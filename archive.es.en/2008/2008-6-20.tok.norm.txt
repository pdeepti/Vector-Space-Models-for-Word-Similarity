but as high-end development spreads , some are saying : enough .
they fear berlin 's character could be irrevocably changed . mario feist remembers that there used to be bakeries and small grocery shops in the oderberger strasse when he first moved there in 1989 .
today , it is much easier to get a latte macchiato or a 150-euro shirt outside his front door than a loaf of bread or carton of milk .
he has watched as his street has been transformed from a dreary road marked by crumbling facades to a hip thoroughfare of renovated buildings , expensive boutiques and trendy cafés , whose sidewalks often resemble a fashion catwalk on sunny weekends .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marthashof sales office offers homes for the high-end client it 's a metamorphosis that he 's not completely comfortable with , especially since it could take on a whole new dimension once the 12,000-square-meter development of luxury apartments being constructed just outside his back window is completed .
called marthashof , it will house around 500 people , and since the square meter price for the townhouses starts at 3,000 euros , the large influx into the neighborhood will be quite well off .
" it could become a very sterile place just for rich people and not the kind of place i 'd want to live , " he said .
" i want to have different kinds of people here . "
expanding wave his concerns are not his alone .
as berlin 's gentrification process spreads to encompass more and more neighborhoods , people are beginning to push back at what they see as a danger to a vibrant , diverse city of neighborhoods featuring people of different social and economic backgrounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an unrenovated and renovated building side by side on oderberger strasse in some neighborhoods , like feist 's prenzlauer berg , gentrification has been happening for years .
but as berlin continues to pull in more investment and its international reputation attracts more wealthy people , the neighborhood has seen a construction boom in luxury apartments and townhouses , which , in comparison to london , new york or paris , can still be had on the cheap .
the fears are that as more wealthy people move in to an area , their up-market tastes will be reflected in businesses that set up shop and rents will go up , pricing out lower and middle-income people .
feist said he 's already seen it happen in his street , when a greek restaurateur was forced to move out after his rent was tripled when the building housing his eatery changed hands .
" gentrification is not a good or bad thing in itself , " said antje seidel-schuelze , a researcher at the german institute of urban affairs .
" in one way , the districts where it happens become better .
but long-established people in a neighborhood are often replaced by wealthier people .
that leads to a certain homogeneity . "
same old same it 's that threat of sameness that riles patrik technau , a 23-year-old student and prenzlauer berg native who recently organized a protest rally near marthashof and another high-end development that attracted 500 people .
his event capped a week of demonstrations across berlin by mostly left-wing groups who say they are against the rapid development and reconstruction of the city .
during the protests , at least 30 cars were set ablaze . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more up-market housing going up " new people are moving here from abroad or other parts of germany and driving out people who 've lived here 40 or 50 years , " he said .
" that 's not fair and it makes me very angry . "
and while once the gentrification seemed limited to central neighborhoods such as prenzlauer berg and mitte , it 's spreading , said andrej holm , a professor at berlin 's humbolt university who studies gentrification .
that is what is causing the anger to rise .
as people were priced out of one neighborhood , they would move .
but often the gentrification wave would follow , forcing them to move again .
now , neighborhoods that were usually seen as immune to the process , and have been long-time enclaves of ethnic communities or artists and bohemians , are attracting professionals who are tired of the boutiques and bars , and are looking for something more " authentic . "
problem is , say researchers , that the lattes , renovations and higher rents are n't usually very far behind .
keeping the mix according to holm , city governments have several instruments that can keep neighborhoods on their way up from losing their diversity , such as rent control mechanisms or the construction of new social housing , even in gentrified neighborhoods .
but he said berlin has generally abandoned these tools , particularly when it comes to low-rent housing .
" in the few lots where there is still space for construction , only things like luxury townhouses and gated communities are going up , " he said .
" the city seems to think if we increase the number of high-end apartments , it can attract the kind of people that will also improve berlin 's economic situation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gentrification wave is expected to eventually hit even areas like berlin 's neukölln district but while the upper-income influx might lift a few economic boats in berlin , it could strand people like claudia hering , who along with mario feist is part of a citizens ' initiative called aim which wants changes to the marthashof development .
" we are afraid that in two or three years we wo n't be able to live here anymore , " she said .
but would she even want to ?
according to researcher seidel-schuelze , gentrification often makes people want to leave their own neighborhoods , no matter what their history there .
not only can they perhaps no longer afford it , the new look and feel can make the place not seem like home anymore .
" i know some people who used to live -lrb- in prenzlauer berg -rrb- in the gdr and they say it 's not my district anymore and i do n't want to be with these new dinks - double income , no kids people , " she said .

trade union critics say that the social market economy is not working so well anymore for germany .
older generations nostalgic for the d-mark that marked the post-war economic boom , blame the euro for inflation . sixty years ago this friday , june 20 , the allied powers introduced a new currency , the d-mark , which became the basis of social market economy that led to the federal republic of germany 's wirtschaftswunder or economic miracle in the 1950s .
but the combination of free market dynamics with a wide social net that had served germany so well in the post-war period , is “ facing a deep legitimacy crisis ” , said michael sommer , head of the confederation of german unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- , an umbrella trade union organization in an interview with the newspaper berliner zeitung .
since the middle of the 1990s , real wages have hardly gone up , with every fifth worker barely earning enough at a subsistence level , added sommer .
“ social mobility still remains an illusion for the majority of single parents , long term unemployed and immigrant groups , ” he said lashing out at big multi-national companies that put short term gains and profits ahead of a long term strategy that preserves jobs and benefits .
euro blamed for inflation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumers feel their euro is not stretching far enough with massive job cuts underway at big dax companies such as deutsche telekom and siemens , as well as general cost of living increases , many germans are feeling the pinch and blame the euro , the common eu currency introduced nearly a decade ago for inflation .
more than a third of germans would even like to have their d-mark back , according to a representative survey by the association of german banks -lrb- bdb -rrb- published friday .
when asked whether they would like to have the old national currency back to replace the euro , fully one-third of 34 respondents answered “ yes . ”
in january 1999 , the switch to the euro for 11 eu member states took place electronically , although the notes and coins were introduced three years later .
inflation has nothing to do with the euro bildunterschrift : in the post-war decades , the d-mark provided a sense of economic well-being .
the main reason for wanting the deutsche mark back was the perception that the euro was responsible for rising prices , an argument that bdb rejected saying that current inflation had everything to do with higher energy and food prices and nothing to do with the euro .
the bdb also pointed out that inflation in the euro zone over the past 10 years had even remained fairly moderate .
" since the start of currency union , inflation has , at 2 percent a year on average , been relatively limited , " said bdb chairman manfred weber .
" in this connection , the euro is one of the most stable currencies overall . ”
weber said the currency now provided a firm basis for growth in the euro zone , which has now grown to 15 members , since the eastward expansion of the eu in 2004 .
britain , which still maintains the pound sterling , is the only major eu country that has not joined the euro zone .
eu leaders have just decided at their current summit in brussels that slovakia will become the 16th member country to introduce the euro in 2009 .
older germans still think in terms of d-marks despite the bdb 's confidence in the euro , nearly half of all germans , especially elder generations who feel nostalgic for the d-mark , still calculate in the old currency , according to frankfurt psychologist and university professor henning haase .
converting to d-marks is also relatively easy since one euro was roughly two deutsche marks .
" particularly in times of higher inflation , many people long for the return of the d-mark , " haase said , but added that that while an inflation rate of 3.1 percent is now perceived as high , inflation had " the deutsche mark is still firmly anchored in many minds as a stable currency , " he said . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the caribbean country 's northern neighbor is bound to be angered by the move . the move is expected to place brussels and washington on a collision course and drew criticism from cuban dissidents .
the vote on thursday , june 19 , scrapped the sanctions that were imposed in 2003 , suspended in 2005 and are largely symbolic .
they include limits on high-level government visits and the role of eu diplomats in cuba 's cultural events and do not approach the hard line of the 46-year-old us sanctions , which include a trade and investment embargo .
" cosmetic changes " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has prohibited all exports to cuba since 1960 earlier thursday , a us state department spokesman said washington opposed any moves to ease sanctions on cuba , saying that reforms so far under new cuban president raul castro are " some very minor , cosmetic changes " that have fallen well short of ending decades of repressive policies under his brother , fidel castro .
the end of sanctions would give legitimacy to a dictatorial regime , deputy spokesman tom casey said , and countries should not signal that the " continued oppression of the cuban people is any more acceptable now than in the past . "
dissidents in cuba also objected to the lifting of the sanctions , charging the european union with being " hypocritical . "
" it gives me pain , and i 'm ashamed of governments that , far from promoting the democratic values under which they live , are made accomplices to one of the last dictatorships in the world , " vladimiro roca , one of cuba 's best known dissidents and leader of the illegal social democratic party , told dpa news agency .
encouraging reform although eu diplomats said the lifting of the sanctions was aimed at encouraging democratic reforms on cuba , the economist oscar espinosa , one of 75 dissidents whose 2003 arrests led to the eu sanctions , warned the move could harden the attitude of cuba 's communist government .
" it is worrisome because the lifting of the sanctions without something in return from cuba could have a very negative effect on cuba 's internal affairs , " espinosa said .
" it could send a signal to the hardline sectors of the government that it pays to be intransigent and inflexible . "
hypocritical as the european union ceased high-level contacts with cuba 's government in 2003 , it also increased its contacts with cuba 's dissidents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cuba is now expected to become more tolerant of dissidents but the sanctions were suspended in 2005 , and spain pushed to have them officially lifted after fidel castro withdrew as cuba 's leader and raul castro , who took over as president in february , implemented reforms , including giving unused state land to farmers and allowing ordinary cubans to use mobile phones , stay in tourist hotels and buy energy-consuming goods like dvd players and personal computers .
while the eu saw signs of liberalization in those moves , cuba 's dissidents said they have seen no change in the government 's treatment of the opposition .
for instance , of the 75 dissidents jailed in 2003 , 55 remain in custody .
the lifting of the sanctions " confirms once more that , with some notable exceptions , the eu is following a hypocritical policy exclusively concerned with its economic interests and not about cuba entering the circle of the democratic nations of the world , " said roca , who is a recipient of the eu 's sakharov prize for freedom of thought .
the czech republic and sweden have been reluctant to lift the sanctions and have demanded that cuba make progress in freeing political prisoners and implement other human rights concessions .
as a result , the eu 's decision is subject to a review in a year , diplomats said . dpa news agency -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw 's jochen kuerten caught up with him to find out what he thinks of today 's film industry . deutsche welle : your latest movie " ulzhan " was recently screened at the festival of german film in ludwigshafen , which tends to focus on work by newcomers .
were you pleased to be invited as an elder statesmen of german cinema ?
volker schloendorff : you bet !
when i was there i noticed that there 's a renewed interest in the concept of the auteur movie .
that was what we were all about , and this is a festival that specifically sets out to put german cinema on this path .
i think that 's wonderful .
all the good directors working at the moment , including tom tykwer and christian petzol , are auteur filmmakers .
you began making films in the 1960s and today you 're one of the most experienced directors in the country . how has life changed for directors ?
what 's it like starting out as a director these days ?
when i was making my first movie " young torless " in 1966 , television had n't even arrived .
the market for movies was vast , and audiences were hungry .
so when we showed up with our " new german cinema , " it was pounced upon . back then , millions of people would watch a movie that would be seen by barely 10,000 today .
so we got off to an excellent start .
but then came a long dry patch , and basically we were rescued by television .
these days there 's been an explosion in film making which makes life very , very hard .
up to 10 times as many movies are produced , especially in germany , and it 's all made easier by digital technology and the many film funds out there .
but it 's not easy to find audiences .
the theaters screen so much - twelve movies are launched every week .
it 's very competitive .
but there are far fewer cinemas these days .
this is an issue close to your heart , is n't it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : small cinemas are struggling to survive yes , i 'm like a missionary , constantly on the road .
recently i was at a conference for local cinemas because i do believe strongly that cinema should have a place in the community - especially in the small and medium-sized towns which are increasingly over-run with bars and supermarkets .
a cinema is a place where people can meet , communicate and share an experience .
there 's more to life than the sofa and the pub .
let 's look back at your career .
you once said in an interview that winning an oscar for „ the tin drum “ opened many doors for you , and that you would never have survived so long in the film industry without it .
did you mean that success is necessary to keep working ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the tin drum " won the 1979 academy award for best foreign language film yes , you need either a name or financial success .
acclaim alone gets you nowhere .
you need to have a few movies which have made the theaters , distributors and producers a lot of money so that they remain convinced that with you , they 're onto a winner .
i think that 's the way it works .
and if you have an oeuvre and your work has either won oscars or attracted large audiences such as " death of a salesman “ and " homo faber , “ then it 's easier to get through a dry patch and still get offers and have your calls returned .
what advice would you give young filmmakers today ?
is it worth heading to the us to make movies ?
it 's very worthwhile , because it 's such an intense experience .
some things need to be learnt first-hand .
you have to have been there , to have made two or three films and felt the cold winds of the free market in country which has no subsidies at all .
then you realize how mollycoddled we are here .
that can motivate you to make films that are provocative , striking and different .
making a good movie is n't enough .
it might get you through in germany but if you want to make the leap into the wide world , then you need the us experience . interview : jochen kuerten -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw 's jochen kuerten caught up with him to find out what he thinks of today 's film industry . deutsche welle : your latest movie " ulzhan " was recently screened at the festival of german film in ludwigshafen , which tends to focus on work by newcomers .
were you pleased to be invited as an elder statesmen of german cinema ?
volker schloendorff : you bet !
when i was there i noticed that there 's a renewed interest in the concept of the auteur movie .
that was what we were all about , and this is a festival that specifically sets out to put german cinema on this path .
i think that 's wonderful .
all the good directors working at the moment , including tom tykwer and christian petzol , are auteur filmmakers .
you began making films in the 1960s and today you 're one of the most experienced directors in the country . how has life changed for directors ?
what 's it like starting out as a director these days ?
when i was making my first movie " young torless " in 1966 , television had n't even arrived .
the market for movies was vast , and audiences were hungry .
so when we showed up with our " new german cinema , " it was pounced upon . back then , millions of people would watch a movie that would be seen by barely 10,000 today .
so we got off to an excellent start .
but then came a long dry patch , and basically we were rescued by television .
these days there 's been an explosion in film making which makes life very , very hard .
up to 10 times as many movies are produced , especially in germany , and it 's all made easier by digital technology and the many film funds out there .
but it 's not easy to find audiences .
the theaters screen so much - twelve movies are launched every week .
it 's very competitive .
but there are far fewer cinemas these days .
this is an issue close to your heart , is n't it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : small cinemas are struggling to survive yes , i 'm like a missionary , constantly on the road .
recently i was at a conference for local cinemas because i do believe strongly that cinema should have a place in the community - especially in the small and medium-sized towns which are increasingly over-run with bars and supermarkets .
a cinema is a place where people can meet , communicate and share an experience .
there 's more to life than the sofa and the pub .
let 's look back at your career .
you once said in an interview that winning an oscar for „ the tin drum “ opened many doors for you , and that you would never have survived so long in the film industry without it .
did you mean that success is necessary to keep working ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the tin drum " won the 1979 academy award for best foreign language film yes , you need either a name or financial success .
acclaim alone gets you nowhere .
you need to have a few movies which have made the theaters , distributors and producers a lot of money so that they remain convinced that with you , they 're onto a winner .
i think that 's the way it works .
and if you have an oeuvre and your work has either won oscars or attracted large audiences such as " death of a salesman “ and " homo faber , “ then it 's easier to get through a dry patch and still get offers and have your calls returned .
what advice would you give young filmmakers today ?
is it worth heading to the us to make movies ?
it 's very worthwhile , because it 's such an intense experience .
some things need to be learnt first-hand .
you have to have been there , to have made two or three films and felt the cold winds of the free market in country which has no subsidies at all .
then you realize how mollycoddled we are here .
that can motivate you to make films that are provocative , striking and different .
making a good movie is n't enough .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 20.06.2008 study : racism in germany increasingly mainstream großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : racism is not confined to society 's margins , the study says according to a study commissioned by the friedrich ebert foundation , social prejudice is rife across the full spectrum of german society - ranging from a dislike of foreigners to a resentment of the unemployed . the report presented in berlin this week was the second part of a study begun in 2006 , which questioned 5,000 germans over 14 about their views of right-wing extremism and concluded that one in four germans holds xenophobic opinions .
drawing on interviews with 60 of the initial participants , the survey aimed to establish the roots of prejudice by examining attitudes among people of various ages , social background and profession .
" we were interested in finding out what determines an individual 's political opinions , be they far-right or democratic , " said project coordinator dietmar molthagen .
" for this reason , we set out to examine the interviewees ' opinions in the context of their lives , " said researcher oliver decker .
mainstream prejudice he and elmar braehler from leipzig university 's institute for clinical psychology and sociology said their work revealed that racism in germany is increasingly mainstream : in both eastern and western germany and across the generations , the public has little compunction about expressing far-right beliefs .
their conclusion is that the problem lies at the very center of society , undermining the theory that the breeding grounds for right-wing extremism are the parts of the country struck by unemployment and social decay .
37 percent of the population maintain that immigrants come to germany " to exploit the welfare state , " 39 percent think germany " is dangerously over-run with foreigners , " and 26 percent would like " a single , strong party that represents the german community . "
the main targets of german prejudice are turks and russians , who are seen as parasitical and grasping .
creature comforts bildunterschrift : prosperity and prejudice are closely intertwined however , researchers also identified the emergence of what they call " cultural racism " - prejudices against marginal groups such as the jobless and the socially disadvantaged .
this , the study suggested , reflected a strong pressure to conform to a perceived social norm and a condemnation of those who failed to do so .
with most of the participants saying they felt powerless to help define politics , the study also revealed a widespread disillusionment with democracy and democratic principles .
the findings suggested that most people supported democracy to the extent that it guaranteed personal prosperity , but in its absence , turned immediately to intolerance .
the researchers cited similar attitudes in the 1950s , when the economic miracle proved an obstacle to coming to terms with the past .
" the rapid accumulation of wealth in west germany -lsb- in the post-war years -rsb- left no scope for reflection and shame , " said researcher oliver decker . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but as high-end development spreads , some are saying : enough .
they fear berlin 's character could be irrevocably changed . mario feist remembers that there used to be bakeries and small grocery shops in the oderberger strasse when he first moved there in 1989 .
today , it is much easier to get a latte macchiato or a 150-euro shirt outside his front door than a loaf of bread or carton of milk .
he has watched as his street has been transformed from a dreary road marked by crumbling facades to a hip thoroughfare of renovated buildings , expensive boutiques and trendy cafés , whose sidewalks often resemble a fashion catwalk on sunny weekends .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marthashof sales office offers homes for the high-end client it 's a metamorphosis that he 's not completely comfortable with , especially since it could take on a whole new dimension once the 12,000-square-meter development of luxury apartments being constructed just outside his back window is completed .
called marthashof , it will house around 500 people , and since the square meter price for the townhouses starts at 3,000 euros , the large influx into the neighborhood will be quite well off .
" it could become a very sterile place just for rich people and not the kind of place i 'd want to live , " he said .
" i want to have different kinds of people here . "
expanding wave his concerns are not his alone .
as berlin 's gentrification process spreads to encompass more and more neighborhoods , people are beginning to push back at what they see as a danger to a vibrant , diverse city of neighborhoods featuring people of different social and economic backgrounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an unrenovated and renovated building side by side on oderberger strasse in some neighborhoods , like feist 's prenzlauer berg , gentrification has been happening for years .
but as berlin continues to pull in more investment and its international reputation attracts more wealthy people , the neighborhood has seen a construction boom in luxury apartments and townhouses , which , in comparison to london , new york or paris , can still be had on the cheap .
the fears are that as more wealthy people move in to an area , their up-market tastes will be reflected in businesses that set up shop and rents will go up , pricing out lower and middle-income people .
feist said he 's already seen it happen in his street , when a greek restaurateur was forced to move out after his rent was tripled when the building housing his eatery changed hands .
" gentrification is not a good or bad thing in itself , " said antje seidel-schuelze , a researcher at the german institute of urban affairs .
" in one way , the districts where it happens become better .
but long-established people in a neighborhood are often replaced by wealthier people .
that leads to a certain homogeneity . "
same old same it 's that threat of sameness that riles patrik technau , a 23-year-old student and prenzlauer berg native who recently organized a protest rally near marthashof and another high-end development that attracted 500 people .
his event capped a week of demonstrations across berlin by mostly left-wing groups who say they are against the rapid development and reconstruction of the city .
during the protests , at least 30 cars were set ablaze . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more up-market housing going up " new people are moving here from abroad or other parts of germany and driving out people who 've lived here 40 or 50 years , " he said .
" that 's not fair and it makes me very angry . "
and while once the gentrification seemed limited to central neighborhoods such as prenzlauer berg and mitte , it 's spreading , said andrej holm , a professor at berlin 's humbolt university who studies gentrification .
that is what is causing the anger to rise .
as people were priced out of one neighborhood , they would move .
but often the gentrification wave would follow , forcing them to move again .
now , neighborhoods that were usually seen as immune to the process , and have been long-time enclaves of ethnic communities or artists and bohemians , are attracting professionals who are tired of the boutiques and bars , and are looking for something more " authentic . "
problem is , say researchers , that the lattes , renovations and higher rents are n't usually very far behind .
keeping the mix according to holm , city governments have several instruments that can keep neighborhoods on their way up from losing their diversity , such as rent control mechanisms or the construction of new social housing , even in gentrified neighborhoods .
but he said berlin has generally abandoned these tools , particularly when it comes to low-rent housing .
" in the few lots where there is still space for construction , only things like luxury townhouses and gated communities are going up , " he said .
" the city seems to think if we increase the number of high-end apartments , it can attract the kind of people that will also improve berlin 's economic situation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gentrification wave is expected to eventually hit even areas like berlin 's neukölln district but while the upper-income influx might lift a few economic boats in berlin , it could strand people like claudia hering , who along with mario feist is part of a citizens ' initiative called aim which wants changes to the marthashof development .
" we are afraid that in two or three years we wo n't be able to live here anymore , " she said .
but would she even want to ?
according to researcher seidel-schuelze , gentrification often makes people want to leave their own neighborhoods , no matter what their history there .
not only can they perhaps no longer afford it , the new look and feel can make the place not seem like home anymore .
" i know some people who used to live -lrb- in prenzlauer berg -rrb- in the gdr and they say it 's not my district anymore and i do n't want to be with these new dinks - double income , no kids people , " she said .
" they 're just not part of that world . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

drawing on interviews with 60 of the initial participants , the survey aimed to establish the roots of prejudice by examining attitudes among people of various ages , social background and profession .
" we were interested in finding out what determines an individual 's political opinions , be they far-right or democratic , " said project coordinator dietmar molthagen .
" for this reason , we set out to examine the interviewees ' opinions in the context of their lives , " said researcher oliver decker .
mainstream prejudice he and elmar braehler from leipzig university 's institute for clinical psychology and sociology said their work revealed that racism in germany is increasingly mainstream : in both eastern and western germany and across the generations , the public has little compunction about expressing far-right beliefs .
their conclusion is that the problem lies at the very center of society , undermining the theory that the breeding grounds for right-wing extremism are the parts of the country struck by unemployment and social decay .
37 percent of the population maintain that immigrants come to germany " to exploit the welfare state , " 39 percent think germany " is dangerously over-run with foreigners , " and 26 percent would like " a single , strong party that represents the german community . "
the main targets of german prejudice are turks and russians , who are seen as parasitical and grasping .
creature comforts bildunterschrift : prosperity and prejudice are closely intertwined however , researchers also identified the emergence of what they call " cultural racism " - prejudices against marginal groups such as the jobless and the socially disadvantaged .
this , the study suggested , reflected a strong pressure to conform to a perceived social norm and a condemnation of those who failed to do so .
with most of the participants saying they felt powerless to help define politics , the study also revealed a widespread disillusionment with democracy and democratic principles .
the findings suggested that most people supported democracy to the extent that it guaranteed personal prosperity , but in its absence , turned immediately to intolerance .
the researchers cited similar attitudes in the 1950s , when the economic miracle proved an obstacle to coming to terms with the past .
" the rapid accumulation of wealth in west germany -lsb- in the post-war years -rsb- left no scope for reflection and shame , " said researcher oliver decker . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

intersport , the sporting goods group operating the official store in the vienna fan zone , sold 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 388,000 -rrb- worth of euro-related products last monday , spokesperson christian mann said .
business was higher than usual that day , because host austria was playing germany .
unexpected demand overall sales figures are hard to come by , as vendors ' agreements with uefa prevents them from releasing such information .
" demand is far higher than expected , " mann said .
intersport eybl , the part of the intersport that is uefa 's exclusive vending partner of sporting goods for the euro 2008 , expects revenues of " mid-level single-digit million euros , " another spokesperson said .
memorabilia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : image boosters inside the official vienna fan shop the other day , the atmosphere was busier than in the fan zone surrounding the store .
customers seemed to be interested mostly in buying t-shirts commemorating past games , as they were marked down to 5 euros .
but fans were also buying pricier items , like team jerseys or the official ball , store manager alexandra sallmann said .
" one would n't believe the things people are buying , " she said , pointing to little replicas of the henri delaunay trophy .
jerseys of teams that failed to move to the quarter-finals are already selling at half price , except for the austrian team colours .
the host 's t-shirts were still being bought , sallmann said .
image booster according to mann , the euro would be a financial " zero sum game " for austria 's largest sporting goods retailer .
the reason why costs would equal revenues was that intersport 's regular stores already started devoting part of their retail space for euro 2008 products last year , he said .
setting up the temporary store in the fan zone had cost as much as opening up a regular new store , he added .
" this is really about the image value , " mann said .
being seen as the exclusive sporting goods partner of the euro would help to build the brand and to expand it in the european market , where intersport shops have a share of 20 per cent .
special offers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stores are satisfied with sales at the billa supermarket chain , another official uefa sales partner , euro 2008 products have been marked down by 50 per cent since the kick-off of the championships .
in the small euro 2008 display area in a billa store in central vienna , soft toys of mascots trix and flix cost only 4,99 euros , compared with 20 euros in the fan zone store .
the discount was not due to slow demand , nor would the supply with merchandise be stopped , corporate spokesperson corinna tinkler said .
her company was " satisfied " with sales figures so far , she said .
the discounted merchandise was intended as an " additional bonus " for customers .
when asked whether her company would make a profit from selling products such as euro t-shirts and stationery , she said that it was " hard to say , " as the final accounting would be done after the championship finals .
but she also stressed that billa had chosen to become an official uefa partner because of the positive effect it had on the brand .
another factor eating away at profits are the retailers ' advance costs for obtaining the right to become official uefa partners , several sources within the industry told deutsche presse-agentur dpa .

drawing on interviews with 60 of the initial participants , the survey aimed to establish the roots of prejudice by examining attitudes among people of various ages , social background and profession .
" we were interested in finding out what determines an individual 's political opinions , be they far-right or democratic , " said project coordinator dietmar molthagen .
" for this reason , we set out to examine the interviewees ' opinions in the context of their lives , " said researcher oliver decker .
mainstream prejudice he and elmar braehler from leipzig university 's institute for clinical psychology and sociology said their work revealed that racism in germany is increasingly mainstream : in both eastern and western germany and across the generations , the public has little compunction about expressing far-right beliefs .
their conclusion is that the problem lies at the very center of society , undermining the theory that the breeding grounds for right-wing extremism are the parts of the country struck by unemployment and social decay .
37 percent of the population maintain that immigrants come to germany " to exploit the welfare state , " 39 percent think germany " is dangerously over-run with foreigners , " and 26 percent would like " a single , strong party that represents the german community . "
the main targets of german prejudice are turks and russians , who are seen as parasitical and grasping .
creature comforts bildunterschrift : prosperity and prejudice are closely intertwined however , researchers also identified the emergence of what they call " cultural racism " - prejudices against marginal groups such as the jobless and the socially disadvantaged .
this , the study suggested , reflected a strong pressure to conform to a perceived social norm and a condemnation of those who failed to do so .
with most of the participants saying they felt powerless to help define politics , the study also revealed a widespread disillusionment with democracy and democratic principles .
the findings suggested that most people supported democracy to the extent that it guaranteed personal prosperity , but in its absence , turned immediately to intolerance .
the researchers cited similar attitudes in the 1950s , when the economic miracle proved an obstacle to coming to terms with the past .
" the rapid accumulation of wealth in west germany -lsb- in the post-war years -rsb- left no scope for reflection and shame , " said researcher oliver decker . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but as high-end development spreads , some are saying : enough .
they fear berlin 's character could be irrevocably changed . mario feist remembers that there used to be bakeries and small grocery shops in the oderberger strasse when he first moved there in 1989 .
today , it is much easier to get a latte macchiato or a 150-euro shirt outside his front door than a loaf of bread or carton of milk .
he has watched as his street has been transformed from a dreary road marked by crumbling facades to a hip thoroughfare of renovated buildings , expensive boutiques and trendy cafés , whose sidewalks often resemble a fashion catwalk on sunny weekends .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marthashof sales office offers homes for the high-end client it 's a metamorphosis that he 's not completely comfortable with , especially since it could take on a whole new dimension once the 12,000-square-meter development of luxury apartments being constructed just outside his back window is completed .
called marthashof , it will house around 500 people , and since the square meter price for the townhouses starts at 3,000 euros , the large influx into the neighborhood will be quite well off .
" it could become a very sterile place just for rich people and not the kind of place i 'd want to live , " he said .
" i want to have different kinds of people here . "
expanding wave his concerns are not his alone .
as berlin 's gentrification process spreads to encompass more and more neighborhoods , people are beginning to push back at what they see as a danger to a vibrant , diverse city of neighborhoods featuring people of different social and economic backgrounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an unrenovated and renovated building side by side on oderberger strasse in some neighborhoods , like feist 's prenzlauer berg , gentrification has been happening for years .
but as berlin continues to pull in more investment and its international reputation attracts more wealthy people , the neighborhood has seen a construction boom in luxury apartments and townhouses , which , in comparison to london , new york or paris , can still be had on the cheap .
the fears are that as more wealthy people move in to an area , their up-market tastes will be reflected in businesses that set up shop and rents will go up , pricing out lower and middle-income people .
feist said he 's already seen it happen in his street , when a greek restaurateur was forced to move out after his rent was tripled when the building housing his eatery changed hands .
" gentrification is not a good or bad thing in itself , " said antje seidel-schuelze , a researcher at the german institute of urban affairs .
" in one way , the districts where it happens become better .
but long-established people in a neighborhood are often replaced by wealthier people .
that leads to a certain homogeneity . "
same old same it 's that threat of sameness that riles patrik technau , a 23-year-old student and prenzlauer berg native who recently organized a protest rally near marthashof and another high-end development that attracted 500 people .
his event capped a week of demonstrations across berlin by mostly left-wing groups who say they are against the rapid development and reconstruction of the city .
during the protests , at least 30 cars were set ablaze . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more up-market housing going up " new people are moving here from abroad or other parts of germany and driving out people who 've lived here 40 or 50 years , " he said .
" that 's not fair and it makes me very angry . "
and while once the gentrification seemed limited to central neighborhoods such as prenzlauer berg and mitte , it 's spreading , said andrej holm , a professor at berlin 's humbolt university who studies gentrification .
that is what is causing the anger to rise .
as people were priced out of one neighborhood , they would move .
but often the gentrification wave would follow , forcing them to move again .
now , neighborhoods that were usually seen as immune to the process , and have been long-time enclaves of ethnic communities or artists and bohemians , are attracting professionals who are tired of the boutiques and bars , and are looking for something more " authentic . "
problem is , say researchers , that the lattes , renovations and higher rents are n't usually very far behind .
keeping the mix according to holm , city governments have several instruments that can keep neighborhoods on their way up from losing their diversity , such as rent control mechanisms or the construction of new social housing , even in gentrified neighborhoods .
but he said berlin has generally abandoned these tools , particularly when it comes to low-rent housing .
" in the few lots where there is still space for construction , only things like luxury townhouses and gated communities are going up , " he said .
" the city seems to think if we increase the number of high-end apartments , it can attract the kind of people that will also improve berlin 's economic situation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gentrification wave is expected to eventually hit even areas like berlin 's neukölln district but while the upper-income influx might lift a few economic boats in berlin , it could strand people like claudia hering , who along with mario feist is part of a citizens ' initiative called aim which wants changes to the marthashof development .
" we are afraid that in two or three years we wo n't be able to live here anymore , " she said .
but would she even want to ?
according to researcher seidel-schuelze , gentrification often makes people want to leave their own neighborhoods , no matter what their history there .
not only can they perhaps no longer afford it , the new look and feel can make the place not seem like home anymore .
" i know some people who used to live -lrb- in prenzlauer berg -rrb- in the gdr and they say it 's not my district anymore and i do n't want to be with these new dinks - double income , no kids people , " she said .

" i do n't think we will have any solutions on the table in october , " said martin .
european commission president jose manuel barroso , german chancellor angela merkel and european parliament president hans-gert poettering had been among those calling for a rapid solution to the crisis at the start of a two-day eu summit in brussels .
" we both agreed that the next meeting of the european council -lrb- of national leaders -rrb- in october will be an appropriate occasion for further discussion on this matter , " barroso said after holding crisis talks with irish premier brian cowen ahead of the meeting .
but he also warned that adapting the treaty would be " extremely difficult . "
the lisbon treaty , which replaces the doomed nice treaty and was only approved by eu leaders last december after years of wrangling , is designed to improve the decision-making process of an institution that now has 27 member states .
it also gives the european parliament a greater say .
will europe be paralyzed again ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament president wanted a rapid solution urging cowen to come up with solutions and calling on all sides to show " understanding and flexibility " , poettering warned that , with the possible exception of croatia , the eu would not be able to accommodate more countries until the new treaty came into effect .
france , which takes over the rotating presidency of the eu from slovenia on july 1 , is also among those nations particularly keen to see a rapid resolution to the problem .
its president , nicolas sarkozy , was reported as saying ahead of his arrival in brussels that he would ask ireland to hold a second referendum on the treaty .
" we will not touch the lisbon treaty , because if we do we will have to start from zero , " one advisor to the french government said .
as well enjoying backing from the german government , france has the support of denmark , with prime minister anders fogh rasmussen calling on the treaty to come into force by april 2009 , so as to allow the next european parliament to be elected in june according to the new rules .

" do n't put any pressure on anybody , " czech deputy prime minister for european affairs alexandr vondra said .
" we do n't need a long reflection period , but we wo n't fix the problem during this meeting , " acknowledged slovenian prime minister janez jansa at the start of the bloc 's regular summer meeting .
overshadowing other key matters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : back in december , eu leaders thought they 'd made a breakthrough the institutional crisis overshadowed efforts by eu leaders to address pressing matters , such as surging oil and food prices .

eu leaders pour over a statement on zimbabwe at a brussels summit european union leaders have threatened zimbabwean president robert mugabe with more sanctions amid reports of escalating violence against the opposition before next week 's presidential election . eu leaders meeting at the end of a two-day summit in brussels adopted a statement warning zimbabwe of further sanctions one week before the country holds a runoff presidential election marred by widespread violations . " the european council reiterates its readiness to take additional measures against those responsible for violence , " the statement said . britain leads calls for tough measures the document did not specify what the additional measures would be , but british prime minister gordon brown said it could include more targeted sanctions against members of president robert mugabe 's regime . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mugabe has blamed eu sanctions for zimbabwe 's economic woes britain has been heading calls for the eu to get tough on mugabe who is accused of violating human rights and of ordering the harassment of opposition supporters . " mugabe 's increasingly desperate and isolated regime has unleashed still more violence , " brown told a news conference .
" this is a brazen and obscene abuse of power by a criminal cabal . " eu leaders also " regretted " zimbabwe 's rejection of its offer to provide election monitors and called on the southern africa development community and the african union to " deploy a significant number of election monitors as soon as possible and to ensure their continued presence until the electoral process is completed and results officially declared . " " the european council remains deeply concerned by the situation in zimbabwe and reiterates the need for the upcoming second round of presidential elections on june 27 to be held in a peaceful , free and fair environment in accordance with international norms and standards , " eu leaders said . opposition supporters killed the threat came as zimbabwe 's main opposition movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- candidate morgan tsvangirai was said to be considering pulling out of the june 27 runoff because of escalating violence against his supporters by followers of president mugabe . the mdc says at least 70 of its supporters have been killed in recent weeks and 25,000 forced from their homes in a state-sponsored campaign of violence .
one of its top leaders , tendai biti , has also been charged with treason and subversion .
the charges carry a possible death sentence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : morgan tsvangirai is mulling pulling out of the poll mdc rallies have also been disrupted and tsvangirai briefly detained by police on several occasions .
the eu already has an arms embargo against zimbabwe and has placed travel bans on and frozen the assets of president mugabe and other senior government and ruling zanu-pf party officials .
mugabe blames the sanctions for plunging zimbabwe into economic instability .
african nations rebuke mugabe in an unusual move , this week tanzania , swaziland and angola which are members of the south african development community and form a committe entrusted with regioanl peace and security sharply rebuked mugabe for the continued violence in zimbabwe and the intimidation of opposition politicians .

" we have told the government of zimbabwe to stop the violence .
people of zimbabwe are hurting and it pains us . "
tanzania holds the rotating chairmanship of the african union , the main african intergovernmental organization .
mugabe however said remained defiant , saying he wo n't retire until he is sure that " the land is truly and safely in the hands of the black majority , " state media reported friday .
the state-run daily herald newspaper quoted mugabe in indirect speech as saying that " he had to ensure the legacy of returning land stolen by the british settlers to its rightful owners - the black people - before entertaining any thoughts of relinquishing power .

intersport , the sporting goods group operating the official store in the vienna fan zone , sold 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 388,000 -rrb- worth of euro-related products last monday , spokesperson christian mann said .
business was higher than usual that day , because host austria was playing germany .
unexpected demand overall sales figures are hard to come by , as vendors ' agreements with uefa prevents them from releasing such information .
" demand is far higher than expected , " mann said .
intersport eybl , the part of the intersport that is uefa 's exclusive vending partner of sporting goods for the euro 2008 , expects revenues of " mid-level single-digit million euros , " another spokesperson said .
memorabilia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : image boosters inside the official vienna fan shop the other day , the atmosphere was busier than in the fan zone surrounding the store .
customers seemed to be interested mostly in buying t-shirts commemorating past games , as they were marked down to 5 euros .
but fans were also buying pricier items , like team jerseys or the official ball , store manager alexandra sallmann said .
" one would n't believe the things people are buying , " she said , pointing to little replicas of the henri delaunay trophy .
jerseys of teams that failed to move to the quarter-finals are already selling at half price , except for the austrian team colours .
the host 's t-shirts were still being bought , sallmann said .
image booster according to mann , the euro would be a financial " zero sum game " for austria 's largest sporting goods retailer .
the reason why costs would equal revenues was that intersport 's regular stores already started devoting part of their retail space for euro 2008 products last year , he said .
setting up the temporary store in the fan zone had cost as much as opening up a regular new store , he added .
" this is really about the image value , " mann said .
being seen as the exclusive sporting goods partner of the euro would help to build the brand and to expand it in the european market , where intersport shops have a share of 20 per cent .
special offers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stores are satisfied with sales at the billa supermarket chain , another official uefa sales partner , euro 2008 products have been marked down by 50 per cent since the kick-off of the championships .
in the small euro 2008 display area in a billa store in central vienna , soft toys of mascots trix and flix cost only 4,99 euros , compared with 20 euros in the fan zone store .
the discount was not due to slow demand , nor would the supply with merchandise be stopped , corporate spokesperson corinna tinkler said .
her company was " satisfied " with sales figures so far , she said .
the discounted merchandise was intended as an " additional bonus " for customers .
when asked whether her company would make a profit from selling products such as euro t-shirts and stationery , she said that it was " hard to say , " as the final accounting would be done after the championship finals .
but she also stressed that billa had chosen to become an official uefa partner because of the positive effect it had on the brand .
another factor eating away at profits are the retailers ' advance costs for obtaining the right to become official uefa partners , several sources within the industry told deutsche presse-agentur dpa .

the caribbean country 's northern neighbor is bound to be angered by the move . the move is expected to place brussels and washington on a collision course and drew criticism from cuban dissidents .
the vote on thursday , june 19 , scrapped the sanctions that were imposed in 2003 , suspended in 2005 and are largely symbolic .
they include limits on high-level government visits and the role of eu diplomats in cuba 's cultural events and do not approach the hard line of the 46-year-old us sanctions , which include a trade and investment embargo .
" cosmetic changes " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has prohibited all exports to cuba since 1960 earlier thursday , a us state department spokesman said washington opposed any moves to ease sanctions on cuba , saying that reforms so far under new cuban president raul castro are " some very minor , cosmetic changes " that have fallen well short of ending decades of repressive policies under his brother , fidel castro .
the end of sanctions would give legitimacy to a dictatorial regime , deputy spokesman tom casey said , and countries should not signal that the " continued oppression of the cuban people is any more acceptable now than in the past . "
dissidents in cuba also objected to the lifting of the sanctions , charging the european union with being " hypocritical . "
" it gives me pain , and i 'm ashamed of governments that , far from promoting the democratic values under which they live , are made accomplices to one of the last dictatorships in the world , " vladimiro roca , one of cuba 's best known dissidents and leader of the illegal social democratic party , told dpa news agency .
encouraging reform although eu diplomats said the lifting of the sanctions was aimed at encouraging democratic reforms on cuba , the economist oscar espinosa , one of 75 dissidents whose 2003 arrests led to the eu sanctions , warned the move could harden the attitude of cuba 's communist government .
" it is worrisome because the lifting of the sanctions without something in return from cuba could have a very negative effect on cuba 's internal affairs , " espinosa said .
" it could send a signal to the hardline sectors of the government that it pays to be intransigent and inflexible . "
hypocritical as the european union ceased high-level contacts with cuba 's government in 2003 , it also increased its contacts with cuba 's dissidents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cuba is now expected to become more tolerant of dissidents but the sanctions were suspended in 2005 , and spain pushed to have them officially lifted after fidel castro withdrew as cuba 's leader and raul castro , who took over as president in february , implemented reforms , including giving unused state land to farmers and allowing ordinary cubans to use mobile phones , stay in tourist hotels and buy energy-consuming goods like dvd players and personal computers .
while the eu saw signs of liberalization in those moves , cuba 's dissidents said they have seen no change in the government 's treatment of the opposition .
for instance , of the 75 dissidents jailed in 2003 , 55 remain in custody .
the lifting of the sanctions " confirms once more that , with some notable exceptions , the eu is following a hypocritical policy exclusively concerned with its economic interests and not about cuba entering the circle of the democratic nations of the world , " said roca , who is a recipient of the eu 's sakharov prize for freedom of thought .
the czech republic and sweden have been reluctant to lift the sanctions and have demanded that cuba make progress in freeing political prisoners and implement other human rights concessions .
as a result , the eu 's decision is subject to a review in a year , diplomats said . dpa news agency -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's part of the 2008 oerol festival , a site-specific experimental theater event .
the work " is a little bit like going back to the roots of my work .
so that is interesting for me , " said wilson .
in the 1970s , he produced " ka mountain and guardenia terrace , " a continuous seven-day silent play staged on a mountaintop in iran .
renowned for producing elaborate and evocative stage sets , exhibitions and installations , wilson 's works are noted for his use of very slow movement and extremes in space or time .
" walking " is a collaboration between wilson and two dutch artists , theun mosk and boukje schweigman , where festival participants walk at a slow pace through the striking landscape of terschelling 's pastures , woodlands , sand dunes and beaches .
participants become the actors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilson is known for experimenting with extremes in time and space the walkers are asked to hand in their watches , phones , cameras , and any devices they may have that tell time , before they are taken to stand alone in a black box .
then they are guided to a large wooden room with a deep circle dug into the ground .
slow music plays in the background .
finally , a field guide leads them out to a field and sets the pace for the remaining four-hour walk on the island .
clearly , " walking " pushes the boundaries of traditional theater .
it serves as a combination of both an interactive landscape installation and a theater production : the walkers are the actors and the landscape provides the backdrop scenery for the work .
experiencing time in a new way wilson said he was drawn immediately to the dramatic landscape on the island and wanted walkers to maintain a deliberately slow pace to heighten their observation during the walk .
" our perception is different if we take more time to do something , " said wilson .
" we begin to hear and see what is there in a different way .
we begin to smell things in a different way .
there is time to reflect . "
in the early 1970s he won international acclaim for " deafman glance , " a silent opera created in collaboration with raymond andrews , who is both deaf and mute .
wilson worked together with composer philip glass on the opera " einstein on the beach . "

it 's part of the 2008 oerol festival , a site-specific experimental theater event .
the work " is a little bit like going back to the roots of my work .
so that is interesting for me , " said wilson .
in the 1970s , he produced " ka mountain and guardenia terrace , " a continuous seven-day silent play staged on a mountaintop in iran .
renowned for producing elaborate and evocative stage sets , exhibitions and installations , wilson 's works are noted for his use of very slow movement and extremes in space or time .
" walking " is a collaboration between wilson and two dutch artists , theun mosk and boukje schweigman , where festival participants walk at a slow pace through the striking landscape of terschelling 's pastures , woodlands , sand dunes and beaches .
participants become the actors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilson is known for experimenting with extremes in time and space the walkers are asked to hand in their watches , phones , cameras , and any devices they may have that tell time , before they are taken to stand alone in a black box .
then they are guided to a large wooden room with a deep circle dug into the ground .
slow music plays in the background .
finally , a field guide leads them out to a field and sets the pace for the remaining four-hour walk on the island .
clearly , " walking " pushes the boundaries of traditional theater .
it serves as a combination of both an interactive landscape installation and a theater production : the walkers are the actors and the landscape provides the backdrop scenery for the work .
experiencing time in a new way wilson said he was drawn immediately to the dramatic landscape on the island and wanted walkers to maintain a deliberately slow pace to heighten their observation during the walk .
" our perception is different if we take more time to do something , " said wilson .
" we begin to hear and see what is there in a different way .
we begin to smell things in a different way .
there is time to reflect . "
in the early 1970s he won international acclaim for " deafman glance , " a silent opera created in collaboration with raymond andrews , who is both deaf and mute .
wilson worked together with composer philip glass on the opera " einstein on the beach . "
he also collaborated with musician tom waits and writer william s. burroughs on the musical fable " the black rider . " cheryl northey send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

prague 's parliamentary ratification was suspended in late april as it was going through the lower chamber , after the senate demanded a constitutional court ruling on whether the treaty conforms with the czech constitution .
in addition to this obstacle , the czech republic 's eurosceptic president vaclav klaus has already insisted the irish vote had killed off the document , meant to help the eu operate more efficiently as it grows .

they have also long made it clear that they oppose turkey 's long-term membership aspirations . merkel said the eu 's existing institutional arrangements limited the size of the bloc to its current 27 members .

prague 's parliamentary ratification was suspended in late april as it was going through the lower chamber , after the senate demanded a constitutional court ruling on whether the treaty conforms with the czech constitution .
in addition to this obstacle , the czech republic 's eurosceptic president vaclav klaus has already insisted the irish vote had killed off the document , meant to help the eu operate more efficiently as it grows .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish premier brian cowen has a lot of explaining to do to make matters worse , a british court challenge for a referendum forced prime minister gordon brown to concede at the summit that the the treaty was invalid without a ruling .
" ratification will not take place of course until we have had the judgement , " he said .
a judge at london 's high court called on the british government to delay ratification until he ruled on a legal bid to force a referendum .
in the end , eu leaders agreed on friday to give ireland at least until october to come up with recommendations on the way ahead . in a final statement , the eu said although 19 member states have ratified the treaty , " more time was needed to analyse the situation . " merkel , sarkozy say no new members eu leaders also failed to find common ground on whether the bloc could still absorb new members after the treaty 's rejection by ireland . the reform charter was intended to make the enlargement process more manageable by streamlining the european union 's institutions .
the treaty is also meant to give the eu more clout on in foreign affairs after the large eastward expansion of the bloc since 2004 , when 12 new members joined . german chancellor angela merkel on friday backed president nicolas sarkozy 's call for the european union to forget about adding new members until it finds a solution to ireland 's rejection of an eu reform treaty . " without the lisbon treaty , there is no enlargement , " sarkozy , whose country assumes the eu 's rotating , six-month presidency on july 1 , said .
" i would find it very strange that europe has trouble agreeing on its institutions but that it would be able to agree to allow in a 28th , 29th or 30th member , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel remains against taking in new members without the treaty both sarkozy and merkel strongly support the lisbon treaty and have urged other eu members to pursue its ratification despite ireland 's " no . "
they have also long made it clear that they oppose turkey 's long-term membership aspirations . merkel said the eu 's existing institutional arrangements limited the size of the bloc to its current 27 members . " i agree because the nice treaty limited the -lrb- european -rrb- union to a membership of 27 states and for me it is unthinkable that we would change one area of the nice treaty without looking at the whole of the lisbon treaty , " she said in brussels . luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , the eu 's longest-serving leader , shared the view . " without a new treaty there 's no enlargement , " he insisted .
" one of the reasons for the lisbon treaty was the capacity to enlarge . " splits on enlargement but not everyone agreed with berlin and paris ' calls for a freeze on enlargement until the treaty riddle was solved .
the move is almost certain to affect turkey and croatia , who are currently negotiating their accession to the eu .
several other countries in the western balkans are also hoping to climb up the candidacy ladder . " the irish vote should in no way be related to the enlargement , " polish prime minister donald tusk said . austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik urged that croatia " should not become the first victim of the irish referendum . " " we have to keep our word , it would be a wrong signal to the balkan states to put a question mark over enlargement , " she said . seven eu nations have yet to ratify the lisbon treaty . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the caribbean country 's northern neighbor is bound to be angered by the move . the move is expected to place brussels and washington on a collision course and drew criticism from cuban dissidents .
the vote on thursday , june 19 , scrapped the sanctions that were imposed in 2003 , suspended in 2005 and are largely symbolic .
they include limits on high-level government visits and the role of eu diplomats in cuba 's cultural events and do not approach the hard line of the 46-year-old us sanctions , which include a trade and investment embargo .
" cosmetic changes " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has prohibited all exports to cuba since 1960 earlier thursday , a us state department spokesman said washington opposed any moves to ease sanctions on cuba , saying that reforms so far under new cuban president raul castro are " some very minor , cosmetic changes " that have fallen well short of ending decades of repressive policies under his brother , fidel castro .
the end of sanctions would give legitimacy to a dictatorial regime , deputy spokesman tom casey said , and countries should not signal that the " continued oppression of the cuban people is any more acceptable now than in the past . "
dissidents in cuba also objected to the lifting of the sanctions , charging the european union with being " hypocritical . "
" it gives me pain , and i 'm ashamed of governments that , far from promoting the democratic values under which they live , are made accomplices to one of the last dictatorships in the world , " vladimiro roca , one of cuba 's best known dissidents and leader of the illegal social democratic party , told dpa news agency .
encouraging reform although eu diplomats said the lifting of the sanctions was aimed at encouraging democratic reforms on cuba , the economist oscar espinosa , one of 75 dissidents whose 2003 arrests led to the eu sanctions , warned the move could harden the attitude of cuba 's communist government .
" it is worrisome because the lifting of the sanctions without something in return from cuba could have a very negative effect on cuba 's internal affairs , " espinosa said .
" it could send a signal to the hardline sectors of the government that it pays to be intransigent and inflexible . "
hypocritical as the european union ceased high-level contacts with cuba 's government in 2003 , it also increased its contacts with cuba 's dissidents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cuba is now expected to become more tolerant of dissidents but the sanctions were suspended in 2005 , and spain pushed to have them officially lifted after fidel castro withdrew as cuba 's leader and raul castro , who took over as president in february , implemented reforms , including giving unused state land to farmers and allowing ordinary cubans to use mobile phones , stay in tourist hotels and buy energy-consuming goods like dvd players and personal computers .
while the eu saw signs of liberalization in those moves , cuba 's dissidents said they have seen no change in the government 's treatment of the opposition .
for instance , of the 75 dissidents jailed in 2003 , 55 remain in custody .
the lifting of the sanctions " confirms once more that , with some notable exceptions , the eu is following a hypocritical policy exclusively concerned with its economic interests and not about cuba entering the circle of the democratic nations of the world , " said roca , who is a recipient of the eu 's sakharov prize for freedom of thought .
the czech republic and sweden have been reluctant to lift the sanctions and have demanded that cuba make progress in freeing political prisoners and implement other human rights concessions .
as a result , the eu 's decision is subject to a review in a year , diplomats said . dpa news agency -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the university in germany 's bavaria state has about 4,500 students and teaches regular arts , science and business courses .
this week , the bishop , with express backing from other bavarian bishops , also suspended the university 's administrative head and appointed two temporary new chiefs , saying a fresh start was needed .

interest in the dispute has been heightened by the fact that pope benedict xvi is a bavarian and was a formerly a professor in the state , at a different university , regensburg .
the vatican has not spoken out about the row .

the conflict reached a head with two senior academics resigning and a bitter joint open letter last week from students and senior professors attacking the " unprecedented " church interference .

the university in germany 's bavaria state has about 4,500 students and teaches regular arts , science and business courses .
this week , the bishop , with express backing from other bavarian bishops , also suspended the university 's administrative head and appointed two temporary new chiefs , saying a fresh start was needed .
refuge of faith bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavaria 's most famous son whereas the church sees its university as a refuge of faith in a nation that is increasingly hostile to religion , professors have painted the struggle as a battle for academic liberty and autonomy , as claimed by universities around the globe .
interest in the dispute has been heightened by the fact that pope benedict xvi is a bavarian and was a formerly a professor in the state , at a different university , regensburg .
the vatican has not spoken out about the row .
unlike at theology colleges , students do not have to be catholic to attend ku .
as at most german state universities , the tuition fees are minimal compared to those in most western nations .
irreconcilable differences to some , the row brings back memories of the vatican 's desire in 1979 to remove the dissident swiss-born theologian hans kueng from his professor-of-theology post at the german university of tuebingen .
however the man at the center of the latest tussle , ulrich hemel , is not a theologian but a business executive whose main academic subject has been the religious formation of children .
hemel was chosen by eichstaett professors to become " president , " a german university 's top academic official , earlier this year , but bishop hanke flatly refused to bless hemel 's appointment and certification needed by hemel from the vatican never arrived .
newspapers speculated that the bishop was disturbed by the fact that hemel had been married three times , but whatever the origin , it is clear that the bishop and hemel have an irreconcilable antipathy .
the bishop 's stated objections to hemel include an accusation that hemel blabbed to the media after they talked .
the catholic newspaper tagespost quoted bishop hanke , who is grand chancellor , or ceremonial chief of the university , saying hemel had never been a full professor and had no recent scholarly publications .
uniquely german bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bischop gregor maria hanke there are catholic universities in the united states , but ku , founded in 1980 , has a uniquely german form of government .
the university , with most of its campus in the bavarian town of eichstaett and a business school in the bigger industrial city of ingolstadt , is mainly funded by the state of bavaria , with the state 's bishops contributing 15 per cent of the budget .
the row has escalated , with suggestions of intrigue and plots rattling the provincial calm at eichstaett .
the conflict reached a head with two senior academics resigning and a bitter joint open letter last week from students and senior professors attacking the " unprecedented " church interference .
professors , who have life tenure and huge power in the german university system , often argue that academic research should be driven by a scholar 's interests rather than the demands of society .
optimistic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many want to see the university become more catholic the bishop has ordered a financial audit of recent spending by the chief executive , gottfried von der heydte , who shared control of the university with its president .
the bishop said he would not make his suspicions public .
tv news crews filmed the grey-suited auditors arriving , sending away von der heydte 's assistants and staying late into the night to search computer and paper files .
professors received letters forbidding them to speak with von der heydte .
bishop hanke said the route out of the conflict was the installation of two outside , neutral academics who would be tasked from july 1 with overseeing a fresh start .
" this is like a marital conflict , " he said .
" it 's best to get a third party to help you . "
the munich newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung said the academic credentials of the two trouble-shooters chosen by the bishop , retired sociologist rudolf fisch and historian gert melville , had impressed some professors , so the duo might be able to bridge the differences .
on wednesday , the professors backed off from further conflict , issuing a joint statement that they were confident the new management would put the university back on the right track .
hanke also met this week for two hours with student leaders , who said both sides were optimistic about the university 's future .
bishop hanke , who took office in november 2006 , has said the trouble-shooters will oversee a hunt next year for a new president .
doctrinal issues have not been raised in the dispute , but the archbishop of munich , reinhard marx , indicated this week that bishops want the university to adopt a more catholic " character " in future . dpa news agency -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

trade union critics say that the social market economy is not working so well anymore for germany .
older generations nostalgic for the d-mark that marked the post-war economic boom , blame the euro for inflation . sixty years ago this friday , june 20 , the allied powers introduced a new currency , the d-mark , which became the basis of social market economy that led to the federal republic of germany 's wirtschaftswunder or economic miracle in the 1950s .
but the combination of free market dynamics with a wide social net that had served germany so well in the post-war period , is “ facing a deep legitimacy crisis ” , said michael sommer , head of the confederation of german unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- , an umbrella trade union organization in an interview with the newspaper berliner zeitung .
since the middle of the 1990s , real wages have hardly gone up , with every fifth worker barely earning enough at a subsistence level , added sommer .
“ social mobility still remains an illusion for the majority of single parents , long term unemployed and immigrant groups , ” he said lashing out at big multi-national companies that put short term gains and profits ahead of a long term strategy that preserves jobs and benefits .
euro blamed for inflation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumers feel their euro is not stretching far enough with massive job cuts underway at big dax companies such as deutsche telekom and siemens , as well as general cost of living increases , many germans are feeling the pinch and blame the euro , the common eu currency introduced nearly a decade ago for inflation .
more than a third of germans would even like to have their d-mark back , according to a representative survey by the association of german banks -lrb- bdb -rrb- published friday .
when asked whether they would like to have the old national currency back to replace the euro , fully one-third of 34 respondents answered “ yes . ”
in january 1999 , the switch to the euro for 11 eu member states took place electronically , although the notes and coins were introduced three years later .
inflation has nothing to do with the euro bildunterschrift : in the post-war decades , the d-mark provided a sense of economic well-being .
the main reason for wanting the deutsche mark back was the perception that the euro was responsible for rising prices , an argument that bdb rejected saying that current inflation had everything to do with higher energy and food prices and nothing to do with the euro .
the bdb also pointed out that inflation in the euro zone over the past 10 years had even remained fairly moderate .
" since the start of currency union , inflation has , at 2 percent a year on average , been relatively limited , " said bdb chairman manfred weber .
" in this connection , the euro is one of the most stable currencies overall . ”
weber said the currency now provided a firm basis for growth in the euro zone , which has now grown to 15 members , since the eastward expansion of the eu in 2004 .
britain , which still maintains the pound sterling , is the only major eu country that has not joined the euro zone .
eu leaders have just decided at their current summit in brussels that slovakia will become the 16th member country to introduce the euro in 2009 .
older germans still think in terms of d-marks despite the bdb 's confidence in the euro , nearly half of all germans , especially elder generations who feel nostalgic for the d-mark , still calculate in the old currency , according to frankfurt psychologist and university professor henning haase .
converting to d-marks is also relatively easy since one euro was roughly two deutsche marks .
" particularly in times of higher inflation , many people long for the return of the d-mark , " haase said , but added that that while an inflation rate of 3.1 percent is now perceived as high , inflation had " the deutsche mark is still firmly anchored in many minds as a stable currency , " he said . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

intersport , the sporting goods group operating the official store in the vienna fan zone , sold 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 388,000 -rrb- worth of euro-related products last monday , spokesperson christian mann said .
business was higher than usual that day , because host austria was playing germany .
unexpected demand overall sales figures are hard to come by , as vendors ' agreements with uefa prevents them from releasing such information .
" demand is far higher than expected , " mann said .
intersport eybl , the part of the intersport that is uefa 's exclusive vending partner of sporting goods for the euro 2008 , expects revenues of " mid-level single-digit million euros , " another spokesperson said .
memorabilia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : image boosters inside the official vienna fan shop the other day , the atmosphere was busier than in the fan zone surrounding the store .
customers seemed to be interested mostly in buying t-shirts commemorating past games , as they were marked down to 5 euros .
but fans were also buying pricier items , like team jerseys or the official ball , store manager alexandra sallmann said .
" one would n't believe the things people are buying , " she said , pointing to little replicas of the henri delaunay trophy .
jerseys of teams that failed to move to the quarter-finals are already selling at half price , except for the austrian team colours .
the host 's t-shirts were still being bought , sallmann said .
image booster according to mann , the euro would be a financial " zero sum game " for austria 's largest sporting goods retailer .
the reason why costs would equal revenues was that intersport 's regular stores already started devoting part of their retail space for euro 2008 products last year , he said .
setting up the temporary store in the fan zone had cost as much as opening up a regular new store , he added .
" this is really about the image value , " mann said .
being seen as the exclusive sporting goods partner of the euro would help to build the brand and to expand it in the european market , where intersport shops have a share of 20 per cent .
special offers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stores are satisfied with sales at the billa supermarket chain , another official uefa sales partner , euro 2008 products have been marked down by 50 per cent since the kick-off of the championships .
in the small euro 2008 display area in a billa store in central vienna , soft toys of mascots trix and flix cost only 4,99 euros , compared with 20 euros in the fan zone store .
the discount was not due to slow demand , nor would the supply with merchandise be stopped , corporate spokesperson corinna tinkler said .
her company was " satisfied " with sales figures so far , she said .
the discounted merchandise was intended as an " additional bonus " for customers .
when asked whether her company would make a profit from selling products such as euro t-shirts and stationery , she said that it was " hard to say , " as the final accounting would be done after the championship finals .
but she also stressed that billa had chosen to become an official uefa partner because of the positive effect it had on the brand .
another factor eating away at profits are the retailers ' advance costs for obtaining the right to become official uefa partners , several sources within the industry told deutsche presse-agentur dpa .

prague 's parliamentary ratification was suspended in late april as it was going through the lower chamber , after the senate demanded a constitutional court ruling on whether the treaty conforms with the czech constitution .
in addition to this obstacle , the czech republic 's eurosceptic president vaclav klaus has already insisted the irish vote had killed off the document , meant to help the eu operate more efficiently as it grows .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish premier brian cowen has a lot of explaining to do to make matters worse , a british court challenge for a referendum forced prime minister gordon brown to concede at the summit that the the treaty was invalid without a ruling .
" ratification will not take place of course until we have had the judgement , " he said .

intersport , the sporting goods group operating the official store in the vienna fan zone , sold 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 388,000 -rrb- worth of euro-related products last monday , spokesperson christian mann said .
business was higher than usual that day , because host austria was playing germany .

customers seemed to be interested mostly in buying t-shirts commemorating past games , as they were marked down to 5 euros .
but fans were also buying pricier items , like team jerseys or the official ball , store manager alexandra sallmann said .
" one would n't believe the things people are buying , " she said , pointing to little replicas of the henri delaunay trophy .
jerseys of teams that failed to move to the quarter-finals are already selling at half price , except for the austrian team colours .
the host 's t-shirts were still being bought , sallmann said .
image booster according to mann , the euro would be a financial " zero sum game " for austria 's largest sporting goods retailer .
the reason why costs would equal revenues was that intersport 's regular stores already started devoting part of their retail space for euro 2008 products last year , he said .
setting up the temporary store in the fan zone had cost as much as opening up a regular new store , he added .
" this is really about the image value , " mann said .
being seen as the exclusive sporting goods partner of the euro would help to build the brand and to expand it in the european market , where intersport shops have a share of 20 per cent .

in the small euro 2008 display area in a billa store in central vienna , soft toys of mascots trix and flix cost only 4,99 euros , compared with 20 euros in the fan zone store .
the discount was not due to slow demand , nor would the supply with merchandise be stopped , corporate spokesperson corinna tinkler said .
her company was " satisfied " with sales figures so far , she said .
the discounted merchandise was intended as an " additional bonus " for customers .
when asked whether her company would make a profit from selling products such as euro t-shirts and stationery , she said that it was " hard to say , " as the final accounting would be done after the championship finals .
but she also stressed that billa had chosen to become an official uefa partner because of the positive effect it had on the brand .
another factor eating away at profits are the retailers ' advance costs for obtaining the right to become official uefa partners , several sources within the industry told deutsche presse-agentur dpa .

the discounted merchandise was intended as an " additional bonus " for customers .
when asked whether her company would make a profit from selling products such as euro t-shirts and stationery , she said that it was " hard to say , " as the final accounting would be done after the championship finals .
but she also stressed that billa had chosen to become an official uefa partner because of the positive effect it had on the brand .
another factor eating away at profits are the retailers ' advance costs for obtaining the right to become official uefa partners , several sources within the industry told deutsche presse-agentur dpa .
" it 's one more example showing that uefa has a knack for making money , " a manager of a retail chain that does not sell official euro products said . dpa news agency -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

trade union critics say that the social market economy is not working so well anymore for germany .
older generations nostalgic for the d-mark that marked the post-war economic boom , blame the euro for inflation . sixty years ago this friday , june 20 , the allied powers introduced a new currency , the d-mark , which became the basis of social market economy that led to the federal republic of germany 's wirtschaftswunder or economic miracle in the 1950s .
but the combination of free market dynamics with a wide social net that had served germany so well in the post-war period , is “ facing a deep legitimacy crisis ” , said michael sommer , head of the confederation of german unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- , an umbrella trade union organization in an interview with the newspaper berliner zeitung .
since the middle of the 1990s , real wages have hardly gone up , with every fifth worker barely earning enough at a subsistence level , added sommer .
“ social mobility still remains an illusion for the majority of single parents , long term unemployed and immigrant groups , ” he said lashing out at big multi-national companies that put short term gains and profits ahead of a long term strategy that preserves jobs and benefits .
euro blamed for inflation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumers feel their euro is not stretching far enough with massive job cuts underway at big dax companies such as deutsche telekom and siemens , as well as general cost of living increases , many germans are feeling the pinch and blame the euro , the common eu currency introduced nearly a decade ago for inflation .
more than a third of germans would even like to have their d-mark back , according to a representative survey by the association of german banks -lrb- bdb -rrb- published friday .
when asked whether they would like to have the old national currency back to replace the euro , fully one-third of 34 respondents answered “ yes . ”
in january 1999 , the switch to the euro for 11 eu member states took place electronically , although the notes and coins were introduced three years later .
inflation has nothing to do with the euro bildunterschrift : in the post-war decades , the d-mark provided a sense of economic well-being .
the main reason for wanting the deutsche mark back was the perception that the euro was responsible for rising prices , an argument that bdb rejected saying that current inflation had everything to do with higher energy and food prices and nothing to do with the euro .
the bdb also pointed out that inflation in the euro zone over the past 10 years had even remained fairly moderate .
" since the start of currency union , inflation has , at 2 percent a year on average , been relatively limited , " said bdb chairman manfred weber .
" in this connection , the euro is one of the most stable currencies overall . ”
weber said the currency now provided a firm basis for growth in the euro zone , which has now grown to 15 members , since the eastward expansion of the eu in 2004 .
britain , which still maintains the pound sterling , is the only major eu country that has not joined the euro zone .
eu leaders have just decided at their current summit in brussels that slovakia will become the 16th member country to introduce the euro in 2009 .
older germans still think in terms of d-marks despite the bdb 's confidence in the euro , nearly half of all germans , especially elder generations who feel nostalgic for the d-mark , still calculate in the old currency , according to frankfurt psychologist and university professor henning haase .
converting to d-marks is also relatively easy since one euro was roughly two deutsche marks .
" particularly in times of higher inflation , many people long for the return of the d-mark , " haase said , but added that that while an inflation rate of 3.1 percent is now perceived as high , inflation had " the deutsche mark is still firmly anchored in many minds as a stable currency , " he said . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

intersport , the sporting goods group operating the official store in the vienna fan zone , sold 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 388,000 -rrb- worth of euro-related products last monday , spokesperson christian mann said .
business was higher than usual that day , because host austria was playing germany .
unexpected demand overall sales figures are hard to come by , as vendors ' agreements with uefa prevents them from releasing such information .

" one would n't believe the things people are buying , " she said , pointing to little replicas of the henri delaunay trophy .

the host 's t-shirts were still being bought , sallmann said .
image booster according to mann , the euro would be a financial " zero sum game " for austria 's largest sporting goods retailer .
the reason why costs would equal revenues was that intersport 's regular stores already started devoting part of their retail space for euro 2008 products last year , he said .
setting up the temporary store in the fan zone had cost as much as opening up a regular new store , he added .

the university in germany 's bavaria state has about 4,500 students and teaches regular arts , science and business courses .
this week , the bishop , with express backing from other bavarian bishops , also suspended the university 's administrative head and appointed two temporary new chiefs , saying a fresh start was needed .
refuge of faith bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavaria 's most famous son whereas the church sees its university as a refuge of faith in a nation that is increasingly hostile to religion , professors have painted the struggle as a battle for academic liberty and autonomy , as claimed by universities around the globe .
interest in the dispute has been heightened by the fact that pope benedict xvi is a bavarian and was a formerly a professor in the state , at a different university , regensburg .
the vatican has not spoken out about the row .
unlike at theology colleges , students do not have to be catholic to attend ku .
as at most german state universities , the tuition fees are minimal compared to those in most western nations .
irreconcilable differences to some , the row brings back memories of the vatican 's desire in 1979 to remove the dissident swiss-born theologian hans kueng from his professor-of-theology post at the german university of tuebingen .
however the man at the center of the latest tussle , ulrich hemel , is not a theologian but a business executive whose main academic subject has been the religious formation of children .
hemel was chosen by eichstaett professors to become " president , " a german university 's top academic official , earlier this year , but bishop hanke flatly refused to bless hemel 's appointment and certification needed by hemel from the vatican never arrived .
newspapers speculated that the bishop was disturbed by the fact that hemel had been married three times , but whatever the origin , it is clear that the bishop and hemel have an irreconcilable antipathy .
the bishop 's stated objections to hemel include an accusation that hemel blabbed to the media after they talked .
the catholic newspaper tagespost quoted bishop hanke , who is grand chancellor , or ceremonial chief of the university , saying hemel had never been a full professor and had no recent scholarly publications .
uniquely german bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bischop gregor maria hanke there are catholic universities in the united states , but ku , founded in 1980 , has a uniquely german form of government .
the university , with most of its campus in the bavarian town of eichstaett and a business school in the bigger industrial city of ingolstadt , is mainly funded by the state of bavaria , with the state 's bishops contributing 15 per cent of the budget .
the row has escalated , with suggestions of intrigue and plots rattling the provincial calm at eichstaett .
the conflict reached a head with two senior academics resigning and a bitter joint open letter last week from students and senior professors attacking the " unprecedented " church interference .
professors , who have life tenure and huge power in the german university system , often argue that academic research should be driven by a scholar 's interests rather than the demands of society .
optimistic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many want to see the university become more catholic the bishop has ordered a financial audit of recent spending by the chief executive , gottfried von der heydte , who shared control of the university with its president .
the bishop said he would not make his suspicions public .
tv news crews filmed the grey-suited auditors arriving , sending away von der heydte 's assistants and staying late into the night to search computer and paper files .
professors received letters forbidding them to speak with von der heydte .
bishop hanke said the route out of the conflict was the installation of two outside , neutral academics who would be tasked from july 1 with overseeing a fresh start .
" this is like a marital conflict , " he said .
" it 's best to get a third party to help you . "
the munich newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung said the academic credentials of the two trouble-shooters chosen by the bishop , retired sociologist rudolf fisch and historian gert melville , had impressed some professors , so the duo might be able to bridge the differences .
on wednesday , the professors backed off from further conflict , issuing a joint statement that they were confident the new management would put the university back on the right track .
hanke also met this week for two hours with student leaders , who said both sides were optimistic about the university 's future .
bishop hanke , who took office in november 2006 , has said the trouble-shooters will oversee a hunt next year for a new president .
doctrinal issues have not been raised in the dispute , but the archbishop of munich , reinhard marx , indicated this week that bishops want the university to adopt a more catholic " character " in future . dpa news agency -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hemel was chosen by eichstaett professors to become " president , " a german university 's top academic official , earlier this year , but bishop hanke flatly refused to bless hemel 's appointment and certification needed by hemel from the vatican never arrived .
newspapers speculated that the bishop was disturbed by the fact that hemel had been married three times , but whatever the origin , it is clear that the bishop and hemel have an irreconcilable antipathy .
the bishop 's stated objections to hemel include an accusation that hemel blabbed to the media after they talked .
the catholic newspaper tagespost quoted bishop hanke , who is grand chancellor , or ceremonial chief of the university , saying hemel had never been a full professor and had no recent scholarly publications .

the row has escalated , with suggestions of intrigue and plots rattling the provincial calm at eichstaett .
the conflict reached a head with two senior academics resigning and a bitter joint open letter last week from students and senior professors attacking the " unprecedented " church interference .

the bishop said he would not make his suspicions public .
tv news crews filmed the grey-suited auditors arriving , sending away von der heydte 's assistants and staying late into the night to search computer and paper files .
professors received letters forbidding them to speak with von der heydte .
bishop hanke said the route out of the conflict was the installation of two outside , neutral academics who would be tasked from july 1 with overseeing a fresh start .
" this is like a marital conflict , " he said .
" it 's best to get a third party to help you . "
the munich newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung said the academic credentials of the two trouble-shooters chosen by the bishop , retired sociologist rudolf fisch and historian gert melville , had impressed some professors , so the duo might be able to bridge the differences .

intersport , the sporting goods group operating the official store in the vienna fan zone , sold 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 388,000 -rrb- worth of euro-related products last monday , spokesperson christian mann said .
business was higher than usual that day , because host austria was playing germany .
unexpected demand overall sales figures are hard to come by , as vendors ' agreements with uefa prevents them from releasing such information .
" demand is far higher than expected , " mann said .
intersport eybl , the part of the intersport that is uefa 's exclusive vending partner of sporting goods for the euro 2008 , expects revenues of " mid-level single-digit million euros , " another spokesperson said .
memorabilia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : image boosters inside the official vienna fan shop the other day , the atmosphere was busier than in the fan zone surrounding the store .
customers seemed to be interested mostly in buying t-shirts commemorating past games , as they were marked down to 5 euros .
but fans were also buying pricier items , like team jerseys or the official ball , store manager alexandra sallmann said .
" one would n't believe the things people are buying , " she said , pointing to little replicas of the henri delaunay trophy .
jerseys of teams that failed to move to the quarter-finals are already selling at half price , except for the austrian team colours .
the host 's t-shirts were still being bought , sallmann said .
image booster according to mann , the euro would be a financial " zero sum game " for austria 's largest sporting goods retailer .
the reason why costs would equal revenues was that intersport 's regular stores already started devoting part of their retail space for euro 2008 products last year , he said .
setting up the temporary store in the fan zone had cost as much as opening up a regular new store , he added .
" this is really about the image value , " mann said .
being seen as the exclusive sporting goods partner of the euro would help to build the brand and to expand it in the european market , where intersport shops have a share of 20 per cent .
special offers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stores are satisfied with sales at the billa supermarket chain , another official uefa sales partner , euro 2008 products have been marked down by 50 per cent since the kick-off of the championships .
in the small euro 2008 display area in a billa store in central vienna , soft toys of mascots trix and flix cost only 4,99 euros , compared with 20 euros in the fan zone store .
the discount was not due to slow demand , nor would the supply with merchandise be stopped , corporate spokesperson corinna tinkler said .
her company was " satisfied " with sales figures so far , she said .
the discounted merchandise was intended as an " additional bonus " for customers .
when asked whether her company would make a profit from selling products such as euro t-shirts and stationery , she said that it was " hard to say , " as the final accounting would be done after the championship finals .
but she also stressed that billa had chosen to become an official uefa partner because of the positive effect it had on the brand .
another factor eating away at profits are the retailers ' advance costs for obtaining the right to become official uefa partners , several sources within the industry told deutsche presse-agentur dpa .

the university in germany 's bavaria state has about 4,500 students and teaches regular arts , science and business courses .
this week , the bishop , with express backing from other bavarian bishops , also suspended the university 's administrative head and appointed two temporary new chiefs , saying a fresh start was needed .
refuge of faith bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavaria 's most famous son whereas the church sees its university as a refuge of faith in a nation that is increasingly hostile to religion , professors have painted the struggle as a battle for academic liberty and autonomy , as claimed by universities around the globe .
interest in the dispute has been heightened by the fact that pope benedict xvi is a bavarian and was a formerly a professor in the state , at a different university , regensburg .
the vatican has not spoken out about the row .
unlike at theology colleges , students do not have to be catholic to attend ku .
as at most german state universities , the tuition fees are minimal compared to those in most western nations .
irreconcilable differences to some , the row brings back memories of the vatican 's desire in 1979 to remove the dissident swiss-born theologian hans kueng from his professor-of-theology post at the german university of tuebingen .
however the man at the center of the latest tussle , ulrich hemel , is not a theologian but a business executive whose main academic subject has been the religious formation of children .
hemel was chosen by eichstaett professors to become " president , " a german university 's top academic official , earlier this year , but bishop hanke flatly refused to bless hemel 's appointment and certification needed by hemel from the vatican never arrived .
newspapers speculated that the bishop was disturbed by the fact that hemel had been married three times , but whatever the origin , it is clear that the bishop and hemel have an irreconcilable antipathy .
the bishop 's stated objections to hemel include an accusation that hemel blabbed to the media after they talked .
the catholic newspaper tagespost quoted bishop hanke , who is grand chancellor , or ceremonial chief of the university , saying hemel had never been a full professor and had no recent scholarly publications .

the caribbean country 's northern neighbor is bound to be angered by the move . the move is expected to place brussels and washington on a collision course and drew criticism from cuban dissidents .
the vote on thursday , june 19 , scrapped the sanctions that were imposed in 2003 , suspended in 2005 and are largely symbolic .
they include limits on high-level government visits and the role of eu diplomats in cuba 's cultural events and do not approach the hard line of the 46-year-old us sanctions , which include a trade and investment embargo .
" cosmetic changes " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has prohibited all exports to cuba since 1960 earlier thursday , a us state department spokesman said washington opposed any moves to ease sanctions on cuba , saying that reforms so far under new cuban president raul castro are " some very minor , cosmetic changes " that have fallen well short of ending decades of repressive policies under his brother , fidel castro .
the end of sanctions would give legitimacy to a dictatorial regime , deputy spokesman tom casey said , and countries should not signal that the " continued oppression of the cuban people is any more acceptable now than in the past . "
dissidents in cuba also objected to the lifting of the sanctions , charging the european union with being " hypocritical . "
" it gives me pain , and i 'm ashamed of governments that , far from promoting the democratic values under which they live , are made accomplices to one of the last dictatorships in the world , " vladimiro roca , one of cuba 's best known dissidents and leader of the illegal social democratic party , told dpa news agency .
encouraging reform although eu diplomats said the lifting of the sanctions was aimed at encouraging democratic reforms on cuba , the economist oscar espinosa , one of 75 dissidents whose 2003 arrests led to the eu sanctions , warned the move could harden the attitude of cuba 's communist government .
" it is worrisome because the lifting of the sanctions without something in return from cuba could have a very negative effect on cuba 's internal affairs , " espinosa said .
" it could send a signal to the hardline sectors of the government that it pays to be intransigent and inflexible . "
hypocritical as the european union ceased high-level contacts with cuba 's government in 2003 , it also increased its contacts with cuba 's dissidents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cuba is now expected to become more tolerant of dissidents but the sanctions were suspended in 2005 , and spain pushed to have them officially lifted after fidel castro withdrew as cuba 's leader and raul castro , who took over as president in february , implemented reforms , including giving unused state land to farmers and allowing ordinary cubans to use mobile phones , stay in tourist hotels and buy energy-consuming goods like dvd players and personal computers .
while the eu saw signs of liberalization in those moves , cuba 's dissidents said they have seen no change in the government 's treatment of the opposition .
for instance , of the 75 dissidents jailed in 2003 , 55 remain in custody .
the lifting of the sanctions " confirms once more that , with some notable exceptions , the eu is following a hypocritical policy exclusively concerned with its economic interests and not about cuba entering the circle of the democratic nations of the world , " said roca , who is a recipient of the eu 's sakharov prize for freedom of thought .
the czech republic and sweden have been reluctant to lift the sanctions and have demanded that cuba make progress in freeing political prisoners and implement other human rights concessions .

the caribbean country 's northern neighbor is bound to be angered by the move . the move is expected to place brussels and washington on a collision course and drew criticism from cuban dissidents .
the vote on thursday , june 19 , scrapped the sanctions that were imposed in 2003 , suspended in 2005 and are largely symbolic .
they include limits on high-level government visits and the role of eu diplomats in cuba 's cultural events and do not approach the hard line of the 46-year-old us sanctions , which include a trade and investment embargo .
" cosmetic changes " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has prohibited all exports to cuba since 1960 earlier thursday , a us state department spokesman said washington opposed any moves to ease sanctions on cuba , saying that reforms so far under new cuban president raul castro are " some very minor , cosmetic changes " that have fallen well short of ending decades of repressive policies under his brother , fidel castro .
the end of sanctions would give legitimacy to a dictatorial regime , deputy spokesman tom casey said , and countries should not signal that the " continued oppression of the cuban people is any more acceptable now than in the past . "
dissidents in cuba also objected to the lifting of the sanctions , charging the european union with being " hypocritical . "
" it gives me pain , and i 'm ashamed of governments that , far from promoting the democratic values under which they live , are made accomplices to one of the last dictatorships in the world , " vladimiro roca , one of cuba 's best known dissidents and leader of the illegal social democratic party , told dpa news agency .
encouraging reform although eu diplomats said the lifting of the sanctions was aimed at encouraging democratic reforms on cuba , the economist oscar espinosa , one of 75 dissidents whose 2003 arrests led to the eu sanctions , warned the move could harden the attitude of cuba 's communist government .
" it is worrisome because the lifting of the sanctions without something in return from cuba could have a very negative effect on cuba 's internal affairs , " espinosa said .
" it could send a signal to the hardline sectors of the government that it pays to be intransigent and inflexible . "
hypocritical as the european union ceased high-level contacts with cuba 's government in 2003 , it also increased its contacts with cuba 's dissidents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cuba is now expected to become more tolerant of dissidents but the sanctions were suspended in 2005 , and spain pushed to have them officially lifted after fidel castro withdrew as cuba 's leader and raul castro , who took over as president in february , implemented reforms , including giving unused state land to farmers and allowing ordinary cubans to use mobile phones , stay in tourist hotels and buy energy-consuming goods like dvd players and personal computers .
while the eu saw signs of liberalization in those moves , cuba 's dissidents said they have seen no change in the government 's treatment of the opposition .
for instance , of the 75 dissidents jailed in 2003 , 55 remain in custody .
the lifting of the sanctions " confirms once more that , with some notable exceptions , the eu is following a hypocritical policy exclusively concerned with its economic interests and not about cuba entering the circle of the democratic nations of the world , " said roca , who is a recipient of the eu 's sakharov prize for freedom of thought .
the czech republic and sweden have been reluctant to lift the sanctions and have demanded that cuba make progress in freeing political prisoners and implement other human rights concessions .

the university in germany 's bavaria state has about 4,500 students and teaches regular arts , science and business courses .
this week , the bishop , with express backing from other bavarian bishops , also suspended the university 's administrative head and appointed two temporary new chiefs , saying a fresh start was needed .
refuge of faith bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavaria 's most famous son whereas the church sees its university as a refuge of faith in a nation that is increasingly hostile to religion , professors have painted the struggle as a battle for academic liberty and autonomy , as claimed by universities around the globe .
interest in the dispute has been heightened by the fact that pope benedict xvi is a bavarian and was a formerly a professor in the state , at a different university , regensburg .
the vatican has not spoken out about the row .
unlike at theology colleges , students do not have to be catholic to attend ku .
as at most german state universities , the tuition fees are minimal compared to those in most western nations .
irreconcilable differences to some , the row brings back memories of the vatican 's desire in 1979 to remove the dissident swiss-born theologian hans kueng from his professor-of-theology post at the german university of tuebingen .
however the man at the center of the latest tussle , ulrich hemel , is not a theologian but a business executive whose main academic subject has been the religious formation of children .
hemel was chosen by eichstaett professors to become " president , " a german university 's top academic official , earlier this year , but bishop hanke flatly refused to bless hemel 's appointment and certification needed by hemel from the vatican never arrived .
newspapers speculated that the bishop was disturbed by the fact that hemel had been married three times , but whatever the origin , it is clear that the bishop and hemel have an irreconcilable antipathy .
the bishop 's stated objections to hemel include an accusation that hemel blabbed to the media after they talked .
the catholic newspaper tagespost quoted bishop hanke , who is grand chancellor , or ceremonial chief of the university , saying hemel had never been a full professor and had no recent scholarly publications .
uniquely german bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bischop gregor maria hanke there are catholic universities in the united states , but ku , founded in 1980 , has a uniquely german form of government .
the university , with most of its campus in the bavarian town of eichstaett and a business school in the bigger industrial city of ingolstadt , is mainly funded by the state of bavaria , with the state 's bishops contributing 15 per cent of the budget .
the row has escalated , with suggestions of intrigue and plots rattling the provincial calm at eichstaett .
the conflict reached a head with two senior academics resigning and a bitter joint open letter last week from students and senior professors attacking the " unprecedented " church interference .
professors , who have life tenure and huge power in the german university system , often argue that academic research should be driven by a scholar 's interests rather than the demands of society .
optimistic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many want to see the university become more catholic the bishop has ordered a financial audit of recent spending by the chief executive , gottfried von der heydte , who shared control of the university with its president .
the bishop said he would not make his suspicions public .
tv news crews filmed the grey-suited auditors arriving , sending away von der heydte 's assistants and staying late into the night to search computer and paper files .
professors received letters forbidding them to speak with von der heydte .
bishop hanke said the route out of the conflict was the installation of two outside , neutral academics who would be tasked from july 1 with overseeing a fresh start .
" this is like a marital conflict , " he said .
" it 's best to get a third party to help you . "
the munich newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung said the academic credentials of the two trouble-shooters chosen by the bishop , retired sociologist rudolf fisch and historian gert melville , had impressed some professors , so the duo might be able to bridge the differences .
on wednesday , the professors backed off from further conflict , issuing a joint statement that they were confident the new management would put the university back on the right track .
hanke also met this week for two hours with student leaders , who said both sides were optimistic about the university 's future .
bishop hanke , who took office in november 2006 , has said the trouble-shooters will oversee a hunt next year for a new president .
doctrinal issues have not been raised in the dispute , but the archbishop of munich , reinhard marx , indicated this week that bishops want the university to adopt a more catholic " character " in future . dpa news agency -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the caribbean country 's northern neighbor is bound to be angered by the move . the move is expected to place brussels and washington on a collision course and drew criticism from cuban dissidents .
the vote on thursday , june 19 , scrapped the sanctions that were imposed in 2003 , suspended in 2005 and are largely symbolic .
they include limits on high-level government visits and the role of eu diplomats in cuba 's cultural events and do not approach the hard line of the 46-year-old us sanctions , which include a trade and investment embargo .
" cosmetic changes " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has prohibited all exports to cuba since 1960 earlier thursday , a us state department spokesman said washington opposed any moves to ease sanctions on cuba , saying that reforms so far under new cuban president raul castro are " some very minor , cosmetic changes " that have fallen well short of ending decades of repressive policies under his brother , fidel castro .
the end of sanctions would give legitimacy to a dictatorial regime , deputy spokesman tom casey said , and countries should not signal that the " continued oppression of the cuban people is any more acceptable now than in the past . "
dissidents in cuba also objected to the lifting of the sanctions , charging the european union with being " hypocritical . "
" it gives me pain , and i 'm ashamed of governments that , far from promoting the democratic values under which they live , are made accomplices to one of the last dictatorships in the world , " vladimiro roca , one of cuba 's best known dissidents and leader of the illegal social democratic party , told dpa news agency .
encouraging reform although eu diplomats said the lifting of the sanctions was aimed at encouraging democratic reforms on cuba , the economist oscar espinosa , one of 75 dissidents whose 2003 arrests led to the eu sanctions , warned the move could harden the attitude of cuba 's communist government .
" it is worrisome because the lifting of the sanctions without something in return from cuba could have a very negative effect on cuba 's internal affairs , " espinosa said .
" it could send a signal to the hardline sectors of the government that it pays to be intransigent and inflexible . "
hypocritical as the european union ceased high-level contacts with cuba 's government in 2003 , it also increased its contacts with cuba 's dissidents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cuba is now expected to become more tolerant of dissidents but the sanctions were suspended in 2005 , and spain pushed to have them officially lifted after fidel castro withdrew as cuba 's leader and raul castro , who took over as president in february , implemented reforms , including giving unused state land to farmers and allowing ordinary cubans to use mobile phones , stay in tourist hotels and buy energy-consuming goods like dvd players and personal computers .
while the eu saw signs of liberalization in those moves , cuba 's dissidents said they have seen no change in the government 's treatment of the opposition .
for instance , of the 75 dissidents jailed in 2003 , 55 remain in custody .
the lifting of the sanctions " confirms once more that , with some notable exceptions , the eu is following a hypocritical policy exclusively concerned with its economic interests and not about cuba entering the circle of the democratic nations of the world , " said roca , who is a recipient of the eu 's sakharov prize for freedom of thought .
the czech republic and sweden have been reluctant to lift the sanctions and have demanded that cuba make progress in freeing political prisoners and implement other human rights concessions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de cities -pipe- 20.06.2008 berlin residents unsettled by wave of gentrification großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another high-end boutique moves into the eastern neighborhood of prenzlauer berg since the berlin wall fell , the gentrification of some eastern neighborhoods has been ongoing .
but as high-end development spreads , some are saying : enough .
they fear berlin 's character could be irrevocably changed . mario feist remembers that there used to be bakeries and small grocery shops in the oderberger strasse when he first moved there in 1989 .
today , it is much easier to get a latte macchiato or a 150-euro shirt outside his front door than a loaf of bread or carton of milk .
he has watched as his street has been transformed from a dreary road marked by crumbling facades to a hip thoroughfare of renovated buildings , expensive boutiques and trendy cafés , whose sidewalks often resemble a fashion catwalk on sunny weekends .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marthashof sales office offers homes for the high-end client it 's a metamorphosis that he 's not completely comfortable with , especially since it could take on a whole new dimension once the 12,000-square-meter development of luxury apartments being constructed just outside his back window is completed .
called marthashof , it will house around 500 people , and since the square meter price for the townhouses starts at 3,000 euros , the large influx into the neighborhood will be quite well off .
" it could become a very sterile place just for rich people and not the kind of place i 'd want to live , " he said .
" i want to have different kinds of people here . "
expanding wave his concerns are not his alone .
as berlin 's gentrification process spreads to encompass more and more neighborhoods , people are beginning to push back at what they see as a danger to a vibrant , diverse city of neighborhoods featuring people of different social and economic backgrounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an unrenovated and renovated building side by side on oderberger strasse in some neighborhoods , like feist 's prenzlauer berg , gentrification has been happening for years .
but as berlin continues to pull in more investment and its international reputation attracts more wealthy people , the neighborhood has seen a construction boom in luxury apartments and townhouses , which , in comparison to london , new york or paris , can still be had on the cheap .
the fears are that as more wealthy people move in to an area , their up-market tastes will be reflected in businesses that set up shop and rents will go up , pricing out lower and middle-income people .
feist said he 's already seen it happen in his street , when a greek restaurateur was forced to move out after his rent was tripled when the building housing his eatery changed hands .
" gentrification is not a good or bad thing in itself , " said antje seidel-schuelze , a researcher at the german institute of urban affairs .
" in one way , the districts where it happens become better .
but long-established people in a neighborhood are often replaced by wealthier people .
that leads to a certain homogeneity . "
same old same it 's that threat of sameness that riles patrik technau , a 23-year-old student and prenzlauer berg native who recently organized a protest rally near marthashof and another high-end development that attracted 500 people .
his event capped a week of demonstrations across berlin by mostly left-wing groups who say they are against the rapid development and reconstruction of the city .
during the protests , at least 30 cars were set ablaze . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more up-market housing going up " new people are moving here from abroad or other parts of germany and driving out people who 've lived here 40 or 50 years , " he said .
" that 's not fair and it makes me very angry . "
and while once the gentrification seemed limited to central neighborhoods such as prenzlauer berg and mitte , it 's spreading , said andrej holm , a professor at berlin 's humbolt university who studies gentrification .
that is what is causing the anger to rise .
as people were priced out of one neighborhood , they would move .
but often the gentrification wave would follow , forcing them to move again .
now , neighborhoods that were usually seen as immune to the process , and have been long-time enclaves of ethnic communities or artists and bohemians , are attracting professionals who are tired of the boutiques and bars , and are looking for something more " authentic . "
problem is , say researchers , that the lattes , renovations and higher rents are n't usually very far behind .
keeping the mix according to holm , city governments have several instruments that can keep neighborhoods on their way up from losing their diversity , such as rent control mechanisms or the construction of new social housing , even in gentrified neighborhoods .
but he said berlin has generally abandoned these tools , particularly when it comes to low-rent housing .
" in the few lots where there is still space for construction , only things like luxury townhouses and gated communities are going up , " he said .
" the city seems to think if we increase the number of high-end apartments , it can attract the kind of people that will also improve berlin 's economic situation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gentrification wave is expected to eventually hit even areas like berlin 's neukölln district but while the upper-income influx might lift a few economic boats in berlin , it could strand people like claudia hering , who along with mario feist is part of a citizens ' initiative called aim which wants changes to the marthashof development .
" we are afraid that in two or three years we wo n't be able to live here anymore , " she said .
but would she even want to ?
according to researcher seidel-schuelze , gentrification often makes people want to leave their own neighborhoods , no matter what their history there .
not only can they perhaps no longer afford it , the new look and feel can make the place not seem like home anymore .
" i know some people who used to live -lrb- in prenzlauer berg -rrb- in the gdr and they say it 's not my district anymore and i do n't want to be with these new dinks - double income , no kids people , " she said .

but as high-end development spreads , some are saying : enough .
they fear berlin 's character could be irrevocably changed . mario feist remembers that there used to be bakeries and small grocery shops in the oderberger strasse when he first moved there in 1989 .
today , it is much easier to get a latte macchiato or a 150-euro shirt outside his front door than a loaf of bread or carton of milk .
he has watched as his street has been transformed from a dreary road marked by crumbling facades to a hip thoroughfare of renovated buildings , expensive boutiques and trendy cafés , whose sidewalks often resemble a fashion catwalk on sunny weekends .

called marthashof , it will house around 500 people , and since the square meter price for the townhouses starts at 3,000 euros , the large influx into the neighborhood will be quite well off .
" it could become a very sterile place just for rich people and not the kind of place i 'd want to live , " he said .
" i want to have different kinds of people here . "
expanding wave his concerns are not his alone .
as berlin 's gentrification process spreads to encompass more and more neighborhoods , people are beginning to push back at what they see as a danger to a vibrant , diverse city of neighborhoods featuring people of different social and economic backgrounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an unrenovated and renovated building side by side on oderberger strasse in some neighborhoods , like feist 's prenzlauer berg , gentrification has been happening for years .
but as berlin continues to pull in more investment and its international reputation attracts more wealthy people , the neighborhood has seen a construction boom in luxury apartments and townhouses , which , in comparison to london , new york or paris , can still be had on the cheap .
the fears are that as more wealthy people move in to an area , their up-market tastes will be reflected in businesses that set up shop and rents will go up , pricing out lower and middle-income people .
feist said he 's already seen it happen in his street , when a greek restaurateur was forced to move out after his rent was tripled when the building housing his eatery changed hands .
" gentrification is not a good or bad thing in itself , " said antje seidel-schuelze , a researcher at the german institute of urban affairs .
" in one way , the districts where it happens become better .
but long-established people in a neighborhood are often replaced by wealthier people .
that leads to a certain homogeneity . "
same old same it 's that threat of sameness that riles patrik technau , a 23-year-old student and prenzlauer berg native who recently organized a protest rally near marthashof and another high-end development that attracted 500 people .
his event capped a week of demonstrations across berlin by mostly left-wing groups who say they are against the rapid development and reconstruction of the city .
during the protests , at least 30 cars were set ablaze . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more up-market housing going up " new people are moving here from abroad or other parts of germany and driving out people who 've lived here 40 or 50 years , " he said .
" that 's not fair and it makes me very angry . "
and while once the gentrification seemed limited to central neighborhoods such as prenzlauer berg and mitte , it 's spreading , said andrej holm , a professor at berlin 's humbolt university who studies gentrification .
that is what is causing the anger to rise .
as people were priced out of one neighborhood , they would move .
but often the gentrification wave would follow , forcing them to move again .
now , neighborhoods that were usually seen as immune to the process , and have been long-time enclaves of ethnic communities or artists and bohemians , are attracting professionals who are tired of the boutiques and bars , and are looking for something more " authentic . "
problem is , say researchers , that the lattes , renovations and higher rents are n't usually very far behind .
keeping the mix according to holm , city governments have several instruments that can keep neighborhoods on their way up from losing their diversity , such as rent control mechanisms or the construction of new social housing , even in gentrified neighborhoods .
but he said berlin has generally abandoned these tools , particularly when it comes to low-rent housing .
" in the few lots where there is still space for construction , only things like luxury townhouses and gated communities are going up , " he said .
" the city seems to think if we increase the number of high-end apartments , it can attract the kind of people that will also improve berlin 's economic situation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gentrification wave is expected to eventually hit even areas like berlin 's neukölln district but while the upper-income influx might lift a few economic boats in berlin , it could strand people like claudia hering , who along with mario feist is part of a citizens ' initiative called aim which wants changes to the marthashof development .
" we are afraid that in two or three years we wo n't be able to live here anymore , " she said .
but would she even want to ?
according to researcher seidel-schuelze , gentrification often makes people want to leave their own neighborhoods , no matter what their history there .
not only can they perhaps no longer afford it , the new look and feel can make the place not seem like home anymore .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 20.06.2008 nostalgic germans blame the euro for faltering economy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one third of germans want a return to the d-mark , a symbol of the 1950s economic miracle .
trade union critics say that the social market economy is not working so well anymore for germany .
older generations nostalgic for the d-mark that marked the post-war economic boom , blame the euro for inflation . sixty years ago this friday , june 20 , the allied powers introduced a new currency , the d-mark , which became the basis of social market economy that led to the federal republic of germany 's wirtschaftswunder or economic miracle in the 1950s .
but the combination of free market dynamics with a wide social net that had served germany so well in the post-war period , is “ facing a deep legitimacy crisis ” , said michael sommer , head of the confederation of german unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- , an umbrella trade union organization in an interview with the newspaper berliner zeitung .
since the middle of the 1990s , real wages have hardly gone up , with every fifth worker barely earning enough at a subsistence level , added sommer .
“ social mobility still remains an illusion for the majority of single parents , long term unemployed and immigrant groups , ” he said lashing out at big multi-national companies that put short term gains and profits ahead of a long term strategy that preserves jobs and benefits .
euro blamed for inflation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumers feel their euro is not stretching far enough with massive job cuts underway at big dax companies such as deutsche telekom and siemens , as well as general cost of living increases , many germans are feeling the pinch and blame the euro , the common eu currency introduced nearly a decade ago for inflation .
more than a third of germans would even like to have their d-mark back , according to a representative survey by the association of german banks -lrb- bdb -rrb- published friday .
when asked whether they would like to have the old national currency back to replace the euro , fully one-third of 34 respondents answered “ yes . ”
in january 1999 , the switch to the euro for 11 eu member states took place electronically , although the notes and coins were introduced three years later .
inflation has nothing to do with the euro bildunterschrift : in the post-war decades , the d-mark provided a sense of economic well-being .
the main reason for wanting the deutsche mark back was the perception that the euro was responsible for rising prices , an argument that bdb rejected saying that current inflation had everything to do with higher energy and food prices and nothing to do with the euro .
the bdb also pointed out that inflation in the euro zone over the past 10 years had even remained fairly moderate .

trade union critics say that the social market economy is not working so well anymore for germany .
older generations nostalgic for the d-mark that marked the post-war economic boom , blame the euro for inflation . sixty years ago this friday , june 20 , the allied powers introduced a new currency , the d-mark , which became the basis of social market economy that led to the federal republic of germany 's wirtschaftswunder or economic miracle in the 1950s .
but the combination of free market dynamics with a wide social net that had served germany so well in the post-war period , is “ facing a deep legitimacy crisis ” , said michael sommer , head of the confederation of german unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- , an umbrella trade union organization in an interview with the newspaper berliner zeitung .
since the middle of the 1990s , real wages have hardly gone up , with every fifth worker barely earning enough at a subsistence level , added sommer .
“ social mobility still remains an illusion for the majority of single parents , long term unemployed and immigrant groups , ” he said lashing out at big multi-national companies that put short term gains and profits ahead of a long term strategy that preserves jobs and benefits .
euro blamed for inflation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumers feel their euro is not stretching far enough with massive job cuts underway at big dax companies such as deutsche telekom and siemens , as well as general cost of living increases , many germans are feeling the pinch and blame the euro , the common eu currency introduced nearly a decade ago for inflation .
more than a third of germans would even like to have their d-mark back , according to a representative survey by the association of german banks -lrb- bdb -rrb- published friday .
when asked whether they would like to have the old national currency back to replace the euro , fully one-third of 34 respondents answered “ yes . ”
in january 1999 , the switch to the euro for 11 eu member states took place electronically , although the notes and coins were introduced three years later .
inflation has nothing to do with the euro bildunterschrift : in the post-war decades , the d-mark provided a sense of economic well-being .
the main reason for wanting the deutsche mark back was the perception that the euro was responsible for rising prices , an argument that bdb rejected saying that current inflation had everything to do with higher energy and food prices and nothing to do with the euro .
the bdb also pointed out that inflation in the euro zone over the past 10 years had even remained fairly moderate .

trade union critics say that the social market economy is not working so well anymore for germany .
older generations nostalgic for the d-mark that marked the post-war economic boom , blame the euro for inflation . sixty years ago this friday , june 20 , the allied powers introduced a new currency , the d-mark , which became the basis of social market economy that led to the federal republic of germany 's wirtschaftswunder or economic miracle in the 1950s .
but the combination of free market dynamics with a wide social net that had served germany so well in the post-war period , is “ facing a deep legitimacy crisis ” , said michael sommer , head of the confederation of german unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- , an umbrella trade union organization in an interview with the newspaper berliner zeitung .
since the middle of the 1990s , real wages have hardly gone up , with every fifth worker barely earning enough at a subsistence level , added sommer .
“ social mobility still remains an illusion for the majority of single parents , long term unemployed and immigrant groups , ” he said lashing out at big multi-national companies that put short term gains and profits ahead of a long term strategy that preserves jobs and benefits .
euro blamed for inflation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumers feel their euro is not stretching far enough with massive job cuts underway at big dax companies such as deutsche telekom and siemens , as well as general cost of living increases , many germans are feeling the pinch and blame the euro , the common eu currency introduced nearly a decade ago for inflation .
more than a third of germans would even like to have their d-mark back , according to a representative survey by the association of german banks -lrb- bdb -rrb- published friday .
when asked whether they would like to have the old national currency back to replace the euro , fully one-third of 34 respondents answered “ yes . ”
in january 1999 , the switch to the euro for 11 eu member states took place electronically , although the notes and coins were introduced three years later .
inflation has nothing to do with the euro bildunterschrift : in the post-war decades , the d-mark provided a sense of economic well-being .
the main reason for wanting the deutsche mark back was the perception that the euro was responsible for rising prices , an argument that bdb rejected saying that current inflation had everything to do with higher energy and food prices and nothing to do with the euro .
the bdb also pointed out that inflation in the euro zone over the past 10 years had even remained fairly moderate .
" since the start of currency union , inflation has , at 2 percent a year on average , been relatively limited , " said bdb chairman manfred weber .
" in this connection , the euro is one of the most stable currencies overall . ”
weber said the currency now provided a firm basis for growth in the euro zone , which has now grown to 15 members , since the eastward expansion of the eu in 2004 .
britain , which still maintains the pound sterling , is the only major eu country that has not joined the euro zone .
eu leaders have just decided at their current summit in brussels that slovakia will become the 16th member country to introduce the euro in 2009 .
older germans still think in terms of d-marks despite the bdb 's confidence in the euro , nearly half of all germans , especially elder generations who feel nostalgic for the d-mark , still calculate in the old currency , according to frankfurt psychologist and university professor henning haase .
converting to d-marks is also relatively easy since one euro was roughly two deutsche marks .
" particularly in times of higher inflation , many people long for the return of the d-mark , " haase said , but added that that while an inflation rate of 3.1 percent is now perceived as high , inflation had " the deutsche mark is still firmly anchored in many minds as a stable currency , " he said . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but as high-end development spreads , some are saying : enough .
they fear berlin 's character could be irrevocably changed . mario feist remembers that there used to be bakeries and small grocery shops in the oderberger strasse when he first moved there in 1989 .
today , it is much easier to get a latte macchiato or a 150-euro shirt outside his front door than a loaf of bread or carton of milk .
he has watched as his street has been transformed from a dreary road marked by crumbling facades to a hip thoroughfare of renovated buildings , expensive boutiques and trendy cafés , whose sidewalks often resemble a fashion catwalk on sunny weekends .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marthashof sales office offers homes for the high-end client it 's a metamorphosis that he 's not completely comfortable with , especially since it could take on a whole new dimension once the 12,000-square-meter development of luxury apartments being constructed just outside his back window is completed .
called marthashof , it will house around 500 people , and since the square meter price for the townhouses starts at 3,000 euros , the large influx into the neighborhood will be quite well off .
" it could become a very sterile place just for rich people and not the kind of place i 'd want to live , " he said .
" i want to have different kinds of people here . "
expanding wave his concerns are not his alone .
as berlin 's gentrification process spreads to encompass more and more neighborhoods , people are beginning to push back at what they see as a danger to a vibrant , diverse city of neighborhoods featuring people of different social and economic backgrounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an unrenovated and renovated building side by side on oderberger strasse in some neighborhoods , like feist 's prenzlauer berg , gentrification has been happening for years .
but as berlin continues to pull in more investment and its international reputation attracts more wealthy people , the neighborhood has seen a construction boom in luxury apartments and townhouses , which , in comparison to london , new york or paris , can still be had on the cheap .
the fears are that as more wealthy people move in to an area , their up-market tastes will be reflected in businesses that set up shop and rents will go up , pricing out lower and middle-income people .
feist said he 's already seen it happen in his street , when a greek restaurateur was forced to move out after his rent was tripled when the building housing his eatery changed hands .
" gentrification is not a good or bad thing in itself , " said antje seidel-schuelze , a researcher at the german institute of urban affairs .
" in one way , the districts where it happens become better .
but long-established people in a neighborhood are often replaced by wealthier people .
that leads to a certain homogeneity . "
same old same it 's that threat of sameness that riles patrik technau , a 23-year-old student and prenzlauer berg native who recently organized a protest rally near marthashof and another high-end development that attracted 500 people .
his event capped a week of demonstrations across berlin by mostly left-wing groups who say they are against the rapid development and reconstruction of the city .
during the protests , at least 30 cars were set ablaze . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more up-market housing going up " new people are moving here from abroad or other parts of germany and driving out people who 've lived here 40 or 50 years , " he said .
" that 's not fair and it makes me very angry . "
and while once the gentrification seemed limited to central neighborhoods such as prenzlauer berg and mitte , it 's spreading , said andrej holm , a professor at berlin 's humbolt university who studies gentrification .
that is what is causing the anger to rise .
as people were priced out of one neighborhood , they would move .
but often the gentrification wave would follow , forcing them to move again .
now , neighborhoods that were usually seen as immune to the process , and have been long-time enclaves of ethnic communities or artists and bohemians , are attracting professionals who are tired of the boutiques and bars , and are looking for something more " authentic . "
problem is , say researchers , that the lattes , renovations and higher rents are n't usually very far behind .
keeping the mix according to holm , city governments have several instruments that can keep neighborhoods on their way up from losing their diversity , such as rent control mechanisms or the construction of new social housing , even in gentrified neighborhoods .
but he said berlin has generally abandoned these tools , particularly when it comes to low-rent housing .
" in the few lots where there is still space for construction , only things like luxury townhouses and gated communities are going up , " he said .
" the city seems to think if we increase the number of high-end apartments , it can attract the kind of people that will also improve berlin 's economic situation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gentrification wave is expected to eventually hit even areas like berlin 's neukölln district but while the upper-income influx might lift a few economic boats in berlin , it could strand people like claudia hering , who along with mario feist is part of a citizens ' initiative called aim which wants changes to the marthashof development .
" we are afraid that in two or three years we wo n't be able to live here anymore , " she said .
but would she even want to ?
according to researcher seidel-schuelze , gentrification often makes people want to leave their own neighborhoods , no matter what their history there .
not only can they perhaps no longer afford it , the new look and feel can make the place not seem like home anymore .
" i know some people who used to live -lrb- in prenzlauer berg -rrb- in the gdr and they say it 's not my district anymore and i do n't want to be with these new dinks - double income , no kids people , " she said .

trade union critics say that the social market economy is not working so well anymore for germany .
older generations nostalgic for the d-mark that marked the post-war economic boom , blame the euro for inflation . sixty years ago this friday , june 20 , the allied powers introduced a new currency , the d-mark , which became the basis of social market economy that led to the federal republic of germany 's wirtschaftswunder or economic miracle in the 1950s .
but the combination of free market dynamics with a wide social net that had served germany so well in the post-war period , is “ facing a deep legitimacy crisis ” , said michael sommer , head of the confederation of german unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- , an umbrella trade union organization in an interview with the newspaper berliner zeitung .
since the middle of the 1990s , real wages have hardly gone up , with every fifth worker barely earning enough at a subsistence level , added sommer .
“ social mobility still remains an illusion for the majority of single parents , long term unemployed and immigrant groups , ” he said lashing out at big multi-national companies that put short term gains and profits ahead of a long term strategy that preserves jobs and benefits .
euro blamed for inflation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumers feel their euro is not stretching far enough with massive job cuts underway at big dax companies such as deutsche telekom and siemens , as well as general cost of living increases , many germans are feeling the pinch and blame the euro , the common eu currency introduced nearly a decade ago for inflation .
more than a third of germans would even like to have their d-mark back , according to a representative survey by the association of german banks -lrb- bdb -rrb- published friday .
when asked whether they would like to have the old national currency back to replace the euro , fully one-third of 34 respondents answered “ yes . ”
in january 1999 , the switch to the euro for 11 eu member states took place electronically , although the notes and coins were introduced three years later .
inflation has nothing to do with the euro bildunterschrift : in the post-war decades , the d-mark provided a sense of economic well-being .
the main reason for wanting the deutsche mark back was the perception that the euro was responsible for rising prices , an argument that bdb rejected saying that current inflation had everything to do with higher energy and food prices and nothing to do with the euro .
the bdb also pointed out that inflation in the euro zone over the past 10 years had even remained fairly moderate .
" since the start of currency union , inflation has , at 2 percent a year on average , been relatively limited , " said bdb chairman manfred weber .
" in this connection , the euro is one of the most stable currencies overall . ”
weber said the currency now provided a firm basis for growth in the euro zone , which has now grown to 15 members , since the eastward expansion of the eu in 2004 .
britain , which still maintains the pound sterling , is the only major eu country that has not joined the euro zone .
eu leaders have just decided at their current summit in brussels that slovakia will become the 16th member country to introduce the euro in 2009 .
older germans still think in terms of d-marks despite the bdb 's confidence in the euro , nearly half of all germans , especially elder generations who feel nostalgic for the d-mark , still calculate in the old currency , according to frankfurt psychologist and university professor henning haase .
converting to d-marks is also relatively easy since one euro was roughly two deutsche marks .
" particularly in times of higher inflation , many people long for the return of the d-mark , " haase said , but added that that while an inflation rate of 3.1 percent is now perceived as high , inflation had " the deutsche mark is still firmly anchored in many minds as a stable currency , " he said . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

trade union critics say that the social market economy is not working so well anymore for germany .
older generations nostalgic for the d-mark that marked the post-war economic boom , blame the euro for inflation . sixty years ago this friday , june 20 , the allied powers introduced a new currency , the d-mark , which became the basis of social market economy that led to the federal republic of germany 's wirtschaftswunder or economic miracle in the 1950s .
but the combination of free market dynamics with a wide social net that had served germany so well in the post-war period , is “ facing a deep legitimacy crisis ” , said michael sommer , head of the confederation of german unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- , an umbrella trade union organization in an interview with the newspaper berliner zeitung .
since the middle of the 1990s , real wages have hardly gone up , with every fifth worker barely earning enough at a subsistence level , added sommer .
“ social mobility still remains an illusion for the majority of single parents , long term unemployed and immigrant groups , ” he said lashing out at big multi-national companies that put short term gains and profits ahead of a long term strategy that preserves jobs and benefits .
euro blamed for inflation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumers feel their euro is not stretching far enough with massive job cuts underway at big dax companies such as deutsche telekom and siemens , as well as general cost of living increases , many germans are feeling the pinch and blame the euro , the common eu currency introduced nearly a decade ago for inflation .
more than a third of germans would even like to have their d-mark back , according to a representative survey by the association of german banks -lrb- bdb -rrb- published friday .
when asked whether they would like to have the old national currency back to replace the euro , fully one-third of 34 respondents answered “ yes . ”
in january 1999 , the switch to the euro for 11 eu member states took place electronically , although the notes and coins were introduced three years later .
inflation has nothing to do with the euro bildunterschrift : in the post-war decades , the d-mark provided a sense of economic well-being .
the main reason for wanting the deutsche mark back was the perception that the euro was responsible for rising prices , an argument that bdb rejected saying that current inflation had everything to do with higher energy and food prices and nothing to do with the euro .
the bdb also pointed out that inflation in the euro zone over the past 10 years had even remained fairly moderate .
" since the start of currency union , inflation has , at 2 percent a year on average , been relatively limited , " said bdb chairman manfred weber .
" in this connection , the euro is one of the most stable currencies overall . ”
weber said the currency now provided a firm basis for growth in the euro zone , which has now grown to 15 members , since the eastward expansion of the eu in 2004 .
britain , which still maintains the pound sterling , is the only major eu country that has not joined the euro zone .
eu leaders have just decided at their current summit in brussels that slovakia will become the 16th member country to introduce the euro in 2009 .
older germans still think in terms of d-marks despite the bdb 's confidence in the euro , nearly half of all germans , especially elder generations who feel nostalgic for the d-mark , still calculate in the old currency , according to frankfurt psychologist and university professor henning haase .
converting to d-marks is also relatively easy since one euro was roughly two deutsche marks .
" particularly in times of higher inflation , many people long for the return of the d-mark , " haase said , but added that that while an inflation rate of 3.1 percent is now perceived as high , inflation had " the deutsche mark is still firmly anchored in many minds as a stable currency , " he said . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the university in germany 's bavaria state has about 4,500 students and teaches regular arts , science and business courses .
this week , the bishop , with express backing from other bavarian bishops , also suspended the university 's administrative head and appointed two temporary new chiefs , saying a fresh start was needed .
refuge of faith bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavaria 's most famous son whereas the church sees its university as a refuge of faith in a nation that is increasingly hostile to religion , professors have painted the struggle as a battle for academic liberty and autonomy , as claimed by universities around the globe .
interest in the dispute has been heightened by the fact that pope benedict xvi is a bavarian and was a formerly a professor in the state , at a different university , regensburg .
the vatican has not spoken out about the row .
unlike at theology colleges , students do not have to be catholic to attend ku .
as at most german state universities , the tuition fees are minimal compared to those in most western nations .
irreconcilable differences to some , the row brings back memories of the vatican 's desire in 1979 to remove the dissident swiss-born theologian hans kueng from his professor-of-theology post at the german university of tuebingen .
however the man at the center of the latest tussle , ulrich hemel , is not a theologian but a business executive whose main academic subject has been the religious formation of children .
hemel was chosen by eichstaett professors to become " president , " a german university 's top academic official , earlier this year , but bishop hanke flatly refused to bless hemel 's appointment and certification needed by hemel from the vatican never arrived .
newspapers speculated that the bishop was disturbed by the fact that hemel had been married three times , but whatever the origin , it is clear that the bishop and hemel have an irreconcilable antipathy .
the bishop 's stated objections to hemel include an accusation that hemel blabbed to the media after they talked .
the catholic newspaper tagespost quoted bishop hanke , who is grand chancellor , or ceremonial chief of the university , saying hemel had never been a full professor and had no recent scholarly publications .
uniquely german bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bischop gregor maria hanke there are catholic universities in the united states , but ku , founded in 1980 , has a uniquely german form of government .
the university , with most of its campus in the bavarian town of eichstaett and a business school in the bigger industrial city of ingolstadt , is mainly funded by the state of bavaria , with the state 's bishops contributing 15 per cent of the budget .
the row has escalated , with suggestions of intrigue and plots rattling the provincial calm at eichstaett .
the conflict reached a head with two senior academics resigning and a bitter joint open letter last week from students and senior professors attacking the " unprecedented " church interference .
professors , who have life tenure and huge power in the german university system , often argue that academic research should be driven by a scholar 's interests rather than the demands of society .
optimistic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many want to see the university become more catholic the bishop has ordered a financial audit of recent spending by the chief executive , gottfried von der heydte , who shared control of the university with its president .
the bishop said he would not make his suspicions public .
tv news crews filmed the grey-suited auditors arriving , sending away von der heydte 's assistants and staying late into the night to search computer and paper files .
professors received letters forbidding them to speak with von der heydte .
bishop hanke said the route out of the conflict was the installation of two outside , neutral academics who would be tasked from july 1 with overseeing a fresh start .
" this is like a marital conflict , " he said .
" it 's best to get a third party to help you . "
the munich newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung said the academic credentials of the two trouble-shooters chosen by the bishop , retired sociologist rudolf fisch and historian gert melville , had impressed some professors , so the duo might be able to bridge the differences .
on wednesday , the professors backed off from further conflict , issuing a joint statement that they were confident the new management would put the university back on the right track .
hanke also met this week for two hours with student leaders , who said both sides were optimistic about the university 's future .
bishop hanke , who took office in november 2006 , has said the trouble-shooters will oversee a hunt next year for a new president .
doctrinal issues have not been raised in the dispute , but the archbishop of munich , reinhard marx , indicated this week that bishops want the university to adopt a more catholic " character " in future . dpa news agency -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the university in germany 's bavaria state has about 4,500 students and teaches regular arts , science and business courses .
this week , the bishop , with express backing from other bavarian bishops , also suspended the university 's administrative head and appointed two temporary new chiefs , saying a fresh start was needed .
refuge of faith bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavaria 's most famous son whereas the church sees its university as a refuge of faith in a nation that is increasingly hostile to religion , professors have painted the struggle as a battle for academic liberty and autonomy , as claimed by universities around the globe .
interest in the dispute has been heightened by the fact that pope benedict xvi is a bavarian and was a formerly a professor in the state , at a different university , regensburg .
the vatican has not spoken out about the row .
unlike at theology colleges , students do not have to be catholic to attend ku .
as at most german state universities , the tuition fees are minimal compared to those in most western nations .
irreconcilable differences to some , the row brings back memories of the vatican 's desire in 1979 to remove the dissident swiss-born theologian hans kueng from his professor-of-theology post at the german university of tuebingen .
however the man at the center of the latest tussle , ulrich hemel , is not a theologian but a business executive whose main academic subject has been the religious formation of children .
hemel was chosen by eichstaett professors to become " president , " a german university 's top academic official , earlier this year , but bishop hanke flatly refused to bless hemel 's appointment and certification needed by hemel from the vatican never arrived .
newspapers speculated that the bishop was disturbed by the fact that hemel had been married three times , but whatever the origin , it is clear that the bishop and hemel have an irreconcilable antipathy .
the bishop 's stated objections to hemel include an accusation that hemel blabbed to the media after they talked .
the catholic newspaper tagespost quoted bishop hanke , who is grand chancellor , or ceremonial chief of the university , saying hemel had never been a full professor and had no recent scholarly publications .
uniquely german bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bischop gregor maria hanke there are catholic universities in the united states , but ku , founded in 1980 , has a uniquely german form of government .
the university , with most of its campus in the bavarian town of eichstaett and a business school in the bigger industrial city of ingolstadt , is mainly funded by the state of bavaria , with the state 's bishops contributing 15 per cent of the budget .
the row has escalated , with suggestions of intrigue and plots rattling the provincial calm at eichstaett .
the conflict reached a head with two senior academics resigning and a bitter joint open letter last week from students and senior professors attacking the " unprecedented " church interference .
professors , who have life tenure and huge power in the german university system , often argue that academic research should be driven by a scholar 's interests rather than the demands of society .
optimistic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many want to see the university become more catholic the bishop has ordered a financial audit of recent spending by the chief executive , gottfried von der heydte , who shared control of the university with its president .
the bishop said he would not make his suspicions public .
tv news crews filmed the grey-suited auditors arriving , sending away von der heydte 's assistants and staying late into the night to search computer and paper files .
professors received letters forbidding them to speak with von der heydte .
bishop hanke said the route out of the conflict was the installation of two outside , neutral academics who would be tasked from july 1 with overseeing a fresh start .
" this is like a marital conflict , " he said .
" it 's best to get a third party to help you . "
the munich newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung said the academic credentials of the two trouble-shooters chosen by the bishop , retired sociologist rudolf fisch and historian gert melville , had impressed some professors , so the duo might be able to bridge the differences .
on wednesday , the professors backed off from further conflict , issuing a joint statement that they were confident the new management would put the university back on the right track .
hanke also met this week for two hours with student leaders , who said both sides were optimistic about the university 's future .
bishop hanke , who took office in november 2006 , has said the trouble-shooters will oversee a hunt next year for a new president .
doctrinal issues have not been raised in the dispute , but the archbishop of munich , reinhard marx , indicated this week that bishops want the university to adopt a more catholic " character " in future . dpa news agency -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's part of the 2008 oerol festival , a site-specific experimental theater event .
the work " is a little bit like going back to the roots of my work .
so that is interesting for me , " said wilson .
in the 1970s , he produced " ka mountain and guardenia terrace , " a continuous seven-day silent play staged on a mountaintop in iran .
renowned for producing elaborate and evocative stage sets , exhibitions and installations , wilson 's works are noted for his use of very slow movement and extremes in space or time .
" walking " is a collaboration between wilson and two dutch artists , theun mosk and boukje schweigman , where festival participants walk at a slow pace through the striking landscape of terschelling 's pastures , woodlands , sand dunes and beaches .

slow music plays in the background .
finally , a field guide leads them out to a field and sets the pace for the remaining four-hour walk on the island .
clearly , " walking " pushes the boundaries of traditional theater .
it serves as a combination of both an interactive landscape installation and a theater production : the walkers are the actors and the landscape provides the backdrop scenery for the work .
experiencing time in a new way wilson said he was drawn immediately to the dramatic landscape on the island and wanted walkers to maintain a deliberately slow pace to heighten their observation during the walk .
" our perception is different if we take more time to do something , " said wilson .
" we begin to hear and see what is there in a different way .
we begin to smell things in a different way .
there is time to reflect . "
in the early 1970s he won international acclaim for " deafman glance , " a silent opera created in collaboration with raymond andrews , who is both deaf and mute .

it 's part of the 2008 oerol festival , a site-specific experimental theater event .
the work " is a little bit like going back to the roots of my work .
so that is interesting for me , " said wilson .
in the 1970s , he produced " ka mountain and guardenia terrace , " a continuous seven-day silent play staged on a mountaintop in iran .
renowned for producing elaborate and evocative stage sets , exhibitions and installations , wilson 's works are noted for his use of very slow movement and extremes in space or time .
" walking " is a collaboration between wilson and two dutch artists , theun mosk and boukje schweigman , where festival participants walk at a slow pace through the striking landscape of terschelling 's pastures , woodlands , sand dunes and beaches .
participants become the actors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilson is known for experimenting with extremes in time and space the walkers are asked to hand in their watches , phones , cameras , and any devices they may have that tell time , before they are taken to stand alone in a black box .
then they are guided to a large wooden room with a deep circle dug into the ground .
slow music plays in the background .
finally , a field guide leads them out to a field and sets the pace for the remaining four-hour walk on the island .
clearly , " walking " pushes the boundaries of traditional theater .
it serves as a combination of both an interactive landscape installation and a theater production : the walkers are the actors and the landscape provides the backdrop scenery for the work .
experiencing time in a new way wilson said he was drawn immediately to the dramatic landscape on the island and wanted walkers to maintain a deliberately slow pace to heighten their observation during the walk .
" our perception is different if we take more time to do something , " said wilson .
" we begin to hear and see what is there in a different way .
we begin to smell things in a different way .
there is time to reflect . "
in the early 1970s he won international acclaim for " deafman glance , " a silent opera created in collaboration with raymond andrews , who is both deaf and mute .
wilson worked together with composer philip glass on the opera " einstein on the beach . "

prague 's parliamentary ratification was suspended in late april as it was going through the lower chamber , after the senate demanded a constitutional court ruling on whether the treaty conforms with the czech constitution .
in addition to this obstacle , the czech republic 's eurosceptic president vaclav klaus has already insisted the irish vote had killed off the document , meant to help the eu operate more efficiently as it grows .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish premier brian cowen has a lot of explaining to do to make matters worse , a british court challenge for a referendum forced prime minister gordon brown to concede at the summit that the the treaty was invalid without a ruling .
" ratification will not take place of course until we have had the judgement , " he said .
a judge at london 's high court called on the british government to delay ratification until he ruled on a legal bid to force a referendum .
in the end , eu leaders agreed on friday to give ireland at least until october to come up with recommendations on the way ahead . in a final statement , the eu said although 19 member states have ratified the treaty , " more time was needed to analyse the situation . " merkel , sarkozy say no new members eu leaders also failed to find common ground on whether the bloc could still absorb new members after the treaty 's rejection by ireland . the reform charter was intended to make the enlargement process more manageable by streamlining the european union 's institutions .
the treaty is also meant to give the eu more clout on in foreign affairs after the large eastward expansion of the bloc since 2004 , when 12 new members joined . german chancellor angela merkel on friday backed president nicolas sarkozy 's call for the european union to forget about adding new members until it finds a solution to ireland 's rejection of an eu reform treaty . " without the lisbon treaty , there is no enlargement , " sarkozy , whose country assumes the eu 's rotating , six-month presidency on july 1 , said .

"
they have also long made it clear that they oppose turkey 's long-term membership aspirations . merkel said the eu 's existing institutional arrangements limited the size of the bloc to its current 27 members . " i agree because the nice treaty limited the -lrb- european -rrb- union to a membership of 27 states and for me it is unthinkable that we would change one area of the nice treaty without looking at the whole of the lisbon treaty , " she said in brussels . luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , the eu 's longest-serving leader , shared the view .

" one of the reasons for the lisbon treaty was the capacity to enlarge . " splits on enlargement but not everyone agreed with berlin and paris ' calls for a freeze on enlargement until the treaty riddle was solved .
the move is almost certain to affect turkey and croatia , who are currently negotiating their accession to the eu .

prague 's parliamentary ratification was suspended in late april as it was going through the lower chamber , after the senate demanded a constitutional court ruling on whether the treaty conforms with the czech constitution .

the munich newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung said the academic credentials of the two trouble-shooters chosen by the bishop , retired sociologist rudolf fisch and historian gert melville , had impressed some professors , so the duo might be able to bridge the differences .
on wednesday , the professors backed off from further conflict , issuing a joint statement that they were confident the new management would put the university back on the right track .
hanke also met this week for two hours with student leaders , who said both sides were optimistic about the university 's future .
bishop hanke , who took office in november 2006 , has said the trouble-shooters will oversee a hunt next year for a new president .
doctrinal issues have not been raised in the dispute , but the archbishop of munich , reinhard marx , indicated this week that bishops want the university to adopt a more catholic " character " in future . dpa news agency -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the caribbean country 's northern neighbor is bound to be angered by the move . the move is expected to place brussels and washington on a collision course and drew criticism from cuban dissidents .
the vote on thursday , june 19 , scrapped the sanctions that were imposed in 2003 , suspended in 2005 and are largely symbolic .
they include limits on high-level government visits and the role of eu diplomats in cuba 's cultural events and do not approach the hard line of the 46-year-old us sanctions , which include a trade and investment embargo .
" cosmetic changes " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has prohibited all exports to cuba since 1960 earlier thursday , a us state department spokesman said washington opposed any moves to ease sanctions on cuba , saying that reforms so far under new cuban president raul castro are " some very minor , cosmetic changes " that have fallen well short of ending decades of repressive policies under his brother , fidel castro .
the end of sanctions would give legitimacy to a dictatorial regime , deputy spokesman tom casey said , and countries should not signal that the " continued oppression of the cuban people is any more acceptable now than in the past . "
dissidents in cuba also objected to the lifting of the sanctions , charging the european union with being " hypocritical . "
" it gives me pain , and i 'm ashamed of governments that , far from promoting the democratic values under which they live , are made accomplices to one of the last dictatorships in the world , " vladimiro roca , one of cuba 's best known dissidents and leader of the illegal social democratic party , told dpa news agency .
encouraging reform although eu diplomats said the lifting of the sanctions was aimed at encouraging democratic reforms on cuba , the economist oscar espinosa , one of 75 dissidents whose 2003 arrests led to the eu sanctions , warned the move could harden the attitude of cuba 's communist government .
" it is worrisome because the lifting of the sanctions without something in return from cuba could have a very negative effect on cuba 's internal affairs , " espinosa said .
" it could send a signal to the hardline sectors of the government that it pays to be intransigent and inflexible . "
hypocritical as the european union ceased high-level contacts with cuba 's government in 2003 , it also increased its contacts with cuba 's dissidents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cuba is now expected to become more tolerant of dissidents but the sanctions were suspended in 2005 , and spain pushed to have them officially lifted after fidel castro withdrew as cuba 's leader and raul castro , who took over as president in february , implemented reforms , including giving unused state land to farmers and allowing ordinary cubans to use mobile phones , stay in tourist hotels and buy energy-consuming goods like dvd players and personal computers .
while the eu saw signs of liberalization in those moves , cuba 's dissidents said they have seen no change in the government 's treatment of the opposition .
for instance , of the 75 dissidents jailed in 2003 , 55 remain in custody .
the lifting of the sanctions " confirms once more that , with some notable exceptions , the eu is following a hypocritical policy exclusively concerned with its economic interests and not about cuba entering the circle of the democratic nations of the world , " said roca , who is a recipient of the eu 's sakharov prize for freedom of thought .
the czech republic and sweden have been reluctant to lift the sanctions and have demanded that cuba make progress in freeing political prisoners and implement other human rights concessions .

the caribbean country 's northern neighbor is bound to be angered by the move . the move is expected to place brussels and washington on a collision course and drew criticism from cuban dissidents .
the vote on thursday , june 19 , scrapped the sanctions that were imposed in 2003 , suspended in 2005 and are largely symbolic .
they include limits on high-level government visits and the role of eu diplomats in cuba 's cultural events and do not approach the hard line of the 46-year-old us sanctions , which include a trade and investment embargo .
" cosmetic changes " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has prohibited all exports to cuba since 1960 earlier thursday , a us state department spokesman said washington opposed any moves to ease sanctions on cuba , saying that reforms so far under new cuban president raul castro are " some very minor , cosmetic changes " that have fallen well short of ending decades of repressive policies under his brother , fidel castro .
the end of sanctions would give legitimacy to a dictatorial regime , deputy spokesman tom casey said , and countries should not signal that the " continued oppression of the cuban people is any more acceptable now than in the past . "
dissidents in cuba also objected to the lifting of the sanctions , charging the european union with being " hypocritical . "
" it gives me pain , and i 'm ashamed of governments that , far from promoting the democratic values under which they live , are made accomplices to one of the last dictatorships in the world , " vladimiro roca , one of cuba 's best known dissidents and leader of the illegal social democratic party , told dpa news agency .
encouraging reform although eu diplomats said the lifting of the sanctions was aimed at encouraging democratic reforms on cuba , the economist oscar espinosa , one of 75 dissidents whose 2003 arrests led to the eu sanctions , warned the move could harden the attitude of cuba 's communist government .
" it is worrisome because the lifting of the sanctions without something in return from cuba could have a very negative effect on cuba 's internal affairs , " espinosa said .
" it could send a signal to the hardline sectors of the government that it pays to be intransigent and inflexible . "
hypocritical as the european union ceased high-level contacts with cuba 's government in 2003 , it also increased its contacts with cuba 's dissidents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cuba is now expected to become more tolerant of dissidents but the sanctions were suspended in 2005 , and spain pushed to have them officially lifted after fidel castro withdrew as cuba 's leader and raul castro , who took over as president in february , implemented reforms , including giving unused state land to farmers and allowing ordinary cubans to use mobile phones , stay in tourist hotels and buy energy-consuming goods like dvd players and personal computers .
while the eu saw signs of liberalization in those moves , cuba 's dissidents said they have seen no change in the government 's treatment of the opposition .
for instance , of the 75 dissidents jailed in 2003 , 55 remain in custody .
the lifting of the sanctions " confirms once more that , with some notable exceptions , the eu is following a hypocritical policy exclusively concerned with its economic interests and not about cuba entering the circle of the democratic nations of the world , " said roca , who is a recipient of the eu 's sakharov prize for freedom of thought .
the czech republic and sweden have been reluctant to lift the sanctions and have demanded that cuba make progress in freeing political prisoners and implement other human rights concessions .

" i do n't think we will have any solutions on the table in october , " said martin .
european commission president jose manuel barroso , german chancellor angela merkel and european parliament president hans-gert poettering had been among those calling for a rapid solution to the crisis at the start of a two-day eu summit in brussels .
" we both agreed that the next meeting of the european council -lrb- of national leaders -rrb- in october will be an appropriate occasion for further discussion on this matter , " barroso said after holding crisis talks with irish premier brian cowen ahead of the meeting .
but he also warned that adapting the treaty would be " extremely difficult . "
the lisbon treaty , which replaces the doomed nice treaty and was only approved by eu leaders last december after years of wrangling , is designed to improve the decision-making process of an institution that now has 27 member states .
it also gives the european parliament a greater say .
will europe be paralyzed again ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament president wanted a rapid solution urging cowen to come up with solutions and calling on all sides to show " understanding and flexibility " , poettering warned that , with the possible exception of croatia , the eu would not be able to accommodate more countries until the new treaty came into effect .
france , which takes over the rotating presidency of the eu from slovenia on july 1 , is also among those nations particularly keen to see a rapid resolution to the problem .
its president , nicolas sarkozy , was reported as saying ahead of his arrival in brussels that he would ask ireland to hold a second referendum on the treaty .
" we will not touch the lisbon treaty , because if we do we will have to start from zero , " one advisor to the french government said .
as well enjoying backing from the german government , france has the support of denmark , with prime minister anders fogh rasmussen calling on the treaty to come into force by april 2009 , so as to allow the next european parliament to be elected in june according to the new rules .
czech republic is also resisting quick fixes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one knows quite how to respond to the irish no-vote among those who oppose talk of an irish " road map " solution being submitted at the eu 's next summit on october 15-16 is the czech republic , where the eu treaty has been placed under review by its constitutional court .
" do n't put any pressure on anybody , " czech deputy prime minister for european affairs alexandr vondra said .
" we do n't need a long reflection period , but we wo n't fix the problem during this meeting , " acknowledged slovenian prime minister janez jansa at the start of the bloc 's regular summer meeting .
overshadowing other key matters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : back in december , eu leaders thought they 'd made a breakthrough the institutional crisis overshadowed efforts by eu leaders to address pressing matters , such as surging oil and food prices .
jansa said he shared citizens ' concerns that the eu should not re-enter a long period of institutional navel-gazing , saying the summit 's agenda had not changed as a result of the irish no .
" that is why i did not change the agenda , so we will deal heavily with soaring oil and food prices and set some short , medium and long-term goals , " jansa said .
however , concrete answers to these problems also looked remote , president nicolas sarkozy 's call for fuel tax to be capped was dismissed by the leaders of germany , sweden , denmark , as well as the eu 's energy commissioner , ahead of the summit .
this was the first time that eu leaders met to discuss the fallout caused by the june 12 referendum , in which a majority of irish voters said no to the lisbon treaty . dpa news agency -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but as high-end development spreads , some are saying : enough .
they fear berlin 's character could be irrevocably changed . mario feist remembers that there used to be bakeries and small grocery shops in the oderberger strasse when he first moved there in 1989 .
today , it is much easier to get a latte macchiato or a 150-euro shirt outside his front door than a loaf of bread or carton of milk .
he has watched as his street has been transformed from a dreary road marked by crumbling facades to a hip thoroughfare of renovated buildings , expensive boutiques and trendy cafés , whose sidewalks often resemble a fashion catwalk on sunny weekends .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marthashof sales office offers homes for the high-end client it 's a metamorphosis that he 's not completely comfortable with , especially since it could take on a whole new dimension once the 12,000-square-meter development of luxury apartments being constructed just outside his back window is completed .
called marthashof , it will house around 500 people , and since the square meter price for the townhouses starts at 3,000 euros , the large influx into the neighborhood will be quite well off .
" it could become a very sterile place just for rich people and not the kind of place i 'd want to live , " he said .
" i want to have different kinds of people here . "
expanding wave his concerns are not his alone .
as berlin 's gentrification process spreads to encompass more and more neighborhoods , people are beginning to push back at what they see as a danger to a vibrant , diverse city of neighborhoods featuring people of different social and economic backgrounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an unrenovated and renovated building side by side on oderberger strasse in some neighborhoods , like feist 's prenzlauer berg , gentrification has been happening for years .
but as berlin continues to pull in more investment and its international reputation attracts more wealthy people , the neighborhood has seen a construction boom in luxury apartments and townhouses , which , in comparison to london , new york or paris , can still be had on the cheap .
the fears are that as more wealthy people move in to an area , their up-market tastes will be reflected in businesses that set up shop and rents will go up , pricing out lower and middle-income people .
feist said he 's already seen it happen in his street , when a greek restaurateur was forced to move out after his rent was tripled when the building housing his eatery changed hands .
" gentrification is not a good or bad thing in itself , " said antje seidel-schuelze , a researcher at the german institute of urban affairs .
" in one way , the districts where it happens become better .
but long-established people in a neighborhood are often replaced by wealthier people .
that leads to a certain homogeneity . "
same old same it 's that threat of sameness that riles patrik technau , a 23-year-old student and prenzlauer berg native who recently organized a protest rally near marthashof and another high-end development that attracted 500 people .
his event capped a week of demonstrations across berlin by mostly left-wing groups who say they are against the rapid development and reconstruction of the city .
during the protests , at least 30 cars were set ablaze . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more up-market housing going up " new people are moving here from abroad or other parts of germany and driving out people who 've lived here 40 or 50 years , " he said .
" that 's not fair and it makes me very angry . "
and while once the gentrification seemed limited to central neighborhoods such as prenzlauer berg and mitte , it 's spreading , said andrej holm , a professor at berlin 's humbolt university who studies gentrification .
that is what is causing the anger to rise .
as people were priced out of one neighborhood , they would move .
but often the gentrification wave would follow , forcing them to move again .
now , neighborhoods that were usually seen as immune to the process , and have been long-time enclaves of ethnic communities or artists and bohemians , are attracting professionals who are tired of the boutiques and bars , and are looking for something more " authentic . "
problem is , say researchers , that the lattes , renovations and higher rents are n't usually very far behind .
keeping the mix according to holm , city governments have several instruments that can keep neighborhoods on their way up from losing their diversity , such as rent control mechanisms or the construction of new social housing , even in gentrified neighborhoods .
but he said berlin has generally abandoned these tools , particularly when it comes to low-rent housing .
" in the few lots where there is still space for construction , only things like luxury townhouses and gated communities are going up , " he said .
" the city seems to think if we increase the number of high-end apartments , it can attract the kind of people that will also improve berlin 's economic situation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gentrification wave is expected to eventually hit even areas like berlin 's neukölln district but while the upper-income influx might lift a few economic boats in berlin , it could strand people like claudia hering , who along with mario feist is part of a citizens ' initiative called aim which wants changes to the marthashof development .
" we are afraid that in two or three years we wo n't be able to live here anymore , " she said .
but would she even want to ?
according to researcher seidel-schuelze , gentrification often makes people want to leave their own neighborhoods , no matter what their history there .
not only can they perhaps no longer afford it , the new look and feel can make the place not seem like home anymore .
" i know some people who used to live -lrb- in prenzlauer berg -rrb- in the gdr and they say it 's not my district anymore and i do n't want to be with these new dinks - double income , no kids people , " she said .

they fear berlin 's character could be irrevocably changed . mario feist remembers that there used to be bakeries and small grocery shops in the oderberger strasse when he first moved there in 1989 .
today , it is much easier to get a latte macchiato or a 150-euro shirt outside his front door than a loaf of bread or carton of milk .
he has watched as his street has been transformed from a dreary road marked by crumbling facades to a hip thoroughfare of renovated buildings , expensive boutiques and trendy cafés , whose sidewalks often resemble a fashion catwalk on sunny weekends .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marthashof sales office offers homes for the high-end client it 's a metamorphosis that he 's not completely comfortable with , especially since it could take on a whole new dimension once the 12,000-square-meter development of luxury apartments being constructed just outside his back window is completed .
called marthashof , it will house around 500 people , and since the square meter price for the townhouses starts at 3,000 euros , the large influx into the neighborhood will be quite well off .
" it could become a very sterile place just for rich people and not the kind of place i 'd want to live , " he said .
" i want to have different kinds of people here . "
expanding wave his concerns are not his alone .
as berlin 's gentrification process spreads to encompass more and more neighborhoods , people are beginning to push back at what they see as a danger to a vibrant , diverse city of neighborhoods featuring people of different social and economic backgrounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an unrenovated and renovated building side by side on oderberger strasse in some neighborhoods , like feist 's prenzlauer berg , gentrification has been happening for years .
but as berlin continues to pull in more investment and its international reputation attracts more wealthy people , the neighborhood has seen a construction boom in luxury apartments and townhouses , which , in comparison to london , new york or paris , can still be had on the cheap .
the fears are that as more wealthy people move in to an area , their up-market tastes will be reflected in businesses that set up shop and rents will go up , pricing out lower and middle-income people .
feist said he 's already seen it happen in his street , when a greek restaurateur was forced to move out after his rent was tripled when the building housing his eatery changed hands .
" gentrification is not a good or bad thing in itself , " said antje seidel-schuelze , a researcher at the german institute of urban affairs .
" in one way , the districts where it happens become better .
but long-established people in a neighborhood are often replaced by wealthier people .
that leads to a certain homogeneity . "
same old same it 's that threat of sameness that riles patrik technau , a 23-year-old student and prenzlauer berg native who recently organized a protest rally near marthashof and another high-end development that attracted 500 people .
his event capped a week of demonstrations across berlin by mostly left-wing groups who say they are against the rapid development and reconstruction of the city .
during the protests , at least 30 cars were set ablaze . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more up-market housing going up " new people are moving here from abroad or other parts of germany and driving out people who 've lived here 40 or 50 years , " he said .
" that 's not fair and it makes me very angry . "
and while once the gentrification seemed limited to central neighborhoods such as prenzlauer berg and mitte , it 's spreading , said andrej holm , a professor at berlin 's humbolt university who studies gentrification .
that is what is causing the anger to rise .
as people were priced out of one neighborhood , they would move .
but often the gentrification wave would follow , forcing them to move again .
now , neighborhoods that were usually seen as immune to the process , and have been long-time enclaves of ethnic communities or artists and bohemians , are attracting professionals who are tired of the boutiques and bars , and are looking for something more " authentic . "
problem is , say researchers , that the lattes , renovations and higher rents are n't usually very far behind .
keeping the mix according to holm , city governments have several instruments that can keep neighborhoods on their way up from losing their diversity , such as rent control mechanisms or the construction of new social housing , even in gentrified neighborhoods .
but he said berlin has generally abandoned these tools , particularly when it comes to low-rent housing .
" in the few lots where there is still space for construction , only things like luxury townhouses and gated communities are going up , " he said .
" the city seems to think if we increase the number of high-end apartments , it can attract the kind of people that will also improve berlin 's economic situation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gentrification wave is expected to eventually hit even areas like berlin 's neukölln district but while the upper-income influx might lift a few economic boats in berlin , it could strand people like claudia hering , who along with mario feist is part of a citizens ' initiative called aim which wants changes to the marthashof development .
" we are afraid that in two or three years we wo n't be able to live here anymore , " she said .
but would she even want to ?
according to researcher seidel-schuelze , gentrification often makes people want to leave their own neighborhoods , no matter what their history there .
not only can they perhaps no longer afford it , the new look and feel can make the place not seem like home anymore .
" i know some people who used to live -lrb- in prenzlauer berg -rrb- in the gdr and they say it 's not my district anymore and i do n't want to be with these new dinks - double income , no kids people , " she said .

now , neighborhoods that were usually seen as immune to the process , and have been long-time enclaves of ethnic communities or artists and bohemians , are attracting professionals who are tired of the boutiques and bars , and are looking for something more " authentic . "
problem is , say researchers , that the lattes , renovations and higher rents are n't usually very far behind .
keeping the mix according to holm , city governments have several instruments that can keep neighborhoods on their way up from losing their diversity , such as rent control mechanisms or the construction of new social housing , even in gentrified neighborhoods .
but he said berlin has generally abandoned these tools , particularly when it comes to low-rent housing .
" in the few lots where there is still space for construction , only things like luxury townhouses and gated communities are going up , " he said .
" the city seems to think if we increase the number of high-end apartments , it can attract the kind of people that will also improve berlin 's economic situation . "

" we are afraid that in two or three years we wo n't be able to live here anymore , " she said .

but as high-end development spreads , some are saying : enough .
they fear berlin 's character could be irrevocably changed . mario feist remembers that there used to be bakeries and small grocery shops in the oderberger strasse when he first moved there in 1989 .
today , it is much easier to get a latte macchiato or a 150-euro shirt outside his front door than a loaf of bread or carton of milk .
he has watched as his street has been transformed from a dreary road marked by crumbling facades to a hip thoroughfare of renovated buildings , expensive boutiques and trendy cafés , whose sidewalks often resemble a fashion catwalk on sunny weekends .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marthashof sales office offers homes for the high-end client it 's a metamorphosis that he 's not completely comfortable with , especially since it could take on a whole new dimension once the 12,000-square-meter development of luxury apartments being constructed just outside his back window is completed .
called marthashof , it will house around 500 people , and since the square meter price for the townhouses starts at 3,000 euros , the large influx into the neighborhood will be quite well off .
" it could become a very sterile place just for rich people and not the kind of place i 'd want to live , " he said .
" i want to have different kinds of people here . "
expanding wave his concerns are not his alone .
as berlin 's gentrification process spreads to encompass more and more neighborhoods , people are beginning to push back at what they see as a danger to a vibrant , diverse city of neighborhoods featuring people of different social and economic backgrounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an unrenovated and renovated building side by side on oderberger strasse in some neighborhoods , like feist 's prenzlauer berg , gentrification has been happening for years .
but as berlin continues to pull in more investment and its international reputation attracts more wealthy people , the neighborhood has seen a construction boom in luxury apartments and townhouses , which , in comparison to london , new york or paris , can still be had on the cheap .
the fears are that as more wealthy people move in to an area , their up-market tastes will be reflected in businesses that set up shop and rents will go up , pricing out lower and middle-income people .
feist said he 's already seen it happen in his street , when a greek restaurateur was forced to move out after his rent was tripled when the building housing his eatery changed hands .
" gentrification is not a good or bad thing in itself , " said antje seidel-schuelze , a researcher at the german institute of urban affairs .
" in one way , the districts where it happens become better .
but long-established people in a neighborhood are often replaced by wealthier people .
that leads to a certain homogeneity . "
same old same it 's that threat of sameness that riles patrik technau , a 23-year-old student and prenzlauer berg native who recently organized a protest rally near marthashof and another high-end development that attracted 500 people .
his event capped a week of demonstrations across berlin by mostly left-wing groups who say they are against the rapid development and reconstruction of the city .
during the protests , at least 30 cars were set ablaze . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more up-market housing going up " new people are moving here from abroad or other parts of germany and driving out people who 've lived here 40 or 50 years , " he said .
" that 's not fair and it makes me very angry . "
and while once the gentrification seemed limited to central neighborhoods such as prenzlauer berg and mitte , it 's spreading , said andrej holm , a professor at berlin 's humbolt university who studies gentrification .
that is what is causing the anger to rise .
as people were priced out of one neighborhood , they would move .
but often the gentrification wave would follow , forcing them to move again .
now , neighborhoods that were usually seen as immune to the process , and have been long-time enclaves of ethnic communities or artists and bohemians , are attracting professionals who are tired of the boutiques and bars , and are looking for something more " authentic . "

" i do n't think we will have any solutions on the table in october , " said martin .
european commission president jose manuel barroso , german chancellor angela merkel and european parliament president hans-gert poettering had been among those calling for a rapid solution to the crisis at the start of a two-day eu summit in brussels .
" we both agreed that the next meeting of the european council -lrb- of national leaders -rrb- in october will be an appropriate occasion for further discussion on this matter , " barroso said after holding crisis talks with irish premier brian cowen ahead of the meeting .
but he also warned that adapting the treaty would be " extremely difficult . "
the lisbon treaty , which replaces the doomed nice treaty and was only approved by eu leaders last december after years of wrangling , is designed to improve the decision-making process of an institution that now has 27 member states .
it also gives the european parliament a greater say .
will europe be paralyzed again ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament president wanted a rapid solution urging cowen to come up with solutions and calling on all sides to show " understanding and flexibility " , poettering warned that , with the possible exception of croatia , the eu would not be able to accommodate more countries until the new treaty came into effect .
france , which takes over the rotating presidency of the eu from slovenia on july 1 , is also among those nations particularly keen to see a rapid resolution to the problem .
its president , nicolas sarkozy , was reported as saying ahead of his arrival in brussels that he would ask ireland to hold a second referendum on the treaty .
" we will not touch the lisbon treaty , because if we do we will have to start from zero , " one advisor to the french government said .
as well enjoying backing from the german government , france has the support of denmark , with prime minister anders fogh rasmussen calling on the treaty to come into force by april 2009 , so as to allow the next european parliament to be elected in june according to the new rules .

" do n't put any pressure on anybody , " czech deputy prime minister for european affairs alexandr vondra said .

" i do n't think we will have any solutions on the table in october , " said martin .
european commission president jose manuel barroso , german chancellor angela merkel and european parliament president hans-gert poettering had been among those calling for a rapid solution to the crisis at the start of a two-day eu summit in brussels .
" we both agreed that the next meeting of the european council -lrb- of national leaders -rrb- in october will be an appropriate occasion for further discussion on this matter , " barroso said after holding crisis talks with irish premier brian cowen ahead of the meeting .
but he also warned that adapting the treaty would be " extremely difficult . "
the lisbon treaty , which replaces the doomed nice treaty and was only approved by eu leaders last december after years of wrangling , is designed to improve the decision-making process of an institution that now has 27 member states .
it also gives the european parliament a greater say .

dw 's jochen kuerten caught up with him to find out what he thinks of today 's film industry . deutsche welle : your latest movie " ulzhan " was recently screened at the festival of german film in ludwigshafen , which tends to focus on work by newcomers .
were you pleased to be invited as an elder statesmen of german cinema ?
volker schloendorff : you bet !
when i was there i noticed that there 's a renewed interest in the concept of the auteur movie .
that was what we were all about , and this is a festival that specifically sets out to put german cinema on this path .
i think that 's wonderful .
all the good directors working at the moment , including tom tykwer and christian petzol , are auteur filmmakers .
you began making films in the 1960s and today you 're one of the most experienced directors in the country . how has life changed for directors ?
what 's it like starting out as a director these days ?
when i was making my first movie " young torless " in 1966 , television had n't even arrived .
the market for movies was vast , and audiences were hungry .
so when we showed up with our " new german cinema , " it was pounced upon . back then , millions of people would watch a movie that would be seen by barely 10,000 today .
so we got off to an excellent start .
but then came a long dry patch , and basically we were rescued by television .
these days there 's been an explosion in film making which makes life very , very hard .
up to 10 times as many movies are produced , especially in germany , and it 's all made easier by digital technology and the many film funds out there .
but it 's not easy to find audiences .
the theaters screen so much - twelve movies are launched every week .
it 's very competitive .
but there are far fewer cinemas these days .
this is an issue close to your heart , is n't it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : small cinemas are struggling to survive yes , i 'm like a missionary , constantly on the road .
recently i was at a conference for local cinemas because i do believe strongly that cinema should have a place in the community - especially in the small and medium-sized towns which are increasingly over-run with bars and supermarkets .
a cinema is a place where people can meet , communicate and share an experience .
there 's more to life than the sofa and the pub .
let 's look back at your career .
you once said in an interview that winning an oscar for „ the tin drum “ opened many doors for you , and that you would never have survived so long in the film industry without it .
did you mean that success is necessary to keep working ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the tin drum " won the 1979 academy award for best foreign language film yes , you need either a name or financial success .
acclaim alone gets you nowhere .
you need to have a few movies which have made the theaters , distributors and producers a lot of money so that they remain convinced that with you , they 're onto a winner .
i think that 's the way it works .
and if you have an oeuvre and your work has either won oscars or attracted large audiences such as " death of a salesman “ and " homo faber , “ then it 's easier to get through a dry patch and still get offers and have your calls returned .
what advice would you give young filmmakers today ?
is it worth heading to the us to make movies ?
it 's very worthwhile , because it 's such an intense experience .
some things need to be learnt first-hand .
you have to have been there , to have made two or three films and felt the cold winds of the free market in country which has no subsidies at all .

dw 's jochen kuerten caught up with him to find out what he thinks of today 's film industry . deutsche welle : your latest movie " ulzhan " was recently screened at the festival of german film in ludwigshafen , which tends to focus on work by newcomers .
were you pleased to be invited as an elder statesmen of german cinema ?
volker schloendorff : you bet !
when i was there i noticed that there 's a renewed interest in the concept of the auteur movie .
that was what we were all about , and this is a festival that specifically sets out to put german cinema on this path .
i think that 's wonderful .
all the good directors working at the moment , including tom tykwer and christian petzol , are auteur filmmakers .
you began making films in the 1960s and today you 're one of the most experienced directors in the country . how has life changed for directors ?
what 's it like starting out as a director these days ?
when i was making my first movie " young torless " in 1966 , television had n't even arrived .
the market for movies was vast , and audiences were hungry .
so when we showed up with our " new german cinema , " it was pounced upon . back then , millions of people would watch a movie that would be seen by barely 10,000 today .
so we got off to an excellent start .
but then came a long dry patch , and basically we were rescued by television .
these days there 's been an explosion in film making which makes life very , very hard .
up to 10 times as many movies are produced , especially in germany , and it 's all made easier by digital technology and the many film funds out there .
but it 's not easy to find audiences .
the theaters screen so much - twelve movies are launched every week .
it 's very competitive .
but there are far fewer cinemas these days .
this is an issue close to your heart , is n't it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : small cinemas are struggling to survive yes , i 'm like a missionary , constantly on the road .
recently i was at a conference for local cinemas because i do believe strongly that cinema should have a place in the community - especially in the small and medium-sized towns which are increasingly over-run with bars and supermarkets .
a cinema is a place where people can meet , communicate and share an experience .
there 's more to life than the sofa and the pub .
let 's look back at your career .
you once said in an interview that winning an oscar for „ the tin drum “ opened many doors for you , and that you would never have survived so long in the film industry without it .
did you mean that success is necessary to keep working ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the tin drum " won the 1979 academy award for best foreign language film yes , you need either a name or financial success .
acclaim alone gets you nowhere .
you need to have a few movies which have made the theaters , distributors and producers a lot of money so that they remain convinced that with you , they 're onto a winner .
i think that 's the way it works .
and if you have an oeuvre and your work has either won oscars or attracted large audiences such as " death of a salesman “ and " homo faber , “ then it 's easier to get through a dry patch and still get offers and have your calls returned .
what advice would you give young filmmakers today ?
is it worth heading to the us to make movies ?
it 's very worthwhile , because it 's such an intense experience .
some things need to be learnt first-hand .
you have to have been there , to have made two or three films and felt the cold winds of the free market in country which has no subsidies at all .

dw 's jochen kuerten caught up with him to find out what he thinks of today 's film industry . deutsche welle : your latest movie " ulzhan " was recently screened at the festival of german film in ludwigshafen , which tends to focus on work by newcomers .
were you pleased to be invited as an elder statesmen of german cinema ?
volker schloendorff : you bet !
when i was there i noticed that there 's a renewed interest in the concept of the auteur movie .
that was what we were all about , and this is a festival that specifically sets out to put german cinema on this path .
i think that 's wonderful .
all the good directors working at the moment , including tom tykwer and christian petzol , are auteur filmmakers .
you began making films in the 1960s and today you 're one of the most experienced directors in the country . how has life changed for directors ?
what 's it like starting out as a director these days ?
when i was making my first movie " young torless " in 1966 , television had n't even arrived .
the market for movies was vast , and audiences were hungry .
so when we showed up with our " new german cinema , " it was pounced upon . back then , millions of people would watch a movie that would be seen by barely 10,000 today .
so we got off to an excellent start .
but then came a long dry patch , and basically we were rescued by television .
these days there 's been an explosion in film making which makes life very , very hard .
up to 10 times as many movies are produced , especially in germany , and it 's all made easier by digital technology and the many film funds out there .
but it 's not easy to find audiences .
the theaters screen so much - twelve movies are launched every week .
it 's very competitive .
but there are far fewer cinemas these days .
this is an issue close to your heart , is n't it ?

recently i was at a conference for local cinemas because i do believe strongly that cinema should have a place in the community - especially in the small and medium-sized towns which are increasingly over-run with bars and supermarkets .
a cinema is a place where people can meet , communicate and share an experience .
there 's more to life than the sofa and the pub .
let 's look back at your career .
you once said in an interview that winning an oscar for „ the tin drum “ opened many doors for you , and that you would never have survived so long in the film industry without it .
did you mean that success is necessary to keep working ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the tin drum " won the 1979 academy award for best foreign language film yes , you need either a name or financial success .
acclaim alone gets you nowhere .
you need to have a few movies which have made the theaters , distributors and producers a lot of money so that they remain convinced that with you , they 're onto a winner .
i think that 's the way it works .
and if you have an oeuvre and your work has either won oscars or attracted large audiences such as " death of a salesman “ and " homo faber , “ then it 's easier to get through a dry patch and still get offers and have your calls returned .
what advice would you give young filmmakers today ?
is it worth heading to the us to make movies ?
it 's very worthwhile , because it 's such an intense experience .
some things need to be learnt first-hand .
you have to have been there , to have made two or three films and felt the cold winds of the free market in country which has no subsidies at all .
then you realize how mollycoddled we are here .
that can motivate you to make films that are provocative , striking and different .

intersport , the sporting goods group operating the official store in the vienna fan zone , sold 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 388,000 -rrb- worth of euro-related products last monday , spokesperson christian mann said .
business was higher than usual that day , because host austria was playing germany .
unexpected demand overall sales figures are hard to come by , as vendors ' agreements with uefa prevents them from releasing such information .
" demand is far higher than expected , " mann said .
intersport eybl , the part of the intersport that is uefa 's exclusive vending partner of sporting goods for the euro 2008 , expects revenues of " mid-level single-digit million euros , " another spokesperson said .
memorabilia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : image boosters inside the official vienna fan shop the other day , the atmosphere was busier than in the fan zone surrounding the store .
customers seemed to be interested mostly in buying t-shirts commemorating past games , as they were marked down to 5 euros .
but fans were also buying pricier items , like team jerseys or the official ball , store manager alexandra sallmann said .
" one would n't believe the things people are buying , " she said , pointing to little replicas of the henri delaunay trophy .
jerseys of teams that failed to move to the quarter-finals are already selling at half price , except for the austrian team colours .
the host 's t-shirts were still being bought , sallmann said .
image booster according to mann , the euro would be a financial " zero sum game " for austria 's largest sporting goods retailer .
the reason why costs would equal revenues was that intersport 's regular stores already started devoting part of their retail space for euro 2008 products last year , he said .
setting up the temporary store in the fan zone had cost as much as opening up a regular new store , he added .
" this is really about the image value , " mann said .
being seen as the exclusive sporting goods partner of the euro would help to build the brand and to expand it in the european market , where intersport shops have a share of 20 per cent .
special offers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stores are satisfied with sales at the billa supermarket chain , another official uefa sales partner , euro 2008 products have been marked down by 50 per cent since the kick-off of the championships .
in the small euro 2008 display area in a billa store in central vienna , soft toys of mascots trix and flix cost only 4,99 euros , compared with 20 euros in the fan zone store .
the discount was not due to slow demand , nor would the supply with merchandise be stopped , corporate spokesperson corinna tinkler said .
her company was " satisfied " with sales figures so far , she said .
the discounted merchandise was intended as an " additional bonus " for customers .
when asked whether her company would make a profit from selling products such as euro t-shirts and stationery , she said that it was " hard to say , " as the final accounting would be done after the championship finals .
but she also stressed that billa had chosen to become an official uefa partner because of the positive effect it had on the brand .

intersport , the sporting goods group operating the official store in the vienna fan zone , sold 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 388,000 -rrb- worth of euro-related products last monday , spokesperson christian mann said .
business was higher than usual that day , because host austria was playing germany .
unexpected demand overall sales figures are hard to come by , as vendors ' agreements with uefa prevents them from releasing such information .
" demand is far higher than expected , " mann said .
intersport eybl , the part of the intersport that is uefa 's exclusive vending partner of sporting goods for the euro 2008 , expects revenues of " mid-level single-digit million euros , " another spokesperson said .
memorabilia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : image boosters inside the official vienna fan shop the other day , the atmosphere was busier than in the fan zone surrounding the store .
customers seemed to be interested mostly in buying t-shirts commemorating past games , as they were marked down to 5 euros .
but fans were also buying pricier items , like team jerseys or the official ball , store manager alexandra sallmann said .
" one would n't believe the things people are buying , " she said , pointing to little replicas of the henri delaunay trophy .
jerseys of teams that failed to move to the quarter-finals are already selling at half price , except for the austrian team colours .
the host 's t-shirts were still being bought , sallmann said .
image booster according to mann , the euro would be a financial " zero sum game " for austria 's largest sporting goods retailer .
the reason why costs would equal revenues was that intersport 's regular stores already started devoting part of their retail space for euro 2008 products last year , he said .
setting up the temporary store in the fan zone had cost as much as opening up a regular new store , he added .
" this is really about the image value , " mann said .
being seen as the exclusive sporting goods partner of the euro would help to build the brand and to expand it in the european market , where intersport shops have a share of 20 per cent .

in the small euro 2008 display area in a billa store in central vienna , soft toys of mascots trix and flix cost only 4,99 euros , compared with 20 euros in the fan zone store .
the discount was not due to slow demand , nor would the supply with merchandise be stopped , corporate spokesperson corinna tinkler said .
her company was " satisfied " with sales figures so far , she said .
the discounted merchandise was intended as an " additional bonus " for customers .
when asked whether her company would make a profit from selling products such as euro t-shirts and stationery , she said that it was " hard to say , " as the final accounting would be done after the championship finals .
but she also stressed that billa had chosen to become an official uefa partner because of the positive effect it had on the brand .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 20.06.2008 study : racism in germany increasingly mainstream großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : racism is not confined to society 's margins , the study says according to a study commissioned by the friedrich ebert foundation , social prejudice is rife across the full spectrum of german society - ranging from a dislike of foreigners to a resentment of the unemployed . the report presented in berlin this week was the second part of a study begun in 2006 , which questioned 5,000 germans over 14 about their views of right-wing extremism and concluded that one in four germans holds xenophobic opinions .
drawing on interviews with 60 of the initial participants , the survey aimed to establish the roots of prejudice by examining attitudes among people of various ages , social background and profession .
" we were interested in finding out what determines an individual 's political opinions , be they far-right or democratic , " said project coordinator dietmar molthagen .
" for this reason , we set out to examine the interviewees ' opinions in the context of their lives , " said researcher oliver decker .
mainstream prejudice he and elmar braehler from leipzig university 's institute for clinical psychology and sociology said their work revealed that racism in germany is increasingly mainstream : in both eastern and western germany and across the generations , the public has little compunction about expressing far-right beliefs .
their conclusion is that the problem lies at the very center of society , undermining the theory that the breeding grounds for right-wing extremism are the parts of the country struck by unemployment and social decay .
37 percent of the population maintain that immigrants come to germany " to exploit the welfare state , " 39 percent think germany " is dangerously over-run with foreigners , " and 26 percent would like " a single , strong party that represents the german community . "
the main targets of german prejudice are turks and russians , who are seen as parasitical and grasping .
creature comforts bildunterschrift : prosperity and prejudice are closely intertwined however , researchers also identified the emergence of what they call " cultural racism " - prejudices against marginal groups such as the jobless and the socially disadvantaged .
this , the study suggested , reflected a strong pressure to conform to a perceived social norm and a condemnation of those who failed to do so .
with most of the participants saying they felt powerless to help define politics , the study also revealed a widespread disillusionment with democracy and democratic principles .
the findings suggested that most people supported democracy to the extent that it guaranteed personal prosperity , but in its absence , turned immediately to intolerance .
the researchers cited similar attitudes in the 1950s , when the economic miracle proved an obstacle to coming to terms with the past .
" the rapid accumulation of wealth in west germany -lsb- in the post-war years -rsb- left no scope for reflection and shame , " said researcher oliver decker . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de german film tackles racism through humor neo-nazism , racism and xenophobia are nothing new to cinema audiences , but tackling them through comedy is somewhat rare .

drawing on interviews with 60 of the initial participants , the survey aimed to establish the roots of prejudice by examining attitudes among people of various ages , social background and profession .

intersport , the sporting goods group operating the official store in the vienna fan zone , sold 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 388,000 -rrb- worth of euro-related products last monday , spokesperson christian mann said .
business was higher than usual that day , because host austria was playing germany .
unexpected demand overall sales figures are hard to come by , as vendors ' agreements with uefa prevents them from releasing such information .
" demand is far higher than expected , " mann said .
intersport eybl , the part of the intersport that is uefa 's exclusive vending partner of sporting goods for the euro 2008 , expects revenues of " mid-level single-digit million euros , " another spokesperson said .
memorabilia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : image boosters inside the official vienna fan shop the other day , the atmosphere was busier than in the fan zone surrounding the store .
customers seemed to be interested mostly in buying t-shirts commemorating past games , as they were marked down to 5 euros .
but fans were also buying pricier items , like team jerseys or the official ball , store manager alexandra sallmann said .
" one would n't believe the things people are buying , " she said , pointing to little replicas of the henri delaunay trophy .
jerseys of teams that failed to move to the quarter-finals are already selling at half price , except for the austrian team colours .
the host 's t-shirts were still being bought , sallmann said .
image booster according to mann , the euro would be a financial " zero sum game " for austria 's largest sporting goods retailer .
the reason why costs would equal revenues was that intersport 's regular stores already started devoting part of their retail space for euro 2008 products last year , he said .
setting up the temporary store in the fan zone had cost as much as opening up a regular new store , he added .
" this is really about the image value , " mann said .
being seen as the exclusive sporting goods partner of the euro would help to build the brand and to expand it in the european market , where intersport shops have a share of 20 per cent .
special offers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stores are satisfied with sales at the billa supermarket chain , another official uefa sales partner , euro 2008 products have been marked down by 50 per cent since the kick-off of the championships .
in the small euro 2008 display area in a billa store in central vienna , soft toys of mascots trix and flix cost only 4,99 euros , compared with 20 euros in the fan zone store .
the discount was not due to slow demand , nor would the supply with merchandise be stopped , corporate spokesperson corinna tinkler said .
her company was " satisfied " with sales figures so far , she said .
the discounted merchandise was intended as an " additional bonus " for customers .
when asked whether her company would make a profit from selling products such as euro t-shirts and stationery , she said that it was " hard to say , " as the final accounting would be done after the championship finals .
but she also stressed that billa had chosen to become an official uefa partner because of the positive effect it had on the brand .
another factor eating away at profits are the retailers ' advance costs for obtaining the right to become official uefa partners , several sources within the industry told deutsche presse-agentur dpa .

the caribbean country 's northern neighbor is bound to be angered by the move . the move is expected to place brussels and washington on a collision course and drew criticism from cuban dissidents .
the vote on thursday , june 19 , scrapped the sanctions that were imposed in 2003 , suspended in 2005 and are largely symbolic .
they include limits on high-level government visits and the role of eu diplomats in cuba 's cultural events and do not approach the hard line of the 46-year-old us sanctions , which include a trade and investment embargo .
" cosmetic changes " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has prohibited all exports to cuba since 1960 earlier thursday , a us state department spokesman said washington opposed any moves to ease sanctions on cuba , saying that reforms so far under new cuban president raul castro are " some very minor , cosmetic changes " that have fallen well short of ending decades of repressive policies under his brother , fidel castro .
the end of sanctions would give legitimacy to a dictatorial regime , deputy spokesman tom casey said , and countries should not signal that the " continued oppression of the cuban people is any more acceptable now than in the past . "
dissidents in cuba also objected to the lifting of the sanctions , charging the european union with being " hypocritical . "
" it gives me pain , and i 'm ashamed of governments that , far from promoting the democratic values under which they live , are made accomplices to one of the last dictatorships in the world , " vladimiro roca , one of cuba 's best known dissidents and leader of the illegal social democratic party , told dpa news agency .
encouraging reform although eu diplomats said the lifting of the sanctions was aimed at encouraging democratic reforms on cuba , the economist oscar espinosa , one of 75 dissidents whose 2003 arrests led to the eu sanctions , warned the move could harden the attitude of cuba 's communist government .
" it is worrisome because the lifting of the sanctions without something in return from cuba could have a very negative effect on cuba 's internal affairs , " espinosa said .
" it could send a signal to the hardline sectors of the government that it pays to be intransigent and inflexible . "
hypocritical as the european union ceased high-level contacts with cuba 's government in 2003 , it also increased its contacts with cuba 's dissidents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cuba is now expected to become more tolerant of dissidents but the sanctions were suspended in 2005 , and spain pushed to have them officially lifted after fidel castro withdrew as cuba 's leader and raul castro , who took over as president in february , implemented reforms , including giving unused state land to farmers and allowing ordinary cubans to use mobile phones , stay in tourist hotels and buy energy-consuming goods like dvd players and personal computers .
while the eu saw signs of liberalization in those moves , cuba 's dissidents said they have seen no change in the government 's treatment of the opposition .
for instance , of the 75 dissidents jailed in 2003 , 55 remain in custody .
the lifting of the sanctions " confirms once more that , with some notable exceptions , the eu is following a hypocritical policy exclusively concerned with its economic interests and not about cuba entering the circle of the democratic nations of the world , " said roca , who is a recipient of the eu 's sakharov prize for freedom of thought .
the czech republic and sweden have been reluctant to lift the sanctions and have demanded that cuba make progress in freeing political prisoners and implement other human rights concessions .

the caribbean country 's northern neighbor is bound to be angered by the move . the move is expected to place brussels and washington on a collision course and drew criticism from cuban dissidents .
the vote on thursday , june 19 , scrapped the sanctions that were imposed in 2003 , suspended in 2005 and are largely symbolic .
they include limits on high-level government visits and the role of eu diplomats in cuba 's cultural events and do not approach the hard line of the 46-year-old us sanctions , which include a trade and investment embargo .
" cosmetic changes " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has prohibited all exports to cuba since 1960 earlier thursday , a us state department spokesman said washington opposed any moves to ease sanctions on cuba , saying that reforms so far under new cuban president raul castro are " some very minor , cosmetic changes " that have fallen well short of ending decades of repressive policies under his brother , fidel castro .
the end of sanctions would give legitimacy to a dictatorial regime , deputy spokesman tom casey said , and countries should not signal that the " continued oppression of the cuban people is any more acceptable now than in the past . "
dissidents in cuba also objected to the lifting of the sanctions , charging the european union with being " hypocritical . "
" it gives me pain , and i 'm ashamed of governments that , far from promoting the democratic values under which they live , are made accomplices to one of the last dictatorships in the world , " vladimiro roca , one of cuba 's best known dissidents and leader of the illegal social democratic party , told dpa news agency .
encouraging reform although eu diplomats said the lifting of the sanctions was aimed at encouraging democratic reforms on cuba , the economist oscar espinosa , one of 75 dissidents whose 2003 arrests led to the eu sanctions , warned the move could harden the attitude of cuba 's communist government .
" it is worrisome because the lifting of the sanctions without something in return from cuba could have a very negative effect on cuba 's internal affairs , " espinosa said .
" it could send a signal to the hardline sectors of the government that it pays to be intransigent and inflexible . "
hypocritical as the european union ceased high-level contacts with cuba 's government in 2003 , it also increased its contacts with cuba 's dissidents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cuba is now expected to become more tolerant of dissidents but the sanctions were suspended in 2005 , and spain pushed to have them officially lifted after fidel castro withdrew as cuba 's leader and raul castro , who took over as president in february , implemented reforms , including giving unused state land to farmers and allowing ordinary cubans to use mobile phones , stay in tourist hotels and buy energy-consuming goods like dvd players and personal computers .
while the eu saw signs of liberalization in those moves , cuba 's dissidents said they have seen no change in the government 's treatment of the opposition .
for instance , of the 75 dissidents jailed in 2003 , 55 remain in custody .
the lifting of the sanctions " confirms once more that , with some notable exceptions , the eu is following a hypocritical policy exclusively concerned with its economic interests and not about cuba entering the circle of the democratic nations of the world , " said roca , who is a recipient of the eu 's sakharov prize for freedom of thought .
the czech republic and sweden have been reluctant to lift the sanctions and have demanded that cuba make progress in freeing political prisoners and implement other human rights concessions .

trade union critics say that the social market economy is not working so well anymore for germany .
older generations nostalgic for the d-mark that marked the post-war economic boom , blame the euro for inflation . sixty years ago this friday , june 20 , the allied powers introduced a new currency , the d-mark , which became the basis of social market economy that led to the federal republic of germany 's wirtschaftswunder or economic miracle in the 1950s .
but the combination of free market dynamics with a wide social net that had served germany so well in the post-war period , is “ facing a deep legitimacy crisis ” , said michael sommer , head of the confederation of german unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- , an umbrella trade union organization in an interview with the newspaper berliner zeitung .
since the middle of the 1990s , real wages have hardly gone up , with every fifth worker barely earning enough at a subsistence level , added sommer .
“ social mobility still remains an illusion for the majority of single parents , long term unemployed and immigrant groups , ” he said lashing out at big multi-national companies that put short term gains and profits ahead of a long term strategy that preserves jobs and benefits .
euro blamed for inflation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumers feel their euro is not stretching far enough with massive job cuts underway at big dax companies such as deutsche telekom and siemens , as well as general cost of living increases , many germans are feeling the pinch and blame the euro , the common eu currency introduced nearly a decade ago for inflation .
more than a third of germans would even like to have their d-mark back , according to a representative survey by the association of german banks -lrb- bdb -rrb- published friday .
when asked whether they would like to have the old national currency back to replace the euro , fully one-third of 34 respondents answered “ yes . ”
in january 1999 , the switch to the euro for 11 eu member states took place electronically , although the notes and coins were introduced three years later .
inflation has nothing to do with the euro bildunterschrift : in the post-war decades , the d-mark provided a sense of economic well-being .
the main reason for wanting the deutsche mark back was the perception that the euro was responsible for rising prices , an argument that bdb rejected saying that current inflation had everything to do with higher energy and food prices and nothing to do with the euro .
the bdb also pointed out that inflation in the euro zone over the past 10 years had even remained fairly moderate .
" since the start of currency union , inflation has , at 2 percent a year on average , been relatively limited , " said bdb chairman manfred weber .
" in this connection , the euro is one of the most stable currencies overall . ”
weber said the currency now provided a firm basis for growth in the euro zone , which has now grown to 15 members , since the eastward expansion of the eu in 2004 .
britain , which still maintains the pound sterling , is the only major eu country that has not joined the euro zone .
eu leaders have just decided at their current summit in brussels that slovakia will become the 16th member country to introduce the euro in 2009 .
older germans still think in terms of d-marks despite the bdb 's confidence in the euro , nearly half of all germans , especially elder generations who feel nostalgic for the d-mark , still calculate in the old currency , according to frankfurt psychologist and university professor henning haase .
converting to d-marks is also relatively easy since one euro was roughly two deutsche marks .
" particularly in times of higher inflation , many people long for the return of the d-mark , " haase said , but added that that while an inflation rate of 3.1 percent is now perceived as high , inflation had " the deutsche mark is still firmly anchored in many minds as a stable currency , " he said . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the combination of free market dynamics with a wide social net that had served germany so well in the post-war period , is “ facing a deep legitimacy crisis ” , said michael sommer , head of the confederation of german unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- , an umbrella trade union organization in an interview with the newspaper berliner zeitung .
since the middle of the 1990s , real wages have hardly gone up , with every fifth worker barely earning enough at a subsistence level , added sommer .
“ social mobility still remains an illusion for the majority of single parents , long term unemployed and immigrant groups , ” he said lashing out at big multi-national companies that put short term gains and profits ahead of a long term strategy that preserves jobs and benefits .
euro blamed for inflation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumers feel their euro is not stretching far enough with massive job cuts underway at big dax companies such as deutsche telekom and siemens , as well as general cost of living increases , many germans are feeling the pinch and blame the euro , the common eu currency introduced nearly a decade ago for inflation .
more than a third of germans would even like to have their d-mark back , according to a representative survey by the association of german banks -lrb- bdb -rrb- published friday .
when asked whether they would like to have the old national currency back to replace the euro , fully one-third of 34 respondents answered “ yes . ”
in january 1999 , the switch to the euro for 11 eu member states took place electronically , although the notes and coins were introduced three years later .
inflation has nothing to do with the euro bildunterschrift : in the post-war decades , the d-mark provided a sense of economic well-being .
the main reason for wanting the deutsche mark back was the perception that the euro was responsible for rising prices , an argument that bdb rejected saying that current inflation had everything to do with higher energy and food prices and nothing to do with the euro .
the bdb also pointed out that inflation in the euro zone over the past 10 years had even remained fairly moderate .
" since the start of currency union , inflation has , at 2 percent a year on average , been relatively limited , " said bdb chairman manfred weber .
" in this connection , the euro is one of the most stable currencies overall . ”
weber said the currency now provided a firm basis for growth in the euro zone , which has now grown to 15 members , since the eastward expansion of the eu in 2004 .
britain , which still maintains the pound sterling , is the only major eu country that has not joined the euro zone .
eu leaders have just decided at their current summit in brussels that slovakia will become the 16th member country to introduce the euro in 2009 .
older germans still think in terms of d-marks despite the bdb 's confidence in the euro , nearly half of all germans , especially elder generations who feel nostalgic for the d-mark , still calculate in the old currency , according to frankfurt psychologist and university professor henning haase .
converting to d-marks is also relatively easy since one euro was roughly two deutsche marks .
" particularly in times of higher inflation , many people long for the return of the d-mark , " haase said , but added that that while an inflation rate of 3.1 percent is now perceived as high , inflation had " the deutsche mark is still firmly anchored in many minds as a stable currency , " he said . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i do n't think we will have any solutions on the table in october , " said martin .
european commission president jose manuel barroso , german chancellor angela merkel and european parliament president hans-gert poettering had been among those calling for a rapid solution to the crisis at the start of a two-day eu summit in brussels .
" we both agreed that the next meeting of the european council -lrb- of national leaders -rrb- in october will be an appropriate occasion for further discussion on this matter , " barroso said after holding crisis talks with irish premier brian cowen ahead of the meeting .
but he also warned that adapting the treaty would be " extremely difficult . "
the lisbon treaty , which replaces the doomed nice treaty and was only approved by eu leaders last december after years of wrangling , is designed to improve the decision-making process of an institution that now has 27 member states .
it also gives the european parliament a greater say .

france , which takes over the rotating presidency of the eu from slovenia on july 1 , is also among those nations particularly keen to see a rapid resolution to the problem .
its president , nicolas sarkozy , was reported as saying ahead of his arrival in brussels that he would ask ireland to hold a second referendum on the treaty .
" we will not touch the lisbon treaty , because if we do we will have to start from zero , " one advisor to the french government said .
as well enjoying backing from the german government , france has the support of denmark , with prime minister anders fogh rasmussen calling on the treaty to come into force by april 2009 , so as to allow the next european parliament to be elected in june according to the new rules .

" do n't put any pressure on anybody , " czech deputy prime minister for european affairs alexandr vondra said .
" we do n't need a long reflection period , but we wo n't fix the problem during this meeting , " acknowledged slovenian prime minister janez jansa at the start of the bloc 's regular summer meeting .
overshadowing other key matters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : back in december , eu leaders thought they 'd made a breakthrough the institutional crisis overshadowed efforts by eu leaders to address pressing matters , such as surging oil and food prices .
jansa said he shared citizens ' concerns that the eu should not re-enter a long period of institutional navel-gazing , saying the summit 's agenda had not changed as a result of the irish no .
" that is why i did not change the agenda , so we will deal heavily with soaring oil and food prices and set some short , medium and long-term goals , " jansa said .
however , concrete answers to these problems also looked remote , president nicolas sarkozy 's call for fuel tax to be capped was dismissed by the leaders of germany , sweden , denmark , as well as the eu 's energy commissioner , ahead of the summit .
this was the first time that eu leaders met to discuss the fallout caused by the june 12 referendum , in which a majority of irish voters said no to the lisbon treaty . dpa news agency -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i do n't think we will have any solutions on the table in october , " said martin .
european commission president jose manuel barroso , german chancellor angela merkel and european parliament president hans-gert poettering had been among those calling for a rapid solution to the crisis at the start of a two-day eu summit in brussels .
" we both agreed that the next meeting of the european council -lrb- of national leaders -rrb- in october will be an appropriate occasion for further discussion on this matter , " barroso said after holding crisis talks with irish premier brian cowen ahead of the meeting .
but he also warned that adapting the treaty would be " extremely difficult . "
the lisbon treaty , which replaces the doomed nice treaty and was only approved by eu leaders last december after years of wrangling , is designed to improve the decision-making process of an institution that now has 27 member states .
it also gives the european parliament a greater say .
will europe be paralyzed again ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament president wanted a rapid solution urging cowen to come up with solutions and calling on all sides to show " understanding and flexibility " , poettering warned that , with the possible exception of croatia , the eu would not be able to accommodate more countries until the new treaty came into effect .
france , which takes over the rotating presidency of the eu from slovenia on july 1 , is also among those nations particularly keen to see a rapid resolution to the problem .
its president , nicolas sarkozy , was reported as saying ahead of his arrival in brussels that he would ask ireland to hold a second referendum on the treaty .
" we will not touch the lisbon treaty , because if we do we will have to start from zero , " one advisor to the french government said .
as well enjoying backing from the german government , france has the support of denmark , with prime minister anders fogh rasmussen calling on the treaty to come into force by april 2009 , so as to allow the next european parliament to be elected in june according to the new rules .
czech republic is also resisting quick fixes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one knows quite how to respond to the irish no-vote among those who oppose talk of an irish " road map " solution being submitted at the eu 's next summit on october 15-16 is the czech republic , where the eu treaty has been placed under review by its constitutional court .
" do n't put any pressure on anybody , " czech deputy prime minister for european affairs alexandr vondra said .
" we do n't need a long reflection period , but we wo n't fix the problem during this meeting , " acknowledged slovenian prime minister janez jansa at the start of the bloc 's regular summer meeting .
overshadowing other key matters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : back in december , eu leaders thought they 'd made a breakthrough the institutional crisis overshadowed efforts by eu leaders to address pressing matters , such as surging oil and food prices .
jansa said he shared citizens ' concerns that the eu should not re-enter a long period of institutional navel-gazing , saying the summit 's agenda had not changed as a result of the irish no .
" that is why i did not change the agenda , so we will deal heavily with soaring oil and food prices and set some short , medium and long-term goals , " jansa said .

trade union critics say that the social market economy is not working so well anymore for germany .
older generations nostalgic for the d-mark that marked the post-war economic boom , blame the euro for inflation . sixty years ago this friday , june 20 , the allied powers introduced a new currency , the d-mark , which became the basis of social market economy that led to the federal republic of germany 's wirtschaftswunder or economic miracle in the 1950s .
but the combination of free market dynamics with a wide social net that had served germany so well in the post-war period , is “ facing a deep legitimacy crisis ” , said michael sommer , head of the confederation of german unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- , an umbrella trade union organization in an interview with the newspaper berliner zeitung .
since the middle of the 1990s , real wages have hardly gone up , with every fifth worker barely earning enough at a subsistence level , added sommer .
“ social mobility still remains an illusion for the majority of single parents , long term unemployed and immigrant groups , ” he said lashing out at big multi-national companies that put short term gains and profits ahead of a long term strategy that preserves jobs and benefits .
euro blamed for inflation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumers feel their euro is not stretching far enough with massive job cuts underway at big dax companies such as deutsche telekom and siemens , as well as general cost of living increases , many germans are feeling the pinch and blame the euro , the common eu currency introduced nearly a decade ago for inflation .
more than a third of germans would even like to have their d-mark back , according to a representative survey by the association of german banks -lrb- bdb -rrb- published friday .
when asked whether they would like to have the old national currency back to replace the euro , fully one-third of 34 respondents answered “ yes . ”
in january 1999 , the switch to the euro for 11 eu member states took place electronically , although the notes and coins were introduced three years later .
inflation has nothing to do with the euro bildunterschrift : in the post-war decades , the d-mark provided a sense of economic well-being .
the main reason for wanting the deutsche mark back was the perception that the euro was responsible for rising prices , an argument that bdb rejected saying that current inflation had everything to do with higher energy and food prices and nothing to do with the euro .
the bdb also pointed out that inflation in the euro zone over the past 10 years had even remained fairly moderate .
" since the start of currency union , inflation has , at 2 percent a year on average , been relatively limited , " said bdb chairman manfred weber .
" in this connection , the euro is one of the most stable currencies overall . ”
weber said the currency now provided a firm basis for growth in the euro zone , which has now grown to 15 members , since the eastward expansion of the eu in 2004 .
britain , which still maintains the pound sterling , is the only major eu country that has not joined the euro zone .
eu leaders have just decided at their current summit in brussels that slovakia will become the 16th member country to introduce the euro in 2009 .
older germans still think in terms of d-marks despite the bdb 's confidence in the euro , nearly half of all germans , especially elder generations who feel nostalgic for the d-mark , still calculate in the old currency , according to frankfurt psychologist and university professor henning haase .
converting to d-marks is also relatively easy since one euro was roughly two deutsche marks .
" particularly in times of higher inflation , many people long for the return of the d-mark , " haase said , but added that that while an inflation rate of 3.1 percent is now perceived as high , inflation had " the deutsche mark is still firmly anchored in many minds as a stable currency , " he said . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the university in germany 's bavaria state has about 4,500 students and teaches regular arts , science and business courses .
this week , the bishop , with express backing from other bavarian bishops , also suspended the university 's administrative head and appointed two temporary new chiefs , saying a fresh start was needed .

interest in the dispute has been heightened by the fact that pope benedict xvi is a bavarian and was a formerly a professor in the state , at a different university , regensburg .
the vatican has not spoken out about the row .
unlike at theology colleges , students do not have to be catholic to attend ku .
as at most german state universities , the tuition fees are minimal compared to those in most western nations .
irreconcilable differences to some , the row brings back memories of the vatican 's desire in 1979 to remove the dissident swiss-born theologian hans kueng from his professor-of-theology post at the german university of tuebingen .
however the man at the center of the latest tussle , ulrich hemel , is not a theologian but a business executive whose main academic subject has been the religious formation of children .
hemel was chosen by eichstaett professors to become " president , " a german university 's top academic official , earlier this year , but bishop hanke flatly refused to bless hemel 's appointment and certification needed by hemel from the vatican never arrived .
newspapers speculated that the bishop was disturbed by the fact that hemel had been married three times , but whatever the origin , it is clear that the bishop and hemel have an irreconcilable antipathy .
the bishop 's stated objections to hemel include an accusation that hemel blabbed to the media after they talked .
the catholic newspaper tagespost quoted bishop hanke , who is grand chancellor , or ceremonial chief of the university , saying hemel had never been a full professor and had no recent scholarly publications .

the university , with most of its campus in the bavarian town of eichstaett and a business school in the bigger industrial city of ingolstadt , is mainly funded by the state of bavaria , with the state 's bishops contributing 15 per cent of the budget .
the row has escalated , with suggestions of intrigue and plots rattling the provincial calm at eichstaett .
the conflict reached a head with two senior academics resigning and a bitter joint open letter last week from students and senior professors attacking the " unprecedented " church interference .
professors , who have life tenure and huge power in the german university system , often argue that academic research should be driven by a scholar 's interests rather than the demands of society .

tv news crews filmed the grey-suited auditors arriving , sending away von der heydte 's assistants and staying late into the night to search computer and paper files .
professors received letters forbidding them to speak with von der heydte .
bishop hanke said the route out of the conflict was the installation of two outside , neutral academics who would be tasked from july 1 with overseeing a fresh start .
" this is like a marital conflict , " he said .
" it 's best to get a third party to help you . "
the munich newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung said the academic credentials of the two trouble-shooters chosen by the bishop , retired sociologist rudolf fisch and historian gert melville , had impressed some professors , so the duo might be able to bridge the differences .
on wednesday , the professors backed off from further conflict , issuing a joint statement that they were confident the new management would put the university back on the right track .
hanke also met this week for two hours with student leaders , who said both sides were optimistic about the university 's future .
bishop hanke , who took office in november 2006 , has said the trouble-shooters will oversee a hunt next year for a new president .
doctrinal issues have not been raised in the dispute , but the archbishop of munich , reinhard marx , indicated this week that bishops want the university to adopt a more catholic " character " in future . dpa news agency -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the university in germany 's bavaria state has about 4,500 students and teaches regular arts , science and business courses .

" i do n't think we will have any solutions on the table in october , " said martin .
european commission president jose manuel barroso , german chancellor angela merkel and european parliament president hans-gert poettering had been among those calling for a rapid solution to the crisis at the start of a two-day eu summit in brussels .
" we both agreed that the next meeting of the european council -lrb- of national leaders -rrb- in october will be an appropriate occasion for further discussion on this matter , " barroso said after holding crisis talks with irish premier brian cowen ahead of the meeting .
but he also warned that adapting the treaty would be " extremely difficult . "
the lisbon treaty , which replaces the doomed nice treaty and was only approved by eu leaders last december after years of wrangling , is designed to improve the decision-making process of an institution that now has 27 member states .
it also gives the european parliament a greater say .
will europe be paralyzed again ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament president wanted a rapid solution urging cowen to come up with solutions and calling on all sides to show " understanding and flexibility " , poettering warned that , with the possible exception of croatia , the eu would not be able to accommodate more countries until the new treaty came into effect .
france , which takes over the rotating presidency of the eu from slovenia on july 1 , is also among those nations particularly keen to see a rapid resolution to the problem .
its president , nicolas sarkozy , was reported as saying ahead of his arrival in brussels that he would ask ireland to hold a second referendum on the treaty .
" we will not touch the lisbon treaty , because if we do we will have to start from zero , " one advisor to the french government said .
as well enjoying backing from the german government , france has the support of denmark , with prime minister anders fogh rasmussen calling on the treaty to come into force by april 2009 , so as to allow the next european parliament to be elected in june according to the new rules .
czech republic is also resisting quick fixes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one knows quite how to respond to the irish no-vote among those who oppose talk of an irish " road map " solution being submitted at the eu 's next summit on october 15-16 is the czech republic , where the eu treaty has been placed under review by its constitutional court .
" do n't put any pressure on anybody , " czech deputy prime minister for european affairs alexandr vondra said .
" we do n't need a long reflection period , but we wo n't fix the problem during this meeting , " acknowledged slovenian prime minister janez jansa at the start of the bloc 's regular summer meeting .
overshadowing other key matters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : back in december , eu leaders thought they 'd made a breakthrough the institutional crisis overshadowed efforts by eu leaders to address pressing matters , such as surging oil and food prices .
jansa said he shared citizens ' concerns that the eu should not re-enter a long period of institutional navel-gazing , saying the summit 's agenda had not changed as a result of the irish no .
" that is why i did not change the agenda , so we will deal heavily with soaring oil and food prices and set some short , medium and long-term goals , " jansa said .
however , concrete answers to these problems also looked remote , president nicolas sarkozy 's call for fuel tax to be capped was dismissed by the leaders of germany , sweden , denmark , as well as the eu 's energy commissioner , ahead of the summit .

" i do n't think we will have any solutions on the table in october , " said martin .
european commission president jose manuel barroso , german chancellor angela merkel and european parliament president hans-gert poettering had been among those calling for a rapid solution to the crisis at the start of a two-day eu summit in brussels .
" we both agreed that the next meeting of the european council -lrb- of national leaders -rrb- in october will be an appropriate occasion for further discussion on this matter , " barroso said after holding crisis talks with irish premier brian cowen ahead of the meeting .
but he also warned that adapting the treaty would be " extremely difficult . "
the lisbon treaty , which replaces the doomed nice treaty and was only approved by eu leaders last december after years of wrangling , is designed to improve the decision-making process of an institution that now has 27 member states .
it also gives the european parliament a greater say .
will europe be paralyzed again ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament president wanted a rapid solution urging cowen to come up with solutions and calling on all sides to show " understanding and flexibility " , poettering warned that , with the possible exception of croatia , the eu would not be able to accommodate more countries until the new treaty came into effect .
france , which takes over the rotating presidency of the eu from slovenia on july 1 , is also among those nations particularly keen to see a rapid resolution to the problem .
its president , nicolas sarkozy , was reported as saying ahead of his arrival in brussels that he would ask ireland to hold a second referendum on the treaty .
" we will not touch the lisbon treaty , because if we do we will have to start from zero , " one advisor to the french government said .
as well enjoying backing from the german government , france has the support of denmark , with prime minister anders fogh rasmussen calling on the treaty to come into force by april 2009 , so as to allow the next european parliament to be elected in june according to the new rules .
czech republic is also resisting quick fixes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one knows quite how to respond to the irish no-vote among those who oppose talk of an irish " road map " solution being submitted at the eu 's next summit on october 15-16 is the czech republic , where the eu treaty has been placed under review by its constitutional court .
" do n't put any pressure on anybody , " czech deputy prime minister for european affairs alexandr vondra said .
" we do n't need a long reflection period , but we wo n't fix the problem during this meeting , " acknowledged slovenian prime minister janez jansa at the start of the bloc 's regular summer meeting .
overshadowing other key matters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : back in december , eu leaders thought they 'd made a breakthrough the institutional crisis overshadowed efforts by eu leaders to address pressing matters , such as surging oil and food prices .
jansa said he shared citizens ' concerns that the eu should not re-enter a long period of institutional navel-gazing , saying the summit 's agenda had not changed as a result of the irish no .
" that is why i did not change the agenda , so we will deal heavily with soaring oil and food prices and set some short , medium and long-term goals , " jansa said .
however , concrete answers to these problems also looked remote , president nicolas sarkozy 's call for fuel tax to be capped was dismissed by the leaders of germany , sweden , denmark , as well as the eu 's energy commissioner , ahead of the summit .

dw 's jochen kuerten caught up with him to find out what he thinks of today 's film industry . deutsche welle : your latest movie " ulzhan " was recently screened at the festival of german film in ludwigshafen , which tends to focus on work by newcomers .
were you pleased to be invited as an elder statesmen of german cinema ?
volker schloendorff : you bet !
when i was there i noticed that there 's a renewed interest in the concept of the auteur movie .
that was what we were all about , and this is a festival that specifically sets out to put german cinema on this path .
i think that 's wonderful .
all the good directors working at the moment , including tom tykwer and christian petzol , are auteur filmmakers .
you began making films in the 1960s and today you 're one of the most experienced directors in the country . how has life changed for directors ?
what 's it like starting out as a director these days ?
when i was making my first movie " young torless " in 1966 , television had n't even arrived .
the market for movies was vast , and audiences were hungry .
so when we showed up with our " new german cinema , " it was pounced upon . back then , millions of people would watch a movie that would be seen by barely 10,000 today .
so we got off to an excellent start .
but then came a long dry patch , and basically we were rescued by television .
these days there 's been an explosion in film making which makes life very , very hard .
up to 10 times as many movies are produced , especially in germany , and it 's all made easier by digital technology and the many film funds out there .
but it 's not easy to find audiences .
the theaters screen so much - twelve movies are launched every week .
it 's very competitive .
but there are far fewer cinemas these days .
this is an issue close to your heart , is n't it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : small cinemas are struggling to survive yes , i 'm like a missionary , constantly on the road .
recently i was at a conference for local cinemas because i do believe strongly that cinema should have a place in the community - especially in the small and medium-sized towns which are increasingly over-run with bars and supermarkets .
a cinema is a place where people can meet , communicate and share an experience .
there 's more to life than the sofa and the pub .
let 's look back at your career .
you once said in an interview that winning an oscar for „ the tin drum “ opened many doors for you , and that you would never have survived so long in the film industry without it .
did you mean that success is necessary to keep working ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the tin drum " won the 1979 academy award for best foreign language film yes , you need either a name or financial success .
acclaim alone gets you nowhere .
you need to have a few movies which have made the theaters , distributors and producers a lot of money so that they remain convinced that with you , they 're onto a winner .
i think that 's the way it works .
and if you have an oeuvre and your work has either won oscars or attracted large audiences such as " death of a salesman “ and " homo faber , “ then it 's easier to get through a dry patch and still get offers and have your calls returned .
what advice would you give young filmmakers today ?
is it worth heading to the us to make movies ?
it 's very worthwhile , because it 's such an intense experience .
some things need to be learnt first-hand .
you have to have been there , to have made two or three films and felt the cold winds of the free market in country which has no subsidies at all .
then you realize how mollycoddled we are here .
that can motivate you to make films that are provocative , striking and different .
making a good movie is n't enough .

dw 's jochen kuerten caught up with him to find out what he thinks of today 's film industry . deutsche welle : your latest movie " ulzhan " was recently screened at the festival of german film in ludwigshafen , which tends to focus on work by newcomers .
were you pleased to be invited as an elder statesmen of german cinema ?
volker schloendorff : you bet !
when i was there i noticed that there 's a renewed interest in the concept of the auteur movie .
that was what we were all about , and this is a festival that specifically sets out to put german cinema on this path .
i think that 's wonderful .
all the good directors working at the moment , including tom tykwer and christian petzol , are auteur filmmakers .
you began making films in the 1960s and today you 're one of the most experienced directors in the country . how has life changed for directors ?
what 's it like starting out as a director these days ?
when i was making my first movie " young torless " in 1966 , television had n't even arrived .
the market for movies was vast , and audiences were hungry .
so when we showed up with our " new german cinema , " it was pounced upon . back then , millions of people would watch a movie that would be seen by barely 10,000 today .
so we got off to an excellent start .
but then came a long dry patch , and basically we were rescued by television .
these days there 's been an explosion in film making which makes life very , very hard .
up to 10 times as many movies are produced , especially in germany , and it 's all made easier by digital technology and the many film funds out there .
but it 's not easy to find audiences .
the theaters screen so much - twelve movies are launched every week .
it 's very competitive .
but there are far fewer cinemas these days .
this is an issue close to your heart , is n't it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : small cinemas are struggling to survive yes , i 'm like a missionary , constantly on the road .
recently i was at a conference for local cinemas because i do believe strongly that cinema should have a place in the community - especially in the small and medium-sized towns which are increasingly over-run with bars and supermarkets .
a cinema is a place where people can meet , communicate and share an experience .
there 's more to life than the sofa and the pub .
let 's look back at your career .
you once said in an interview that winning an oscar for „ the tin drum “ opened many doors for you , and that you would never have survived so long in the film industry without it .
did you mean that success is necessary to keep working ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the tin drum " won the 1979 academy award for best foreign language film yes , you need either a name or financial success .
acclaim alone gets you nowhere .
you need to have a few movies which have made the theaters , distributors and producers a lot of money so that they remain convinced that with you , they 're onto a winner .
i think that 's the way it works .
and if you have an oeuvre and your work has either won oscars or attracted large audiences such as " death of a salesman “ and " homo faber , “ then it 's easier to get through a dry patch and still get offers and have your calls returned .
what advice would you give young filmmakers today ?
is it worth heading to the us to make movies ?
it 's very worthwhile , because it 's such an intense experience .
some things need to be learnt first-hand .
you have to have been there , to have made two or three films and felt the cold winds of the free market in country which has no subsidies at all .
then you realize how mollycoddled we are here .
that can motivate you to make films that are provocative , striking and different .
making a good movie is n't enough .
it might get you through in germany but if you want to make the leap into the wide world , then you need the us experience . interview : jochen kuerten -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the university in germany 's bavaria state has about 4,500 students and teaches regular arts , science and business courses .
this week , the bishop , with express backing from other bavarian bishops , also suspended the university 's administrative head and appointed two temporary new chiefs , saying a fresh start was needed .
refuge of faith bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavaria 's most famous son whereas the church sees its university as a refuge of faith in a nation that is increasingly hostile to religion , professors have painted the struggle as a battle for academic liberty and autonomy , as claimed by universities around the globe .
interest in the dispute has been heightened by the fact that pope benedict xvi is a bavarian and was a formerly a professor in the state , at a different university , regensburg .
the vatican has not spoken out about the row .
unlike at theology colleges , students do not have to be catholic to attend ku .
as at most german state universities , the tuition fees are minimal compared to those in most western nations .
irreconcilable differences to some , the row brings back memories of the vatican 's desire in 1979 to remove the dissident swiss-born theologian hans kueng from his professor-of-theology post at the german university of tuebingen .
however the man at the center of the latest tussle , ulrich hemel , is not a theologian but a business executive whose main academic subject has been the religious formation of children .
hemel was chosen by eichstaett professors to become " president , " a german university 's top academic official , earlier this year , but bishop hanke flatly refused to bless hemel 's appointment and certification needed by hemel from the vatican never arrived .
newspapers speculated that the bishop was disturbed by the fact that hemel had been married three times , but whatever the origin , it is clear that the bishop and hemel have an irreconcilable antipathy .
the bishop 's stated objections to hemel include an accusation that hemel blabbed to the media after they talked .
the catholic newspaper tagespost quoted bishop hanke , who is grand chancellor , or ceremonial chief of the university , saying hemel had never been a full professor and had no recent scholarly publications .
uniquely german bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bischop gregor maria hanke there are catholic universities in the united states , but ku , founded in 1980 , has a uniquely german form of government .
the university , with most of its campus in the bavarian town of eichstaett and a business school in the bigger industrial city of ingolstadt , is mainly funded by the state of bavaria , with the state 's bishops contributing 15 per cent of the budget .
the row has escalated , with suggestions of intrigue and plots rattling the provincial calm at eichstaett .
the conflict reached a head with two senior academics resigning and a bitter joint open letter last week from students and senior professors attacking the " unprecedented " church interference .
professors , who have life tenure and huge power in the german university system , often argue that academic research should be driven by a scholar 's interests rather than the demands of society .
optimistic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many want to see the university become more catholic the bishop has ordered a financial audit of recent spending by the chief executive , gottfried von der heydte , who shared control of the university with its president .
the bishop said he would not make his suspicions public .
tv news crews filmed the grey-suited auditors arriving , sending away von der heydte 's assistants and staying late into the night to search computer and paper files .
professors received letters forbidding them to speak with von der heydte .
bishop hanke said the route out of the conflict was the installation of two outside , neutral academics who would be tasked from july 1 with overseeing a fresh start .
" this is like a marital conflict , " he said .
" it 's best to get a third party to help you . "
the munich newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung said the academic credentials of the two trouble-shooters chosen by the bishop , retired sociologist rudolf fisch and historian gert melville , had impressed some professors , so the duo might be able to bridge the differences .
on wednesday , the professors backed off from further conflict , issuing a joint statement that they were confident the new management would put the university back on the right track .
hanke also met this week for two hours with student leaders , who said both sides were optimistic about the university 's future .
bishop hanke , who took office in november 2006 , has said the trouble-shooters will oversee a hunt next year for a new president .
doctrinal issues have not been raised in the dispute , but the archbishop of munich , reinhard marx , indicated this week that bishops want the university to adopt a more catholic " character " in future . dpa news agency -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's part of the 2008 oerol festival , a site-specific experimental theater event .
the work " is a little bit like going back to the roots of my work .
so that is interesting for me , " said wilson .
in the 1970s , he produced " ka mountain and guardenia terrace , " a continuous seven-day silent play staged on a mountaintop in iran .
renowned for producing elaborate and evocative stage sets , exhibitions and installations , wilson 's works are noted for his use of very slow movement and extremes in space or time .
" walking " is a collaboration between wilson and two dutch artists , theun mosk and boukje schweigman , where festival participants walk at a slow pace through the striking landscape of terschelling 's pastures , woodlands , sand dunes and beaches .
participants become the actors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilson is known for experimenting with extremes in time and space the walkers are asked to hand in their watches , phones , cameras , and any devices they may have that tell time , before they are taken to stand alone in a black box .
then they are guided to a large wooden room with a deep circle dug into the ground .
slow music plays in the background .
finally , a field guide leads them out to a field and sets the pace for the remaining four-hour walk on the island .
clearly , " walking " pushes the boundaries of traditional theater .
it serves as a combination of both an interactive landscape installation and a theater production : the walkers are the actors and the landscape provides the backdrop scenery for the work .
experiencing time in a new way wilson said he was drawn immediately to the dramatic landscape on the island and wanted walkers to maintain a deliberately slow pace to heighten their observation during the walk .
" our perception is different if we take more time to do something , " said wilson .
" we begin to hear and see what is there in a different way .
we begin to smell things in a different way .
there is time to reflect . "
in the early 1970s he won international acclaim for " deafman glance , " a silent opera created in collaboration with raymond andrews , who is both deaf and mute .
wilson worked together with composer philip glass on the opera " einstein on the beach . "

it 's part of the 2008 oerol festival , a site-specific experimental theater event .
the work " is a little bit like going back to the roots of my work .
so that is interesting for me , " said wilson .
in the 1970s , he produced " ka mountain and guardenia terrace , " a continuous seven-day silent play staged on a mountaintop in iran .
renowned for producing elaborate and evocative stage sets , exhibitions and installations , wilson 's works are noted for his use of very slow movement and extremes in space or time .
" walking " is a collaboration between wilson and two dutch artists , theun mosk and boukje schweigman , where festival participants walk at a slow pace through the striking landscape of terschelling 's pastures , woodlands , sand dunes and beaches .
participants become the actors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilson is known for experimenting with extremes in time and space the walkers are asked to hand in their watches , phones , cameras , and any devices they may have that tell time , before they are taken to stand alone in a black box .
then they are guided to a large wooden room with a deep circle dug into the ground .
slow music plays in the background .
finally , a field guide leads them out to a field and sets the pace for the remaining four-hour walk on the island .
clearly , " walking " pushes the boundaries of traditional theater .
it serves as a combination of both an interactive landscape installation and a theater production : the walkers are the actors and the landscape provides the backdrop scenery for the work .
experiencing time in a new way wilson said he was drawn immediately to the dramatic landscape on the island and wanted walkers to maintain a deliberately slow pace to heighten their observation during the walk .
" our perception is different if we take more time to do something , " said wilson .
" we begin to hear and see what is there in a different way .
we begin to smell things in a different way .
there is time to reflect . "
in the early 1970s he won international acclaim for " deafman glance , " a silent opera created in collaboration with raymond andrews , who is both deaf and mute .
wilson worked together with composer philip glass on the opera " einstein on the beach . "
he also collaborated with musician tom waits and writer william s. burroughs on the musical fable " the black rider . " cheryl northey send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

prague 's parliamentary ratification was suspended in late april as it was going through the lower chamber , after the senate demanded a constitutional court ruling on whether the treaty conforms with the czech constitution .
in addition to this obstacle , the czech republic 's eurosceptic president vaclav klaus has already insisted the irish vote had killed off the document , meant to help the eu operate more efficiently as it grows .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish premier brian cowen has a lot of explaining to do to make matters worse , a british court challenge for a referendum forced prime minister gordon brown to concede at the summit that the the treaty was invalid without a ruling .
" ratification will not take place of course until we have had the judgement , " he said .
a judge at london 's high court called on the british government to delay ratification until he ruled on a legal bid to force a referendum .
in the end , eu leaders agreed on friday to give ireland at least until october to come up with recommendations on the way ahead . in a final statement , the eu said although 19 member states have ratified the treaty , " more time was needed to analyse the situation . " merkel , sarkozy say no new members eu leaders also failed to find common ground on whether the bloc could still absorb new members after the treaty 's rejection by ireland . the reform charter was intended to make the enlargement process more manageable by streamlining the european union 's institutions .
the treaty is also meant to give the eu more clout on in foreign affairs after the large eastward expansion of the bloc since 2004 , when 12 new members joined . german chancellor angela merkel on friday backed president nicolas sarkozy 's call for the european union to forget about adding new members until it finds a solution to ireland 's rejection of an eu reform treaty . " without the lisbon treaty , there is no enlargement , " sarkozy , whose country assumes the eu 's rotating , six-month presidency on july 1 , said .
" i would find it very strange that europe has trouble agreeing on its institutions but that it would be able to agree to allow in a 28th , 29th or 30th member , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel remains against taking in new members without the treaty both sarkozy and merkel strongly support the lisbon treaty and have urged other eu members to pursue its ratification despite ireland 's " no . "
they have also long made it clear that they oppose turkey 's long-term membership aspirations . merkel said the eu 's existing institutional arrangements limited the size of the bloc to its current 27 members . " i agree because the nice treaty limited the -lrb- european -rrb- union to a membership of 27 states and for me it is unthinkable that we would change one area of the nice treaty without looking at the whole of the lisbon treaty , " she said in brussels . luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , the eu 's longest-serving leader , shared the view . " without a new treaty there 's no enlargement , " he insisted .
" one of the reasons for the lisbon treaty was the capacity to enlarge . " splits on enlargement but not everyone agreed with berlin and paris ' calls for a freeze on enlargement until the treaty riddle was solved .
the move is almost certain to affect turkey and croatia , who are currently negotiating their accession to the eu .
several other countries in the western balkans are also hoping to climb up the candidacy ladder . " the irish vote should in no way be related to the enlargement , " polish prime minister donald tusk said . austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik urged that croatia " should not become the first victim of the irish referendum . " " we have to keep our word , it would be a wrong signal to the balkan states to put a question mark over enlargement , " she said . seven eu nations have yet to ratify the lisbon treaty . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

prague 's parliamentary ratification was suspended in late april as it was going through the lower chamber , after the senate demanded a constitutional court ruling on whether the treaty conforms with the czech constitution .
in addition to this obstacle , the czech republic 's eurosceptic president vaclav klaus has already insisted the irish vote had killed off the document , meant to help the eu operate more efficiently as it grows .

but as high-end development spreads , some are saying : enough .
they fear berlin 's character could be irrevocably changed . mario feist remembers that there used to be bakeries and small grocery shops in the oderberger strasse when he first moved there in 1989 .
today , it is much easier to get a latte macchiato or a 150-euro shirt outside his front door than a loaf of bread or carton of milk .
he has watched as his street has been transformed from a dreary road marked by crumbling facades to a hip thoroughfare of renovated buildings , expensive boutiques and trendy cafés , whose sidewalks often resemble a fashion catwalk on sunny weekends .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marthashof sales office offers homes for the high-end client it 's a metamorphosis that he 's not completely comfortable with , especially since it could take on a whole new dimension once the 12,000-square-meter development of luxury apartments being constructed just outside his back window is completed .
called marthashof , it will house around 500 people , and since the square meter price for the townhouses starts at 3,000 euros , the large influx into the neighborhood will be quite well off .
" it could become a very sterile place just for rich people and not the kind of place i 'd want to live , " he said .
" i want to have different kinds of people here . "
expanding wave his concerns are not his alone .
as berlin 's gentrification process spreads to encompass more and more neighborhoods , people are beginning to push back at what they see as a danger to a vibrant , diverse city of neighborhoods featuring people of different social and economic backgrounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an unrenovated and renovated building side by side on oderberger strasse in some neighborhoods , like feist 's prenzlauer berg , gentrification has been happening for years .
but as berlin continues to pull in more investment and its international reputation attracts more wealthy people , the neighborhood has seen a construction boom in luxury apartments and townhouses , which , in comparison to london , new york or paris , can still be had on the cheap .
the fears are that as more wealthy people move in to an area , their up-market tastes will be reflected in businesses that set up shop and rents will go up , pricing out lower and middle-income people .
feist said he 's already seen it happen in his street , when a greek restaurateur was forced to move out after his rent was tripled when the building housing his eatery changed hands .
" gentrification is not a good or bad thing in itself , " said antje seidel-schuelze , a researcher at the german institute of urban affairs .
" in one way , the districts where it happens become better .
but long-established people in a neighborhood are often replaced by wealthier people .
that leads to a certain homogeneity . "
same old same it 's that threat of sameness that riles patrik technau , a 23-year-old student and prenzlauer berg native who recently organized a protest rally near marthashof and another high-end development that attracted 500 people .
his event capped a week of demonstrations across berlin by mostly left-wing groups who say they are against the rapid development and reconstruction of the city .
during the protests , at least 30 cars were set ablaze . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more up-market housing going up " new people are moving here from abroad or other parts of germany and driving out people who 've lived here 40 or 50 years , " he said .
" that 's not fair and it makes me very angry . "
and while once the gentrification seemed limited to central neighborhoods such as prenzlauer berg and mitte , it 's spreading , said andrej holm , a professor at berlin 's humbolt university who studies gentrification .
that is what is causing the anger to rise .
as people were priced out of one neighborhood , they would move .
but often the gentrification wave would follow , forcing them to move again .
now , neighborhoods that were usually seen as immune to the process , and have been long-time enclaves of ethnic communities or artists and bohemians , are attracting professionals who are tired of the boutiques and bars , and are looking for something more " authentic . "
problem is , say researchers , that the lattes , renovations and higher rents are n't usually very far behind .
keeping the mix according to holm , city governments have several instruments that can keep neighborhoods on their way up from losing their diversity , such as rent control mechanisms or the construction of new social housing , even in gentrified neighborhoods .
but he said berlin has generally abandoned these tools , particularly when it comes to low-rent housing .
" in the few lots where there is still space for construction , only things like luxury townhouses and gated communities are going up , " he said .
" the city seems to think if we increase the number of high-end apartments , it can attract the kind of people that will also improve berlin 's economic situation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gentrification wave is expected to eventually hit even areas like berlin 's neukölln district but while the upper-income influx might lift a few economic boats in berlin , it could strand people like claudia hering , who along with mario feist is part of a citizens ' initiative called aim which wants changes to the marthashof development .
" we are afraid that in two or three years we wo n't be able to live here anymore , " she said .
but would she even want to ?
according to researcher seidel-schuelze , gentrification often makes people want to leave their own neighborhoods , no matter what their history there .
not only can they perhaps no longer afford it , the new look and feel can make the place not seem like home anymore .
" i know some people who used to live -lrb- in prenzlauer berg -rrb- in the gdr and they say it 's not my district anymore and i do n't want to be with these new dinks - double income , no kids people , " she said .

but as high-end development spreads , some are saying : enough .
they fear berlin 's character could be irrevocably changed . mario feist remembers that there used to be bakeries and small grocery shops in the oderberger strasse when he first moved there in 1989 .
today , it is much easier to get a latte macchiato or a 150-euro shirt outside his front door than a loaf of bread or carton of milk .
he has watched as his street has been transformed from a dreary road marked by crumbling facades to a hip thoroughfare of renovated buildings , expensive boutiques and trendy cafés , whose sidewalks often resemble a fashion catwalk on sunny weekends .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marthashof sales office offers homes for the high-end client it 's a metamorphosis that he 's not completely comfortable with , especially since it could take on a whole new dimension once the 12,000-square-meter development of luxury apartments being constructed just outside his back window is completed .
called marthashof , it will house around 500 people , and since the square meter price for the townhouses starts at 3,000 euros , the large influx into the neighborhood will be quite well off .
" it could become a very sterile place just for rich people and not the kind of place i 'd want to live , " he said .
" i want to have different kinds of people here . "
expanding wave his concerns are not his alone .
as berlin 's gentrification process spreads to encompass more and more neighborhoods , people are beginning to push back at what they see as a danger to a vibrant , diverse city of neighborhoods featuring people of different social and economic backgrounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an unrenovated and renovated building side by side on oderberger strasse in some neighborhoods , like feist 's prenzlauer berg , gentrification has been happening for years .
but as berlin continues to pull in more investment and its international reputation attracts more wealthy people , the neighborhood has seen a construction boom in luxury apartments and townhouses , which , in comparison to london , new york or paris , can still be had on the cheap .
the fears are that as more wealthy people move in to an area , their up-market tastes will be reflected in businesses that set up shop and rents will go up , pricing out lower and middle-income people .
feist said he 's already seen it happen in his street , when a greek restaurateur was forced to move out after his rent was tripled when the building housing his eatery changed hands .
" gentrification is not a good or bad thing in itself , " said antje seidel-schuelze , a researcher at the german institute of urban affairs .
" in one way , the districts where it happens become better .
but long-established people in a neighborhood are often replaced by wealthier people .
that leads to a certain homogeneity . "
same old same it 's that threat of sameness that riles patrik technau , a 23-year-old student and prenzlauer berg native who recently organized a protest rally near marthashof and another high-end development that attracted 500 people .
his event capped a week of demonstrations across berlin by mostly left-wing groups who say they are against the rapid development and reconstruction of the city .
during the protests , at least 30 cars were set ablaze . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more up-market housing going up " new people are moving here from abroad or other parts of germany and driving out people who 've lived here 40 or 50 years , " he said .
" that 's not fair and it makes me very angry . "
and while once the gentrification seemed limited to central neighborhoods such as prenzlauer berg and mitte , it 's spreading , said andrej holm , a professor at berlin 's humbolt university who studies gentrification .
that is what is causing the anger to rise .
as people were priced out of one neighborhood , they would move .
but often the gentrification wave would follow , forcing them to move again .
now , neighborhoods that were usually seen as immune to the process , and have been long-time enclaves of ethnic communities or artists and bohemians , are attracting professionals who are tired of the boutiques and bars , and are looking for something more " authentic . "
problem is , say researchers , that the lattes , renovations and higher rents are n't usually very far behind .
keeping the mix according to holm , city governments have several instruments that can keep neighborhoods on their way up from losing their diversity , such as rent control mechanisms or the construction of new social housing , even in gentrified neighborhoods .
but he said berlin has generally abandoned these tools , particularly when it comes to low-rent housing .
" in the few lots where there is still space for construction , only things like luxury townhouses and gated communities are going up , " he said .
" the city seems to think if we increase the number of high-end apartments , it can attract the kind of people that will also improve berlin 's economic situation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gentrification wave is expected to eventually hit even areas like berlin 's neukölln district but while the upper-income influx might lift a few economic boats in berlin , it could strand people like claudia hering , who along with mario feist is part of a citizens ' initiative called aim which wants changes to the marthashof development .
" we are afraid that in two or three years we wo n't be able to live here anymore , " she said .
but would she even want to ?
according to researcher seidel-schuelze , gentrification often makes people want to leave their own neighborhoods , no matter what their history there .
not only can they perhaps no longer afford it , the new look and feel can make the place not seem like home anymore .
" i know some people who used to live -lrb- in prenzlauer berg -rrb- in the gdr and they say it 's not my district anymore and i do n't want to be with these new dinks - double income , no kids people , " she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 20.06.2008 eu defies us , lifts sanctions on cuba großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu will continue to press cuba to improve its human rights record the foreign ministers of the 27-nation eu bloc have agreed to scrap sanctions against cuba .
the caribbean country 's northern neighbor is bound to be angered by the move . the move is expected to place brussels and washington on a collision course and drew criticism from cuban dissidents .
the vote on thursday , june 19 , scrapped the sanctions that were imposed in 2003 , suspended in 2005 and are largely symbolic .
they include limits on high-level government visits and the role of eu diplomats in cuba 's cultural events and do not approach the hard line of the 46-year-old us sanctions , which include a trade and investment embargo .
" cosmetic changes " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has prohibited all exports to cuba since 1960 earlier thursday , a us state department spokesman said washington opposed any moves to ease sanctions on cuba , saying that reforms so far under new cuban president raul castro are " some very minor , cosmetic changes " that have fallen well short of ending decades of repressive policies under his brother , fidel castro .
the end of sanctions would give legitimacy to a dictatorial regime , deputy spokesman tom casey said , and countries should not signal that the " continued oppression of the cuban people is any more acceptable now than in the past . "
dissidents in cuba also objected to the lifting of the sanctions , charging the european union with being " hypocritical . "
" it gives me pain , and i 'm ashamed of governments that , far from promoting the democratic values under which they live , are made accomplices to one of the last dictatorships in the world , " vladimiro roca , one of cuba 's best known dissidents and leader of the illegal social democratic party , told dpa news agency .
encouraging reform although eu diplomats said the lifting of the sanctions was aimed at encouraging democratic reforms on cuba , the economist oscar espinosa , one of 75 dissidents whose 2003 arrests led to the eu sanctions , warned the move could harden the attitude of cuba 's communist government .
" it is worrisome because the lifting of the sanctions without something in return from cuba could have a very negative effect on cuba 's internal affairs , " espinosa said .
" it could send a signal to the hardline sectors of the government that it pays to be intransigent and inflexible . "
hypocritical as the european union ceased high-level contacts with cuba 's government in 2003 , it also increased its contacts with cuba 's dissidents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cuba is now expected to become more tolerant of dissidents but the sanctions were suspended in 2005 , and spain pushed to have them officially lifted after fidel castro withdrew as cuba 's leader and raul castro , who took over as president in february , implemented reforms , including giving unused state land to farmers and allowing ordinary cubans to use mobile phones , stay in tourist hotels and buy energy-consuming goods like dvd players and personal computers .
while the eu saw signs of liberalization in those moves , cuba 's dissidents said they have seen no change in the government 's treatment of the opposition .
for instance , of the 75 dissidents jailed in 2003 , 55 remain in custody .
the lifting of the sanctions " confirms once more that , with some notable exceptions , the eu is following a hypocritical policy exclusively concerned with its economic interests and not about cuba entering the circle of the democratic nations of the world , " said roca , who is a recipient of the eu 's sakharov prize for freedom of thought .

intersport , the sporting goods group operating the official store in the vienna fan zone , sold 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 388,000 -rrb- worth of euro-related products last monday , spokesperson christian mann said .
business was higher than usual that day , because host austria was playing germany .

image booster according to mann , the euro would be a financial " zero sum game " for austria 's largest sporting goods retailer .
the reason why costs would equal revenues was that intersport 's regular stores already started devoting part of their retail space for euro 2008 products last year , he said .
setting up the temporary store in the fan zone had cost as much as opening up a regular new store , he added .

intersport , the sporting goods group operating the official store in the vienna fan zone , sold 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 388,000 -rrb- worth of euro-related products last monday , spokesperson christian mann said .
business was higher than usual that day , because host austria was playing germany .
unexpected demand overall sales figures are hard to come by , as vendors ' agreements with uefa prevents them from releasing such information .
" demand is far higher than expected , " mann said .
intersport eybl , the part of the intersport that is uefa 's exclusive vending partner of sporting goods for the euro 2008 , expects revenues of " mid-level single-digit million euros , " another spokesperson said .
memorabilia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : image boosters inside the official vienna fan shop the other day , the atmosphere was busier than in the fan zone surrounding the store .
customers seemed to be interested mostly in buying t-shirts commemorating past games , as they were marked down to 5 euros .
but fans were also buying pricier items , like team jerseys or the official ball , store manager alexandra sallmann said .
" one would n't believe the things people are buying , " she said , pointing to little replicas of the henri delaunay trophy .
jerseys of teams that failed to move to the quarter-finals are already selling at half price , except for the austrian team colours .
the host 's t-shirts were still being bought , sallmann said .
image booster according to mann , the euro would be a financial " zero sum game " for austria 's largest sporting goods retailer .
the reason why costs would equal revenues was that intersport 's regular stores already started devoting part of their retail space for euro 2008 products last year , he said .
setting up the temporary store in the fan zone had cost as much as opening up a regular new store , he added .
" this is really about the image value , " mann said .
being seen as the exclusive sporting goods partner of the euro would help to build the brand and to expand it in the european market , where intersport shops have a share of 20 per cent .
special offers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stores are satisfied with sales at the billa supermarket chain , another official uefa sales partner , euro 2008 products have been marked down by 50 per cent since the kick-off of the championships .
in the small euro 2008 display area in a billa store in central vienna , soft toys of mascots trix and flix cost only 4,99 euros , compared with 20 euros in the fan zone store .
the discount was not due to slow demand , nor would the supply with merchandise be stopped , corporate spokesperson corinna tinkler said .
her company was " satisfied " with sales figures so far , she said .
the discounted merchandise was intended as an " additional bonus " for customers .
when asked whether her company would make a profit from selling products such as euro t-shirts and stationery , she said that it was " hard to say , " as the final accounting would be done after the championship finals .
but she also stressed that billa had chosen to become an official uefa partner because of the positive effect it had on the brand .
another factor eating away at profits are the retailers ' advance costs for obtaining the right to become official uefa partners , several sources within the industry told deutsche presse-agentur dpa .

dw 's jochen kuerten caught up with him to find out what he thinks of today 's film industry . deutsche welle : your latest movie " ulzhan " was recently screened at the festival of german film in ludwigshafen , which tends to focus on work by newcomers .
were you pleased to be invited as an elder statesmen of german cinema ?
volker schloendorff : you bet !
when i was there i noticed that there 's a renewed interest in the concept of the auteur movie .
that was what we were all about , and this is a festival that specifically sets out to put german cinema on this path .
i think that 's wonderful .
all the good directors working at the moment , including tom tykwer and christian petzol , are auteur filmmakers .
you began making films in the 1960s and today you 're one of the most experienced directors in the country . how has life changed for directors ?
what 's it like starting out as a director these days ?
when i was making my first movie " young torless " in 1966 , television had n't even arrived .
the market for movies was vast , and audiences were hungry .
so when we showed up with our " new german cinema , " it was pounced upon . back then , millions of people would watch a movie that would be seen by barely 10,000 today .
so we got off to an excellent start .
but then came a long dry patch , and basically we were rescued by television .
these days there 's been an explosion in film making which makes life very , very hard .
up to 10 times as many movies are produced , especially in germany , and it 's all made easier by digital technology and the many film funds out there .
but it 's not easy to find audiences .
the theaters screen so much - twelve movies are launched every week .
it 's very competitive .
but there are far fewer cinemas these days .
this is an issue close to your heart , is n't it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : small cinemas are struggling to survive yes , i 'm like a missionary , constantly on the road .
recently i was at a conference for local cinemas because i do believe strongly that cinema should have a place in the community - especially in the small and medium-sized towns which are increasingly over-run with bars and supermarkets .
a cinema is a place where people can meet , communicate and share an experience .
there 's more to life than the sofa and the pub .
let 's look back at your career .
you once said in an interview that winning an oscar for „ the tin drum “ opened many doors for you , and that you would never have survived so long in the film industry without it .
did you mean that success is necessary to keep working ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the tin drum " won the 1979 academy award for best foreign language film yes , you need either a name or financial success .
acclaim alone gets you nowhere .
you need to have a few movies which have made the theaters , distributors and producers a lot of money so that they remain convinced that with you , they 're onto a winner .
i think that 's the way it works .
and if you have an oeuvre and your work has either won oscars or attracted large audiences such as " death of a salesman “ and " homo faber , “ then it 's easier to get through a dry patch and still get offers and have your calls returned .
what advice would you give young filmmakers today ?
is it worth heading to the us to make movies ?
it 's very worthwhile , because it 's such an intense experience .
some things need to be learnt first-hand .
you have to have been there , to have made two or three films and felt the cold winds of the free market in country which has no subsidies at all .
then you realize how mollycoddled we are here .
that can motivate you to make films that are provocative , striking and different .
making a good movie is n't enough .
it might get you through in germany but if you want to make the leap into the wide world , then you need the us experience . interview : jochen kuerten -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw 's jochen kuerten caught up with him to find out what he thinks of today 's film industry . deutsche welle : your latest movie " ulzhan " was recently screened at the festival of german film in ludwigshafen , which tends to focus on work by newcomers .
were you pleased to be invited as an elder statesmen of german cinema ?
volker schloendorff : you bet !
when i was there i noticed that there 's a renewed interest in the concept of the auteur movie .
that was what we were all about , and this is a festival that specifically sets out to put german cinema on this path .
i think that 's wonderful .
all the good directors working at the moment , including tom tykwer and christian petzol , are auteur filmmakers .
you began making films in the 1960s and today you 're one of the most experienced directors in the country . how has life changed for directors ?
what 's it like starting out as a director these days ?
when i was making my first movie " young torless " in 1966 , television had n't even arrived .
the market for movies was vast , and audiences were hungry .
so when we showed up with our " new german cinema , " it was pounced upon . back then , millions of people would watch a movie that would be seen by barely 10,000 today .
so we got off to an excellent start .
but then came a long dry patch , and basically we were rescued by television .
these days there 's been an explosion in film making which makes life very , very hard .
up to 10 times as many movies are produced , especially in germany , and it 's all made easier by digital technology and the many film funds out there .

" i do n't think we will have any solutions on the table in october , " said martin .
european commission president jose manuel barroso , german chancellor angela merkel and european parliament president hans-gert poettering had been among those calling for a rapid solution to the crisis at the start of a two-day eu summit in brussels .
" we both agreed that the next meeting of the european council -lrb- of national leaders -rrb- in october will be an appropriate occasion for further discussion on this matter , " barroso said after holding crisis talks with irish premier brian cowen ahead of the meeting .
but he also warned that adapting the treaty would be " extremely difficult . "
the lisbon treaty , which replaces the doomed nice treaty and was only approved by eu leaders last december after years of wrangling , is designed to improve the decision-making process of an institution that now has 27 member states .
it also gives the european parliament a greater say .
will europe be paralyzed again ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament president wanted a rapid solution urging cowen to come up with solutions and calling on all sides to show " understanding and flexibility " , poettering warned that , with the possible exception of croatia , the eu would not be able to accommodate more countries until the new treaty came into effect .
france , which takes over the rotating presidency of the eu from slovenia on july 1 , is also among those nations particularly keen to see a rapid resolution to the problem .
its president , nicolas sarkozy , was reported as saying ahead of his arrival in brussels that he would ask ireland to hold a second referendum on the treaty .
" we will not touch the lisbon treaty , because if we do we will have to start from zero , " one advisor to the french government said .
as well enjoying backing from the german government , france has the support of denmark , with prime minister anders fogh rasmussen calling on the treaty to come into force by april 2009 , so as to allow the next european parliament to be elected in june according to the new rules .

" do n't put any pressure on anybody , " czech deputy prime minister for european affairs alexandr vondra said .
" we do n't need a long reflection period , but we wo n't fix the problem during this meeting , " acknowledged slovenian prime minister janez jansa at the start of the bloc 's regular summer meeting .
overshadowing other key matters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : back in december , eu leaders thought they 'd made a breakthrough the institutional crisis overshadowed efforts by eu leaders to address pressing matters , such as surging oil and food prices .

" that is why i did not change the agenda , so we will deal heavily with soaring oil and food prices and set some short , medium and long-term goals , " jansa said .
however , concrete answers to these problems also looked remote , president nicolas sarkozy 's call for fuel tax to be capped was dismissed by the leaders of germany , sweden , denmark , as well as the eu 's energy commissioner , ahead of the summit .

" i do n't think we will have any solutions on the table in october , " said martin .
european commission president jose manuel barroso , german chancellor angela merkel and european parliament president hans-gert poettering had been among those calling for a rapid solution to the crisis at the start of a two-day eu summit in brussels .
" we both agreed that the next meeting of the european council -lrb- of national leaders -rrb- in october will be an appropriate occasion for further discussion on this matter , " barroso said after holding crisis talks with irish premier brian cowen ahead of the meeting .
but he also warned that adapting the treaty would be " extremely difficult . "
the lisbon treaty , which replaces the doomed nice treaty and was only approved by eu leaders last december after years of wrangling , is designed to improve the decision-making process of an institution that now has 27 member states .
it also gives the european parliament a greater say .
will europe be paralyzed again ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament president wanted a rapid solution urging cowen to come up with solutions and calling on all sides to show " understanding and flexibility " , poettering warned that , with the possible exception of croatia , the eu would not be able to accommodate more countries until the new treaty came into effect .
france , which takes over the rotating presidency of the eu from slovenia on july 1 , is also among those nations particularly keen to see a rapid resolution to the problem .
its president , nicolas sarkozy , was reported as saying ahead of his arrival in brussels that he would ask ireland to hold a second referendum on the treaty .
" we will not touch the lisbon treaty , because if we do we will have to start from zero , " one advisor to the french government said .
as well enjoying backing from the german government , france has the support of denmark , with prime minister anders fogh rasmussen calling on the treaty to come into force by april 2009 , so as to allow the next european parliament to be elected in june according to the new rules .

" do n't put any pressure on anybody , " czech deputy prime minister for european affairs alexandr vondra said .
" we do n't need a long reflection period , but we wo n't fix the problem during this meeting , " acknowledged slovenian prime minister janez jansa at the start of the bloc 's regular summer meeting .

so when we showed up with our " new german cinema , " it was pounced upon . back then , millions of people would watch a movie that would be seen by barely 10,000 today .
so we got off to an excellent start .
but then came a long dry patch , and basically we were rescued by television .

" i do n't think we will have any solutions on the table in october , " said martin .
european commission president jose manuel barroso , german chancellor angela merkel and european parliament president hans-gert poettering had been among those calling for a rapid solution to the crisis at the start of a two-day eu summit in brussels .
" we both agreed that the next meeting of the european council -lrb- of national leaders -rrb- in october will be an appropriate occasion for further discussion on this matter , " barroso said after holding crisis talks with irish premier brian cowen ahead of the meeting .
but he also warned that adapting the treaty would be " extremely difficult . "
the lisbon treaty , which replaces the doomed nice treaty and was only approved by eu leaders last december after years of wrangling , is designed to improve the decision-making process of an institution that now has 27 member states .
it also gives the european parliament a greater say .
will europe be paralyzed again ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament president wanted a rapid solution urging cowen to come up with solutions and calling on all sides to show " understanding and flexibility " , poettering warned that , with the possible exception of croatia , the eu would not be able to accommodate more countries until the new treaty came into effect .
france , which takes over the rotating presidency of the eu from slovenia on july 1 , is also among those nations particularly keen to see a rapid resolution to the problem .
its president , nicolas sarkozy , was reported as saying ahead of his arrival in brussels that he would ask ireland to hold a second referendum on the treaty .
" we will not touch the lisbon treaty , because if we do we will have to start from zero , " one advisor to the french government said .
as well enjoying backing from the german government , france has the support of denmark , with prime minister anders fogh rasmussen calling on the treaty to come into force by april 2009 , so as to allow the next european parliament to be elected in june according to the new rules .
czech republic is also resisting quick fixes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one knows quite how to respond to the irish no-vote among those who oppose talk of an irish " road map " solution being submitted at the eu 's next summit on october 15-16 is the czech republic , where the eu treaty has been placed under review by its constitutional court .
" do n't put any pressure on anybody , " czech deputy prime minister for european affairs alexandr vondra said .
" we do n't need a long reflection period , but we wo n't fix the problem during this meeting , " acknowledged slovenian prime minister janez jansa at the start of the bloc 's regular summer meeting .
overshadowing other key matters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : back in december , eu leaders thought they 'd made a breakthrough the institutional crisis overshadowed efforts by eu leaders to address pressing matters , such as surging oil and food prices .
jansa said he shared citizens ' concerns that the eu should not re-enter a long period of institutional navel-gazing , saying the summit 's agenda had not changed as a result of the irish no .
" that is why i did not change the agenda , so we will deal heavily with soaring oil and food prices and set some short , medium and long-term goals , " jansa said .
however , concrete answers to these problems also looked remote , president nicolas sarkozy 's call for fuel tax to be capped was dismissed by the leaders of germany , sweden , denmark , as well as the eu 's energy commissioner , ahead of the summit .
this was the first time that eu leaders met to discuss the fallout caused by the june 12 referendum , in which a majority of irish voters said no to the lisbon treaty . dpa news agency -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw 's jochen kuerten caught up with him to find out what he thinks of today 's film industry . deutsche welle : your latest movie " ulzhan " was recently screened at the festival of german film in ludwigshafen , which tends to focus on work by newcomers .
were you pleased to be invited as an elder statesmen of german cinema ?
volker schloendorff : you bet !
when i was there i noticed that there 's a renewed interest in the concept of the auteur movie .
that was what we were all about , and this is a festival that specifically sets out to put german cinema on this path .
i think that 's wonderful .
all the good directors working at the moment , including tom tykwer and christian petzol , are auteur filmmakers .
you began making films in the 1960s and today you 're one of the most experienced directors in the country . how has life changed for directors ?
what 's it like starting out as a director these days ?
when i was making my first movie " young torless " in 1966 , television had n't even arrived .
the market for movies was vast , and audiences were hungry .
so when we showed up with our " new german cinema , " it was pounced upon . back then , millions of people would watch a movie that would be seen by barely 10,000 today .
so we got off to an excellent start .
but then came a long dry patch , and basically we were rescued by television .
these days there 's been an explosion in film making which makes life very , very hard .
up to 10 times as many movies are produced , especially in germany , and it 's all made easier by digital technology and the many film funds out there .
but it 's not easy to find audiences .
the theaters screen so much - twelve movies are launched every week .
it 's very competitive .
but there are far fewer cinemas these days .
this is an issue close to your heart , is n't it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : small cinemas are struggling to survive yes , i 'm like a missionary , constantly on the road .
recently i was at a conference for local cinemas because i do believe strongly that cinema should have a place in the community - especially in the small and medium-sized towns which are increasingly over-run with bars and supermarkets .
a cinema is a place where people can meet , communicate and share an experience .
there 's more to life than the sofa and the pub .
let 's look back at your career .
you once said in an interview that winning an oscar for „ the tin drum “ opened many doors for you , and that you would never have survived so long in the film industry without it .
did you mean that success is necessary to keep working ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the tin drum " won the 1979 academy award for best foreign language film yes , you need either a name or financial success .
acclaim alone gets you nowhere .
you need to have a few movies which have made the theaters , distributors and producers a lot of money so that they remain convinced that with you , they 're onto a winner .
i think that 's the way it works .
and if you have an oeuvre and your work has either won oscars or attracted large audiences such as " death of a salesman “ and " homo faber , “ then it 's easier to get through a dry patch and still get offers and have your calls returned .
what advice would you give young filmmakers today ?
is it worth heading to the us to make movies ?
it 's very worthwhile , because it 's such an intense experience .
some things need to be learnt first-hand .
you have to have been there , to have made two or three films and felt the cold winds of the free market in country which has no subsidies at all .
then you realize how mollycoddled we are here .
that can motivate you to make films that are provocative , striking and different .
making a good movie is n't enough .
it might get you through in germany but if you want to make the leap into the wide world , then you need the us experience . interview : jochen kuerten -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the university in germany 's bavaria state has about 4,500 students and teaches regular arts , science and business courses .
this week , the bishop , with express backing from other bavarian bishops , also suspended the university 's administrative head and appointed two temporary new chiefs , saying a fresh start was needed .

interest in the dispute has been heightened by the fact that pope benedict xvi is a bavarian and was a formerly a professor in the state , at a different university , regensburg .
the vatican has not spoken out about the row .
unlike at theology colleges , students do not have to be catholic to attend ku .
as at most german state universities , the tuition fees are minimal compared to those in most western nations .
irreconcilable differences to some , the row brings back memories of the vatican 's desire in 1979 to remove the dissident swiss-born theologian hans kueng from his professor-of-theology post at the german university of tuebingen .
however the man at the center of the latest tussle , ulrich hemel , is not a theologian but a business executive whose main academic subject has been the religious formation of children .
hemel was chosen by eichstaett professors to become " president , " a german university 's top academic official , earlier this year , but bishop hanke flatly refused to bless hemel 's appointment and certification needed by hemel from the vatican never arrived .
newspapers speculated that the bishop was disturbed by the fact that hemel had been married three times , but whatever the origin , it is clear that the bishop and hemel have an irreconcilable antipathy .
the bishop 's stated objections to hemel include an accusation that hemel blabbed to the media after they talked .
the catholic newspaper tagespost quoted bishop hanke , who is grand chancellor , or ceremonial chief of the university , saying hemel had never been a full professor and had no recent scholarly publications .

the row has escalated , with suggestions of intrigue and plots rattling the provincial calm at eichstaett .
the conflict reached a head with two senior academics resigning and a bitter joint open letter last week from students and senior professors attacking the " unprecedented " church interference .

bishop hanke said the route out of the conflict was the installation of two outside , neutral academics who would be tasked from july 1 with overseeing a fresh start .

trade union critics say that the social market economy is not working so well anymore for germany .
older generations nostalgic for the d-mark that marked the post-war economic boom , blame the euro for inflation . sixty years ago this friday , june 20 , the allied powers introduced a new currency , the d-mark , which became the basis of social market economy that led to the federal republic of germany 's wirtschaftswunder or economic miracle in the 1950s .
but the combination of free market dynamics with a wide social net that had served germany so well in the post-war period , is “ facing a deep legitimacy crisis ” , said michael sommer , head of the confederation of german unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- , an umbrella trade union organization in an interview with the newspaper berliner zeitung .
since the middle of the 1990s , real wages have hardly gone up , with every fifth worker barely earning enough at a subsistence level , added sommer .
“ social mobility still remains an illusion for the majority of single parents , long term unemployed and immigrant groups , ” he said lashing out at big multi-national companies that put short term gains and profits ahead of a long term strategy that preserves jobs and benefits .
euro blamed for inflation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumers feel their euro is not stretching far enough with massive job cuts underway at big dax companies such as deutsche telekom and siemens , as well as general cost of living increases , many germans are feeling the pinch and blame the euro , the common eu currency introduced nearly a decade ago for inflation .
more than a third of germans would even like to have their d-mark back , according to a representative survey by the association of german banks -lrb- bdb -rrb- published friday .
when asked whether they would like to have the old national currency back to replace the euro , fully one-third of 34 respondents answered “ yes . ”
in january 1999 , the switch to the euro for 11 eu member states took place electronically , although the notes and coins were introduced three years later .
inflation has nothing to do with the euro bildunterschrift : in the post-war decades , the d-mark provided a sense of economic well-being .
the main reason for wanting the deutsche mark back was the perception that the euro was responsible for rising prices , an argument that bdb rejected saying that current inflation had everything to do with higher energy and food prices and nothing to do with the euro .
the bdb also pointed out that inflation in the euro zone over the past 10 years had even remained fairly moderate .
" since the start of currency union , inflation has , at 2 percent a year on average , been relatively limited , " said bdb chairman manfred weber .
" in this connection , the euro is one of the most stable currencies overall . ”
weber said the currency now provided a firm basis for growth in the euro zone , which has now grown to 15 members , since the eastward expansion of the eu in 2004 .
britain , which still maintains the pound sterling , is the only major eu country that has not joined the euro zone .
eu leaders have just decided at their current summit in brussels that slovakia will become the 16th member country to introduce the euro in 2009 .
older germans still think in terms of d-marks despite the bdb 's confidence in the euro , nearly half of all germans , especially elder generations who feel nostalgic for the d-mark , still calculate in the old currency , according to frankfurt psychologist and university professor henning haase .
converting to d-marks is also relatively easy since one euro was roughly two deutsche marks .
" particularly in times of higher inflation , many people long for the return of the d-mark , " haase said , but added that that while an inflation rate of 3.1 percent is now perceived as high , inflation had " the deutsche mark is still firmly anchored in many minds as a stable currency , " he said . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but as high-end development spreads , some are saying : enough .
they fear berlin 's character could be irrevocably changed . mario feist remembers that there used to be bakeries and small grocery shops in the oderberger strasse when he first moved there in 1989 .
today , it is much easier to get a latte macchiato or a 150-euro shirt outside his front door than a loaf of bread or carton of milk .
he has watched as his street has been transformed from a dreary road marked by crumbling facades to a hip thoroughfare of renovated buildings , expensive boutiques and trendy cafés , whose sidewalks often resemble a fashion catwalk on sunny weekends .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marthashof sales office offers homes for the high-end client it 's a metamorphosis that he 's not completely comfortable with , especially since it could take on a whole new dimension once the 12,000-square-meter development of luxury apartments being constructed just outside his back window is completed .
called marthashof , it will house around 500 people , and since the square meter price for the townhouses starts at 3,000 euros , the large influx into the neighborhood will be quite well off .
" it could become a very sterile place just for rich people and not the kind of place i 'd want to live , " he said .
" i want to have different kinds of people here . "
expanding wave his concerns are not his alone .
as berlin 's gentrification process spreads to encompass more and more neighborhoods , people are beginning to push back at what they see as a danger to a vibrant , diverse city of neighborhoods featuring people of different social and economic backgrounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an unrenovated and renovated building side by side on oderberger strasse in some neighborhoods , like feist 's prenzlauer berg , gentrification has been happening for years .
but as berlin continues to pull in more investment and its international reputation attracts more wealthy people , the neighborhood has seen a construction boom in luxury apartments and townhouses , which , in comparison to london , new york or paris , can still be had on the cheap .
the fears are that as more wealthy people move in to an area , their up-market tastes will be reflected in businesses that set up shop and rents will go up , pricing out lower and middle-income people .
feist said he 's already seen it happen in his street , when a greek restaurateur was forced to move out after his rent was tripled when the building housing his eatery changed hands .
" gentrification is not a good or bad thing in itself , " said antje seidel-schuelze , a researcher at the german institute of urban affairs .
" in one way , the districts where it happens become better .
but long-established people in a neighborhood are often replaced by wealthier people .
that leads to a certain homogeneity . "
same old same it 's that threat of sameness that riles patrik technau , a 23-year-old student and prenzlauer berg native who recently organized a protest rally near marthashof and another high-end development that attracted 500 people .
his event capped a week of demonstrations across berlin by mostly left-wing groups who say they are against the rapid development and reconstruction of the city .
during the protests , at least 30 cars were set ablaze . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more up-market housing going up " new people are moving here from abroad or other parts of germany and driving out people who 've lived here 40 or 50 years , " he said .
" that 's not fair and it makes me very angry . "
and while once the gentrification seemed limited to central neighborhoods such as prenzlauer berg and mitte , it 's spreading , said andrej holm , a professor at berlin 's humbolt university who studies gentrification .
that is what is causing the anger to rise .
as people were priced out of one neighborhood , they would move .
but often the gentrification wave would follow , forcing them to move again .
now , neighborhoods that were usually seen as immune to the process , and have been long-time enclaves of ethnic communities or artists and bohemians , are attracting professionals who are tired of the boutiques and bars , and are looking for something more " authentic . "
problem is , say researchers , that the lattes , renovations and higher rents are n't usually very far behind .
keeping the mix according to holm , city governments have several instruments that can keep neighborhoods on their way up from losing their diversity , such as rent control mechanisms or the construction of new social housing , even in gentrified neighborhoods .
but he said berlin has generally abandoned these tools , particularly when it comes to low-rent housing .
" in the few lots where there is still space for construction , only things like luxury townhouses and gated communities are going up , " he said .
" the city seems to think if we increase the number of high-end apartments , it can attract the kind of people that will also improve berlin 's economic situation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gentrification wave is expected to eventually hit even areas like berlin 's neukölln district but while the upper-income influx might lift a few economic boats in berlin , it could strand people like claudia hering , who along with mario feist is part of a citizens ' initiative called aim which wants changes to the marthashof development .
" we are afraid that in two or three years we wo n't be able to live here anymore , " she said .
but would she even want to ?
according to researcher seidel-schuelze , gentrification often makes people want to leave their own neighborhoods , no matter what their history there .
not only can they perhaps no longer afford it , the new look and feel can make the place not seem like home anymore .
" i know some people who used to live -lrb- in prenzlauer berg -rrb- in the gdr and they say it 's not my district anymore and i do n't want to be with these new dinks - double income , no kids people , " she said .

during the protests , at least 30 cars were set ablaze . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more up-market housing going up " new people are moving here from abroad or other parts of germany and driving out people who 've lived here 40 or 50 years , " he said .
" that 's not fair and it makes me very angry . "
and while once the gentrification seemed limited to central neighborhoods such as prenzlauer berg and mitte , it 's spreading , said andrej holm , a professor at berlin 's humbolt university who studies gentrification .
that is what is causing the anger to rise .
as people were priced out of one neighborhood , they would move .
but often the gentrification wave would follow , forcing them to move again .
now , neighborhoods that were usually seen as immune to the process , and have been long-time enclaves of ethnic communities or artists and bohemians , are attracting professionals who are tired of the boutiques and bars , and are looking for something more " authentic . "
problem is , say researchers , that the lattes , renovations and higher rents are n't usually very far behind .
keeping the mix according to holm , city governments have several instruments that can keep neighborhoods on their way up from losing their diversity , such as rent control mechanisms or the construction of new social housing , even in gentrified neighborhoods .
but he said berlin has generally abandoned these tools , particularly when it comes to low-rent housing .
" in the few lots where there is still space for construction , only things like luxury townhouses and gated communities are going up , " he said .
" the city seems to think if we increase the number of high-end apartments , it can attract the kind of people that will also improve berlin 's economic situation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gentrification wave is expected to eventually hit even areas like berlin 's neukölln district but while the upper-income influx might lift a few economic boats in berlin , it could strand people like claudia hering , who along with mario feist is part of a citizens ' initiative called aim which wants changes to the marthashof development .
" we are afraid that in two or three years we wo n't be able to live here anymore , " she said .
but would she even want to ?
according to researcher seidel-schuelze , gentrification often makes people want to leave their own neighborhoods , no matter what their history there .
not only can they perhaps no longer afford it , the new look and feel can make the place not seem like home anymore .
" i know some people who used to live -lrb- in prenzlauer berg -rrb- in the gdr and they say it 's not my district anymore and i do n't want to be with these new dinks - double income , no kids people , " she said .

but as high-end development spreads , some are saying : enough .
they fear berlin 's character could be irrevocably changed . mario feist remembers that there used to be bakeries and small grocery shops in the oderberger strasse when he first moved there in 1989 .
today , it is much easier to get a latte macchiato or a 150-euro shirt outside his front door than a loaf of bread or carton of milk .
he has watched as his street has been transformed from a dreary road marked by crumbling facades to a hip thoroughfare of renovated buildings , expensive boutiques and trendy cafés , whose sidewalks often resemble a fashion catwalk on sunny weekends .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marthashof sales office offers homes for the high-end client it 's a metamorphosis that he 's not completely comfortable with , especially since it could take on a whole new dimension once the 12,000-square-meter development of luxury apartments being constructed just outside his back window is completed .
called marthashof , it will house around 500 people , and since the square meter price for the townhouses starts at 3,000 euros , the large influx into the neighborhood will be quite well off .
" it could become a very sterile place just for rich people and not the kind of place i 'd want to live , " he said .
" i want to have different kinds of people here . "
expanding wave his concerns are not his alone .
as berlin 's gentrification process spreads to encompass more and more neighborhoods , people are beginning to push back at what they see as a danger to a vibrant , diverse city of neighborhoods featuring people of different social and economic backgrounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an unrenovated and renovated building side by side on oderberger strasse in some neighborhoods , like feist 's prenzlauer berg , gentrification has been happening for years .
but as berlin continues to pull in more investment and its international reputation attracts more wealthy people , the neighborhood has seen a construction boom in luxury apartments and townhouses , which , in comparison to london , new york or paris , can still be had on the cheap .
the fears are that as more wealthy people move in to an area , their up-market tastes will be reflected in businesses that set up shop and rents will go up , pricing out lower and middle-income people .
feist said he 's already seen it happen in his street , when a greek restaurateur was forced to move out after his rent was tripled when the building housing his eatery changed hands .
" gentrification is not a good or bad thing in itself , " said antje seidel-schuelze , a researcher at the german institute of urban affairs .
" in one way , the districts where it happens become better .
but long-established people in a neighborhood are often replaced by wealthier people .
that leads to a certain homogeneity . "
same old same it 's that threat of sameness that riles patrik technau , a 23-year-old student and prenzlauer berg native who recently organized a protest rally near marthashof and another high-end development that attracted 500 people .

prague 's parliamentary ratification was suspended in late april as it was going through the lower chamber , after the senate demanded a constitutional court ruling on whether the treaty conforms with the czech constitution .
in addition to this obstacle , the czech republic 's eurosceptic president vaclav klaus has already insisted the irish vote had killed off the document , meant to help the eu operate more efficiently as it grows .

a judge at london 's high court called on the british government to delay ratification until he ruled on a legal bid to force a referendum .

prague 's parliamentary ratification was suspended in late april as it was going through the lower chamber , after the senate demanded a constitutional court ruling on whether the treaty conforms with the czech constitution .

it 's part of the 2008 oerol festival , a site-specific experimental theater event .
the work " is a little bit like going back to the roots of my work .
so that is interesting for me , " said wilson .
in the 1970s , he produced " ka mountain and guardenia terrace , " a continuous seven-day silent play staged on a mountaintop in iran .
renowned for producing elaborate and evocative stage sets , exhibitions and installations , wilson 's works are noted for his use of very slow movement and extremes in space or time .
" walking " is a collaboration between wilson and two dutch artists , theun mosk and boukje schweigman , where festival participants walk at a slow pace through the striking landscape of terschelling 's pastures , woodlands , sand dunes and beaches .
participants become the actors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilson is known for experimenting with extremes in time and space the walkers are asked to hand in their watches , phones , cameras , and any devices they may have that tell time , before they are taken to stand alone in a black box .
then they are guided to a large wooden room with a deep circle dug into the ground .
slow music plays in the background .
finally , a field guide leads them out to a field and sets the pace for the remaining four-hour walk on the island .
clearly , " walking " pushes the boundaries of traditional theater .
it serves as a combination of both an interactive landscape installation and a theater production : the walkers are the actors and the landscape provides the backdrop scenery for the work .
experiencing time in a new way wilson said he was drawn immediately to the dramatic landscape on the island and wanted walkers to maintain a deliberately slow pace to heighten their observation during the walk .
" our perception is different if we take more time to do something , " said wilson .
" we begin to hear and see what is there in a different way .
we begin to smell things in a different way .
there is time to reflect . "
in the early 1970s he won international acclaim for " deafman glance , " a silent opera created in collaboration with raymond andrews , who is both deaf and mute .
wilson worked together with composer philip glass on the opera " einstein on the beach . "
he also collaborated with musician tom waits and writer william s. burroughs on the musical fable " the black rider . " cheryl northey send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's part of the 2008 oerol festival , a site-specific experimental theater event .
the work " is a little bit like going back to the roots of my work .
so that is interesting for me , " said wilson .
in the 1970s , he produced " ka mountain and guardenia terrace , " a continuous seven-day silent play staged on a mountaintop in iran .
renowned for producing elaborate and evocative stage sets , exhibitions and installations , wilson 's works are noted for his use of very slow movement and extremes in space or time .
" walking " is a collaboration between wilson and two dutch artists , theun mosk and boukje schweigman , where festival participants walk at a slow pace through the striking landscape of terschelling 's pastures , woodlands , sand dunes and beaches .
participants become the actors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilson is known for experimenting with extremes in time and space the walkers are asked to hand in their watches , phones , cameras , and any devices they may have that tell time , before they are taken to stand alone in a black box .
then they are guided to a large wooden room with a deep circle dug into the ground .
slow music plays in the background .
finally , a field guide leads them out to a field and sets the pace for the remaining four-hour walk on the island .
clearly , " walking " pushes the boundaries of traditional theater .
it serves as a combination of both an interactive landscape installation and a theater production : the walkers are the actors and the landscape provides the backdrop scenery for the work .
experiencing time in a new way wilson said he was drawn immediately to the dramatic landscape on the island and wanted walkers to maintain a deliberately slow pace to heighten their observation during the walk .

dw 's jochen kuerten caught up with him to find out what he thinks of today 's film industry . deutsche welle : your latest movie " ulzhan " was recently screened at the festival of german film in ludwigshafen , which tends to focus on work by newcomers .
were you pleased to be invited as an elder statesmen of german cinema ?
volker schloendorff : you bet !
when i was there i noticed that there 's a renewed interest in the concept of the auteur movie .
that was what we were all about , and this is a festival that specifically sets out to put german cinema on this path .
i think that 's wonderful .
all the good directors working at the moment , including tom tykwer and christian petzol , are auteur filmmakers .
you began making films in the 1960s and today you 're one of the most experienced directors in the country . how has life changed for directors ?
what 's it like starting out as a director these days ?
when i was making my first movie " young torless " in 1966 , television had n't even arrived .
the market for movies was vast , and audiences were hungry .
so when we showed up with our " new german cinema , " it was pounced upon . back then , millions of people would watch a movie that would be seen by barely 10,000 today .
so we got off to an excellent start .
but then came a long dry patch , and basically we were rescued by television .
these days there 's been an explosion in film making which makes life very , very hard .
up to 10 times as many movies are produced , especially in germany , and it 's all made easier by digital technology and the many film funds out there .
but it 's not easy to find audiences .
the theaters screen so much - twelve movies are launched every week .
it 's very competitive .
but there are far fewer cinemas these days .
this is an issue close to your heart , is n't it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : small cinemas are struggling to survive yes , i 'm like a missionary , constantly on the road .
recently i was at a conference for local cinemas because i do believe strongly that cinema should have a place in the community - especially in the small and medium-sized towns which are increasingly over-run with bars and supermarkets .
a cinema is a place where people can meet , communicate and share an experience .
there 's more to life than the sofa and the pub .
let 's look back at your career .
you once said in an interview that winning an oscar for „ the tin drum “ opened many doors for you , and that you would never have survived so long in the film industry without it .
did you mean that success is necessary to keep working ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the tin drum " won the 1979 academy award for best foreign language film yes , you need either a name or financial success .
acclaim alone gets you nowhere .
you need to have a few movies which have made the theaters , distributors and producers a lot of money so that they remain convinced that with you , they 're onto a winner .
i think that 's the way it works .
and if you have an oeuvre and your work has either won oscars or attracted large audiences such as " death of a salesman “ and " homo faber , “ then it 's easier to get through a dry patch and still get offers and have your calls returned .
what advice would you give young filmmakers today ?
is it worth heading to the us to make movies ?
it 's very worthwhile , because it 's such an intense experience .
some things need to be learnt first-hand .
you have to have been there , to have made two or three films and felt the cold winds of the free market in country which has no subsidies at all .
then you realize how mollycoddled we are here .
that can motivate you to make films that are provocative , striking and different .
making a good movie is n't enough .

dw 's jochen kuerten caught up with him to find out what he thinks of today 's film industry . deutsche welle : your latest movie " ulzhan " was recently screened at the festival of german film in ludwigshafen , which tends to focus on work by newcomers .
were you pleased to be invited as an elder statesmen of german cinema ?
volker schloendorff : you bet !
when i was there i noticed that there 's a renewed interest in the concept of the auteur movie .
that was what we were all about , and this is a festival that specifically sets out to put german cinema on this path .
i think that 's wonderful .
all the good directors working at the moment , including tom tykwer and christian petzol , are auteur filmmakers .
you began making films in the 1960s and today you 're one of the most experienced directors in the country . how has life changed for directors ?
what 's it like starting out as a director these days ?
when i was making my first movie " young torless " in 1966 , television had n't even arrived .
the market for movies was vast , and audiences were hungry .
so when we showed up with our " new german cinema , " it was pounced upon . back then , millions of people would watch a movie that would be seen by barely 10,000 today .
so we got off to an excellent start .
but then came a long dry patch , and basically we were rescued by television .
these days there 's been an explosion in film making which makes life very , very hard .
up to 10 times as many movies are produced , especially in germany , and it 's all made easier by digital technology and the many film funds out there .
but it 's not easy to find audiences .
the theaters screen so much - twelve movies are launched every week .
it 's very competitive .
but there are far fewer cinemas these days .
this is an issue close to your heart , is n't it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : small cinemas are struggling to survive yes , i 'm like a missionary , constantly on the road .
recently i was at a conference for local cinemas because i do believe strongly that cinema should have a place in the community - especially in the small and medium-sized towns which are increasingly over-run with bars and supermarkets .
a cinema is a place where people can meet , communicate and share an experience .
there 's more to life than the sofa and the pub .
let 's look back at your career .
you once said in an interview that winning an oscar for „ the tin drum “ opened many doors for you , and that you would never have survived so long in the film industry without it .
did you mean that success is necessary to keep working ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the tin drum " won the 1979 academy award for best foreign language film yes , you need either a name or financial success .
acclaim alone gets you nowhere .
you need to have a few movies which have made the theaters , distributors and producers a lot of money so that they remain convinced that with you , they 're onto a winner .
i think that 's the way it works .
and if you have an oeuvre and your work has either won oscars or attracted large audiences such as " death of a salesman “ and " homo faber , “ then it 's easier to get through a dry patch and still get offers and have your calls returned .
what advice would you give young filmmakers today ?
is it worth heading to the us to make movies ?
it 's very worthwhile , because it 's such an intense experience .
some things need to be learnt first-hand .
you have to have been there , to have made two or three films and felt the cold winds of the free market in country which has no subsidies at all .
then you realize how mollycoddled we are here .
that can motivate you to make films that are provocative , striking and different .
making a good movie is n't enough .
it might get you through in germany but if you want to make the leap into the wide world , then you need the us experience . interview : jochen kuerten -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

intersport , the sporting goods group operating the official store in the vienna fan zone , sold 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 388,000 -rrb- worth of euro-related products last monday , spokesperson christian mann said .
business was higher than usual that day , because host austria was playing germany .
unexpected demand overall sales figures are hard to come by , as vendors ' agreements with uefa prevents them from releasing such information .
" demand is far higher than expected , " mann said .
intersport eybl , the part of the intersport that is uefa 's exclusive vending partner of sporting goods for the euro 2008 , expects revenues of " mid-level single-digit million euros , " another spokesperson said .
memorabilia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : image boosters inside the official vienna fan shop the other day , the atmosphere was busier than in the fan zone surrounding the store .
customers seemed to be interested mostly in buying t-shirts commemorating past games , as they were marked down to 5 euros .
but fans were also buying pricier items , like team jerseys or the official ball , store manager alexandra sallmann said .
" one would n't believe the things people are buying , " she said , pointing to little replicas of the henri delaunay trophy .
jerseys of teams that failed to move to the quarter-finals are already selling at half price , except for the austrian team colours .
the host 's t-shirts were still being bought , sallmann said .
image booster according to mann , the euro would be a financial " zero sum game " for austria 's largest sporting goods retailer .
the reason why costs would equal revenues was that intersport 's regular stores already started devoting part of their retail space for euro 2008 products last year , he said .
setting up the temporary store in the fan zone had cost as much as opening up a regular new store , he added .
" this is really about the image value , " mann said .
being seen as the exclusive sporting goods partner of the euro would help to build the brand and to expand it in the european market , where intersport shops have a share of 20 per cent .

in the small euro 2008 display area in a billa store in central vienna , soft toys of mascots trix and flix cost only 4,99 euros , compared with 20 euros in the fan zone store .
the discount was not due to slow demand , nor would the supply with merchandise be stopped , corporate spokesperson corinna tinkler said .
her company was " satisfied " with sales figures so far , she said .
the discounted merchandise was intended as an " additional bonus " for customers .
when asked whether her company would make a profit from selling products such as euro t-shirts and stationery , she said that it was " hard to say , " as the final accounting would be done after the championship finals .
but she also stressed that billa had chosen to become an official uefa partner because of the positive effect it had on the brand .
another factor eating away at profits are the retailers ' advance costs for obtaining the right to become official uefa partners , several sources within the industry told deutsche presse-agentur dpa .

intersport , the sporting goods group operating the official store in the vienna fan zone , sold 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 388,000 -rrb- worth of euro-related products last monday , spokesperson christian mann said .
business was higher than usual that day , because host austria was playing germany .
unexpected demand overall sales figures are hard to come by , as vendors ' agreements with uefa prevents them from releasing such information .

the host 's t-shirts were still being bought , sallmann said .
image booster according to mann , the euro would be a financial " zero sum game " for austria 's largest sporting goods retailer .
the reason why costs would equal revenues was that intersport 's regular stores already started devoting part of their retail space for euro 2008 products last year , he said .

" i do n't think we will have any solutions on the table in october , " said martin .
european commission president jose manuel barroso , german chancellor angela merkel and european parliament president hans-gert poettering had been among those calling for a rapid solution to the crisis at the start of a two-day eu summit in brussels .
" we both agreed that the next meeting of the european council -lrb- of national leaders -rrb- in october will be an appropriate occasion for further discussion on this matter , " barroso said after holding crisis talks with irish premier brian cowen ahead of the meeting .
but he also warned that adapting the treaty would be " extremely difficult . "
the lisbon treaty , which replaces the doomed nice treaty and was only approved by eu leaders last december after years of wrangling , is designed to improve the decision-making process of an institution that now has 27 member states .
it also gives the european parliament a greater say .

france , which takes over the rotating presidency of the eu from slovenia on july 1 , is also among those nations particularly keen to see a rapid resolution to the problem .
its president , nicolas sarkozy , was reported as saying ahead of his arrival in brussels that he would ask ireland to hold a second referendum on the treaty .
" we will not touch the lisbon treaty , because if we do we will have to start from zero , " one advisor to the french government said .
as well enjoying backing from the german government , france has the support of denmark , with prime minister anders fogh rasmussen calling on the treaty to come into force by april 2009 , so as to allow the next european parliament to be elected in june according to the new rules .

" do n't put any pressure on anybody , " czech deputy prime minister for european affairs alexandr vondra said .
" we do n't need a long reflection period , but we wo n't fix the problem during this meeting , " acknowledged slovenian prime minister janez jansa at the start of the bloc 's regular summer meeting .

" i do n't think we will have any solutions on the table in october , " said martin .
european commission president jose manuel barroso , german chancellor angela merkel and european parliament president hans-gert poettering had been among those calling for a rapid solution to the crisis at the start of a two-day eu summit in brussels .
" we both agreed that the next meeting of the european council -lrb- of national leaders -rrb- in october will be an appropriate occasion for further discussion on this matter , " barroso said after holding crisis talks with irish premier brian cowen ahead of the meeting .
but he also warned that adapting the treaty would be " extremely difficult . "
the lisbon treaty , which replaces the doomed nice treaty and was only approved by eu leaders last december after years of wrangling , is designed to improve the decision-making process of an institution that now has 27 member states .
it also gives the european parliament a greater say .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 20.06.2008 eu defies us , lifts sanctions on cuba großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu will continue to press cuba to improve its human rights record the foreign ministers of the 27-nation eu bloc have agreed to scrap sanctions against cuba .
the caribbean country 's northern neighbor is bound to be angered by the move . the move is expected to place brussels and washington on a collision course and drew criticism from cuban dissidents .
the vote on thursday , june 19 , scrapped the sanctions that were imposed in 2003 , suspended in 2005 and are largely symbolic .
they include limits on high-level government visits and the role of eu diplomats in cuba 's cultural events and do not approach the hard line of the 46-year-old us sanctions , which include a trade and investment embargo .
" cosmetic changes " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has prohibited all exports to cuba since 1960 earlier thursday , a us state department spokesman said washington opposed any moves to ease sanctions on cuba , saying that reforms so far under new cuban president raul castro are " some very minor , cosmetic changes " that have fallen well short of ending decades of repressive policies under his brother , fidel castro .
the end of sanctions would give legitimacy to a dictatorial regime , deputy spokesman tom casey said , and countries should not signal that the " continued oppression of the cuban people is any more acceptable now than in the past . "
dissidents in cuba also objected to the lifting of the sanctions , charging the european union with being " hypocritical . "
" it gives me pain , and i 'm ashamed of governments that , far from promoting the democratic values under which they live , are made accomplices to one of the last dictatorships in the world , " vladimiro roca , one of cuba 's best known dissidents and leader of the illegal social democratic party , told dpa news agency .
encouraging reform although eu diplomats said the lifting of the sanctions was aimed at encouraging democratic reforms on cuba , the economist oscar espinosa , one of 75 dissidents whose 2003 arrests led to the eu sanctions , warned the move could harden the attitude of cuba 's communist government .
" it is worrisome because the lifting of the sanctions without something in return from cuba could have a very negative effect on cuba 's internal affairs , " espinosa said .
" it could send a signal to the hardline sectors of the government that it pays to be intransigent and inflexible . "
hypocritical as the european union ceased high-level contacts with cuba 's government in 2003 , it also increased its contacts with cuba 's dissidents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cuba is now expected to become more tolerant of dissidents but the sanctions were suspended in 2005 , and spain pushed to have them officially lifted after fidel castro withdrew as cuba 's leader and raul castro , who took over as president in february , implemented reforms , including giving unused state land to farmers and allowing ordinary cubans to use mobile phones , stay in tourist hotels and buy energy-consuming goods like dvd players and personal computers .
while the eu saw signs of liberalization in those moves , cuba 's dissidents said they have seen no change in the government 's treatment of the opposition .
for instance , of the 75 dissidents jailed in 2003 , 55 remain in custody .
the lifting of the sanctions " confirms once more that , with some notable exceptions , the eu is following a hypocritical policy exclusively concerned with its economic interests and not about cuba entering the circle of the democratic nations of the world , " said roca , who is a recipient of the eu 's sakharov prize for freedom of thought .
the czech republic and sweden have been reluctant to lift the sanctions and have demanded that cuba make progress in freeing political prisoners and implement other human rights concessions .
as a result , the eu 's decision is subject to a review in a year , diplomats said . dpa news agency -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the caribbean country 's northern neighbor is bound to be angered by the move . the move is expected to place brussels and washington on a collision course and drew criticism from cuban dissidents .
the vote on thursday , june 19 , scrapped the sanctions that were imposed in 2003 , suspended in 2005 and are largely symbolic .
they include limits on high-level government visits and the role of eu diplomats in cuba 's cultural events and do not approach the hard line of the 46-year-old us sanctions , which include a trade and investment embargo .
" cosmetic changes " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has prohibited all exports to cuba since 1960 earlier thursday , a us state department spokesman said washington opposed any moves to ease sanctions on cuba , saying that reforms so far under new cuban president raul castro are " some very minor , cosmetic changes " that have fallen well short of ending decades of repressive policies under his brother , fidel castro .
the end of sanctions would give legitimacy to a dictatorial regime , deputy spokesman tom casey said , and countries should not signal that the " continued oppression of the cuban people is any more acceptable now than in the past . "
dissidents in cuba also objected to the lifting of the sanctions , charging the european union with being " hypocritical . "
" it gives me pain , and i 'm ashamed of governments that , far from promoting the democratic values under which they live , are made accomplices to one of the last dictatorships in the world , " vladimiro roca , one of cuba 's best known dissidents and leader of the illegal social democratic party , told dpa news agency .
encouraging reform although eu diplomats said the lifting of the sanctions was aimed at encouraging democratic reforms on cuba , the economist oscar espinosa , one of 75 dissidents whose 2003 arrests led to the eu sanctions , warned the move could harden the attitude of cuba 's communist government .
" it is worrisome because the lifting of the sanctions without something in return from cuba could have a very negative effect on cuba 's internal affairs , " espinosa said .
" it could send a signal to the hardline sectors of the government that it pays to be intransigent and inflexible . "
hypocritical as the european union ceased high-level contacts with cuba 's government in 2003 , it also increased its contacts with cuba 's dissidents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cuba is now expected to become more tolerant of dissidents but the sanctions were suspended in 2005 , and spain pushed to have them officially lifted after fidel castro withdrew as cuba 's leader and raul castro , who took over as president in february , implemented reforms , including giving unused state land to farmers and allowing ordinary cubans to use mobile phones , stay in tourist hotels and buy energy-consuming goods like dvd players and personal computers .
while the eu saw signs of liberalization in those moves , cuba 's dissidents said they have seen no change in the government 's treatment of the opposition .
for instance , of the 75 dissidents jailed in 2003 , 55 remain in custody .
the lifting of the sanctions " confirms once more that , with some notable exceptions , the eu is following a hypocritical policy exclusively concerned with its economic interests and not about cuba entering the circle of the democratic nations of the world , " said roca , who is a recipient of the eu 's sakharov prize for freedom of thought .
the czech republic and sweden have been reluctant to lift the sanctions and have demanded that cuba make progress in freeing political prisoners and implement other human rights concessions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 20.06.2008 nostalgic germans blame the euro for faltering economy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one third of germans want a return to the d-mark , a symbol of the 1950s economic miracle .
trade union critics say that the social market economy is not working so well anymore for germany .
older generations nostalgic for the d-mark that marked the post-war economic boom , blame the euro for inflation . sixty years ago this friday , june 20 , the allied powers introduced a new currency , the d-mark , which became the basis of social market economy that led to the federal republic of germany 's wirtschaftswunder or economic miracle in the 1950s .
but the combination of free market dynamics with a wide social net that had served germany so well in the post-war period , is “ facing a deep legitimacy crisis ” , said michael sommer , head of the confederation of german unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- , an umbrella trade union organization in an interview with the newspaper berliner zeitung .
since the middle of the 1990s , real wages have hardly gone up , with every fifth worker barely earning enough at a subsistence level , added sommer .
“ social mobility still remains an illusion for the majority of single parents , long term unemployed and immigrant groups , ” he said lashing out at big multi-national companies that put short term gains and profits ahead of a long term strategy that preserves jobs and benefits .
euro blamed for inflation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumers feel their euro is not stretching far enough with massive job cuts underway at big dax companies such as deutsche telekom and siemens , as well as general cost of living increases , many germans are feeling the pinch and blame the euro , the common eu currency introduced nearly a decade ago for inflation .
more than a third of germans would even like to have their d-mark back , according to a representative survey by the association of german banks -lrb- bdb -rrb- published friday .
when asked whether they would like to have the old national currency back to replace the euro , fully one-third of 34 respondents answered “ yes . ”
in january 1999 , the switch to the euro for 11 eu member states took place electronically , although the notes and coins were introduced three years later .
inflation has nothing to do with the euro bildunterschrift : in the post-war decades , the d-mark provided a sense of economic well-being .
the main reason for wanting the deutsche mark back was the perception that the euro was responsible for rising prices , an argument that bdb rejected saying that current inflation had everything to do with higher energy and food prices and nothing to do with the euro .
the bdb also pointed out that inflation in the euro zone over the past 10 years had even remained fairly moderate .
" since the start of currency union , inflation has , at 2 percent a year on average , been relatively limited , " said bdb chairman manfred weber .
" in this connection , the euro is one of the most stable currencies overall . ”
weber said the currency now provided a firm basis for growth in the euro zone , which has now grown to 15 members , since the eastward expansion of the eu in 2004 .
britain , which still maintains the pound sterling , is the only major eu country that has not joined the euro zone .
eu leaders have just decided at their current summit in brussels that slovakia will become the 16th member country to introduce the euro in 2009 .
older germans still think in terms of d-marks despite the bdb 's confidence in the euro , nearly half of all germans , especially elder generations who feel nostalgic for the d-mark , still calculate in the old currency , according to frankfurt psychologist and university professor henning haase .
converting to d-marks is also relatively easy since one euro was roughly two deutsche marks .

" i do n't think we will have any solutions on the table in october , " said martin .
european commission president jose manuel barroso , german chancellor angela merkel and european parliament president hans-gert poettering had been among those calling for a rapid solution to the crisis at the start of a two-day eu summit in brussels .
" we both agreed that the next meeting of the european council -lrb- of national leaders -rrb- in october will be an appropriate occasion for further discussion on this matter , " barroso said after holding crisis talks with irish premier brian cowen ahead of the meeting .
but he also warned that adapting the treaty would be " extremely difficult . "
the lisbon treaty , which replaces the doomed nice treaty and was only approved by eu leaders last december after years of wrangling , is designed to improve the decision-making process of an institution that now has 27 member states .
it also gives the european parliament a greater say .
will europe be paralyzed again ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament president wanted a rapid solution urging cowen to come up with solutions and calling on all sides to show " understanding and flexibility " , poettering warned that , with the possible exception of croatia , the eu would not be able to accommodate more countries until the new treaty came into effect .
france , which takes over the rotating presidency of the eu from slovenia on july 1 , is also among those nations particularly keen to see a rapid resolution to the problem .
its president , nicolas sarkozy , was reported as saying ahead of his arrival in brussels that he would ask ireland to hold a second referendum on the treaty .
" we will not touch the lisbon treaty , because if we do we will have to start from zero , " one advisor to the french government said .
as well enjoying backing from the german government , france has the support of denmark , with prime minister anders fogh rasmussen calling on the treaty to come into force by april 2009 , so as to allow the next european parliament to be elected in june according to the new rules .
czech republic is also resisting quick fixes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one knows quite how to respond to the irish no-vote among those who oppose talk of an irish " road map " solution being submitted at the eu 's next summit on october 15-16 is the czech republic , where the eu treaty has been placed under review by its constitutional court .
" do n't put any pressure on anybody , " czech deputy prime minister for european affairs alexandr vondra said .
" we do n't need a long reflection period , but we wo n't fix the problem during this meeting , " acknowledged slovenian prime minister janez jansa at the start of the bloc 's regular summer meeting .
overshadowing other key matters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : back in december , eu leaders thought they 'd made a breakthrough the institutional crisis overshadowed efforts by eu leaders to address pressing matters , such as surging oil and food prices .
jansa said he shared citizens ' concerns that the eu should not re-enter a long period of institutional navel-gazing , saying the summit 's agenda had not changed as a result of the irish no .
" that is why i did not change the agenda , so we will deal heavily with soaring oil and food prices and set some short , medium and long-term goals , " jansa said .
however , concrete answers to these problems also looked remote , president nicolas sarkozy 's call for fuel tax to be capped was dismissed by the leaders of germany , sweden , denmark , as well as the eu 's energy commissioner , ahead of the summit .
this was the first time that eu leaders met to discuss the fallout caused by the june 12 referendum , in which a majority of irish voters said no to the lisbon treaty . dpa news agency -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

intersport , the sporting goods group operating the official store in the vienna fan zone , sold 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 388,000 -rrb- worth of euro-related products last monday , spokesperson christian mann said .
business was higher than usual that day , because host austria was playing germany .
unexpected demand overall sales figures are hard to come by , as vendors ' agreements with uefa prevents them from releasing such information .
" demand is far higher than expected , " mann said .
intersport eybl , the part of the intersport that is uefa 's exclusive vending partner of sporting goods for the euro 2008 , expects revenues of " mid-level single-digit million euros , " another spokesperson said .
memorabilia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : image boosters inside the official vienna fan shop the other day , the atmosphere was busier than in the fan zone surrounding the store .
customers seemed to be interested mostly in buying t-shirts commemorating past games , as they were marked down to 5 euros .
but fans were also buying pricier items , like team jerseys or the official ball , store manager alexandra sallmann said .
" one would n't believe the things people are buying , " she said , pointing to little replicas of the henri delaunay trophy .
jerseys of teams that failed to move to the quarter-finals are already selling at half price , except for the austrian team colours .
the host 's t-shirts were still being bought , sallmann said .
image booster according to mann , the euro would be a financial " zero sum game " for austria 's largest sporting goods retailer .
the reason why costs would equal revenues was that intersport 's regular stores already started devoting part of their retail space for euro 2008 products last year , he said .
setting up the temporary store in the fan zone had cost as much as opening up a regular new store , he added .
" this is really about the image value , " mann said .
being seen as the exclusive sporting goods partner of the euro would help to build the brand and to expand it in the european market , where intersport shops have a share of 20 per cent .

in the small euro 2008 display area in a billa store in central vienna , soft toys of mascots trix and flix cost only 4,99 euros , compared with 20 euros in the fan zone store .
the discount was not due to slow demand , nor would the supply with merchandise be stopped , corporate spokesperson corinna tinkler said .
her company was " satisfied " with sales figures so far , she said .
the discounted merchandise was intended as an " additional bonus " for customers .
when asked whether her company would make a profit from selling products such as euro t-shirts and stationery , she said that it was " hard to say , " as the final accounting would be done after the championship finals .

intersport , the sporting goods group operating the official store in the vienna fan zone , sold 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 388,000 -rrb- worth of euro-related products last monday , spokesperson christian mann said .
business was higher than usual that day , because host austria was playing germany .
unexpected demand overall sales figures are hard to come by , as vendors ' agreements with uefa prevents them from releasing such information .
" demand is far higher than expected , " mann said .
intersport eybl , the part of the intersport that is uefa 's exclusive vending partner of sporting goods for the euro 2008 , expects revenues of " mid-level single-digit million euros , " another spokesperson said .
memorabilia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : image boosters inside the official vienna fan shop the other day , the atmosphere was busier than in the fan zone surrounding the store .
customers seemed to be interested mostly in buying t-shirts commemorating past games , as they were marked down to 5 euros .
but fans were also buying pricier items , like team jerseys or the official ball , store manager alexandra sallmann said .
" one would n't believe the things people are buying , " she said , pointing to little replicas of the henri delaunay trophy .
jerseys of teams that failed to move to the quarter-finals are already selling at half price , except for the austrian team colours .
the host 's t-shirts were still being bought , sallmann said .
image booster according to mann , the euro would be a financial " zero sum game " for austria 's largest sporting goods retailer .
the reason why costs would equal revenues was that intersport 's regular stores already started devoting part of their retail space for euro 2008 products last year , he said .
setting up the temporary store in the fan zone had cost as much as opening up a regular new store , he added .
" this is really about the image value , " mann said .
being seen as the exclusive sporting goods partner of the euro would help to build the brand and to expand it in the european market , where intersport shops have a share of 20 per cent .

in the small euro 2008 display area in a billa store in central vienna , soft toys of mascots trix and flix cost only 4,99 euros , compared with 20 euros in the fan zone store .
the discount was not due to slow demand , nor would the supply with merchandise be stopped , corporate spokesperson corinna tinkler said .
her company was " satisfied " with sales figures so far , she said .
the discounted merchandise was intended as an " additional bonus " for customers .
when asked whether her company would make a profit from selling products such as euro t-shirts and stationery , she said that it was " hard to say , " as the final accounting would be done after the championship finals .

dw 's jochen kuerten caught up with him to find out what he thinks of today 's film industry . deutsche welle : your latest movie " ulzhan " was recently screened at the festival of german film in ludwigshafen , which tends to focus on work by newcomers .
were you pleased to be invited as an elder statesmen of german cinema ?
volker schloendorff : you bet !
when i was there i noticed that there 's a renewed interest in the concept of the auteur movie .
that was what we were all about , and this is a festival that specifically sets out to put german cinema on this path .
i think that 's wonderful .
all the good directors working at the moment , including tom tykwer and christian petzol , are auteur filmmakers .
you began making films in the 1960s and today you 're one of the most experienced directors in the country . how has life changed for directors ?
what 's it like starting out as a director these days ?
when i was making my first movie " young torless " in 1966 , television had n't even arrived .
the market for movies was vast , and audiences were hungry .
so when we showed up with our " new german cinema , " it was pounced upon . back then , millions of people would watch a movie that would be seen by barely 10,000 today .
so we got off to an excellent start .
but then came a long dry patch , and basically we were rescued by television .
these days there 's been an explosion in film making which makes life very , very hard .
up to 10 times as many movies are produced , especially in germany , and it 's all made easier by digital technology and the many film funds out there .
but it 's not easy to find audiences .
the theaters screen so much - twelve movies are launched every week .
it 's very competitive .
but there are far fewer cinemas these days .
this is an issue close to your heart , is n't it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : small cinemas are struggling to survive yes , i 'm like a missionary , constantly on the road .
recently i was at a conference for local cinemas because i do believe strongly that cinema should have a place in the community - especially in the small and medium-sized towns which are increasingly over-run with bars and supermarkets .
a cinema is a place where people can meet , communicate and share an experience .
there 's more to life than the sofa and the pub .
let 's look back at your career .
you once said in an interview that winning an oscar for „ the tin drum “ opened many doors for you , and that you would never have survived so long in the film industry without it .
did you mean that success is necessary to keep working ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the tin drum " won the 1979 academy award for best foreign language film yes , you need either a name or financial success .
acclaim alone gets you nowhere .
you need to have a few movies which have made the theaters , distributors and producers a lot of money so that they remain convinced that with you , they 're onto a winner .
i think that 's the way it works .
and if you have an oeuvre and your work has either won oscars or attracted large audiences such as " death of a salesman “ and " homo faber , “ then it 's easier to get through a dry patch and still get offers and have your calls returned .
what advice would you give young filmmakers today ?
is it worth heading to the us to make movies ?
it 's very worthwhile , because it 's such an intense experience .
some things need to be learnt first-hand .
you have to have been there , to have made two or three films and felt the cold winds of the free market in country which has no subsidies at all .
then you realize how mollycoddled we are here .
that can motivate you to make films that are provocative , striking and different .
making a good movie is n't enough .
it might get you through in germany but if you want to make the leap into the wide world , then you need the us experience . interview : jochen kuerten -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

you need to have a few movies which have made the theaters , distributors and producers a lot of money so that they remain convinced that with you , they 're onto a winner .
i think that 's the way it works .
and if you have an oeuvre and your work has either won oscars or attracted large audiences such as " death of a salesman “ and " homo faber , “ then it 's easier to get through a dry patch and still get offers and have your calls returned .
what advice would you give young filmmakers today ?
is it worth heading to the us to make movies ?
it 's very worthwhile , because it 's such an intense experience .
some things need to be learnt first-hand .
you have to have been there , to have made two or three films and felt the cold winds of the free market in country which has no subsidies at all .
then you realize how mollycoddled we are here .
that can motivate you to make films that are provocative , striking and different .
making a good movie is n't enough .
it might get you through in germany but if you want to make the leap into the wide world , then you need the us experience . interview : jochen kuerten -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the university , with most of its campus in the bavarian town of eichstaett and a business school in the bigger industrial city of ingolstadt , is mainly funded by the state of bavaria , with the state 's bishops contributing 15 per cent of the budget .
the row has escalated , with suggestions of intrigue and plots rattling the provincial calm at eichstaett .
the conflict reached a head with two senior academics resigning and a bitter joint open letter last week from students and senior professors attacking the " unprecedented " church interference .
professors , who have life tenure and huge power in the german university system , often argue that academic research should be driven by a scholar 's interests rather than the demands of society .
optimistic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many want to see the university become more catholic the bishop has ordered a financial audit of recent spending by the chief executive , gottfried von der heydte , who shared control of the university with its president .
the bishop said he would not make his suspicions public .
tv news crews filmed the grey-suited auditors arriving , sending away von der heydte 's assistants and staying late into the night to search computer and paper files .
professors received letters forbidding them to speak with von der heydte .
bishop hanke said the route out of the conflict was the installation of two outside , neutral academics who would be tasked from july 1 with overseeing a fresh start .
" this is like a marital conflict , " he said .
" it 's best to get a third party to help you . "
the munich newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung said the academic credentials of the two trouble-shooters chosen by the bishop , retired sociologist rudolf fisch and historian gert melville , had impressed some professors , so the duo might be able to bridge the differences .
on wednesday , the professors backed off from further conflict , issuing a joint statement that they were confident the new management would put the university back on the right track .
hanke also met this week for two hours with student leaders , who said both sides were optimistic about the university 's future .
bishop hanke , who took office in november 2006 , has said the trouble-shooters will oversee a hunt next year for a new president .
doctrinal issues have not been raised in the dispute , but the archbishop of munich , reinhard marx , indicated this week that bishops want the university to adopt a more catholic " character " in future . dpa news agency -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but as high-end development spreads , some are saying : enough .
they fear berlin 's character could be irrevocably changed . mario feist remembers that there used to be bakeries and small grocery shops in the oderberger strasse when he first moved there in 1989 .
today , it is much easier to get a latte macchiato or a 150-euro shirt outside his front door than a loaf of bread or carton of milk .
he has watched as his street has been transformed from a dreary road marked by crumbling facades to a hip thoroughfare of renovated buildings , expensive boutiques and trendy cafés , whose sidewalks often resemble a fashion catwalk on sunny weekends .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marthashof sales office offers homes for the high-end client it 's a metamorphosis that he 's not completely comfortable with , especially since it could take on a whole new dimension once the 12,000-square-meter development of luxury apartments being constructed just outside his back window is completed .
called marthashof , it will house around 500 people , and since the square meter price for the townhouses starts at 3,000 euros , the large influx into the neighborhood will be quite well off .
" it could become a very sterile place just for rich people and not the kind of place i 'd want to live , " he said .
" i want to have different kinds of people here . "
expanding wave his concerns are not his alone .
as berlin 's gentrification process spreads to encompass more and more neighborhoods , people are beginning to push back at what they see as a danger to a vibrant , diverse city of neighborhoods featuring people of different social and economic backgrounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an unrenovated and renovated building side by side on oderberger strasse in some neighborhoods , like feist 's prenzlauer berg , gentrification has been happening for years .
but as berlin continues to pull in more investment and its international reputation attracts more wealthy people , the neighborhood has seen a construction boom in luxury apartments and townhouses , which , in comparison to london , new york or paris , can still be had on the cheap .
the fears are that as more wealthy people move in to an area , their up-market tastes will be reflected in businesses that set up shop and rents will go up , pricing out lower and middle-income people .
feist said he 's already seen it happen in his street , when a greek restaurateur was forced to move out after his rent was tripled when the building housing his eatery changed hands .
" gentrification is not a good or bad thing in itself , " said antje seidel-schuelze , a researcher at the german institute of urban affairs .
" in one way , the districts where it happens become better .
but long-established people in a neighborhood are often replaced by wealthier people .
that leads to a certain homogeneity . "
same old same it 's that threat of sameness that riles patrik technau , a 23-year-old student and prenzlauer berg native who recently organized a protest rally near marthashof and another high-end development that attracted 500 people .
his event capped a week of demonstrations across berlin by mostly left-wing groups who say they are against the rapid development and reconstruction of the city .
during the protests , at least 30 cars were set ablaze . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more up-market housing going up " new people are moving here from abroad or other parts of germany and driving out people who 've lived here 40 or 50 years , " he said .
" that 's not fair and it makes me very angry . "
and while once the gentrification seemed limited to central neighborhoods such as prenzlauer berg and mitte , it 's spreading , said andrej holm , a professor at berlin 's humbolt university who studies gentrification .
that is what is causing the anger to rise .
as people were priced out of one neighborhood , they would move .
but often the gentrification wave would follow , forcing them to move again .
now , neighborhoods that were usually seen as immune to the process , and have been long-time enclaves of ethnic communities or artists and bohemians , are attracting professionals who are tired of the boutiques and bars , and are looking for something more " authentic . "
problem is , say researchers , that the lattes , renovations and higher rents are n't usually very far behind .
keeping the mix according to holm , city governments have several instruments that can keep neighborhoods on their way up from losing their diversity , such as rent control mechanisms or the construction of new social housing , even in gentrified neighborhoods .
but he said berlin has generally abandoned these tools , particularly when it comes to low-rent housing .
" in the few lots where there is still space for construction , only things like luxury townhouses and gated communities are going up , " he said .
" the city seems to think if we increase the number of high-end apartments , it can attract the kind of people that will also improve berlin 's economic situation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gentrification wave is expected to eventually hit even areas like berlin 's neukölln district but while the upper-income influx might lift a few economic boats in berlin , it could strand people like claudia hering , who along with mario feist is part of a citizens ' initiative called aim which wants changes to the marthashof development .
" we are afraid that in two or three years we wo n't be able to live here anymore , " she said .
but would she even want to ?
according to researcher seidel-schuelze , gentrification often makes people want to leave their own neighborhoods , no matter what their history there .
not only can they perhaps no longer afford it , the new look and feel can make the place not seem like home anymore .
" i know some people who used to live -lrb- in prenzlauer berg -rrb- in the gdr and they say it 's not my district anymore and i do n't want to be with these new dinks - double income , no kids people , " she said .

but as high-end development spreads , some are saying : enough .
they fear berlin 's character could be irrevocably changed . mario feist remembers that there used to be bakeries and small grocery shops in the oderberger strasse when he first moved there in 1989 .
today , it is much easier to get a latte macchiato or a 150-euro shirt outside his front door than a loaf of bread or carton of milk .
he has watched as his street has been transformed from a dreary road marked by crumbling facades to a hip thoroughfare of renovated buildings , expensive boutiques and trendy cafés , whose sidewalks often resemble a fashion catwalk on sunny weekends .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marthashof sales office offers homes for the high-end client it 's a metamorphosis that he 's not completely comfortable with , especially since it could take on a whole new dimension once the 12,000-square-meter development of luxury apartments being constructed just outside his back window is completed .
called marthashof , it will house around 500 people , and since the square meter price for the townhouses starts at 3,000 euros , the large influx into the neighborhood will be quite well off .
" it could become a very sterile place just for rich people and not the kind of place i 'd want to live , " he said .
" i want to have different kinds of people here . "
expanding wave his concerns are not his alone .
as berlin 's gentrification process spreads to encompass more and more neighborhoods , people are beginning to push back at what they see as a danger to a vibrant , diverse city of neighborhoods featuring people of different social and economic backgrounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an unrenovated and renovated building side by side on oderberger strasse in some neighborhoods , like feist 's prenzlauer berg , gentrification has been happening for years .
but as berlin continues to pull in more investment and its international reputation attracts more wealthy people , the neighborhood has seen a construction boom in luxury apartments and townhouses , which , in comparison to london , new york or paris , can still be had on the cheap .
the fears are that as more wealthy people move in to an area , their up-market tastes will be reflected in businesses that set up shop and rents will go up , pricing out lower and middle-income people .
feist said he 's already seen it happen in his street , when a greek restaurateur was forced to move out after his rent was tripled when the building housing his eatery changed hands .
" gentrification is not a good or bad thing in itself , " said antje seidel-schuelze , a researcher at the german institute of urban affairs .
" in one way , the districts where it happens become better .
but long-established people in a neighborhood are often replaced by wealthier people .
that leads to a certain homogeneity . "
same old same it 's that threat of sameness that riles patrik technau , a 23-year-old student and prenzlauer berg native who recently organized a protest rally near marthashof and another high-end development that attracted 500 people .
his event capped a week of demonstrations across berlin by mostly left-wing groups who say they are against the rapid development and reconstruction of the city .
during the protests , at least 30 cars were set ablaze . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more up-market housing going up " new people are moving here from abroad or other parts of germany and driving out people who 've lived here 40 or 50 years , " he said .
" that 's not fair and it makes me very angry . "
and while once the gentrification seemed limited to central neighborhoods such as prenzlauer berg and mitte , it 's spreading , said andrej holm , a professor at berlin 's humbolt university who studies gentrification .
that is what is causing the anger to rise .
as people were priced out of one neighborhood , they would move .
but often the gentrification wave would follow , forcing them to move again .
now , neighborhoods that were usually seen as immune to the process , and have been long-time enclaves of ethnic communities or artists and bohemians , are attracting professionals who are tired of the boutiques and bars , and are looking for something more " authentic . "
problem is , say researchers , that the lattes , renovations and higher rents are n't usually very far behind .
keeping the mix according to holm , city governments have several instruments that can keep neighborhoods on their way up from losing their diversity , such as rent control mechanisms or the construction of new social housing , even in gentrified neighborhoods .
but he said berlin has generally abandoned these tools , particularly when it comes to low-rent housing .
" in the few lots where there is still space for construction , only things like luxury townhouses and gated communities are going up , " he said .
" the city seems to think if we increase the number of high-end apartments , it can attract the kind of people that will also improve berlin 's economic situation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gentrification wave is expected to eventually hit even areas like berlin 's neukölln district but while the upper-income influx might lift a few economic boats in berlin , it could strand people like claudia hering , who along with mario feist is part of a citizens ' initiative called aim which wants changes to the marthashof development .
" we are afraid that in two or three years we wo n't be able to live here anymore , " she said .
but would she even want to ?
according to researcher seidel-schuelze , gentrification often makes people want to leave their own neighborhoods , no matter what their history there .
not only can they perhaps no longer afford it , the new look and feel can make the place not seem like home anymore .
" i know some people who used to live -lrb- in prenzlauer berg -rrb- in the gdr and they say it 's not my district anymore and i do n't want to be with these new dinks - double income , no kids people , " she said .

prague 's parliamentary ratification was suspended in late april as it was going through the lower chamber , after the senate demanded a constitutional court ruling on whether the treaty conforms with the czech constitution .
in addition to this obstacle , the czech republic 's eurosceptic president vaclav klaus has already insisted the irish vote had killed off the document , meant to help the eu operate more efficiently as it grows .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish premier brian cowen has a lot of explaining to do to make matters worse , a british court challenge for a referendum forced prime minister gordon brown to concede at the summit that the the treaty was invalid without a ruling .
" ratification will not take place of course until we have had the judgement , " he said .
a judge at london 's high court called on the british government to delay ratification until he ruled on a legal bid to force a referendum .

prague 's parliamentary ratification was suspended in late april as it was going through the lower chamber , after the senate demanded a constitutional court ruling on whether the treaty conforms with the czech constitution .
in addition to this obstacle , the czech republic 's eurosceptic president vaclav klaus has already insisted the irish vote had killed off the document , meant to help the eu operate more efficiently as it grows .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish premier brian cowen has a lot of explaining to do to make matters worse , a british court challenge for a referendum forced prime minister gordon brown to concede at the summit that the the treaty was invalid without a ruling .
" ratification will not take place of course until we have had the judgement , " he said .
a judge at london 's high court called on the british government to delay ratification until he ruled on a legal bid to force a referendum .
in the end , eu leaders agreed on friday to give ireland at least until october to come up with recommendations on the way ahead . in a final statement , the eu said although 19 member states have ratified the treaty , " more time was needed to analyse the situation . " merkel , sarkozy say no new members eu leaders also failed to find common ground on whether the bloc could still absorb new members after the treaty 's rejection by ireland . the reform charter was intended to make the enlargement process more manageable by streamlining the european union 's institutions .
the treaty is also meant to give the eu more clout on in foreign affairs after the large eastward expansion of the bloc since 2004 , when 12 new members joined . german chancellor angela merkel on friday backed president nicolas sarkozy 's call for the european union to forget about adding new members until it finds a solution to ireland 's rejection of an eu reform treaty .

it 's part of the 2008 oerol festival , a site-specific experimental theater event .
the work " is a little bit like going back to the roots of my work .
so that is interesting for me , " said wilson .
in the 1970s , he produced " ka mountain and guardenia terrace , " a continuous seven-day silent play staged on a mountaintop in iran .
renowned for producing elaborate and evocative stage sets , exhibitions and installations , wilson 's works are noted for his use of very slow movement and extremes in space or time .
" walking " is a collaboration between wilson and two dutch artists , theun mosk and boukje schweigman , where festival participants walk at a slow pace through the striking landscape of terschelling 's pastures , woodlands , sand dunes and beaches .
participants become the actors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilson is known for experimenting with extremes in time and space the walkers are asked to hand in their watches , phones , cameras , and any devices they may have that tell time , before they are taken to stand alone in a black box .
then they are guided to a large wooden room with a deep circle dug into the ground .
slow music plays in the background .
finally , a field guide leads them out to a field and sets the pace for the remaining four-hour walk on the island .
clearly , " walking " pushes the boundaries of traditional theater .
it serves as a combination of both an interactive landscape installation and a theater production : the walkers are the actors and the landscape provides the backdrop scenery for the work .
experiencing time in a new way wilson said he was drawn immediately to the dramatic landscape on the island and wanted walkers to maintain a deliberately slow pace to heighten their observation during the walk .
" our perception is different if we take more time to do something , " said wilson .
" we begin to hear and see what is there in a different way .
we begin to smell things in a different way .
there is time to reflect . "
in the early 1970s he won international acclaim for " deafman glance , " a silent opera created in collaboration with raymond andrews , who is both deaf and mute .
wilson worked together with composer philip glass on the opera " einstein on the beach . "

it 's part of the 2008 oerol festival , a site-specific experimental theater event .
the work " is a little bit like going back to the roots of my work .
so that is interesting for me , " said wilson .
in the 1970s , he produced " ka mountain and guardenia terrace , " a continuous seven-day silent play staged on a mountaintop in iran .
renowned for producing elaborate and evocative stage sets , exhibitions and installations , wilson 's works are noted for his use of very slow movement and extremes in space or time .
" walking " is a collaboration between wilson and two dutch artists , theun mosk and boukje schweigman , where festival participants walk at a slow pace through the striking landscape of terschelling 's pastures , woodlands , sand dunes and beaches .
participants become the actors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilson is known for experimenting with extremes in time and space the walkers are asked to hand in their watches , phones , cameras , and any devices they may have that tell time , before they are taken to stand alone in a black box .
then they are guided to a large wooden room with a deep circle dug into the ground .
slow music plays in the background .
finally , a field guide leads them out to a field and sets the pace for the remaining four-hour walk on the island .
clearly , " walking " pushes the boundaries of traditional theater .
it serves as a combination of both an interactive landscape installation and a theater production : the walkers are the actors and the landscape provides the backdrop scenery for the work .
experiencing time in a new way wilson said he was drawn immediately to the dramatic landscape on the island and wanted walkers to maintain a deliberately slow pace to heighten their observation during the walk .
" our perception is different if we take more time to do something , " said wilson .
" we begin to hear and see what is there in a different way .
we begin to smell things in a different way .
there is time to reflect . "
in the early 1970s he won international acclaim for " deafman glance , " a silent opera created in collaboration with raymond andrews , who is both deaf and mute .
wilson worked together with composer philip glass on the opera " einstein on the beach . "
he also collaborated with musician tom waits and writer william s. burroughs on the musical fable " the black rider . " cheryl northey send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de euro 2008 -pipe- 20.06.2008 euro merchandising a zero-sum game for vendors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flying off the shelves the european championships may have reached the quarter-final stages but austrian stores selling official fan goods say business is still brisk , even though they are starting to lower prices . overall , selling uefa euro 2008 merchandise is more a long-term investment in marketing than a way to make a profit within the few weeks of the championships , companies say .
intersport , the sporting goods group operating the official store in the vienna fan zone , sold 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 388,000 -rrb- worth of euro-related products last monday , spokesperson christian mann said .
business was higher than usual that day , because host austria was playing germany .
unexpected demand overall sales figures are hard to come by , as vendors ' agreements with uefa prevents them from releasing such information .
" demand is far higher than expected , " mann said .
intersport eybl , the part of the intersport that is uefa 's exclusive vending partner of sporting goods for the euro 2008 , expects revenues of " mid-level single-digit million euros , " another spokesperson said .
memorabilia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : image boosters inside the official vienna fan shop the other day , the atmosphere was busier than in the fan zone surrounding the store .
customers seemed to be interested mostly in buying t-shirts commemorating past games , as they were marked down to 5 euros .
but fans were also buying pricier items , like team jerseys or the official ball , store manager alexandra sallmann said .
" one would n't believe the things people are buying , " she said , pointing to little replicas of the henri delaunay trophy .
jerseys of teams that failed to move to the quarter-finals are already selling at half price , except for the austrian team colours .
the host 's t-shirts were still being bought , sallmann said .
image booster according to mann , the euro would be a financial " zero sum game " for austria 's largest sporting goods retailer .
the reason why costs would equal revenues was that intersport 's regular stores already started devoting part of their retail space for euro 2008 products last year , he said .
setting up the temporary store in the fan zone had cost as much as opening up a regular new store , he added .
" this is really about the image value , " mann said .
being seen as the exclusive sporting goods partner of the euro would help to build the brand and to expand it in the european market , where intersport shops have a share of 20 per cent .
special offers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stores are satisfied with sales at the billa supermarket chain , another official uefa sales partner , euro 2008 products have been marked down by 50 per cent since the kick-off of the championships .
in the small euro 2008 display area in a billa store in central vienna , soft toys of mascots trix and flix cost only 4,99 euros , compared with 20 euros in the fan zone store .
the discount was not due to slow demand , nor would the supply with merchandise be stopped , corporate spokesperson corinna tinkler said .
her company was " satisfied " with sales figures so far , she said .
the discounted merchandise was intended as an " additional bonus " for customers .
when asked whether her company would make a profit from selling products such as euro t-shirts and stationery , she said that it was " hard to say , " as the final accounting would be done after the championship finals .
but she also stressed that billa had chosen to become an official uefa partner because of the positive effect it had on the brand .
another factor eating away at profits are the retailers ' advance costs for obtaining the right to become official uefa partners , several sources within the industry told deutsche presse-agentur dpa .

the caribbean country 's northern neighbor is bound to be angered by the move . the move is expected to place brussels and washington on a collision course and drew criticism from cuban dissidents .
the vote on thursday , june 19 , scrapped the sanctions that were imposed in 2003 , suspended in 2005 and are largely symbolic .
they include limits on high-level government visits and the role of eu diplomats in cuba 's cultural events and do not approach the hard line of the 46-year-old us sanctions , which include a trade and investment embargo .
" cosmetic changes " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has prohibited all exports to cuba since 1960 earlier thursday , a us state department spokesman said washington opposed any moves to ease sanctions on cuba , saying that reforms so far under new cuban president raul castro are " some very minor , cosmetic changes " that have fallen well short of ending decades of repressive policies under his brother , fidel castro .
the end of sanctions would give legitimacy to a dictatorial regime , deputy spokesman tom casey said , and countries should not signal that the " continued oppression of the cuban people is any more acceptable now than in the past . "
dissidents in cuba also objected to the lifting of the sanctions , charging the european union with being " hypocritical . "
" it gives me pain , and i 'm ashamed of governments that , far from promoting the democratic values under which they live , are made accomplices to one of the last dictatorships in the world , " vladimiro roca , one of cuba 's best known dissidents and leader of the illegal social democratic party , told dpa news agency .
encouraging reform although eu diplomats said the lifting of the sanctions was aimed at encouraging democratic reforms on cuba , the economist oscar espinosa , one of 75 dissidents whose 2003 arrests led to the eu sanctions , warned the move could harden the attitude of cuba 's communist government .
" it is worrisome because the lifting of the sanctions without something in return from cuba could have a very negative effect on cuba 's internal affairs , " espinosa said .
" it could send a signal to the hardline sectors of the government that it pays to be intransigent and inflexible . "
hypocritical as the european union ceased high-level contacts with cuba 's government in 2003 , it also increased its contacts with cuba 's dissidents .

while the eu saw signs of liberalization in those moves , cuba 's dissidents said they have seen no change in the government 's treatment of the opposition .
for instance , of the 75 dissidents jailed in 2003 , 55 remain in custody .
the lifting of the sanctions " confirms once more that , with some notable exceptions , the eu is following a hypocritical policy exclusively concerned with its economic interests and not about cuba entering the circle of the democratic nations of the world , " said roca , who is a recipient of the eu 's sakharov prize for freedom of thought .

the caribbean country 's northern neighbor is bound to be angered by the move . the move is expected to place brussels and washington on a collision course and drew criticism from cuban dissidents .
the vote on thursday , june 19 , scrapped the sanctions that were imposed in 2003 , suspended in 2005 and are largely symbolic .
they include limits on high-level government visits and the role of eu diplomats in cuba 's cultural events and do not approach the hard line of the 46-year-old us sanctions , which include a trade and investment embargo .
" cosmetic changes " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has prohibited all exports to cuba since 1960 earlier thursday , a us state department spokesman said washington opposed any moves to ease sanctions on cuba , saying that reforms so far under new cuban president raul castro are " some very minor , cosmetic changes " that have fallen well short of ending decades of repressive policies under his brother , fidel castro .
the end of sanctions would give legitimacy to a dictatorial regime , deputy spokesman tom casey said , and countries should not signal that the " continued oppression of the cuban people is any more acceptable now than in the past . "
dissidents in cuba also objected to the lifting of the sanctions , charging the european union with being " hypocritical . "
" it gives me pain , and i 'm ashamed of governments that , far from promoting the democratic values under which they live , are made accomplices to one of the last dictatorships in the world , " vladimiro roca , one of cuba 's best known dissidents and leader of the illegal social democratic party , told dpa news agency .
encouraging reform although eu diplomats said the lifting of the sanctions was aimed at encouraging democratic reforms on cuba , the economist oscar espinosa , one of 75 dissidents whose 2003 arrests led to the eu sanctions , warned the move could harden the attitude of cuba 's communist government .
" it is worrisome because the lifting of the sanctions without something in return from cuba could have a very negative effect on cuba 's internal affairs , " espinosa said .
" it could send a signal to the hardline sectors of the government that it pays to be intransigent and inflexible . "
hypocritical as the european union ceased high-level contacts with cuba 's government in 2003 , it also increased its contacts with cuba 's dissidents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cuba is now expected to become more tolerant of dissidents but the sanctions were suspended in 2005 , and spain pushed to have them officially lifted after fidel castro withdrew as cuba 's leader and raul castro , who took over as president in february , implemented reforms , including giving unused state land to farmers and allowing ordinary cubans to use mobile phones , stay in tourist hotels and buy energy-consuming goods like dvd players and personal computers .
while the eu saw signs of liberalization in those moves , cuba 's dissidents said they have seen no change in the government 's treatment of the opposition .
for instance , of the 75 dissidents jailed in 2003 , 55 remain in custody .
the lifting of the sanctions " confirms once more that , with some notable exceptions , the eu is following a hypocritical policy exclusively concerned with its economic interests and not about cuba entering the circle of the democratic nations of the world , " said roca , who is a recipient of the eu 's sakharov prize for freedom of thought .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 20.06.2008 germany 's catholic church and academics battle over university großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eichstaett has become the scene of a bitter ideological batttle a power struggle reached a climax this week between the catholic church and academics at the german-speaking world 's sole catholic university , raising questions about whether faith and scholarship can get along . the catholic university of eichstaett -lrb- ku -rrb- has been operating for months without a head after gregor maria hanke , the bishop of eichstaett , refused to appoint a principal who had been nominated by the university 's professors .
the university in germany 's bavaria state has about 4,500 students and teaches regular arts , science and business courses .
this week , the bishop , with express backing from other bavarian bishops , also suspended the university 's administrative head and appointed two temporary new chiefs , saying a fresh start was needed .
refuge of faith bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavaria 's most famous son whereas the church sees its university as a refuge of faith in a nation that is increasingly hostile to religion , professors have painted the struggle as a battle for academic liberty and autonomy , as claimed by universities around the globe .
interest in the dispute has been heightened by the fact that pope benedict xvi is a bavarian and was a formerly a professor in the state , at a different university , regensburg .
the vatican has not spoken out about the row .
unlike at theology colleges , students do not have to be catholic to attend ku .
as at most german state universities , the tuition fees are minimal compared to those in most western nations .
irreconcilable differences to some , the row brings back memories of the vatican 's desire in 1979 to remove the dissident swiss-born theologian hans kueng from his professor-of-theology post at the german university of tuebingen .
however the man at the center of the latest tussle , ulrich hemel , is not a theologian but a business executive whose main academic subject has been the religious formation of children .
hemel was chosen by eichstaett professors to become " president , " a german university 's top academic official , earlier this year , but bishop hanke flatly refused to bless hemel 's appointment and certification needed by hemel from the vatican never arrived .
newspapers speculated that the bishop was disturbed by the fact that hemel had been married three times , but whatever the origin , it is clear that the bishop and hemel have an irreconcilable antipathy .
the bishop 's stated objections to hemel include an accusation that hemel blabbed to the media after they talked .
the catholic newspaper tagespost quoted bishop hanke , who is grand chancellor , or ceremonial chief of the university , saying hemel had never been a full professor and had no recent scholarly publications .
uniquely german bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bischop gregor maria hanke there are catholic universities in the united states , but ku , founded in 1980 , has a uniquely german form of government .
the university , with most of its campus in the bavarian town of eichstaett and a business school in the bigger industrial city of ingolstadt , is mainly funded by the state of bavaria , with the state 's bishops contributing 15 per cent of the budget .
the row has escalated , with suggestions of intrigue and plots rattling the provincial calm at eichstaett .
the conflict reached a head with two senior academics resigning and a bitter joint open letter last week from students and senior professors attacking the " unprecedented " church interference .
professors , who have life tenure and huge power in the german university system , often argue that academic research should be driven by a scholar 's interests rather than the demands of society .
optimistic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many want to see the university become more catholic the bishop has ordered a financial audit of recent spending by the chief executive , gottfried von der heydte , who shared control of the university with its president .
the bishop said he would not make his suspicions public .
tv news crews filmed the grey-suited auditors arriving , sending away von der heydte 's assistants and staying late into the night to search computer and paper files .
professors received letters forbidding them to speak with von der heydte .
bishop hanke said the route out of the conflict was the installation of two outside , neutral academics who would be tasked from july 1 with overseeing a fresh start .
" this is like a marital conflict , " he said .
" it 's best to get a third party to help you . "
the munich newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung said the academic credentials of the two trouble-shooters chosen by the bishop , retired sociologist rudolf fisch and historian gert melville , had impressed some professors , so the duo might be able to bridge the differences .
on wednesday , the professors backed off from further conflict , issuing a joint statement that they were confident the new management would put the university back on the right track .
hanke also met this week for two hours with student leaders , who said both sides were optimistic about the university 's future .
bishop hanke , who took office in november 2006 , has said the trouble-shooters will oversee a hunt next year for a new president .
doctrinal issues have not been raised in the dispute , but the archbishop of munich , reinhard marx , indicated this week that bishops want the university to adopt a more catholic " character " in future . dpa news agency -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the university in germany 's bavaria state has about 4,500 students and teaches regular arts , science and business courses .
this week , the bishop , with express backing from other bavarian bishops , also suspended the university 's administrative head and appointed two temporary new chiefs , saying a fresh start was needed .
refuge of faith bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavaria 's most famous son whereas the church sees its university as a refuge of faith in a nation that is increasingly hostile to religion , professors have painted the struggle as a battle for academic liberty and autonomy , as claimed by universities around the globe .
interest in the dispute has been heightened by the fact that pope benedict xvi is a bavarian and was a formerly a professor in the state , at a different university , regensburg .
the vatican has not spoken out about the row .
unlike at theology colleges , students do not have to be catholic to attend ku .
as at most german state universities , the tuition fees are minimal compared to those in most western nations .
irreconcilable differences to some , the row brings back memories of the vatican 's desire in 1979 to remove the dissident swiss-born theologian hans kueng from his professor-of-theology post at the german university of tuebingen .
however the man at the center of the latest tussle , ulrich hemel , is not a theologian but a business executive whose main academic subject has been the religious formation of children .
hemel was chosen by eichstaett professors to become " president , " a german university 's top academic official , earlier this year , but bishop hanke flatly refused to bless hemel 's appointment and certification needed by hemel from the vatican never arrived .
newspapers speculated that the bishop was disturbed by the fact that hemel had been married three times , but whatever the origin , it is clear that the bishop and hemel have an irreconcilable antipathy .
the bishop 's stated objections to hemel include an accusation that hemel blabbed to the media after they talked .
the catholic newspaper tagespost quoted bishop hanke , who is grand chancellor , or ceremonial chief of the university , saying hemel had never been a full professor and had no recent scholarly publications .
uniquely german bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bischop gregor maria hanke there are catholic universities in the united states , but ku , founded in 1980 , has a uniquely german form of government .
the university , with most of its campus in the bavarian town of eichstaett and a business school in the bigger industrial city of ingolstadt , is mainly funded by the state of bavaria , with the state 's bishops contributing 15 per cent of the budget .
the row has escalated , with suggestions of intrigue and plots rattling the provincial calm at eichstaett .
the conflict reached a head with two senior academics resigning and a bitter joint open letter last week from students and senior professors attacking the " unprecedented " church interference .
professors , who have life tenure and huge power in the german university system , often argue that academic research should be driven by a scholar 's interests rather than the demands of society .
optimistic bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many want to see the university become more catholic the bishop has ordered a financial audit of recent spending by the chief executive , gottfried von der heydte , who shared control of the university with its president .
the bishop said he would not make his suspicions public .
tv news crews filmed the grey-suited auditors arriving , sending away von der heydte 's assistants and staying late into the night to search computer and paper files .
professors received letters forbidding them to speak with von der heydte .
bishop hanke said the route out of the conflict was the installation of two outside , neutral academics who would be tasked from july 1 with overseeing a fresh start .
" this is like a marital conflict , " he said .
" it 's best to get a third party to help you . "
the munich newspaper sueddeutsche zeitung said the academic credentials of the two trouble-shooters chosen by the bishop , retired sociologist rudolf fisch and historian gert melville , had impressed some professors , so the duo might be able to bridge the differences .
on wednesday , the professors backed off from further conflict , issuing a joint statement that they were confident the new management would put the university back on the right track .
hanke also met this week for two hours with student leaders , who said both sides were optimistic about the university 's future .
bishop hanke , who took office in november 2006 , has said the trouble-shooters will oversee a hunt next year for a new president .
doctrinal issues have not been raised in the dispute , but the archbishop of munich , reinhard marx , indicated this week that bishops want the university to adopt a more catholic " character " in future . dpa news agency -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

trade union critics say that the social market economy is not working so well anymore for germany .
older generations nostalgic for the d-mark that marked the post-war economic boom , blame the euro for inflation . sixty years ago this friday , june 20 , the allied powers introduced a new currency , the d-mark , which became the basis of social market economy that led to the federal republic of germany 's wirtschaftswunder or economic miracle in the 1950s .
but the combination of free market dynamics with a wide social net that had served germany so well in the post-war period , is “ facing a deep legitimacy crisis ” , said michael sommer , head of the confederation of german unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- , an umbrella trade union organization in an interview with the newspaper berliner zeitung .
since the middle of the 1990s , real wages have hardly gone up , with every fifth worker barely earning enough at a subsistence level , added sommer .
“ social mobility still remains an illusion for the majority of single parents , long term unemployed and immigrant groups , ” he said lashing out at big multi-national companies that put short term gains and profits ahead of a long term strategy that preserves jobs and benefits .
euro blamed for inflation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumers feel their euro is not stretching far enough with massive job cuts underway at big dax companies such as deutsche telekom and siemens , as well as general cost of living increases , many germans are feeling the pinch and blame the euro , the common eu currency introduced nearly a decade ago for inflation .
more than a third of germans would even like to have their d-mark back , according to a representative survey by the association of german banks -lrb- bdb -rrb- published friday .
when asked whether they would like to have the old national currency back to replace the euro , fully one-third of 34 respondents answered “ yes . ”
in january 1999 , the switch to the euro for 11 eu member states took place electronically , although the notes and coins were introduced three years later .
inflation has nothing to do with the euro bildunterschrift : in the post-war decades , the d-mark provided a sense of economic well-being .
the main reason for wanting the deutsche mark back was the perception that the euro was responsible for rising prices , an argument that bdb rejected saying that current inflation had everything to do with higher energy and food prices and nothing to do with the euro .
the bdb also pointed out that inflation in the euro zone over the past 10 years had even remained fairly moderate .
" since the start of currency union , inflation has , at 2 percent a year on average , been relatively limited , " said bdb chairman manfred weber .
" in this connection , the euro is one of the most stable currencies overall . ”
weber said the currency now provided a firm basis for growth in the euro zone , which has now grown to 15 members , since the eastward expansion of the eu in 2004 .
britain , which still maintains the pound sterling , is the only major eu country that has not joined the euro zone .
eu leaders have just decided at their current summit in brussels that slovakia will become the 16th member country to introduce the euro in 2009 .
older germans still think in terms of d-marks despite the bdb 's confidence in the euro , nearly half of all germans , especially elder generations who feel nostalgic for the d-mark , still calculate in the old currency , according to frankfurt psychologist and university professor henning haase .
converting to d-marks is also relatively easy since one euro was roughly two deutsche marks .
" particularly in times of higher inflation , many people long for the return of the d-mark , " haase said , but added that that while an inflation rate of 3.1 percent is now perceived as high , inflation had " the deutsche mark is still firmly anchored in many minds as a stable currency , " he said . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

since the middle of the 1990s , real wages have hardly gone up , with every fifth worker barely earning enough at a subsistence level , added sommer .
“ social mobility still remains an illusion for the majority of single parents , long term unemployed and immigrant groups , ” he said lashing out at big multi-national companies that put short term gains and profits ahead of a long term strategy that preserves jobs and benefits .
euro blamed for inflation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumers feel their euro is not stretching far enough with massive job cuts underway at big dax companies such as deutsche telekom and siemens , as well as general cost of living increases , many germans are feeling the pinch and blame the euro , the common eu currency introduced nearly a decade ago for inflation .
more than a third of germans would even like to have their d-mark back , according to a representative survey by the association of german banks -lrb- bdb -rrb- published friday .
when asked whether they would like to have the old national currency back to replace the euro , fully one-third of 34 respondents answered “ yes . ”
in january 1999 , the switch to the euro for 11 eu member states took place electronically , although the notes and coins were introduced three years later .
inflation has nothing to do with the euro bildunterschrift : in the post-war decades , the d-mark provided a sense of economic well-being .
the main reason for wanting the deutsche mark back was the perception that the euro was responsible for rising prices , an argument that bdb rejected saying that current inflation had everything to do with higher energy and food prices and nothing to do with the euro .
the bdb also pointed out that inflation in the euro zone over the past 10 years had even remained fairly moderate .
" since the start of currency union , inflation has , at 2 percent a year on average , been relatively limited , " said bdb chairman manfred weber .
" in this connection , the euro is one of the most stable currencies overall . ”
weber said the currency now provided a firm basis for growth in the euro zone , which has now grown to 15 members , since the eastward expansion of the eu in 2004 .
britain , which still maintains the pound sterling , is the only major eu country that has not joined the euro zone .
eu leaders have just decided at their current summit in brussels that slovakia will become the 16th member country to introduce the euro in 2009 .
older germans still think in terms of d-marks despite the bdb 's confidence in the euro , nearly half of all germans , especially elder generations who feel nostalgic for the d-mark , still calculate in the old currency , according to frankfurt psychologist and university professor henning haase .
converting to d-marks is also relatively easy since one euro was roughly two deutsche marks .
" particularly in times of higher inflation , many people long for the return of the d-mark , " haase said , but added that that while an inflation rate of 3.1 percent is now perceived as high , inflation had " the deutsche mark is still firmly anchored in many minds as a stable currency , " he said . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 20.06.2008 nostalgic germans blame the euro for faltering economy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one third of germans want a return to the d-mark , a symbol of the 1950s economic miracle .
trade union critics say that the social market economy is not working so well anymore for germany .
older generations nostalgic for the d-mark that marked the post-war economic boom , blame the euro for inflation . sixty years ago this friday , june 20 , the allied powers introduced a new currency , the d-mark , which became the basis of social market economy that led to the federal republic of germany 's wirtschaftswunder or economic miracle in the 1950s .
but the combination of free market dynamics with a wide social net that had served germany so well in the post-war period , is “ facing a deep legitimacy crisis ” , said michael sommer , head of the confederation of german unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- , an umbrella trade union organization in an interview with the newspaper berliner zeitung .
since the middle of the 1990s , real wages have hardly gone up , with every fifth worker barely earning enough at a subsistence level , added sommer .
“ social mobility still remains an illusion for the majority of single parents , long term unemployed and immigrant groups , ” he said lashing out at big multi-national companies that put short term gains and profits ahead of a long term strategy that preserves jobs and benefits .
euro blamed for inflation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumers feel their euro is not stretching far enough with massive job cuts underway at big dax companies such as deutsche telekom and siemens , as well as general cost of living increases , many germans are feeling the pinch and blame the euro , the common eu currency introduced nearly a decade ago for inflation .
more than a third of germans would even like to have their d-mark back , according to a representative survey by the association of german banks -lrb- bdb -rrb- published friday .
when asked whether they would like to have the old national currency back to replace the euro , fully one-third of 34 respondents answered “ yes . ”
in january 1999 , the switch to the euro for 11 eu member states took place electronically , although the notes and coins were introduced three years later .
inflation has nothing to do with the euro bildunterschrift : in the post-war decades , the d-mark provided a sense of economic well-being .
the main reason for wanting the deutsche mark back was the perception that the euro was responsible for rising prices , an argument that bdb rejected saying that current inflation had everything to do with higher energy and food prices and nothing to do with the euro .
the bdb also pointed out that inflation in the euro zone over the past 10 years had even remained fairly moderate .
" since the start of currency union , inflation has , at 2 percent a year on average , been relatively limited , " said bdb chairman manfred weber .
" in this connection , the euro is one of the most stable currencies overall . ”
weber said the currency now provided a firm basis for growth in the euro zone , which has now grown to 15 members , since the eastward expansion of the eu in 2004 .
britain , which still maintains the pound sterling , is the only major eu country that has not joined the euro zone .
eu leaders have just decided at their current summit in brussels that slovakia will become the 16th member country to introduce the euro in 2009 .
older germans still think in terms of d-marks despite the bdb 's confidence in the euro , nearly half of all germans , especially elder generations who feel nostalgic for the d-mark , still calculate in the old currency , according to frankfurt psychologist and university professor henning haase .
converting to d-marks is also relatively easy since one euro was roughly two deutsche marks .
" particularly in times of higher inflation , many people long for the return of the d-mark , " haase said , but added that that while an inflation rate of 3.1 percent is now perceived as high , inflation had " the deutsche mark is still firmly anchored in many minds as a stable currency , " he said . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i do n't think we will have any solutions on the table in october , " said martin .
european commission president jose manuel barroso , german chancellor angela merkel and european parliament president hans-gert poettering had been among those calling for a rapid solution to the crisis at the start of a two-day eu summit in brussels .
" we both agreed that the next meeting of the european council -lrb- of national leaders -rrb- in october will be an appropriate occasion for further discussion on this matter , " barroso said after holding crisis talks with irish premier brian cowen ahead of the meeting .
but he also warned that adapting the treaty would be " extremely difficult . "
the lisbon treaty , which replaces the doomed nice treaty and was only approved by eu leaders last december after years of wrangling , is designed to improve the decision-making process of an institution that now has 27 member states .
it also gives the european parliament a greater say .
will europe be paralyzed again ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european parliament president wanted a rapid solution urging cowen to come up with solutions and calling on all sides to show " understanding and flexibility " , poettering warned that , with the possible exception of croatia , the eu would not be able to accommodate more countries until the new treaty came into effect .
france , which takes over the rotating presidency of the eu from slovenia on july 1 , is also among those nations particularly keen to see a rapid resolution to the problem .
its president , nicolas sarkozy , was reported as saying ahead of his arrival in brussels that he would ask ireland to hold a second referendum on the treaty .
" we will not touch the lisbon treaty , because if we do we will have to start from zero , " one advisor to the french government said .
as well enjoying backing from the german government , france has the support of denmark , with prime minister anders fogh rasmussen calling on the treaty to come into force by april 2009 , so as to allow the next european parliament to be elected in june according to the new rules .
czech republic is also resisting quick fixes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one knows quite how to respond to the irish no-vote among those who oppose talk of an irish " road map " solution being submitted at the eu 's next summit on october 15-16 is the czech republic , where the eu treaty has been placed under review by its constitutional court .
" do n't put any pressure on anybody , " czech deputy prime minister for european affairs alexandr vondra said .
" we do n't need a long reflection period , but we wo n't fix the problem during this meeting , " acknowledged slovenian prime minister janez jansa at the start of the bloc 's regular summer meeting .
overshadowing other key matters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : back in december , eu leaders thought they 'd made a breakthrough the institutional crisis overshadowed efforts by eu leaders to address pressing matters , such as surging oil and food prices .
jansa said he shared citizens ' concerns that the eu should not re-enter a long period of institutional navel-gazing , saying the summit 's agenda had not changed as a result of the irish no .
" that is why i did not change the agenda , so we will deal heavily with soaring oil and food prices and set some short , medium and long-term goals , " jansa said .
however , concrete answers to these problems also looked remote , president nicolas sarkozy 's call for fuel tax to be capped was dismissed by the leaders of germany , sweden , denmark , as well as the eu 's energy commissioner , ahead of the summit .
this was the first time that eu leaders met to discuss the fallout caused by the june 12 referendum , in which a majority of irish voters said no to the lisbon treaty . dpa news agency -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

intersport , the sporting goods group operating the official store in the vienna fan zone , sold 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 388,000 -rrb- worth of euro-related products last monday , spokesperson christian mann said .
business was higher than usual that day , because host austria was playing germany .
unexpected demand overall sales figures are hard to come by , as vendors ' agreements with uefa prevents them from releasing such information .
" demand is far higher than expected , " mann said .
intersport eybl , the part of the intersport that is uefa 's exclusive vending partner of sporting goods for the euro 2008 , expects revenues of " mid-level single-digit million euros , " another spokesperson said .
memorabilia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : image boosters inside the official vienna fan shop the other day , the atmosphere was busier than in the fan zone surrounding the store .
customers seemed to be interested mostly in buying t-shirts commemorating past games , as they were marked down to 5 euros .
but fans were also buying pricier items , like team jerseys or the official ball , store manager alexandra sallmann said .
" one would n't believe the things people are buying , " she said , pointing to little replicas of the henri delaunay trophy .
jerseys of teams that failed to move to the quarter-finals are already selling at half price , except for the austrian team colours .
the host 's t-shirts were still being bought , sallmann said .
image booster according to mann , the euro would be a financial " zero sum game " for austria 's largest sporting goods retailer .
the reason why costs would equal revenues was that intersport 's regular stores already started devoting part of their retail space for euro 2008 products last year , he said .
setting up the temporary store in the fan zone had cost as much as opening up a regular new store , he added .
" this is really about the image value , " mann said .
being seen as the exclusive sporting goods partner of the euro would help to build the brand and to expand it in the european market , where intersport shops have a share of 20 per cent .
special offers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stores are satisfied with sales at the billa supermarket chain , another official uefa sales partner , euro 2008 products have been marked down by 50 per cent since the kick-off of the championships .
in the small euro 2008 display area in a billa store in central vienna , soft toys of mascots trix and flix cost only 4,99 euros , compared with 20 euros in the fan zone store .
the discount was not due to slow demand , nor would the supply with merchandise be stopped , corporate spokesperson corinna tinkler said .
her company was " satisfied " with sales figures so far , she said .
the discounted merchandise was intended as an " additional bonus " for customers .
when asked whether her company would make a profit from selling products such as euro t-shirts and stationery , she said that it was " hard to say , " as the final accounting would be done after the championship finals .
but she also stressed that billa had chosen to become an official uefa partner because of the positive effect it had on the brand .
another factor eating away at profits are the retailers ' advance costs for obtaining the right to become official uefa partners , several sources within the industry told deutsche presse-agentur dpa .
" it 's one more example showing that uefa has a knack for making money , " a manager of a retail chain that does not sell official euro products said . dpa news agency -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw 's jochen kuerten caught up with him to find out what he thinks of today 's film industry . deutsche welle : your latest movie " ulzhan " was recently screened at the festival of german film in ludwigshafen , which tends to focus on work by newcomers .
were you pleased to be invited as an elder statesmen of german cinema ?
volker schloendorff : you bet !
when i was there i noticed that there 's a renewed interest in the concept of the auteur movie .
that was what we were all about , and this is a festival that specifically sets out to put german cinema on this path .
i think that 's wonderful .
all the good directors working at the moment , including tom tykwer and christian petzol , are auteur filmmakers .
you began making films in the 1960s and today you 're one of the most experienced directors in the country . how has life changed for directors ?
what 's it like starting out as a director these days ?
when i was making my first movie " young torless " in 1966 , television had n't even arrived .
the market for movies was vast , and audiences were hungry .
so when we showed up with our " new german cinema , " it was pounced upon . back then , millions of people would watch a movie that would be seen by barely 10,000 today .
so we got off to an excellent start .
but then came a long dry patch , and basically we were rescued by television .
these days there 's been an explosion in film making which makes life very , very hard .
up to 10 times as many movies are produced , especially in germany , and it 's all made easier by digital technology and the many film funds out there .
but it 's not easy to find audiences .
the theaters screen so much - twelve movies are launched every week .
it 's very competitive .
but there are far fewer cinemas these days .
this is an issue close to your heart , is n't it ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : small cinemas are struggling to survive yes , i 'm like a missionary , constantly on the road .
recently i was at a conference for local cinemas because i do believe strongly that cinema should have a place in the community - especially in the small and medium-sized towns which are increasingly over-run with bars and supermarkets .
a cinema is a place where people can meet , communicate and share an experience .
there 's more to life than the sofa and the pub .
let 's look back at your career .
you once said in an interview that winning an oscar for „ the tin drum “ opened many doors for you , and that you would never have survived so long in the film industry without it .
did you mean that success is necessary to keep working ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the tin drum " won the 1979 academy award for best foreign language film yes , you need either a name or financial success .
acclaim alone gets you nowhere .
you need to have a few movies which have made the theaters , distributors and producers a lot of money so that they remain convinced that with you , they 're onto a winner .
i think that 's the way it works .
and if you have an oeuvre and your work has either won oscars or attracted large audiences such as " death of a salesman “ and " homo faber , “ then it 's easier to get through a dry patch and still get offers and have your calls returned .
what advice would you give young filmmakers today ?
is it worth heading to the us to make movies ?
it 's very worthwhile , because it 's such an intense experience .
some things need to be learnt first-hand .
you have to have been there , to have made two or three films and felt the cold winds of the free market in country which has no subsidies at all .
then you realize how mollycoddled we are here .
that can motivate you to make films that are provocative , striking and different .
making a good movie is n't enough .
it might get you through in germany but if you want to make the leap into the wide world , then you need the us experience . interview : jochen kuerten -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the caribbean country 's northern neighbor is bound to be angered by the move . the move is expected to place brussels and washington on a collision course and drew criticism from cuban dissidents .
the vote on thursday , june 19 , scrapped the sanctions that were imposed in 2003 , suspended in 2005 and are largely symbolic .
they include limits on high-level government visits and the role of eu diplomats in cuba 's cultural events and do not approach the hard line of the 46-year-old us sanctions , which include a trade and investment embargo .
" cosmetic changes " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us has prohibited all exports to cuba since 1960 earlier thursday , a us state department spokesman said washington opposed any moves to ease sanctions on cuba , saying that reforms so far under new cuban president raul castro are " some very minor , cosmetic changes " that have fallen well short of ending decades of repressive policies under his brother , fidel castro .
the end of sanctions would give legitimacy to a dictatorial regime , deputy spokesman tom casey said , and countries should not signal that the " continued oppression of the cuban people is any more acceptable now than in the past . "
dissidents in cuba also objected to the lifting of the sanctions , charging the european union with being " hypocritical . "
" it gives me pain , and i 'm ashamed of governments that , far from promoting the democratic values under which they live , are made accomplices to one of the last dictatorships in the world , " vladimiro roca , one of cuba 's best known dissidents and leader of the illegal social democratic party , told dpa news agency .
encouraging reform although eu diplomats said the lifting of the sanctions was aimed at encouraging democratic reforms on cuba , the economist oscar espinosa , one of 75 dissidents whose 2003 arrests led to the eu sanctions , warned the move could harden the attitude of cuba 's communist government .
" it is worrisome because the lifting of the sanctions without something in return from cuba could have a very negative effect on cuba 's internal affairs , " espinosa said .
" it could send a signal to the hardline sectors of the government that it pays to be intransigent and inflexible . "
hypocritical as the european union ceased high-level contacts with cuba 's government in 2003 , it also increased its contacts with cuba 's dissidents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cuba is now expected to become more tolerant of dissidents but the sanctions were suspended in 2005 , and spain pushed to have them officially lifted after fidel castro withdrew as cuba 's leader and raul castro , who took over as president in february , implemented reforms , including giving unused state land to farmers and allowing ordinary cubans to use mobile phones , stay in tourist hotels and buy energy-consuming goods like dvd players and personal computers .
while the eu saw signs of liberalization in those moves , cuba 's dissidents said they have seen no change in the government 's treatment of the opposition .
for instance , of the 75 dissidents jailed in 2003 , 55 remain in custody .
the lifting of the sanctions " confirms once more that , with some notable exceptions , the eu is following a hypocritical policy exclusively concerned with its economic interests and not about cuba entering the circle of the democratic nations of the world , " said roca , who is a recipient of the eu 's sakharov prize for freedom of thought .
the czech republic and sweden have been reluctant to lift the sanctions and have demanded that cuba make progress in freeing political prisoners and implement other human rights concessions .
as a result , the eu 's decision is subject to a review in a year , diplomats said . dpa news agency -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but as high-end development spreads , some are saying : enough .
they fear berlin 's character could be irrevocably changed . mario feist remembers that there used to be bakeries and small grocery shops in the oderberger strasse when he first moved there in 1989 .
today , it is much easier to get a latte macchiato or a 150-euro shirt outside his front door than a loaf of bread or carton of milk .
he has watched as his street has been transformed from a dreary road marked by crumbling facades to a hip thoroughfare of renovated buildings , expensive boutiques and trendy cafés , whose sidewalks often resemble a fashion catwalk on sunny weekends .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marthashof sales office offers homes for the high-end client it 's a metamorphosis that he 's not completely comfortable with , especially since it could take on a whole new dimension once the 12,000-square-meter development of luxury apartments being constructed just outside his back window is completed .
called marthashof , it will house around 500 people , and since the square meter price for the townhouses starts at 3,000 euros , the large influx into the neighborhood will be quite well off .
" it could become a very sterile place just for rich people and not the kind of place i 'd want to live , " he said .
" i want to have different kinds of people here . "
expanding wave his concerns are not his alone .
as berlin 's gentrification process spreads to encompass more and more neighborhoods , people are beginning to push back at what they see as a danger to a vibrant , diverse city of neighborhoods featuring people of different social and economic backgrounds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an unrenovated and renovated building side by side on oderberger strasse in some neighborhoods , like feist 's prenzlauer berg , gentrification has been happening for years .
but as berlin continues to pull in more investment and its international reputation attracts more wealthy people , the neighborhood has seen a construction boom in luxury apartments and townhouses , which , in comparison to london , new york or paris , can still be had on the cheap .
the fears are that as more wealthy people move in to an area , their up-market tastes will be reflected in businesses that set up shop and rents will go up , pricing out lower and middle-income people .
feist said he 's already seen it happen in his street , when a greek restaurateur was forced to move out after his rent was tripled when the building housing his eatery changed hands .
" gentrification is not a good or bad thing in itself , " said antje seidel-schuelze , a researcher at the german institute of urban affairs .
" in one way , the districts where it happens become better .
but long-established people in a neighborhood are often replaced by wealthier people .
that leads to a certain homogeneity . "
same old same it 's that threat of sameness that riles patrik technau , a 23-year-old student and prenzlauer berg native who recently organized a protest rally near marthashof and another high-end development that attracted 500 people .
his event capped a week of demonstrations across berlin by mostly left-wing groups who say they are against the rapid development and reconstruction of the city .
during the protests , at least 30 cars were set ablaze . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more up-market housing going up " new people are moving here from abroad or other parts of germany and driving out people who 've lived here 40 or 50 years , " he said .
" that 's not fair and it makes me very angry . "
and while once the gentrification seemed limited to central neighborhoods such as prenzlauer berg and mitte , it 's spreading , said andrej holm , a professor at berlin 's humbolt university who studies gentrification .
that is what is causing the anger to rise .
as people were priced out of one neighborhood , they would move .
but often the gentrification wave would follow , forcing them to move again .
now , neighborhoods that were usually seen as immune to the process , and have been long-time enclaves of ethnic communities or artists and bohemians , are attracting professionals who are tired of the boutiques and bars , and are looking for something more " authentic . "
problem is , say researchers , that the lattes , renovations and higher rents are n't usually very far behind .
keeping the mix according to holm , city governments have several instruments that can keep neighborhoods on their way up from losing their diversity , such as rent control mechanisms or the construction of new social housing , even in gentrified neighborhoods .
but he said berlin has generally abandoned these tools , particularly when it comes to low-rent housing .
" in the few lots where there is still space for construction , only things like luxury townhouses and gated communities are going up , " he said .
" the city seems to think if we increase the number of high-end apartments , it can attract the kind of people that will also improve berlin 's economic situation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gentrification wave is expected to eventually hit even areas like berlin 's neukölln district but while the upper-income influx might lift a few economic boats in berlin , it could strand people like claudia hering , who along with mario feist is part of a citizens ' initiative called aim which wants changes to the marthashof development .
" we are afraid that in two or three years we wo n't be able to live here anymore , " she said .
but would she even want to ?
according to researcher seidel-schuelze , gentrification often makes people want to leave their own neighborhoods , no matter what their history there .
not only can they perhaps no longer afford it , the new look and feel can make the place not seem like home anymore .
" i know some people who used to live -lrb- in prenzlauer berg -rrb- in the gdr and they say it 's not my district anymore and i do n't want to be with these new dinks - double income , no kids people , " she said .

the work " is a little bit like going back to the roots of my work .
so that is interesting for me , " said wilson .
in the 1970s , he produced " ka mountain and guardenia terrace , " a continuous seven-day silent play staged on a mountaintop in iran .
renowned for producing elaborate and evocative stage sets , exhibitions and installations , wilson 's works are noted for his use of very slow movement and extremes in space or time .
" walking " is a collaboration between wilson and two dutch artists , theun mosk and boukje schweigman , where festival participants walk at a slow pace through the striking landscape of terschelling 's pastures , woodlands , sand dunes and beaches .
participants become the actors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wilson is known for experimenting with extremes in time and space the walkers are asked to hand in their watches , phones , cameras , and any devices they may have that tell time , before they are taken to stand alone in a black box .
then they are guided to a large wooden room with a deep circle dug into the ground .
slow music plays in the background .
finally , a field guide leads them out to a field and sets the pace for the remaining four-hour walk on the island .
clearly , " walking " pushes the boundaries of traditional theater .
it serves as a combination of both an interactive landscape installation and a theater production : the walkers are the actors and the landscape provides the backdrop scenery for the work .
experiencing time in a new way wilson said he was drawn immediately to the dramatic landscape on the island and wanted walkers to maintain a deliberately slow pace to heighten their observation during the walk .
" our perception is different if we take more time to do something , " said wilson .
" we begin to hear and see what is there in a different way .
we begin to smell things in a different way .
there is time to reflect . "
in the early 1970s he won international acclaim for " deafman glance , " a silent opera created in collaboration with raymond andrews , who is both deaf and mute .
wilson worked together with composer philip glass on the opera " einstein on the beach . "
he also collaborated with musician tom waits and writer william s. burroughs on the musical fable " the black rider . " cheryl northey send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

there , where the once supposedly " eternal ice cap " has begun to disappear , drillings can now be carried out deep into the sea bed .
the cores of sediment the scientists drill out of the ocean floor are kept in cold storage at marum .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de euro 2008 -pipe- 20.06.2008 euro merchandising a zero-sum game for vendors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flying off the shelves the european championships may have reached the quarter-final stages but austrian stores selling official fan goods say business is still brisk , even though they are starting to lower prices . overall , selling uefa euro 2008 merchandise is more a long-term investment in marketing than a way to make a profit within the few weeks of the championships , companies say .
intersport , the sporting goods group operating the official store in the vienna fan zone , sold 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 388,000 -rrb- worth of euro-related products last monday , spokesperson christian mann said .
business was higher than usual that day , because host austria was playing germany .
unexpected demand overall sales figures are hard to come by , as vendors ' agreements with uefa prevents them from releasing such information .
" demand is far higher than expected , " mann said .
intersport eybl , the part of the intersport that is uefa 's exclusive vending partner of sporting goods for the euro 2008 , expects revenues of " mid-level single-digit million euros , " another spokesperson said .
memorabilia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : image boosters inside the official vienna fan shop the other day , the atmosphere was busier than in the fan zone surrounding the store .
customers seemed to be interested mostly in buying t-shirts commemorating past games , as they were marked down to 5 euros .
but fans were also buying pricier items , like team jerseys or the official ball , store manager alexandra sallmann said .
" one would n't believe the things people are buying , " she said , pointing to little replicas of the henri delaunay trophy .
jerseys of teams that failed to move to the quarter-finals are already selling at half price , except for the austrian team colours .
the host 's t-shirts were still being bought , sallmann said .
image booster according to mann , the euro would be a financial " zero sum game " for austria 's largest sporting goods retailer .
the reason why costs would equal revenues was that intersport 's regular stores already started devoting part of their retail space for euro 2008 products last year , he said .
setting up the temporary store in the fan zone had cost as much as opening up a regular new store , he added .
" this is really about the image value , " mann said .
being seen as the exclusive sporting goods partner of the euro would help to build the brand and to expand it in the european market , where intersport shops have a share of 20 per cent .
special offers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stores are satisfied with sales at the billa supermarket chain , another official uefa sales partner , euro 2008 products have been marked down by 50 per cent since the kick-off of the championships .
in the small euro 2008 display area in a billa store in central vienna , soft toys of mascots trix and flix cost only 4,99 euros , compared with 20 euros in the fan zone store .
the discount was not due to slow demand , nor would the supply with merchandise be stopped , corporate spokesperson corinna tinkler said .
her company was " satisfied " with sales figures so far , she said .
the discounted merchandise was intended as an " additional bonus " for customers .
when asked whether her company would make a profit from selling products such as euro t-shirts and stationery , she said that it was " hard to say , " as the final accounting would be done after the championship finals .
but she also stressed that billa had chosen to become an official uefa partner because of the positive effect it had on the brand .
another factor eating away at profits are the retailers ' advance costs for obtaining the right to become official uefa partners , several sources within the industry told deutsche presse-agentur dpa .
" it 's one more example showing that uefa has a knack for making money , " a manager of a retail chain that does not sell official euro products said . dpa news agency -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the catch up initiative involves short one-to-one lessons with pupils , aimed at boosting confidence with numbers .
initial trials have seen primary school children double their rate of progress in mathematics .
already 1,600 teachers and assistants in wales have been trained to deliver the sister reading scheme .
the literacy project has seen those children taking part improve their reading age by an average of 18 months after around seven months of tuition .
the startling improvements appear to be mirrored by the mathematics version of the initiative .
the programmes make reading and mathematics more interesting , more enjoyable and more ' do-able ' julie lawes , catch up in total , 27 primary schools in seven welsh local authorities have piloted the maths programme , and over a five-month time span pupils saw their maths ability age leap by almost a year .
the lessons involved individual teaching with a pupil for just half an hour a week , focusing on core components like counting , tens and units , and ordinal numbers .
confidence catch up , which is also the name of the charity that devised and supports the training , said feedback also suggested that there had been a significant and positive change in attitudes from those children taking part .
the launch of the maths initiative for wales and the rest of the uk is being held at a special conference hosted by cardiff university .
catch up 's director , julie lawes said : " the launch today is targeted at the small percentage of children who struggle with their maths and can be so greatly aided by a structured and cost effective one-to-one intervention programme .
" it builds upon the successful experience of its sister programme , which after ten years of operation in wales has improved the reading of up to 27,000 children . "
both the reading and maths programmes can be taught in welsh , under the name dyfal donc .
" the programmes make reading and mathematics more interesting , more enjoyable and more ' do-able ' for children who currently struggle , " added the charity 's director .

the lawsuit claims that the wall street bank 's conduct led to a substantial financial loss for its shareholders .
lehman brothers has not commented on the lawsuit .
last week , lehman reported a quarterly loss of $ 2.8bn and demoted two senior executives .
its shares have fallen 60 % this year on fears of more bad debts .
chief executive richard fuld is one of the four defendants named in the lawsuit filed on behalf of operative plasterers annuity fund .
it also names joseph gregory and erin callan , who last week stepped down from their posts as chief operating officer and chief financial officer .
it accuses these individuals of misrepresenting lehman 's financial position between 13 september 2006 and 6 june 2008 , which caused the firm 's share price to rise .
earlier this month , the investment bank said it would need to raise $ 6bn to boost its balance sheet .
the announcement came a week after it denied it was facing funding problems .
lehman 's financial health has been under the microscope since the collapse of smaller rival bear stearns , after confidence in the bank failed and investors withdrew funds .
more lawsuits are expected against banks , which have been forced to write down millions of dollars in assets linked to the weakening credit market and us housing slump .

the comments by glasgow south mp tom harris first appeared in his blog on his website .
mr harris , a transport minister , told bbc radio he was comparing this generation with previous ones , who were not so healthy or wealthy .
however , he apologised if how he made his comments had caused offence .
in his blog post titled heaven knows we 're miserable now , mr harris said : " there are more two-car homes in britain today than there are homes without a car at all . "
if you read the full article i hope you 'll understand that what i 'm trying to do is actually make a serious point " tom harris mp read tom harris 's blog comments " we live longer , eat healthier -lrb- if we choose -rrb- , have better access to forms of entertainment never imagined a generation ago -lrb- satellite tv , dvd , computer games -rrb- , the majority of us have fast access to the worldwide web , which we use to enable even more spending and for entertainment .
crime is down .
" so why is everyone so bloody miserable ? "
speaking to radio 5 live , the mp defended his posting .
he said : " if you read the full article i hope you 'll understand that what i 'm trying to do is actually make a serious point .
have your say " so many people are miserable because they have never experienced life when it was n't so easy " nigel , dundee send us your comments " even if i accept that that phrase ' why is everyone so bloody miserable ' - i wrote that in a humorous vein - i understand that if people want to take that as offensive , i apologise , that maybe it should have been phrased differently .

advertisement a clip of the behind-the-scenes footage previously unreleased behind-the-scenes footage of marilyn monroe 's last film is to be auctioned in the us .
the reels , shot by an extra on the set of the last film she completed , 1961 's the misfits , are expected to fetch up to $ 20,000 -lrb- £ 10,000 -rrb- .
the two reels of silent 8mm colour film show images never before seen publicly .
monroe looks relaxed and playful , having her hair done , chatting with crew and actors or just walking around clutching a coffee mug .
yet for a screen icon whose every move has been scrutinised , such unseen footage is unique .
one collector said it showed the real marilyn .
the footage is all the more startling because it also shows her co-star clark gable - who died soon after finishing work on the misfits .
now , the 47 minutes of backstage activity could fetch up to $ 20,000 -lrb- £ 10,000 -rrb- at auction in las vegas this weekend .
and then this brief glimpse into movie history could disappear from public view forever .

the leaders are now expected to discuss zimbabwe .
a draft statement threatens increasing eu sanctions on the country .

the bbc 's mark mardell looks at the options open to eu leaders after the irish vote the bbc 's jonny dymond says one diplomat described mr sarkozy 's comments as a threat - and the wrong signal to send to the irish people - and those of croatia and turkey , who hope to join the 27-member bloc .
mr sarkozy did add that he would travel to ireland when france takes over the rotating eu presidency in july to help find a solution .
the treaty must be ratified by all member states to take effect .
nineteen have approved it so far , the latest of which was the uk , where it passed through parliament on wednesday .
czech brakes european commission president jose manuel barroso urged respect for the irish " no " vote but said he was confident all the countries would complete the ratification process .

it 's a principle of international law . "
slovenian prime minister janez jansa , whose country is the current holder of the eu presidency , said enlargement should not be a victim of the delay in ratifying the treaty .
" i believe we 'll find a way out of the situation before any candidate country is ready for a decision on accession to be taken in the eu , " he said .
" i do n't think the commission wants to slow down the process . "
germany rejected the idea of moving ahead on lisbon without ireland , which won strong czech backing at the summit .
our correspondent says concern is swirling around the intentions of the czech government .
pressed on whether he intended to ratify the treaty , czech prime minister mirek topolanek said that he was not going to put the brakes on to halt ratification .

by emma jane kirby bbc news , paris walking into guy savoy 's kitchen is , for an adult , exactly what entering charlie 's chocolate factory must be like for a child .
haute cuisine : a lusciously-coloured pea soup with poached egg the myriad smells are completely alluring - there 's the buttery scent of shallots being braised , the sweet smell of chicken being roasted and , from the patisserie kitchen below , the tantalising aroma of tarte tatin wafting up the stairs .
french president nicolas sarkozy is asking the un to award french cuisine unesco humanity heritage status .
a parliamentary fact-finding commission is currently hearing arguments from top chefs and specialists about france 's candidacy for the status , but does french cuisine merit such a title ?
mr savoy himself is busy preparing for the lunch-time rush .
as he spoons hollandaise sauce into glass egg-cups , the sous chefs stand still and stare at the master at work .
because , with three michelin stars to his name , this top chef knows pretty much all there is to know about food .
' universal value ' " french food is the best , " he tells me assuredly , " because it 's so diverse and there 's so much variety . "
he begins to list the specialities of each region - the charcuterie , the bread , the wine , the cheese and then shrugs his shoulders and smiles .
french cuisine is one of the most evolved cuisines in the world , unquestionably .
perhaps the most evolved orlando murrin , food writer and chef " we need to protect this heritage , " he says .
guy savoy is one of those supporting france 's candidacy for unesco heritage status .
he believes french cooking has such outstanding universal value that it deserves official recognition and protection .
previously successful candidates in this field have included a belgian carnival and the royal ballet of cambodia .
but can a coq-au-vin or a tete de veau really claim to merit more than a british steak and kidney pie or an italian penne a l 'arrabiata ?
deep in the tarn valley , an hour-and-a-half 's drive east of toulouse , i met food writer and chef orlando murrin .

from the earth he tells me he is fascinated by the way the french talk about food incessantly and the way everyone is so interested in the growing , catching and cooking of it .
france boasts some of the world 's finest restaurants but , while he is convinced that french cuisine has perhaps the richest heritage in the world , he does not believe it needs protecting more than any other cuisine .
" french cuisine is one of the most evolved cuisines in the world , unquestionably .

more from today programme orlando draws his inspiration not from the top chefs of paris but from the simple cooking of the neighbours .
he introduces me to monsieur and madame bonne , an elderly couple in their eighties who believe firmly in the culinary principle of " le terroir " - sourcing all their food from the local land and region .
stiff competition monsieur bonne gives me a tour of his vegetable plot which he still tends to himself and shows me his four remaining chickens , kept for eggs .
over a generous slice of madame bonne 's home-made walnut and chocolate cake she tells me how she learnt to cook all the famous french dishes at her mother 's knee but fears unless french traditional cooking is protected , it will simply die out .
" they do n't have time .

madame bonne learnt to cook at her mother 's knee but french food critics fear that a unesco heritage label will do more harm than good .
attaching the word " heritage " to cooking could make it seem immediately old-fashioned and could push the national cuisine off the restaurant table and into the history books .

by emma jane kirby bbc news , paris walking into guy savoy 's kitchen is , for an adult , exactly what entering charlie 's chocolate factory must be like for a child .
haute cuisine : a lusciously-coloured pea soup with poached egg the myriad smells are completely alluring - there 's the buttery scent of shallots being braised , the sweet smell of chicken being roasted and , from the patisserie kitchen below , the tantalising aroma of tarte tatin wafting up the stairs .
french president nicolas sarkozy is asking the un to award french cuisine unesco humanity heritage status .
a parliamentary fact-finding commission is currently hearing arguments from top chefs and specialists about france 's candidacy for the status , but does french cuisine merit such a title ?
mr savoy himself is busy preparing for the lunch-time rush .
as he spoons hollandaise sauce into glass egg-cups , the sous chefs stand still and stare at the master at work .
because , with three michelin stars to his name , this top chef knows pretty much all there is to know about food .
' universal value ' " french food is the best , " he tells me assuredly , " because it 's so diverse and there 's so much variety . "
he begins to list the specialities of each region - the charcuterie , the bread , the wine , the cheese and then shrugs his shoulders and smiles .
french cuisine is one of the most evolved cuisines in the world , unquestionably .
perhaps the most evolved orlando murrin , food writer and chef " we need to protect this heritage , " he says .
guy savoy is one of those supporting france 's candidacy for unesco heritage status .
he believes french cooking has such outstanding universal value that it deserves official recognition and protection .
previously successful candidates in this field have included a belgian carnival and the royal ballet of cambodia .
but can a coq-au-vin or a tete de veau really claim to merit more than a british steak and kidney pie or an italian penne a l 'arrabiata ?
deep in the tarn valley , an hour-and-a-half 's drive east of toulouse , i met food writer and chef orlando murrin .
lured to france by his love of gallic cuisine , mr murrin was inspired to set up a hotel and restaurant here .
from the earth he tells me he is fascinated by the way the french talk about food incessantly and the way everyone is so interested in the growing , catching and cooking of it .
france boasts some of the world 's finest restaurants but , while he is convinced that french cuisine has perhaps the richest heritage in the world , he does not believe it needs protecting more than any other cuisine .
" french cuisine is one of the most evolved cuisines in the world , unquestionably .
perhaps the most evolved , " he told me .
" but it is not of course the only cuisine in the world .
" there is italian cuisine , there are asian cuisines … what about moroccan cuisine and british cuisine indeed ?
there are lots of others that should be protected as well .
" if you are going to protect one , why not protect the other ones that are equally wonderful and rich and historical ? "
from the today programme please turn on javascript .
media requires javascript to play .
more from today programme orlando draws his inspiration not from the top chefs of paris but from the simple cooking of the neighbours .
he introduces me to monsieur and madame bonne , an elderly couple in their eighties who believe firmly in the culinary principle of " le terroir " - sourcing all their food from the local land and region .
stiff competition monsieur bonne gives me a tour of his vegetable plot which he still tends to himself and shows me his four remaining chickens , kept for eggs .
over a generous slice of madame bonne 's home-made walnut and chocolate cake she tells me how she learnt to cook all the famous french dishes at her mother 's knee but fears unless french traditional cooking is protected , it will simply die out .
" they do n't have time .
if you 're invited to dinner at a young person 's house these days , you just get a sandwich . "
madame bonne learnt to cook at her mother 's knee but french food critics fear that a unesco heritage label will do more harm than good .
attaching the word " heritage " to cooking could make it seem immediately old-fashioned and could push the national cuisine off the restaurant table and into the history books .
a few years ago , alexandre cammas founded a movement called le fooding , which aims to do away with the stuffiness of michelin stars .
instead , it is intent on loosening up the rigidity of french cuisine .
he finds the unesco bid ridiculous .
" it 's totally flawed , " he told me .
" i do n't understand how you can ask for a fixed status for something like cooking which is continually growing and changing . "
throughout the month of july , the french government will continue to hear arguments from top chefs and specialists about france 's candidacy for the unesco status .
they then have a year before they have to submit their application to the unesco heritage committee .
competition will be strong - it is rumoured that spain and italy are also considering a bid to get heritage status for mediterranean cuisine .

charges may now be brought against american amanda knox , 20 , her former boyfriend raffaele sollecito , 21 , and hermann guede , 24 , from ivory coast .
they are being held on suspicion of sexually assaulting and murdering the 21-year-old leeds university student from coulsdon , south london .
she died last november in a house she shared with miss knox in perugia .
prosecutors say the three suspects strangled and stabbed miss kercher , according to a court document officially notifying the defence that the investigation is over .
suspect ' innocent ' the document says mr guede committed sexual violence on miss kercher , with the help of miss knox and mr sollecito .
it also says miss knox and mr sollecito tried to make it appear that an attempted robbery had taken place in the house .
all three suspects have denied any wrongdoing .
the defence now has 20 days to request further questioning or produce more documents before prosecutors either seek indictments or drop the accusations .
miss knox 's family said on thursday in an e-mailed statement that the prosecutor " has been wedded to the theory that amanda and two others were responsible for meredith 's murder " .
" we know our daughter is innocent , and we will continue to support her in every way possible , " the statement said .

but fans of the late , great football manager might want to watch the film , the damned united , from behind a sofa .
rather than focusing on his remarkable victories in two european cup finals with nottingham forest , the movie concentrates on the low point of his career , his 44-day nightmare as leeds united boss .
with some fruity language and lots of finger-jabbing , clough is portrayed as a flawed genius .
back in the 1970s , he himself struggled to find any faults with his own ability .
he once said : " rome was n't built in a day ... but i was n't on that particular job " .
the actor given the near-impossible task of capturing clough in looks and voice is michael sheen , better known for his role as tony blair in the film the queen .
" each character is unique , " says sheen during a break from filming at leeds united 's elland road ground .
" this -lsb- movie -rsb- is my two passions coming together .
i used to play a lot of football when i was younger .
i possibly could have had a career in it .
" then i got to about 14 , met girls , you know , started drinking , smoking and all that kind of thing and then got into acting . "
the film , based on the book by david peace , is costing £ 5m and is due to be released in cinemas next year .
more than £ 20,000 of that money has already gone into turning the concrete car park at elland road into a grass pitch to try to recreate the 1970s training facilities .
filming has already taken place at chesterfield 's saltergate ground , which was painted dark green and made to look like the old baseball ground , where derby county played when clough was their successful manager .
it all turned sour for cloughie when he arrived at leeds in the summer of 1974 .
appointed for his brilliance , he was undone by his arrogance and his abrasive approach to a team of thin-skinned superstars who had just won the league .
the previous manager , don revie , was a winner , but the team did not have the panache clough wanted .
he tried to change the style and take on the stars , with disastrous consequences .
the film 's producer andy harries - the drama controller behind the hit tv series cold feet - describes the movie 's portrayal of clough as " affectionate and amusing " .
he says : " we 're not going to sell it as a comedy , but it is a funny film because clough was such a character .
" but it is dark in parts .
i do n't think the film is anything like as dark as the book .
" the book is told through clough 's own mind , the film does n't do that at all .
the film tells the story in a much more straight , narrative way . "
even so , he admits that clough sometimes appears to be approaching lunacy .
" there are some pretty mad scenes , which are also very funny scenes , " he says .
others actors involved include jim broadbent as derby chairman sam longson , timothy spall as clough 's assistant peter taylor and colm meaney as don revie .
perhaps the biggest challenge facing the movie-makers is making it watchable for anyone under 40 who is n't a football fan and has never heard of brian clough .
the quirky title - the damned united - may attract wider interest .
mind you , there were not many alternatives .
there has , of course , already been a life of brian .
