program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 07.12.2008 yugoslav guest workers torn between germany and home großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first wave of guest workers arrived in west germany 40 years this december .
it 's been 40 years since the first guest workers from the former yugoslavia arrived in west germany .
many have created families in germany , but as retirees , they often return home . pavle konopek , now 63 , is a self-employed entrepreneur .
in the spring of 1969 , he arrived from the north serbian region of srem to work in the german city of solingen .
in the former jugoslavia , he was trained as a machinist , but he studied electrical engineering in germany .
his wife also came with him , and his children and grandchildren continue to live in his adopted homeland .
" i 've never had negative experiences here .
to the contrary , i have a huge circle of friends and acquaintances in germany , " laughed konopek .
" i arrived in a foreign country , but the experience was never unpleasant .
there 's quite a difference between my old and new abode .
serbia will always be my mother country .
but home is wherever i hang my hat . "
answering a german ad for guest workers konopek was one of nearly 1.2 million people classified in germany as former yugoslavians , according to the federal ministry of statistics .
most yugoslav migrants responded to newspaper advertisements inviting guest workers to come .
west germany had sealed an agreement with the former socialist country on oct .
12 , 1968 to allow the entry of much needed labor to boost its wirtschaftswunder .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 1.2 million workers and their families come from the former yugoslavia forty years ago this december , the agreement between belgrade and the former german capital of bonn was ratified and the first wave of migrants arrived on feb .
4 , 1969 .
the first so-called guest workers ever to arrive germany , were the italians in 1955 until the flow from mediterranean rim countries , such as turkey , greece and portugal , officially ended in 1973 .
thirty-five years ago , savo pejovic arrived with a dozen fellow workers from pljevlja in montenegro , landing in the small northern town of soltau , south of hamburg .
he was 26 and goal-oriented .
after seven years of hard work at various jobs and further education , he became a trained mechanic .
" when i first arrived , i thought deutschmarks would fall from the trees " , said the father of two .
" but it was different from what i expected .
one could n't return home anymore and we had to think about adapting to life here .
still it was much easier then than it is today to find work , to switch jobs and move to another city , " he said .
well-trained workforce nearly 700,000 serbs , croatians or bosnians came to west germany for work between 1968 and the disintegration of the former yugoslavia in 1991 , but many have not stayed on .
in the first two decades of their arrival , the former yugoslav guest workers managed to remit an estimated 15 billion euros to their families back home .
as the german economy was growing by leaps and bounds , the guest workers made good use of their skills and training , according to leo monz , head of the foreign workers ' division of the german confederation of trade unions .
but do german politicos and businesses appreciate the contributions made by the " guest workers " ?
" we would have liked to see more recognition for them " , said monz .
" maybe there 's still a way to let them know that we recognize the contributions they have made to our country " .
first generation of pensioners the first wave of yugoslav guest workers are retiring now .
many plan to spend the remainder of their years in germany , where they have created families .
" we must think about how they can tap into their social security benefits in both germany and yugoslavia , so that they can feel at home in both countries " , said monz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first generation of immigrants are now pensioners " we need to work out our social system in caring for the elderly and ensure that there are caregivers who speak german and other languages , and have been immersed in other cultures , " he added .
some of the former guest workers do return to their home country .
milan stanojevic started out as an assembly worker in the automobile industry and ended his career as a labor mediator in gelsenkirchen 's industrial belt .
in 1970 , he left his small village in bosnia-herzegovina as a twenty year old with great hopes .
" i came with a small suitcase that contained a hand-knitted jumper , an old pair of shoes , socks and two cans of tinned food .
when the train left the platform , it dawned on me that i was on a long journey .
i became nostalgic for the parents and friends i left behind .
" but i was n't alone .
we numbered 2,500 altogether , but listlessness set in whenever i turned on the radio or telly , or when i went to sleep .
i can still see the images in my mind today : my parents , the family home , tombstones at the grave site .
" i only wanted to be away for one year , buy myself a moped in germany and go back .
it 's too bad that after 38 years , i never got that moped .
but i did manage to renovate the house that once belonged to my parents " . filip slavkovic -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" hopefully i will finally have a moment to prepare and gather strength for that half year , for which i feel great responsibility , " topolanek told reporters .
the czech republic is set to take over at eu 's helm from france on january 1 .
but the premier still faces hurdles as his three-party center-right government has been significantly weakened .
topolanek defeated bem in a second blow to party 's eurosceptic camp during this weekend 's party congress .
on saturday , president vaclav klaus , an outspoken eu critic and party 's iconic founder , surprisingly cut his ties with the party he founded in 1991 and subsequently led for 12 years .
lisbon treaty a cause of friction in czech government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech republic has similar feelings to ireland the congress is also to vote later sunday on a resolution asking civic democratic lawmakers to reject the lisbon treaty , a cause of split within the party .
while klaus 's followers oppose the accord , topolanek , who governs with pro-european greens and christian democrats , reluctantly signed the pact in december 2007 and has since backed it as a necessary evil .
the czech republic is the bloc 's last member to vote on the lisbon treaty , which has been stalled since the irish voters rejected it in a referendum last june .
the pact , aimed at streamlining decision-making in the 27-member union in a bid to make it a stronger global player , must have unanimous approval by all eu countries to become valid .
the czech parliament 's lower house is set to begin debating it on tuesday .
klaus said he would sign the treaty only if ireland reverses its no vote .

topolanek said sunday he soon plans to hold coalition talks on government 's future , which could result in a government reshuffle or even bring the civic democrats to opposition .
the premier conceded that the upcoming eu presidency has protected his fragile government from a collapse .
" perhaps only the czech presidency and the economic threats next year are holding back all the players on the political scene , " topolanek said .
the governing parties fell out of voters ' favor after they introduced several unpopular public finance reforms , such as direct fees in health care .
government 's strong support for placing a planned us missile defense radar base on czech soil has been equally shunned by the public .

according to bush , few will be as " vexing " as the middle east . when barack obama takes his oath on january 20th to become the 44th president of the united states of america , he will not only be making history as the country 's first black leader but he will bringing to an end one of the most unpopular administrations in living memory .
however , while george w. bush and the majority of his colleagues will be replaced , many of the policies and situations engineered during the 43rd president 's term of office will remain .
these present obama and his team with monumental challenges .
which of bush 's policies will be reversed , which will be scrapped and which will remain ?
one of the most serious situations facing the new president will be that of the middle east .
bush himself has recently said that when he vacates the oval office , he will be handing obama a middle east which represents " the most vexing problem " ; a region in which iran still seeks nuclear arms and the arab-israeli conflict continues .
bush admitted last week that the middle east remains a huge problem with tehran and damascus still suspected of sponsoring terrorism , the iraq war continuing to be more bloody and costly than expected while the democratic reforms he had hoped for in the region had come " in fits and starts " while his peace efforts had suffered " unfortunate setbacks . "
but bush maintained that despite frustrations and disappointments , the middle east in 2008 was a freer , more hopeful , and more promising place than it was in 2001 .
obama shares bush 's views on nuclear iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama says he will not allow iran to reach its nuclear potential before obama is handed the keys to the white house , bush warned that iran 's suspect nuclear program " remains a major threat to peace " and warned anew that washington will not permit tehran to get an atomic arsenal .
obama has vowed to " do everything in my power " to that same end .
" we have made our bottom line clear : for the safety of our people and the peace of the world , america will not allow iran to develop a nuclear weapon , " said the out-going president .
bush , the first sitting us president to call for an independent palestinian state at peace with israel , defended his approach to ending the six-decade conflict despite a lack of concrete progress from us-backed negotiations .
" on the most vexing problem in the region - the israeli-palestinian conflict - there is now greater international consensus than at any point in recent memory , " he said .
israeli-palestinian resolution remains us priority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush claims credit for the progress made in israel bush called the two-state approach " one of the highest priorities of my presidency , " described talks following a us-sponsored november 2007 conference in annapolis , maryland , as " determined and substantial . "
" while the israelis and palestinians have not yet produced an agreement , they have made important progress , " he said .
" they have laid a new foundation of trust for the future . "
the bush administration blamed israeli political turmoil in november as it all but ruled out a peace deal in 2008 to pave the way for an independent palestinian state living side-by-side at peace with israel .
but even before that , revived peace efforts had yet to resolve any major core disputes , and progress seemed difficult in the face of the palestinian rift pitting president mahmoud abbas 's fatah against the islamists of hamas .
hamas has controlled gaza since seizing control in june 2007 , while abbas has controlled the west bank from his headquarters in ramallah .
obama has vowed to continue to support the talks .
bush defends iraq war and efforts to democratize region bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush 's presidency will be forever linked to the iraq war bush fiercely defended his decision to invade iraq in march 2003 , but called the war " longer and more costly than expected , " while pointing to iraq 's fledgling democracy as one of the hopeful signs in the region .
he also cited lebanon 's " cedar revolution " against syrian sway , libya 's decision to halt its quest for nuclear weapons , increased enthusiasm for democratic reforms , and prosperity in places such as the united arab emirates .
" iran is facing greater pressure from the international community than ever before , " while terrorist groups like al-qaeda " are increasingly facing ideological rejection in the arab world , " he said .
" these efforts have not always gone according to plan , and in some areas we have fallen short of our hopes , " said bush , who made no mention of obama in his speech .
" it 's rather difficult to see that we did not see a sharp deterioration in the american position in the middle east , " said anthony cordesman , an expert at the center of strategic and international studies think tank .
" it 's very difficult to point to any achievement .

these present obama and his team with monumental challenges .
which of bush 's policies will be reversed , which will be scrapped and which will remain ?
one of the most serious situations facing the new president will be that of the middle east .
bush himself has recently said that when he vacates the oval office , he will be handing obama a middle east which represents " the most vexing problem " ; a region in which iran still seeks nuclear arms and the arab-israeli conflict continues .
bush admitted last week that the middle east remains a huge problem with tehran and damascus still suspected of sponsoring terrorism , the iraq war continuing to be more bloody and costly than expected while the democratic reforms he had hoped for in the region had come " in fits and starts " while his peace efforts had suffered " unfortunate setbacks . "
but bush maintained that despite frustrations and disappointments , the middle east in 2008 was a freer , more hopeful , and more promising place than it was in 2001 .
obama shares bush 's views on nuclear iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama says he will not allow iran to reach its nuclear potential before obama is handed the keys to the white house , bush warned that iran 's suspect nuclear program " remains a major threat to peace " and warned anew that washington will not permit tehran to get an atomic arsenal .
obama has vowed to " do everything in my power " to that same end .
" we have made our bottom line clear : for the safety of our people and the peace of the world , america will not allow iran to develop a nuclear weapon , " said the out-going president .
bush , the first sitting us president to call for an independent palestinian state at peace with israel , defended his approach to ending the six-decade conflict despite a lack of concrete progress from us-backed negotiations .
" on the most vexing problem in the region - the israeli-palestinian conflict - there is now greater international consensus than at any point in recent memory , " he said .
israeli-palestinian resolution remains us priority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush claims credit for the progress made in israel bush called the two-state approach " one of the highest priorities of my presidency , " described talks following a us-sponsored november 2007 conference in annapolis , maryland , as " determined and substantial . "
" while the israelis and palestinians have not yet produced an agreement , they have made important progress , " he said .
" they have laid a new foundation of trust for the future . "
the bush administration blamed israeli political turmoil in november as it all but ruled out a peace deal in 2008 to pave the way for an independent palestinian state living side-by-side at peace with israel .
but even before that , revived peace efforts had yet to resolve any major core disputes , and progress seemed difficult in the face of the palestinian rift pitting president mahmoud abbas 's fatah against the islamists of hamas .
hamas has controlled gaza since seizing control in june 2007 , while abbas has controlled the west bank from his headquarters in ramallah .
obama has vowed to continue to support the talks .
bush defends iraq war and efforts to democratize region bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush 's presidency will be forever linked to the iraq war bush fiercely defended his decision to invade iraq in march 2003 , but called the war " longer and more costly than expected , " while pointing to iraq 's fledgling democracy as one of the hopeful signs in the region .
he also cited lebanon 's " cedar revolution " against syrian sway , libya 's decision to halt its quest for nuclear weapons , increased enthusiasm for democratic reforms , and prosperity in places such as the united arab emirates .
" iran is facing greater pressure from the international community than ever before , " while terrorist groups like al-qaeda " are increasingly facing ideological rejection in the arab world , " he said .

despite selling 65,000 tickets for the 2008 race , the hockenheimring , which hosts every other german grand prix , lost over 5 million euros -lrb- $ 6.3 million -rrb- in 2008 , and it 's not the only german race venue suffering . the hockenheimring is asking for support from the regional government in 2010 to enable it to host the formula one grand prix as currently scheduled .
the track alternates hosting the german grand prix with the nuerburgring , which will hold the 2009 race . " we think we have a right to demand this as the formula one yields a considerable profit for the region , " hockenheim circuit ceo karl-josef schmidt told deutsche welle on wednesday , dec .

" we have an additional revenue of 40 million euros just on the formula one weekend , and that is why we think the region of baden-wuerttemberg should have a remarkable interest in maintaining formula one here . " after losing 5.3 million euros on the event this season , the town of hockenheim , which owns most of the circuit , has said it can not shoulder the burden by itself . fewer spectators bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fewer people are filling the stands in germany ticket sales for the german grand prix have been steadily decreasing , and this is the only revenue the track generates on race weekend .
other sources of income , including merchandising , advertising and television revenues , go to the formula one association or its affiliates . " the underlying reason is that the number of spectators has considerably declined in the past years , " schmidt said .
" we had 95,000 spectators in 2002 , and we had 65,000 this year . " the track needs to sell enough race tickets to offset the fee charged by the formula one association for hosting the event .
hockenheim is contractually forbidden from revealing the amount it pays to the f1 authorities , but the roughly 13 million euros estimated to flow in from the sale of 65,000 tickets sold at roughly 200 euros could n't cover the track 's costs . germany has five drivers on the f1 grid and carmakers like bmw and mercedes are powerful forces in the sport .
both these companies have already said that they value the german grand prix and hope that it doesn ’ t fall off the calendar . shared burden , shared suffering hockenheim shares the german grand prix with germany 's other premier racetrack , the nuerburgring .
the two circuits came to this agreement out of a desire to share the financial burden of hosting a formula one race . " i guess every grand prix racetrack or promoter of a grand prix worldwide loses money with formula one , unfortunately that 's also true for the nuerburgring , " nuerburgring managing director walter kafitz told deutsche welle . " for us as a limited company it is not profitable , but for the region it is profitable , and as the regional government is the nuerburgring 's major shareholder it makes sense to host f1 , " he added . the nuerburgring has a contract to host the german grand prix in 2009 and 2011 , and kafitz said it will uphold this obligation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 07.12.2008 obama to inherit " vexing " middle east from departing bush großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama faces huge challenges in dealing with the myriad problems in the middle east when george w. bush makes way for barack obama in january , the new president will face many of the same issues that dogged the previous administration .
according to bush , few will be as " vexing " as the middle east . when barack obama takes his oath on january 20th to become the 44th president of the united states of america , he will not only be making history as the country 's first black leader but he will bringing to an end one of the most unpopular administrations in living memory .
however , while george w. bush and the majority of his colleagues will be replaced , many of the policies and situations engineered during the 43rd president 's term of office will remain .
these present obama and his team with monumental challenges .
which of bush 's policies will be reversed , which will be scrapped and which will remain ?
one of the most serious situations facing the new president will be that of the middle east .
bush himself has recently said that when he vacates the oval office , he will be handing obama a middle east which represents " the most vexing problem " ; a region in which iran still seeks nuclear arms and the arab-israeli conflict continues .
bush admitted last week that the middle east remains a huge problem with tehran and damascus still suspected of sponsoring terrorism , the iraq war continuing to be more bloody and costly than expected while the democratic reforms he had hoped for in the region had come " in fits and starts " while his peace efforts had suffered " unfortunate setbacks . "
but bush maintained that despite frustrations and disappointments , the middle east in 2008 was a freer , more hopeful , and more promising place than it was in 2001 .
obama shares bush 's views on nuclear iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama says he will not allow iran to reach its nuclear potential before obama is handed the keys to the white house , bush warned that iran 's suspect nuclear program " remains a major threat to peace " and warned anew that washington will not permit tehran to get an atomic arsenal .
obama has vowed to " do everything in my power " to that same end .
" we have made our bottom line clear : for the safety of our people and the peace of the world , america will not allow iran to develop a nuclear weapon , " said the out-going president .
bush , the first sitting us president to call for an independent palestinian state at peace with israel , defended his approach to ending the six-decade conflict despite a lack of concrete progress from us-backed negotiations .
" on the most vexing problem in the region - the israeli-palestinian conflict - there is now greater international consensus than at any point in recent memory , " he said .
israeli-palestinian resolution remains us priority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush claims credit for the progress made in israel bush called the two-state approach " one of the highest priorities of my presidency , " described talks following a us-sponsored november 2007 conference in annapolis , maryland , as " determined and substantial . "
" while the israelis and palestinians have not yet produced an agreement , they have made important progress , " he said .
" they have laid a new foundation of trust for the future . "
the bush administration blamed israeli political turmoil in november as it all but ruled out a peace deal in 2008 to pave the way for an independent palestinian state living side-by-side at peace with israel .
but even before that , revived peace efforts had yet to resolve any major core disputes , and progress seemed difficult in the face of the palestinian rift pitting president mahmoud abbas 's fatah against the islamists of hamas .
hamas has controlled gaza since seizing control in june 2007 , while abbas has controlled the west bank from his headquarters in ramallah .
obama has vowed to continue to support the talks .
bush defends iraq war and efforts to democratize region bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush 's presidency will be forever linked to the iraq war bush fiercely defended his decision to invade iraq in march 2003 , but called the war " longer and more costly than expected , " while pointing to iraq 's fledgling democracy as one of the hopeful signs in the region .
he also cited lebanon 's " cedar revolution " against syrian sway , libya 's decision to halt its quest for nuclear weapons , increased enthusiasm for democratic reforms , and prosperity in places such as the united arab emirates .
" iran is facing greater pressure from the international community than ever before , " while terrorist groups like al-qaeda " are increasingly facing ideological rejection in the arab world , " he said .
" these efforts have not always gone according to plan , and in some areas we have fallen short of our hopes , " said bush , who made no mention of obama in his speech .
" it 's rather difficult to see that we did not see a sharp deterioration in the american position in the middle east , " said anthony cordesman , an expert at the center of strategic and international studies think tank .
" it 's very difficult to point to any achievement .
if there have been achievements almost all come from the united states military , " he told reporters . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's been 40 years since the first guest workers from the former yugoslavia arrived in west germany .
many have created families in germany , but as retirees , they often return home . pavle konopek , now 63 , is a self-employed entrepreneur .
in the spring of 1969 , he arrived from the north serbian region of srem to work in the german city of solingen .
in the former jugoslavia , he was trained as a machinist , but he studied electrical engineering in germany .
his wife also came with him , and his children and grandchildren continue to live in his adopted homeland .
" i 've never had negative experiences here .
to the contrary , i have a huge circle of friends and acquaintances in germany , " laughed konopek .
" i arrived in a foreign country , but the experience was never unpleasant .
there 's quite a difference between my old and new abode .
serbia will always be my mother country .
but home is wherever i hang my hat . "
answering a german ad for guest workers konopek was one of nearly 1.2 million people classified in germany as former yugoslavians , according to the federal ministry of statistics .
most yugoslav migrants responded to newspaper advertisements inviting guest workers to come .
west germany had sealed an agreement with the former socialist country on oct .
12 , 1968 to allow the entry of much needed labor to boost its wirtschaftswunder .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 1.2 million workers and their families come from the former yugoslavia forty years ago this december , the agreement between belgrade and the former german capital of bonn was ratified and the first wave of migrants arrived on feb .
4 , 1969 .
the first so-called guest workers ever to arrive germany , were the italians in 1955 until the flow from mediterranean rim countries , such as turkey , greece and portugal , officially ended in 1973 .

it 's been 40 years since the first guest workers from the former yugoslavia arrived in west germany .
many have created families in germany , but as retirees , they often return home . pavle konopek , now 63 , is a self-employed entrepreneur .
in the spring of 1969 , he arrived from the north serbian region of srem to work in the german city of solingen .
in the former jugoslavia , he was trained as a machinist , but he studied electrical engineering in germany .
his wife also came with him , and his children and grandchildren continue to live in his adopted homeland .
" i 've never had negative experiences here .
to the contrary , i have a huge circle of friends and acquaintances in germany , " laughed konopek .
" i arrived in a foreign country , but the experience was never unpleasant .
there 's quite a difference between my old and new abode .
serbia will always be my mother country .
but home is wherever i hang my hat . "
answering a german ad for guest workers konopek was one of nearly 1.2 million people classified in germany as former yugoslavians , according to the federal ministry of statistics .
most yugoslav migrants responded to newspaper advertisements inviting guest workers to come .
west germany had sealed an agreement with the former socialist country on oct .
12 , 1968 to allow the entry of much needed labor to boost its wirtschaftswunder .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 1.2 million workers and their families come from the former yugoslavia forty years ago this december , the agreement between belgrade and the former german capital of bonn was ratified and the first wave of migrants arrived on feb .
4 , 1969 .
the first so-called guest workers ever to arrive germany , were the italians in 1955 until the flow from mediterranean rim countries , such as turkey , greece and portugal , officially ended in 1973 .

despite selling 65,000 tickets for the 2008 race , the hockenheimring , which hosts every other german grand prix , lost over 5 million euros -lrb- $ 6.3 million -rrb- in 2008 , and it 's not the only german race venue suffering . the hockenheimring is asking for support from the regional government in 2010 to enable it to host the formula one grand prix as currently scheduled .
the track alternates hosting the german grand prix with the nuerburgring , which will hold the 2009 race . " we think we have a right to demand this as the formula one yields a considerable profit for the region , " hockenheim circuit ceo karl-josef schmidt told deutsche welle on wednesday , dec .

" we have an additional revenue of 40 million euros just on the formula one weekend , and that is why we think the region of baden-wuerttemberg should have a remarkable interest in maintaining formula one here .

" we had 95,000 spectators in 2002 , and we had 65,000 this year . " the track needs to sell enough race tickets to offset the fee charged by the formula one association for hosting the event .
hockenheim is contractually forbidden from revealing the amount it pays to the f1 authorities , but the roughly 13 million euros estimated to flow in from the sale of 65,000 tickets sold at roughly 200 euros could n't cover the track 's costs . germany has five drivers on the f1 grid and carmakers like bmw and mercedes are powerful forces in the sport .
both these companies have already said that they value the german grand prix and hope that it doesn ’ t fall off the calendar . shared burden , shared suffering hockenheim shares the german grand prix with germany 's other premier racetrack , the nuerburgring .
the two circuits came to this agreement out of a desire to share the financial burden of hosting a formula one race .

despite selling 65,000 tickets for the 2008 race , the hockenheimring , which hosts every other german grand prix , lost over 5 million euros -lrb- $ 6.3 million -rrb- in 2008 , and it 's not the only german race venue suffering . the hockenheimring is asking for support from the regional government in 2010 to enable it to host the formula one grand prix as currently scheduled .
the track alternates hosting the german grand prix with the nuerburgring , which will hold the 2009 race . " we think we have a right to demand this as the formula one yields a considerable profit for the region , " hockenheim circuit ceo karl-josef schmidt told deutsche welle on wednesday , dec .

" we have an additional revenue of 40 million euros just on the formula one weekend , and that is why we think the region of baden-wuerttemberg should have a remarkable interest in maintaining formula one here .

" we had 95,000 spectators in 2002 , and we had 65,000 this year . " the track needs to sell enough race tickets to offset the fee charged by the formula one association for hosting the event .
hockenheim is contractually forbidden from revealing the amount it pays to the f1 authorities , but the roughly 13 million euros estimated to flow in from the sale of 65,000 tickets sold at roughly 200 euros could n't cover the track 's costs . germany has five drivers on the f1 grid and carmakers like bmw and mercedes are powerful forces in the sport .

the czech republic is set to take over at eu 's helm from france on january 1 .

7 a sign of continuity for the european union as the czech republic prepares to chair the bloc and vote on its reform treaty . in a 284 -162 vote the civic democratic party , which opposes deeper european integration , chose pragmatic treaty supporter topolanek over his eurosceptic challenger , prague mayor pavel bem .
" hopefully i will finally have a moment to prepare and gather strength for that half year , for which i feel great responsibility , " topolanek told reporters .
the czech republic is set to take over at eu 's helm from france on january 1 .
but the premier still faces hurdles as his three-party center-right government has been significantly weakened .
topolanek defeated bem in a second blow to party 's eurosceptic camp during this weekend 's party congress .
on saturday , president vaclav klaus , an outspoken eu critic and party 's iconic founder , surprisingly cut his ties with the party he founded in 1991 and subsequently led for 12 years .

while klaus 's followers oppose the accord , topolanek , who governs with pro-european greens and christian democrats , reluctantly signed the pact in december 2007 and has since backed it as a necessary evil .
the czech republic is the bloc 's last member to vote on the lisbon treaty , which has been stalled since the irish voters rejected it in a referendum last june .
the pact , aimed at streamlining decision-making in the 27-member union in a bid to make it a stronger global player , must have unanimous approval by all eu countries to become valid .
the czech parliament 's lower house is set to begin debating it on tuesday .
klaus said he would sign the treaty only if ireland reverses its no vote .
topolanek survived his party 's heavy losses in october regional and senate elections , cementing party leadership until the next general election in 2010 .

topolanek said sunday he soon plans to hold coalition talks on government 's future , which could result in a government reshuffle or even bring the civic democrats to opposition .
the premier conceded that the upcoming eu presidency has protected his fragile government from a collapse .
" perhaps only the czech presidency and the economic threats next year are holding back all the players on the political scene , " topolanek said .
the governing parties fell out of voters ' favor after they introduced several unpopular public finance reforms , such as direct fees in health care .
government 's strong support for placing a planned us missile defense radar base on czech soil has been equally shunned by the public .
topolanek has also angered voters by what they perceived as a rude and arrogant behavior , for which he apologized before the delegates . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

audi followed up on friday with the confirmation that it will stop auto racing after nine years in the american le mans series . apart from banks and other financial companies , the world 's car industry is currently bearing the brunt of the global recession and scrambling for state loans to stay alive . losses have skyrocketed as sales slumped to levels of the early 1980s . not only the big us three of general motors , chrysler and ford have cut marketing and other costs dramatically as they seek a 34- billion dollar bailout from the government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : honda 's fukui moves to protect his firm 's core businesses honda president takeo fukui made it clear on friday that rather than continuing a mainly unsuccessful stint in f1 racing , the company " must protect its core business activities and secure the long term as widespread uncertainties in the economics around the globe continue to mount . " the examples of woods and the sailing team show that these uncertainties concern the full range of sport sponsoring . there are growing question marks over gm 's long-standing engagement in golf in general through its brand buick . doubts have been raised whether the international olympic committee will be successful in making a car manufacturer part of its elite sponsorship program . avoiding annual endorsement costs of more than 50 million dollars weigh heavier in current times than exclusive rights to olympic symbols such as the five rings . carmakers already became more cautious before the crisis fully hit this year . auto industry 's sponsorship of sport in danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaka ca n't believe bwin replaced opel as milan 's sponsor long gone are the days when gm 's german division opel used to be the shirt sponsors of soccer teams such as bayern munich and ac milan , and endorsed athletes like german tennis heroine steffi graf . spanish top club valencia had toyota 's name on their jersey when they won the 2004 league title and the australian open tennis grand slam was once sponsored by ford . audi have trimmed their winter sport engagement down to being the main alpine skiing world cup sponsor . german yachtsman jochen schuemann had hoped that audi would help fund an america 's cup team but the timing was bad as the company is determined to save some 100 million euros . " audi is not allowed to sign new contracts , " schuemann said on thursday , with audi spokeswomen petra klaehn confirming that " the decision was made based on the current economic conditions . " audi cutting back in its involvement audi is also saving in motorsport with the withdrawal from the american le-mans racing series .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 07.12.2008 yugoslav guest workers torn between germany and home großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first wave of guest workers arrived in west germany 40 years this december .
it 's been 40 years since the first guest workers from the former yugoslavia arrived in west germany .
many have created families in germany , but as retirees , they often return home . pavle konopek , now 63 , is a self-employed entrepreneur .
in the spring of 1969 , he arrived from the north serbian region of srem to work in the german city of solingen .
in the former jugoslavia , he was trained as a machinist , but he studied electrical engineering in germany .
his wife also came with him , and his children and grandchildren continue to live in his adopted homeland .
" i 've never had negative experiences here .
to the contrary , i have a huge circle of friends and acquaintances in germany , " laughed konopek .
" i arrived in a foreign country , but the experience was never unpleasant .
there 's quite a difference between my old and new abode .
serbia will always be my mother country .
but home is wherever i hang my hat . "
answering a german ad for guest workers konopek was one of nearly 1.2 million people classified in germany as former yugoslavians , according to the federal ministry of statistics .
most yugoslav migrants responded to newspaper advertisements inviting guest workers to come .
west germany had sealed an agreement with the former socialist country on oct .
12 , 1968 to allow the entry of much needed labor to boost its wirtschaftswunder .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 1.2 million workers and their families come from the former yugoslavia forty years ago this december , the agreement between belgrade and the former german capital of bonn was ratified and the first wave of migrants arrived on feb .
4 , 1969 .
the first so-called guest workers ever to arrive germany , were the italians in 1955 until the flow from mediterranean rim countries , such as turkey , greece and portugal , officially ended in 1973 .
thirty-five years ago , savo pejovic arrived with a dozen fellow workers from pljevlja in montenegro , landing in the small northern town of soltau , south of hamburg .
he was 26 and goal-oriented .
after seven years of hard work at various jobs and further education , he became a trained mechanic .
" when i first arrived , i thought deutschmarks would fall from the trees " , said the father of two .
" but it was different from what i expected .
one could n't return home anymore and we had to think about adapting to life here .
still it was much easier then than it is today to find work , to switch jobs and move to another city , " he said .
well-trained workforce nearly 700,000 serbs , croatians or bosnians came to west germany for work between 1968 and the disintegration of the former yugoslavia in 1991 , but many have not stayed on .
in the first two decades of their arrival , the former yugoslav guest workers managed to remit an estimated 15 billion euros to their families back home .
as the german economy was growing by leaps and bounds , the guest workers made good use of their skills and training , according to leo monz , head of the foreign workers ' division of the german confederation of trade unions .
but do german politicos and businesses appreciate the contributions made by the " guest workers " ?
" we would have liked to see more recognition for them " , said monz .
" maybe there 's still a way to let them know that we recognize the contributions they have made to our country " .
first generation of pensioners the first wave of yugoslav guest workers are retiring now .
many plan to spend the remainder of their years in germany , where they have created families .
" we must think about how they can tap into their social security benefits in both germany and yugoslavia , so that they can feel at home in both countries " , said monz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first generation of immigrants are now pensioners " we need to work out our social system in caring for the elderly and ensure that there are caregivers who speak german and other languages , and have been immersed in other cultures , " he added .
some of the former guest workers do return to their home country .
milan stanojevic started out as an assembly worker in the automobile industry and ended his career as a labor mediator in gelsenkirchen 's industrial belt .
in 1970 , he left his small village in bosnia-herzegovina as a twenty year old with great hopes .
" i came with a small suitcase that contained a hand-knitted jumper , an old pair of shoes , socks and two cans of tinned food .
when the train left the platform , it dawned on me that i was on a long journey .
i became nostalgic for the parents and friends i left behind .
" but i was n't alone .
we numbered 2,500 altogether , but listlessness set in whenever i turned on the radio or telly , or when i went to sleep .
i can still see the images in my mind today : my parents , the family home , tombstones at the grave site .
" i only wanted to be away for one year , buy myself a moped in germany and go back .
it 's too bad that after 38 years , i never got that moped .
but i did manage to renovate the house that once belonged to my parents " . filip slavkovic -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's been 40 years since the first guest workers from the former yugoslavia arrived in west germany .
many have created families in germany , but as retirees , they often return home . pavle konopek , now 63 , is a self-employed entrepreneur .
in the spring of 1969 , he arrived from the north serbian region of srem to work in the german city of solingen .
in the former jugoslavia , he was trained as a machinist , but he studied electrical engineering in germany .
his wife also came with him , and his children and grandchildren continue to live in his adopted homeland .
" i 've never had negative experiences here .
to the contrary , i have a huge circle of friends and acquaintances in germany , " laughed konopek .
" i arrived in a foreign country , but the experience was never unpleasant .
there 's quite a difference between my old and new abode .
serbia will always be my mother country .
but home is wherever i hang my hat . "
answering a german ad for guest workers konopek was one of nearly 1.2 million people classified in germany as former yugoslavians , according to the federal ministry of statistics .
most yugoslav migrants responded to newspaper advertisements inviting guest workers to come .
west germany had sealed an agreement with the former socialist country on oct .
12 , 1968 to allow the entry of much needed labor to boost its wirtschaftswunder .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 1.2 million workers and their families come from the former yugoslavia forty years ago this december , the agreement between belgrade and the former german capital of bonn was ratified and the first wave of migrants arrived on feb .
4 , 1969 .
the first so-called guest workers ever to arrive germany , were the italians in 1955 until the flow from mediterranean rim countries , such as turkey , greece and portugal , officially ended in 1973 .
thirty-five years ago , savo pejovic arrived with a dozen fellow workers from pljevlja in montenegro , landing in the small northern town of soltau , south of hamburg .
he was 26 and goal-oriented .
after seven years of hard work at various jobs and further education , he became a trained mechanic .
" when i first arrived , i thought deutschmarks would fall from the trees " , said the father of two .
" but it was different from what i expected .
one could n't return home anymore and we had to think about adapting to life here .
still it was much easier then than it is today to find work , to switch jobs and move to another city , " he said .
well-trained workforce nearly 700,000 serbs , croatians or bosnians came to west germany for work between 1968 and the disintegration of the former yugoslavia in 1991 , but many have not stayed on .
in the first two decades of their arrival , the former yugoslav guest workers managed to remit an estimated 15 billion euros to their families back home .
as the german economy was growing by leaps and bounds , the guest workers made good use of their skills and training , according to leo monz , head of the foreign workers ' division of the german confederation of trade unions .
but do german politicos and businesses appreciate the contributions made by the " guest workers " ?
" we would have liked to see more recognition for them " , said monz .
" maybe there 's still a way to let them know that we recognize the contributions they have made to our country " .
first generation of pensioners the first wave of yugoslav guest workers are retiring now .
many plan to spend the remainder of their years in germany , where they have created families .
" we must think about how they can tap into their social security benefits in both germany and yugoslavia , so that they can feel at home in both countries " , said monz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first generation of immigrants are now pensioners " we need to work out our social system in caring for the elderly and ensure that there are caregivers who speak german and other languages , and have been immersed in other cultures , " he added .
some of the former guest workers do return to their home country .
milan stanojevic started out as an assembly worker in the automobile industry and ended his career as a labor mediator in gelsenkirchen 's industrial belt .
in 1970 , he left his small village in bosnia-herzegovina as a twenty year old with great hopes .
" i came with a small suitcase that contained a hand-knitted jumper , an old pair of shoes , socks and two cans of tinned food .
when the train left the platform , it dawned on me that i was on a long journey .
i became nostalgic for the parents and friends i left behind .
" but i was n't alone .
we numbered 2,500 altogether , but listlessness set in whenever i turned on the radio or telly , or when i went to sleep .
i can still see the images in my mind today : my parents , the family home , tombstones at the grave site .
" i only wanted to be away for one year , buy myself a moped in germany and go back .
it 's too bad that after 38 years , i never got that moped .
but i did manage to renovate the house that once belonged to my parents " . filip slavkovic -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to bush , few will be as " vexing " as the middle east . when barack obama takes his oath on january 20th to become the 44th president of the united states of america , he will not only be making history as the country 's first black leader but he will bringing to an end one of the most unpopular administrations in living memory .
however , while george w. bush and the majority of his colleagues will be replaced , many of the policies and situations engineered during the 43rd president 's term of office will remain .
these present obama and his team with monumental challenges .
which of bush 's policies will be reversed , which will be scrapped and which will remain ?
one of the most serious situations facing the new president will be that of the middle east .
bush himself has recently said that when he vacates the oval office , he will be handing obama a middle east which represents " the most vexing problem " ; a region in which iran still seeks nuclear arms and the arab-israeli conflict continues .
bush admitted last week that the middle east remains a huge problem with tehran and damascus still suspected of sponsoring terrorism , the iraq war continuing to be more bloody and costly than expected while the democratic reforms he had hoped for in the region had come " in fits and starts " while his peace efforts had suffered " unfortunate setbacks . "
but bush maintained that despite frustrations and disappointments , the middle east in 2008 was a freer , more hopeful , and more promising place than it was in 2001 .
obama shares bush 's views on nuclear iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama says he will not allow iran to reach its nuclear potential before obama is handed the keys to the white house , bush warned that iran 's suspect nuclear program " remains a major threat to peace " and warned anew that washington will not permit tehran to get an atomic arsenal .
obama has vowed to " do everything in my power " to that same end .
" we have made our bottom line clear : for the safety of our people and the peace of the world , america will not allow iran to develop a nuclear weapon , " said the out-going president .
bush , the first sitting us president to call for an independent palestinian state at peace with israel , defended his approach to ending the six-decade conflict despite a lack of concrete progress from us-backed negotiations .
" on the most vexing problem in the region - the israeli-palestinian conflict - there is now greater international consensus than at any point in recent memory , " he said .
israeli-palestinian resolution remains us priority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush claims credit for the progress made in israel bush called the two-state approach " one of the highest priorities of my presidency , " described talks following a us-sponsored november 2007 conference in annapolis , maryland , as " determined and substantial . "
" while the israelis and palestinians have not yet produced an agreement , they have made important progress , " he said .
" they have laid a new foundation of trust for the future . "
the bush administration blamed israeli political turmoil in november as it all but ruled out a peace deal in 2008 to pave the way for an independent palestinian state living side-by-side at peace with israel .
but even before that , revived peace efforts had yet to resolve any major core disputes , and progress seemed difficult in the face of the palestinian rift pitting president mahmoud abbas 's fatah against the islamists of hamas .
hamas has controlled gaza since seizing control in june 2007 , while abbas has controlled the west bank from his headquarters in ramallah .
obama has vowed to continue to support the talks .
bush defends iraq war and efforts to democratize region bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush 's presidency will be forever linked to the iraq war bush fiercely defended his decision to invade iraq in march 2003 , but called the war " longer and more costly than expected , " while pointing to iraq 's fledgling democracy as one of the hopeful signs in the region .
he also cited lebanon 's " cedar revolution " against syrian sway , libya 's decision to halt its quest for nuclear weapons , increased enthusiasm for democratic reforms , and prosperity in places such as the united arab emirates .
" iran is facing greater pressure from the international community than ever before , " while terrorist groups like al-qaeda " are increasingly facing ideological rejection in the arab world , " he said .
" these efforts have not always gone according to plan , and in some areas we have fallen short of our hopes , " said bush , who made no mention of obama in his speech .
" it 's rather difficult to see that we did not see a sharp deterioration in the american position in the middle east , " said anthony cordesman , an expert at the center of strategic and international studies think tank .
" it 's very difficult to point to any achievement .

according to bush , few will be as " vexing " as the middle east . when barack obama takes his oath on january 20th to become the 44th president of the united states of america , he will not only be making history as the country 's first black leader but he will bringing to an end one of the most unpopular administrations in living memory .
however , while george w. bush and the majority of his colleagues will be replaced , many of the policies and situations engineered during the 43rd president 's term of office will remain .
these present obama and his team with monumental challenges .
which of bush 's policies will be reversed , which will be scrapped and which will remain ?
one of the most serious situations facing the new president will be that of the middle east .
bush himself has recently said that when he vacates the oval office , he will be handing obama a middle east which represents " the most vexing problem " ; a region in which iran still seeks nuclear arms and the arab-israeli conflict continues .
bush admitted last week that the middle east remains a huge problem with tehran and damascus still suspected of sponsoring terrorism , the iraq war continuing to be more bloody and costly than expected while the democratic reforms he had hoped for in the region had come " in fits and starts " while his peace efforts had suffered " unfortunate setbacks . "
but bush maintained that despite frustrations and disappointments , the middle east in 2008 was a freer , more hopeful , and more promising place than it was in 2001 .
obama shares bush 's views on nuclear iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama says he will not allow iran to reach its nuclear potential before obama is handed the keys to the white house , bush warned that iran 's suspect nuclear program " remains a major threat to peace " and warned anew that washington will not permit tehran to get an atomic arsenal .
obama has vowed to " do everything in my power " to that same end .
" we have made our bottom line clear : for the safety of our people and the peace of the world , america will not allow iran to develop a nuclear weapon , " said the out-going president .
bush , the first sitting us president to call for an independent palestinian state at peace with israel , defended his approach to ending the six-decade conflict despite a lack of concrete progress from us-backed negotiations .
" on the most vexing problem in the region - the israeli-palestinian conflict - there is now greater international consensus than at any point in recent memory , " he said .
israeli-palestinian resolution remains us priority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush claims credit for the progress made in israel bush called the two-state approach " one of the highest priorities of my presidency , " described talks following a us-sponsored november 2007 conference in annapolis , maryland , as " determined and substantial . "
" while the israelis and palestinians have not yet produced an agreement , they have made important progress , " he said .
" they have laid a new foundation of trust for the future . "
the bush administration blamed israeli political turmoil in november as it all but ruled out a peace deal in 2008 to pave the way for an independent palestinian state living side-by-side at peace with israel .
but even before that , revived peace efforts had yet to resolve any major core disputes , and progress seemed difficult in the face of the palestinian rift pitting president mahmoud abbas 's fatah against the islamists of hamas .
hamas has controlled gaza since seizing control in june 2007 , while abbas has controlled the west bank from his headquarters in ramallah .
obama has vowed to continue to support the talks .
bush defends iraq war and efforts to democratize region bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush 's presidency will be forever linked to the iraq war bush fiercely defended his decision to invade iraq in march 2003 , but called the war " longer and more costly than expected , " while pointing to iraq 's fledgling democracy as one of the hopeful signs in the region .
he also cited lebanon 's " cedar revolution " against syrian sway , libya 's decision to halt its quest for nuclear weapons , increased enthusiasm for democratic reforms , and prosperity in places such as the united arab emirates .
" iran is facing greater pressure from the international community than ever before , " while terrorist groups like al-qaeda " are increasingly facing ideological rejection in the arab world , " he said .
" these efforts have not always gone according to plan , and in some areas we have fallen short of our hopes , " said bush , who made no mention of obama in his speech .
" it 's rather difficult to see that we did not see a sharp deterioration in the american position in the middle east , " said anthony cordesman , an expert at the center of strategic and international studies think tank .

despite selling 65,000 tickets for the 2008 race , the hockenheimring , which hosts every other german grand prix , lost over 5 million euros -lrb- $ 6.3 million -rrb- in 2008 , and it 's not the only german race venue suffering . the hockenheimring is asking for support from the regional government in 2010 to enable it to host the formula one grand prix as currently scheduled .
the track alternates hosting the german grand prix with the nuerburgring , which will hold the 2009 race . " we think we have a right to demand this as the formula one yields a considerable profit for the region , " hockenheim circuit ceo karl-josef schmidt told deutsche welle on wednesday , dec .

other sources of income , including merchandising , advertising and television revenues , go to the formula one association or its affiliates . " the underlying reason is that the number of spectators has considerably declined in the past years , " schmidt said .
" we had 95,000 spectators in 2002 , and we had 65,000 this year . " the track needs to sell enough race tickets to offset the fee charged by the formula one association for hosting the event .
hockenheim is contractually forbidden from revealing the amount it pays to the f1 authorities , but the roughly 13 million euros estimated to flow in from the sale of 65,000 tickets sold at roughly 200 euros could n't cover the track 's costs . germany has five drivers on the f1 grid and carmakers like bmw and mercedes are powerful forces in the sport .

" for us as a limited company it is not profitable , but for the region it is profitable , and as the regional government is the nuerburgring 's major shareholder it makes sense to host f1 , " he added . the nuerburgring has a contract to host the german grand prix in 2009 and 2011 , and kafitz said it will uphold this obligation .

despite selling 65,000 tickets for the 2008 race , the hockenheimring , which hosts every other german grand prix , lost over 5 million euros -lrb- $ 6.3 million -rrb- in 2008 , and it 's not the only german race venue suffering . the hockenheimring is asking for support from the regional government in 2010 to enable it to host the formula one grand prix as currently scheduled .
the track alternates hosting the german grand prix with the nuerburgring , which will hold the 2009 race . " we think we have a right to demand this as the formula one yields a considerable profit for the region , " hockenheim circuit ceo karl-josef schmidt told deutsche welle on wednesday , dec .
3 .
" we have an additional revenue of 40 million euros just on the formula one weekend , and that is why we think the region of baden-wuerttemberg should have a remarkable interest in maintaining formula one here . " after losing 5.3 million euros on the event this season , the town of hockenheim , which owns most of the circuit , has said it can not shoulder the burden by itself . fewer spectators bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fewer people are filling the stands in germany ticket sales for the german grand prix have been steadily decreasing , and this is the only revenue the track generates on race weekend .
other sources of income , including merchandising , advertising and television revenues , go to the formula one association or its affiliates . " the underlying reason is that the number of spectators has considerably declined in the past years , " schmidt said .
" we had 95,000 spectators in 2002 , and we had 65,000 this year . " the track needs to sell enough race tickets to offset the fee charged by the formula one association for hosting the event .
hockenheim is contractually forbidden from revealing the amount it pays to the f1 authorities , but the roughly 13 million euros estimated to flow in from the sale of 65,000 tickets sold at roughly 200 euros could n't cover the track 's costs . germany has five drivers on the f1 grid and carmakers like bmw and mercedes are powerful forces in the sport .
both these companies have already said that they value the german grand prix and hope that it doesn ’ t fall off the calendar . shared burden , shared suffering hockenheim shares the german grand prix with germany 's other premier racetrack , the nuerburgring .
the two circuits came to this agreement out of a desire to share the financial burden of hosting a formula one race . " i guess every grand prix racetrack or promoter of a grand prix worldwide loses money with formula one , unfortunately that 's also true for the nuerburgring , " nuerburgring managing director walter kafitz told deutsche welle . " for us as a limited company it is not profitable , but for the region it is profitable , and as the regional government is the nuerburgring 's major shareholder it makes sense to host f1 , " he added . the nuerburgring has a contract to host the german grand prix in 2009 and 2011 , and kafitz said it will uphold this obligation .
but he added that the nuerburgring could n't afford to take the 2010 race if hockenheim drops out . germany has played host to at least one formula one race every year since 1960 . mark hallam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's been 40 years since the first guest workers from the former yugoslavia arrived in west germany .
many have created families in germany , but as retirees , they often return home . pavle konopek , now 63 , is a self-employed entrepreneur .
in the spring of 1969 , he arrived from the north serbian region of srem to work in the german city of solingen .
in the former jugoslavia , he was trained as a machinist , but he studied electrical engineering in germany .
his wife also came with him , and his children and grandchildren continue to live in his adopted homeland .
" i 've never had negative experiences here .
to the contrary , i have a huge circle of friends and acquaintances in germany , " laughed konopek .
" i arrived in a foreign country , but the experience was never unpleasant .
there 's quite a difference between my old and new abode .
serbia will always be my mother country .
but home is wherever i hang my hat . "
answering a german ad for guest workers konopek was one of nearly 1.2 million people classified in germany as former yugoslavians , according to the federal ministry of statistics .
most yugoslav migrants responded to newspaper advertisements inviting guest workers to come .
west germany had sealed an agreement with the former socialist country on oct .
12 , 1968 to allow the entry of much needed labor to boost its wirtschaftswunder .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 1.2 million workers and their families come from the former yugoslavia forty years ago this december , the agreement between belgrade and the former german capital of bonn was ratified and the first wave of migrants arrived on feb .
4 , 1969 .
the first so-called guest workers ever to arrive germany , were the italians in 1955 until the flow from mediterranean rim countries , such as turkey , greece and portugal , officially ended in 1973 .
thirty-five years ago , savo pejovic arrived with a dozen fellow workers from pljevlja in montenegro , landing in the small northern town of soltau , south of hamburg .
he was 26 and goal-oriented .
after seven years of hard work at various jobs and further education , he became a trained mechanic .
" when i first arrived , i thought deutschmarks would fall from the trees " , said the father of two .
" but it was different from what i expected .
one could n't return home anymore and we had to think about adapting to life here .
still it was much easier then than it is today to find work , to switch jobs and move to another city , " he said .
well-trained workforce nearly 700,000 serbs , croatians or bosnians came to west germany for work between 1968 and the disintegration of the former yugoslavia in 1991 , but many have not stayed on .
in the first two decades of their arrival , the former yugoslav guest workers managed to remit an estimated 15 billion euros to their families back home .
as the german economy was growing by leaps and bounds , the guest workers made good use of their skills and training , according to leo monz , head of the foreign workers ' division of the german confederation of trade unions .
but do german politicos and businesses appreciate the contributions made by the " guest workers " ?
" we would have liked to see more recognition for them " , said monz .
" maybe there 's still a way to let them know that we recognize the contributions they have made to our country " .
first generation of pensioners the first wave of yugoslav guest workers are retiring now .
many plan to spend the remainder of their years in germany , where they have created families .
" we must think about how they can tap into their social security benefits in both germany and yugoslavia , so that they can feel at home in both countries " , said monz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first generation of immigrants are now pensioners " we need to work out our social system in caring for the elderly and ensure that there are caregivers who speak german and other languages , and have been immersed in other cultures , " he added .
some of the former guest workers do return to their home country .
milan stanojevic started out as an assembly worker in the automobile industry and ended his career as a labor mediator in gelsenkirchen 's industrial belt .
in 1970 , he left his small village in bosnia-herzegovina as a twenty year old with great hopes .
" i came with a small suitcase that contained a hand-knitted jumper , an old pair of shoes , socks and two cans of tinned food .
when the train left the platform , it dawned on me that i was on a long journey .
i became nostalgic for the parents and friends i left behind .
" but i was n't alone .
we numbered 2,500 altogether , but listlessness set in whenever i turned on the radio or telly , or when i went to sleep .
i can still see the images in my mind today : my parents , the family home , tombstones at the grave site .
" i only wanted to be away for one year , buy myself a moped in germany and go back .
it 's too bad that after 38 years , i never got that moped .
but i did manage to renovate the house that once belonged to my parents " . filip slavkovic -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's been 40 years since the first guest workers from the former yugoslavia arrived in west germany .
many have created families in germany , but as retirees , they often return home . pavle konopek , now 63 , is a self-employed entrepreneur .
in the spring of 1969 , he arrived from the north serbian region of srem to work in the german city of solingen .
in the former jugoslavia , he was trained as a machinist , but he studied electrical engineering in germany .
his wife also came with him , and his children and grandchildren continue to live in his adopted homeland .
" i 've never had negative experiences here .
to the contrary , i have a huge circle of friends and acquaintances in germany , " laughed konopek .
" i arrived in a foreign country , but the experience was never unpleasant .
there 's quite a difference between my old and new abode .
serbia will always be my mother country .
but home is wherever i hang my hat . "
answering a german ad for guest workers konopek was one of nearly 1.2 million people classified in germany as former yugoslavians , according to the federal ministry of statistics .
most yugoslav migrants responded to newspaper advertisements inviting guest workers to come .
west germany had sealed an agreement with the former socialist country on oct .
12 , 1968 to allow the entry of much needed labor to boost its wirtschaftswunder .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 1.2 million workers and their families come from the former yugoslavia forty years ago this december , the agreement between belgrade and the former german capital of bonn was ratified and the first wave of migrants arrived on feb .
4 , 1969 .
the first so-called guest workers ever to arrive germany , were the italians in 1955 until the flow from mediterranean rim countries , such as turkey , greece and portugal , officially ended in 1973 .
thirty-five years ago , savo pejovic arrived with a dozen fellow workers from pljevlja in montenegro , landing in the small northern town of soltau , south of hamburg .
he was 26 and goal-oriented .
after seven years of hard work at various jobs and further education , he became a trained mechanic .
" when i first arrived , i thought deutschmarks would fall from the trees " , said the father of two .
" but it was different from what i expected .
one could n't return home anymore and we had to think about adapting to life here .
still it was much easier then than it is today to find work , to switch jobs and move to another city , " he said .
well-trained workforce nearly 700,000 serbs , croatians or bosnians came to west germany for work between 1968 and the disintegration of the former yugoslavia in 1991 , but many have not stayed on .
in the first two decades of their arrival , the former yugoslav guest workers managed to remit an estimated 15 billion euros to their families back home .
as the german economy was growing by leaps and bounds , the guest workers made good use of their skills and training , according to leo monz , head of the foreign workers ' division of the german confederation of trade unions .
but do german politicos and businesses appreciate the contributions made by the " guest workers " ?
" we would have liked to see more recognition for them " , said monz .
" maybe there 's still a way to let them know that we recognize the contributions they have made to our country " .
first generation of pensioners the first wave of yugoslav guest workers are retiring now .
many plan to spend the remainder of their years in germany , where they have created families .
" we must think about how they can tap into their social security benefits in both germany and yugoslavia , so that they can feel at home in both countries " , said monz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first generation of immigrants are now pensioners " we need to work out our social system in caring for the elderly and ensure that there are caregivers who speak german and other languages , and have been immersed in other cultures , " he added .
some of the former guest workers do return to their home country .
milan stanojevic started out as an assembly worker in the automobile industry and ended his career as a labor mediator in gelsenkirchen 's industrial belt .
in 1970 , he left his small village in bosnia-herzegovina as a twenty year old with great hopes .
" i came with a small suitcase that contained a hand-knitted jumper , an old pair of shoes , socks and two cans of tinned food .
when the train left the platform , it dawned on me that i was on a long journey .
i became nostalgic for the parents and friends i left behind .
" but i was n't alone .
we numbered 2,500 altogether , but listlessness set in whenever i turned on the radio or telly , or when i went to sleep .
i can still see the images in my mind today : my parents , the family home , tombstones at the grave site .
" i only wanted to be away for one year , buy myself a moped in germany and go back .
it 's too bad that after 38 years , i never got that moped .
but i did manage to renovate the house that once belonged to my parents " . filip slavkovic -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the track alternates hosting the german grand prix with the nuerburgring , which will hold the 2009 race . " we think we have a right to demand this as the formula one yields a considerable profit for the region , " hockenheim circuit ceo karl-josef schmidt told deutsche welle on wednesday , dec .

" we have an additional revenue of 40 million euros just on the formula one weekend , and that is why we think the region of baden-wuerttemberg should have a remarkable interest in maintaining formula one here .

" we had 95,000 spectators in 2002 , and we had 65,000 this year . " the track needs to sell enough race tickets to offset the fee charged by the formula one association for hosting the event .
hockenheim is contractually forbidden from revealing the amount it pays to the f1 authorities , but the roughly 13 million euros estimated to flow in from the sale of 65,000 tickets sold at roughly 200 euros could n't cover the track 's costs . germany has five drivers on the f1 grid and carmakers like bmw and mercedes are powerful forces in the sport .
both these companies have already said that they value the german grand prix and hope that it doesn ’ t fall off the calendar . shared burden , shared suffering hockenheim shares the german grand prix with germany 's other premier racetrack , the nuerburgring .

it 's been 40 years since the first guest workers from the former yugoslavia arrived in west germany .
many have created families in germany , but as retirees , they often return home . pavle konopek , now 63 , is a self-employed entrepreneur .
in the spring of 1969 , he arrived from the north serbian region of srem to work in the german city of solingen .
in the former jugoslavia , he was trained as a machinist , but he studied electrical engineering in germany .
his wife also came with him , and his children and grandchildren continue to live in his adopted homeland .
" i 've never had negative experiences here .
to the contrary , i have a huge circle of friends and acquaintances in germany , " laughed konopek .
" i arrived in a foreign country , but the experience was never unpleasant .
there 's quite a difference between my old and new abode .
serbia will always be my mother country .
but home is wherever i hang my hat . "
answering a german ad for guest workers konopek was one of nearly 1.2 million people classified in germany as former yugoslavians , according to the federal ministry of statistics .
most yugoslav migrants responded to newspaper advertisements inviting guest workers to come .
west germany had sealed an agreement with the former socialist country on oct .
12 , 1968 to allow the entry of much needed labor to boost its wirtschaftswunder .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 1.2 million workers and their families come from the former yugoslavia forty years ago this december , the agreement between belgrade and the former german capital of bonn was ratified and the first wave of migrants arrived on feb .
4 , 1969 .
the first so-called guest workers ever to arrive germany , were the italians in 1955 until the flow from mediterranean rim countries , such as turkey , greece and portugal , officially ended in 1973 .
thirty-five years ago , savo pejovic arrived with a dozen fellow workers from pljevlja in montenegro , landing in the small northern town of soltau , south of hamburg .
he was 26 and goal-oriented .
after seven years of hard work at various jobs and further education , he became a trained mechanic .
" when i first arrived , i thought deutschmarks would fall from the trees " , said the father of two .
" but it was different from what i expected .
one could n't return home anymore and we had to think about adapting to life here .
still it was much easier then than it is today to find work , to switch jobs and move to another city , " he said .
well-trained workforce nearly 700,000 serbs , croatians or bosnians came to west germany for work between 1968 and the disintegration of the former yugoslavia in 1991 , but many have not stayed on .
in the first two decades of their arrival , the former yugoslav guest workers managed to remit an estimated 15 billion euros to their families back home .
as the german economy was growing by leaps and bounds , the guest workers made good use of their skills and training , according to leo monz , head of the foreign workers ' division of the german confederation of trade unions .
but do german politicos and businesses appreciate the contributions made by the " guest workers " ?
" we would have liked to see more recognition for them " , said monz .
" maybe there 's still a way to let them know that we recognize the contributions they have made to our country " .
first generation of pensioners the first wave of yugoslav guest workers are retiring now .
many plan to spend the remainder of their years in germany , where they have created families .
" we must think about how they can tap into their social security benefits in both germany and yugoslavia , so that they can feel at home in both countries " , said monz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first generation of immigrants are now pensioners " we need to work out our social system in caring for the elderly and ensure that there are caregivers who speak german and other languages , and have been immersed in other cultures , " he added .
some of the former guest workers do return to their home country .
milan stanojevic started out as an assembly worker in the automobile industry and ended his career as a labor mediator in gelsenkirchen 's industrial belt .
in 1970 , he left his small village in bosnia-herzegovina as a twenty year old with great hopes .
" i came with a small suitcase that contained a hand-knitted jumper , an old pair of shoes , socks and two cans of tinned food .
when the train left the platform , it dawned on me that i was on a long journey .
i became nostalgic for the parents and friends i left behind .
" but i was n't alone .
we numbered 2,500 altogether , but listlessness set in whenever i turned on the radio or telly , or when i went to sleep .
i can still see the images in my mind today : my parents , the family home , tombstones at the grave site .
" i only wanted to be away for one year , buy myself a moped in germany and go back .
it 's too bad that after 38 years , i never got that moped .
but i did manage to renovate the house that once belonged to my parents " . filip slavkovic -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

despite selling 65,000 tickets for the 2008 race , the hockenheimring , which hosts every other german grand prix , lost over 5 million euros -lrb- $ 6.3 million -rrb- in 2008 , and it 's not the only german race venue suffering . the hockenheimring is asking for support from the regional government in 2010 to enable it to host the formula one grand prix as currently scheduled .
the track alternates hosting the german grand prix with the nuerburgring , which will hold the 2009 race . " we think we have a right to demand this as the formula one yields a considerable profit for the region , " hockenheim circuit ceo karl-josef schmidt told deutsche welle on wednesday , dec .

" we have an additional revenue of 40 million euros just on the formula one weekend , and that is why we think the region of baden-wuerttemberg should have a remarkable interest in maintaining formula one here .

" we had 95,000 spectators in 2002 , and we had 65,000 this year . " the track needs to sell enough race tickets to offset the fee charged by the formula one association for hosting the event .
hockenheim is contractually forbidden from revealing the amount it pays to the f1 authorities , but the roughly 13 million euros estimated to flow in from the sale of 65,000 tickets sold at roughly 200 euros could n't cover the track 's costs . germany has five drivers on the f1 grid and carmakers like bmw and mercedes are powerful forces in the sport .

despite selling 65,000 tickets for the 2008 race , the hockenheimring , which hosts every other german grand prix , lost over 5 million euros -lrb- $ 6.3 million -rrb- in 2008 , and it 's not the only german race venue suffering . the hockenheimring is asking for support from the regional government in 2010 to enable it to host the formula one grand prix as currently scheduled .
the track alternates hosting the german grand prix with the nuerburgring , which will hold the 2009 race . " we think we have a right to demand this as the formula one yields a considerable profit for the region , " hockenheim circuit ceo karl-josef schmidt told deutsche welle on wednesday , dec .
3 .
" we have an additional revenue of 40 million euros just on the formula one weekend , and that is why we think the region of baden-wuerttemberg should have a remarkable interest in maintaining formula one here . " after losing 5.3 million euros on the event this season , the town of hockenheim , which owns most of the circuit , has said it can not shoulder the burden by itself . fewer spectators bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fewer people are filling the stands in germany ticket sales for the german grand prix have been steadily decreasing , and this is the only revenue the track generates on race weekend .
other sources of income , including merchandising , advertising and television revenues , go to the formula one association or its affiliates . " the underlying reason is that the number of spectators has considerably declined in the past years , " schmidt said .
" we had 95,000 spectators in 2002 , and we had 65,000 this year . " the track needs to sell enough race tickets to offset the fee charged by the formula one association for hosting the event .
hockenheim is contractually forbidden from revealing the amount it pays to the f1 authorities , but the roughly 13 million euros estimated to flow in from the sale of 65,000 tickets sold at roughly 200 euros could n't cover the track 's costs . germany has five drivers on the f1 grid and carmakers like bmw and mercedes are powerful forces in the sport .
both these companies have already said that they value the german grand prix and hope that it doesn ’ t fall off the calendar . shared burden , shared suffering hockenheim shares the german grand prix with germany 's other premier racetrack , the nuerburgring .
the two circuits came to this agreement out of a desire to share the financial burden of hosting a formula one race . " i guess every grand prix racetrack or promoter of a grand prix worldwide loses money with formula one , unfortunately that 's also true for the nuerburgring , " nuerburgring managing director walter kafitz told deutsche welle . " for us as a limited company it is not profitable , but for the region it is profitable , and as the regional government is the nuerburgring 's major shareholder it makes sense to host f1 , " he added . the nuerburgring has a contract to host the german grand prix in 2009 and 2011 , and kafitz said it will uphold this obligation .
but he added that the nuerburgring could n't afford to take the 2010 race if hockenheim drops out . germany has played host to at least one formula one race every year since 1960 . mark hallam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's been 40 years since the first guest workers from the former yugoslavia arrived in west germany .
many have created families in germany , but as retirees , they often return home . pavle konopek , now 63 , is a self-employed entrepreneur .
in the spring of 1969 , he arrived from the north serbian region of srem to work in the german city of solingen .
in the former jugoslavia , he was trained as a machinist , but he studied electrical engineering in germany .
his wife also came with him , and his children and grandchildren continue to live in his adopted homeland .
" i 've never had negative experiences here .
to the contrary , i have a huge circle of friends and acquaintances in germany , " laughed konopek .
" i arrived in a foreign country , but the experience was never unpleasant .
there 's quite a difference between my old and new abode .
serbia will always be my mother country .
but home is wherever i hang my hat . "
answering a german ad for guest workers konopek was one of nearly 1.2 million people classified in germany as former yugoslavians , according to the federal ministry of statistics .
most yugoslav migrants responded to newspaper advertisements inviting guest workers to come .
west germany had sealed an agreement with the former socialist country on oct .
12 , 1968 to allow the entry of much needed labor to boost its wirtschaftswunder .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 1.2 million workers and their families come from the former yugoslavia forty years ago this december , the agreement between belgrade and the former german capital of bonn was ratified and the first wave of migrants arrived on feb .
4 , 1969 .
the first so-called guest workers ever to arrive germany , were the italians in 1955 until the flow from mediterranean rim countries , such as turkey , greece and portugal , officially ended in 1973 .
thirty-five years ago , savo pejovic arrived with a dozen fellow workers from pljevlja in montenegro , landing in the small northern town of soltau , south of hamburg .
he was 26 and goal-oriented .
after seven years of hard work at various jobs and further education , he became a trained mechanic .
" when i first arrived , i thought deutschmarks would fall from the trees " , said the father of two .
" but it was different from what i expected .
one could n't return home anymore and we had to think about adapting to life here .
still it was much easier then than it is today to find work , to switch jobs and move to another city , " he said .
well-trained workforce nearly 700,000 serbs , croatians or bosnians came to west germany for work between 1968 and the disintegration of the former yugoslavia in 1991 , but many have not stayed on .
in the first two decades of their arrival , the former yugoslav guest workers managed to remit an estimated 15 billion euros to their families back home .
as the german economy was growing by leaps and bounds , the guest workers made good use of their skills and training , according to leo monz , head of the foreign workers ' division of the german confederation of trade unions .
but do german politicos and businesses appreciate the contributions made by the " guest workers " ?
" we would have liked to see more recognition for them " , said monz .
" maybe there 's still a way to let them know that we recognize the contributions they have made to our country " .
first generation of pensioners the first wave of yugoslav guest workers are retiring now .
many plan to spend the remainder of their years in germany , where they have created families .
" we must think about how they can tap into their social security benefits in both germany and yugoslavia , so that they can feel at home in both countries " , said monz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first generation of immigrants are now pensioners " we need to work out our social system in caring for the elderly and ensure that there are caregivers who speak german and other languages , and have been immersed in other cultures , " he added .
some of the former guest workers do return to their home country .
milan stanojevic started out as an assembly worker in the automobile industry and ended his career as a labor mediator in gelsenkirchen 's industrial belt .
in 1970 , he left his small village in bosnia-herzegovina as a twenty year old with great hopes .
" i came with a small suitcase that contained a hand-knitted jumper , an old pair of shoes , socks and two cans of tinned food .
when the train left the platform , it dawned on me that i was on a long journey .
i became nostalgic for the parents and friends i left behind .
" but i was n't alone .
we numbered 2,500 altogether , but listlessness set in whenever i turned on the radio or telly , or when i went to sleep .
i can still see the images in my mind today : my parents , the family home , tombstones at the grave site .
" i only wanted to be away for one year , buy myself a moped in germany and go back .
it 's too bad that after 38 years , i never got that moped .
but i did manage to renovate the house that once belonged to my parents " . filip slavkovic -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

audi followed up on friday with the confirmation that it will stop auto racing after nine years in the american le mans series . apart from banks and other financial companies , the world 's car industry is currently bearing the brunt of the global recession and scrambling for state loans to stay alive . losses have skyrocketed as sales slumped to levels of the early 1980s . not only the big us three of general motors , chrysler and ford have cut marketing and other costs dramatically as they seek a 34- billion dollar bailout from the government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : honda 's fukui moves to protect his firm 's core businesses honda president takeo fukui made it clear on friday that rather than continuing a mainly unsuccessful stint in f1 racing , the company " must protect its core business activities and secure the long term as widespread uncertainties in the economics around the globe continue to mount . " the examples of woods and the sailing team show that these uncertainties concern the full range of sport sponsoring . there are growing question marks over gm 's long-standing engagement in golf in general through its brand buick . doubts have been raised whether the international olympic committee will be successful in making a car manufacturer part of its elite sponsorship program . avoiding annual endorsement costs of more than 50 million dollars weigh heavier in current times than exclusive rights to olympic symbols such as the five rings . carmakers already became more cautious before the crisis fully hit this year . auto industry 's sponsorship of sport in danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaka ca n't believe bwin replaced opel as milan 's sponsor long gone are the days when gm 's german division opel used to be the shirt sponsors of soccer teams such as bayern munich and ac milan , and endorsed athletes like german tennis heroine steffi graf . spanish top club valencia had toyota 's name on their jersey when they won the 2004 league title and the australian open tennis grand slam was once sponsored by ford . audi have trimmed their winter sport engagement down to being the main alpine skiing world cup sponsor . german yachtsman jochen schuemann had hoped that audi would help fund an america 's cup team but the timing was bad as the company is determined to save some 100 million euros . " audi is not allowed to sign new contracts , " schuemann said on thursday , with audi spokeswomen petra klaehn confirming that " the decision was made based on the current economic conditions . " audi cutting back in its involvement audi is also saving in motorsport with the withdrawal from the american le-mans racing series .
but it will continue in the german dtm series and the 24-hour race in le mans . " in view of the international economic and financial crisis , it is clear that motorsport must also make a contribution to reduce costs further , " audi motorsport boss wolfgang ullrich said last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : audi will continue in the le mans 24-hour race but the company 's technical development chief michael dick also said : " we know just how important motorsport is for the success of the brand .
therefore it goes without saying that audi must also be present on the race track in economically hard times . " dieck said that a positive cost-benefit calculation is a must in these days , a fact also applies to events in the us and the world 's showcase racing sport of formula one . nascar series team bosses are looking into how they can help the ailing us companies .
one measure currently discussed is limiting testing to race weekends and not at other times on other tracks . " when you figure in travel , accommodations , parts , tires , track rental you could save the -lrb- nascar -rrb- garage area $ 30 million a year , " the detroit free press quoted team owner rick hendrick as saying . formula one is also engaged in massive cost-cutting by planning for instance a standard engine , measures which prove even more necessary after honda 's pullout . motorsport supremo max mosley named f1 " unsustainable " two months ago and was quoted on friday as saying that other teams may follow honda . former racer gerhard berger , who only 10 days ago sold his 50 per cent share in the toro rosso team , told austria 's apa news agency said that honda 's withdrawal " is only the beginning " and that formula one could be in big danger . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to bush , few will be as " vexing " as the middle east . when barack obama takes his oath on january 20th to become the 44th president of the united states of america , he will not only be making history as the country 's first black leader but he will bringing to an end one of the most unpopular administrations in living memory .
however , while george w. bush and the majority of his colleagues will be replaced , many of the policies and situations engineered during the 43rd president 's term of office will remain .
these present obama and his team with monumental challenges .
which of bush 's policies will be reversed , which will be scrapped and which will remain ?
one of the most serious situations facing the new president will be that of the middle east .
bush himself has recently said that when he vacates the oval office , he will be handing obama a middle east which represents " the most vexing problem " ; a region in which iran still seeks nuclear arms and the arab-israeli conflict continues .
bush admitted last week that the middle east remains a huge problem with tehran and damascus still suspected of sponsoring terrorism , the iraq war continuing to be more bloody and costly than expected while the democratic reforms he had hoped for in the region had come " in fits and starts " while his peace efforts had suffered " unfortunate setbacks . "
but bush maintained that despite frustrations and disappointments , the middle east in 2008 was a freer , more hopeful , and more promising place than it was in 2001 .
obama shares bush 's views on nuclear iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama says he will not allow iran to reach its nuclear potential before obama is handed the keys to the white house , bush warned that iran 's suspect nuclear program " remains a major threat to peace " and warned anew that washington will not permit tehran to get an atomic arsenal .
obama has vowed to " do everything in my power " to that same end .
" we have made our bottom line clear : for the safety of our people and the peace of the world , america will not allow iran to develop a nuclear weapon , " said the out-going president .
bush , the first sitting us president to call for an independent palestinian state at peace with israel , defended his approach to ending the six-decade conflict despite a lack of concrete progress from us-backed negotiations .
" on the most vexing problem in the region - the israeli-palestinian conflict - there is now greater international consensus than at any point in recent memory , " he said .
israeli-palestinian resolution remains us priority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush claims credit for the progress made in israel bush called the two-state approach " one of the highest priorities of my presidency , " described talks following a us-sponsored november 2007 conference in annapolis , maryland , as " determined and substantial . "
" while the israelis and palestinians have not yet produced an agreement , they have made important progress , " he said .
" they have laid a new foundation of trust for the future . "
the bush administration blamed israeli political turmoil in november as it all but ruled out a peace deal in 2008 to pave the way for an independent palestinian state living side-by-side at peace with israel .
but even before that , revived peace efforts had yet to resolve any major core disputes , and progress seemed difficult in the face of the palestinian rift pitting president mahmoud abbas 's fatah against the islamists of hamas .
hamas has controlled gaza since seizing control in june 2007 , while abbas has controlled the west bank from his headquarters in ramallah .
obama has vowed to continue to support the talks .
bush defends iraq war and efforts to democratize region bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush 's presidency will be forever linked to the iraq war bush fiercely defended his decision to invade iraq in march 2003 , but called the war " longer and more costly than expected , " while pointing to iraq 's fledgling democracy as one of the hopeful signs in the region .
he also cited lebanon 's " cedar revolution " against syrian sway , libya 's decision to halt its quest for nuclear weapons , increased enthusiasm for democratic reforms , and prosperity in places such as the united arab emirates .
" iran is facing greater pressure from the international community than ever before , " while terrorist groups like al-qaeda " are increasingly facing ideological rejection in the arab world , " he said .
" these efforts have not always gone according to plan , and in some areas we have fallen short of our hopes , " said bush , who made no mention of obama in his speech .
" it 's rather difficult to see that we did not see a sharp deterioration in the american position in the middle east , " said anthony cordesman , an expert at the center of strategic and international studies think tank .

despite selling 65,000 tickets for the 2008 race , the hockenheimring , which hosts every other german grand prix , lost over 5 million euros -lrb- $ 6.3 million -rrb- in 2008 , and it 's not the only german race venue suffering . the hockenheimring is asking for support from the regional government in 2010 to enable it to host the formula one grand prix as currently scheduled .
the track alternates hosting the german grand prix with the nuerburgring , which will hold the 2009 race . " we think we have a right to demand this as the formula one yields a considerable profit for the region , " hockenheim circuit ceo karl-josef schmidt told deutsche welle on wednesday , dec .
3 .
" we have an additional revenue of 40 million euros just on the formula one weekend , and that is why we think the region of baden-wuerttemberg should have a remarkable interest in maintaining formula one here . " after losing 5.3 million euros on the event this season , the town of hockenheim , which owns most of the circuit , has said it can not shoulder the burden by itself . fewer spectators bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fewer people are filling the stands in germany ticket sales for the german grand prix have been steadily decreasing , and this is the only revenue the track generates on race weekend .
other sources of income , including merchandising , advertising and television revenues , go to the formula one association or its affiliates . " the underlying reason is that the number of spectators has considerably declined in the past years , " schmidt said .
" we had 95,000 spectators in 2002 , and we had 65,000 this year . " the track needs to sell enough race tickets to offset the fee charged by the formula one association for hosting the event .
hockenheim is contractually forbidden from revealing the amount it pays to the f1 authorities , but the roughly 13 million euros estimated to flow in from the sale of 65,000 tickets sold at roughly 200 euros could n't cover the track 's costs . germany has five drivers on the f1 grid and carmakers like bmw and mercedes are powerful forces in the sport .
both these companies have already said that they value the german grand prix and hope that it doesn ’ t fall off the calendar . shared burden , shared suffering hockenheim shares the german grand prix with germany 's other premier racetrack , the nuerburgring .
the two circuits came to this agreement out of a desire to share the financial burden of hosting a formula one race . " i guess every grand prix racetrack or promoter of a grand prix worldwide loses money with formula one , unfortunately that 's also true for the nuerburgring , " nuerburgring managing director walter kafitz told deutsche welle . " for us as a limited company it is not profitable , but for the region it is profitable , and as the regional government is the nuerburgring 's major shareholder it makes sense to host f1 , " he added . the nuerburgring has a contract to host the german grand prix in 2009 and 2011 , and kafitz said it will uphold this obligation .
but he added that the nuerburgring could n't afford to take the 2010 race if hockenheim drops out . germany has played host to at least one formula one race every year since 1960 . mark hallam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" audi cutting back in its involvement audi is also saving in motorsport with the withdrawal from the american le-mans racing series .
but it will continue in the german dtm series and the 24-hour race in le mans . " in view of the international economic and financial crisis , it is clear that motorsport must also make a contribution to reduce costs further , " audi motorsport boss wolfgang ullrich said last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : audi will continue in the le mans 24-hour race but the company 's technical development chief michael dick also said : " we know just how important motorsport is for the success of the brand .
therefore it goes without saying that audi must also be present on the race track in economically hard times . " dieck said that a positive cost-benefit calculation is a must in these days , a fact also applies to events in the us and the world 's showcase racing sport of formula one . nascar series team bosses are looking into how they can help the ailing us companies .
one measure currently discussed is limiting testing to race weekends and not at other times on other tracks . " when you figure in travel , accommodations , parts , tires , track rental you could save the -lrb- nascar -rrb- garage area $ 30 million a year , " the detroit free press quoted team owner rick hendrick as saying . formula one is also engaged in massive cost-cutting by planning for instance a standard engine , measures which prove even more necessary after honda 's pullout . motorsport supremo max mosley named f1 " unsustainable " two months ago and was quoted on friday as saying that other teams may follow honda . former racer gerhard berger , who only 10 days ago sold his 50 per cent share in the toro rosso team , told austria 's apa news agency said that honda 's withdrawal " is only the beginning " and that formula one could be in big danger . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to bush , few will be as " vexing " as the middle east . when barack obama takes his oath on january 20th to become the 44th president of the united states of america , he will not only be making history as the country 's first black leader but he will bringing to an end one of the most unpopular administrations in living memory .
however , while george w. bush and the majority of his colleagues will be replaced , many of the policies and situations engineered during the 43rd president 's term of office will remain .
these present obama and his team with monumental challenges .
which of bush 's policies will be reversed , which will be scrapped and which will remain ?
one of the most serious situations facing the new president will be that of the middle east .
bush himself has recently said that when he vacates the oval office , he will be handing obama a middle east which represents " the most vexing problem " ; a region in which iran still seeks nuclear arms and the arab-israeli conflict continues .
bush admitted last week that the middle east remains a huge problem with tehran and damascus still suspected of sponsoring terrorism , the iraq war continuing to be more bloody and costly than expected while the democratic reforms he had hoped for in the region had come " in fits and starts " while his peace efforts had suffered " unfortunate setbacks . "
but bush maintained that despite frustrations and disappointments , the middle east in 2008 was a freer , more hopeful , and more promising place than it was in 2001 .
obama shares bush 's views on nuclear iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama says he will not allow iran to reach its nuclear potential before obama is handed the keys to the white house , bush warned that iran 's suspect nuclear program " remains a major threat to peace " and warned anew that washington will not permit tehran to get an atomic arsenal .
obama has vowed to " do everything in my power " to that same end .
" we have made our bottom line clear : for the safety of our people and the peace of the world , america will not allow iran to develop a nuclear weapon , " said the out-going president .
bush , the first sitting us president to call for an independent palestinian state at peace with israel , defended his approach to ending the six-decade conflict despite a lack of concrete progress from us-backed negotiations .
" on the most vexing problem in the region - the israeli-palestinian conflict - there is now greater international consensus than at any point in recent memory , " he said .
israeli-palestinian resolution remains us priority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush claims credit for the progress made in israel bush called the two-state approach " one of the highest priorities of my presidency , " described talks following a us-sponsored november 2007 conference in annapolis , maryland , as " determined and substantial . "
" while the israelis and palestinians have not yet produced an agreement , they have made important progress , " he said .
" they have laid a new foundation of trust for the future . "
the bush administration blamed israeli political turmoil in november as it all but ruled out a peace deal in 2008 to pave the way for an independent palestinian state living side-by-side at peace with israel .
but even before that , revived peace efforts had yet to resolve any major core disputes , and progress seemed difficult in the face of the palestinian rift pitting president mahmoud abbas 's fatah against the islamists of hamas .
hamas has controlled gaza since seizing control in june 2007 , while abbas has controlled the west bank from his headquarters in ramallah .
obama has vowed to continue to support the talks .
bush defends iraq war and efforts to democratize region bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush 's presidency will be forever linked to the iraq war bush fiercely defended his decision to invade iraq in march 2003 , but called the war " longer and more costly than expected , " while pointing to iraq 's fledgling democracy as one of the hopeful signs in the region .
he also cited lebanon 's " cedar revolution " against syrian sway , libya 's decision to halt its quest for nuclear weapons , increased enthusiasm for democratic reforms , and prosperity in places such as the united arab emirates .
" iran is facing greater pressure from the international community than ever before , " while terrorist groups like al-qaeda " are increasingly facing ideological rejection in the arab world , " he said .
" these efforts have not always gone according to plan , and in some areas we have fallen short of our hopes , " said bush , who made no mention of obama in his speech .
" it 's rather difficult to see that we did not see a sharp deterioration in the american position in the middle east , " said anthony cordesman , an expert at the center of strategic and international studies think tank .
" it 's very difficult to point to any achievement .

according to bush , few will be as " vexing " as the middle east . when barack obama takes his oath on january 20th to become the 44th president of the united states of america , he will not only be making history as the country 's first black leader but he will bringing to an end one of the most unpopular administrations in living memory .
however , while george w. bush and the majority of his colleagues will be replaced , many of the policies and situations engineered during the 43rd president 's term of office will remain .
these present obama and his team with monumental challenges .
which of bush 's policies will be reversed , which will be scrapped and which will remain ?
one of the most serious situations facing the new president will be that of the middle east .
bush himself has recently said that when he vacates the oval office , he will be handing obama a middle east which represents " the most vexing problem " ; a region in which iran still seeks nuclear arms and the arab-israeli conflict continues .
bush admitted last week that the middle east remains a huge problem with tehran and damascus still suspected of sponsoring terrorism , the iraq war continuing to be more bloody and costly than expected while the democratic reforms he had hoped for in the region had come " in fits and starts " while his peace efforts had suffered " unfortunate setbacks . "
but bush maintained that despite frustrations and disappointments , the middle east in 2008 was a freer , more hopeful , and more promising place than it was in 2001 .
obama shares bush 's views on nuclear iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama says he will not allow iran to reach its nuclear potential before obama is handed the keys to the white house , bush warned that iran 's suspect nuclear program " remains a major threat to peace " and warned anew that washington will not permit tehran to get an atomic arsenal .
obama has vowed to " do everything in my power " to that same end .
" we have made our bottom line clear : for the safety of our people and the peace of the world , america will not allow iran to develop a nuclear weapon , " said the out-going president .
bush , the first sitting us president to call for an independent palestinian state at peace with israel , defended his approach to ending the six-decade conflict despite a lack of concrete progress from us-backed negotiations .
" on the most vexing problem in the region - the israeli-palestinian conflict - there is now greater international consensus than at any point in recent memory , " he said .
israeli-palestinian resolution remains us priority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush claims credit for the progress made in israel bush called the two-state approach " one of the highest priorities of my presidency , " described talks following a us-sponsored november 2007 conference in annapolis , maryland , as " determined and substantial . "
" while the israelis and palestinians have not yet produced an agreement , they have made important progress , " he said .
" they have laid a new foundation of trust for the future . "
the bush administration blamed israeli political turmoil in november as it all but ruled out a peace deal in 2008 to pave the way for an independent palestinian state living side-by-side at peace with israel .
but even before that , revived peace efforts had yet to resolve any major core disputes , and progress seemed difficult in the face of the palestinian rift pitting president mahmoud abbas 's fatah against the islamists of hamas .
hamas has controlled gaza since seizing control in june 2007 , while abbas has controlled the west bank from his headquarters in ramallah .
obama has vowed to continue to support the talks .
bush defends iraq war and efforts to democratize region bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush 's presidency will be forever linked to the iraq war bush fiercely defended his decision to invade iraq in march 2003 , but called the war " longer and more costly than expected , " while pointing to iraq 's fledgling democracy as one of the hopeful signs in the region .
he also cited lebanon 's " cedar revolution " against syrian sway , libya 's decision to halt its quest for nuclear weapons , increased enthusiasm for democratic reforms , and prosperity in places such as the united arab emirates .
" iran is facing greater pressure from the international community than ever before , " while terrorist groups like al-qaeda " are increasingly facing ideological rejection in the arab world , " he said .
" these efforts have not always gone according to plan , and in some areas we have fallen short of our hopes , " said bush , who made no mention of obama in his speech .
" it 's rather difficult to see that we did not see a sharp deterioration in the american position in the middle east , " said anthony cordesman , an expert at the center of strategic and international studies think tank .

according to bush , few will be as " vexing " as the middle east . when barack obama takes his oath on january 20th to become the 44th president of the united states of america , he will not only be making history as the country 's first black leader but he will bringing to an end one of the most unpopular administrations in living memory .
however , while george w. bush and the majority of his colleagues will be replaced , many of the policies and situations engineered during the 43rd president 's term of office will remain .
these present obama and his team with monumental challenges .
which of bush 's policies will be reversed , which will be scrapped and which will remain ?
one of the most serious situations facing the new president will be that of the middle east .
bush himself has recently said that when he vacates the oval office , he will be handing obama a middle east which represents " the most vexing problem " ; a region in which iran still seeks nuclear arms and the arab-israeli conflict continues .
bush admitted last week that the middle east remains a huge problem with tehran and damascus still suspected of sponsoring terrorism , the iraq war continuing to be more bloody and costly than expected while the democratic reforms he had hoped for in the region had come " in fits and starts " while his peace efforts had suffered " unfortunate setbacks . "
but bush maintained that despite frustrations and disappointments , the middle east in 2008 was a freer , more hopeful , and more promising place than it was in 2001 .
obama shares bush 's views on nuclear iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama says he will not allow iran to reach its nuclear potential before obama is handed the keys to the white house , bush warned that iran 's suspect nuclear program " remains a major threat to peace " and warned anew that washington will not permit tehran to get an atomic arsenal .
obama has vowed to " do everything in my power " to that same end .
" we have made our bottom line clear : for the safety of our people and the peace of the world , america will not allow iran to develop a nuclear weapon , " said the out-going president .
bush , the first sitting us president to call for an independent palestinian state at peace with israel , defended his approach to ending the six-decade conflict despite a lack of concrete progress from us-backed negotiations .
" on the most vexing problem in the region - the israeli-palestinian conflict - there is now greater international consensus than at any point in recent memory , " he said .
israeli-palestinian resolution remains us priority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush claims credit for the progress made in israel bush called the two-state approach " one of the highest priorities of my presidency , " described talks following a us-sponsored november 2007 conference in annapolis , maryland , as " determined and substantial . "
" while the israelis and palestinians have not yet produced an agreement , they have made important progress , " he said .
" they have laid a new foundation of trust for the future . "
the bush administration blamed israeli political turmoil in november as it all but ruled out a peace deal in 2008 to pave the way for an independent palestinian state living side-by-side at peace with israel .
but even before that , revived peace efforts had yet to resolve any major core disputes , and progress seemed difficult in the face of the palestinian rift pitting president mahmoud abbas 's fatah against the islamists of hamas .
hamas has controlled gaza since seizing control in june 2007 , while abbas has controlled the west bank from his headquarters in ramallah .
obama has vowed to continue to support the talks .
bush defends iraq war and efforts to democratize region bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush 's presidency will be forever linked to the iraq war bush fiercely defended his decision to invade iraq in march 2003 , but called the war " longer and more costly than expected , " while pointing to iraq 's fledgling democracy as one of the hopeful signs in the region .
he also cited lebanon 's " cedar revolution " against syrian sway , libya 's decision to halt its quest for nuclear weapons , increased enthusiasm for democratic reforms , and prosperity in places such as the united arab emirates .
" iran is facing greater pressure from the international community than ever before , " while terrorist groups like al-qaeda " are increasingly facing ideological rejection in the arab world , " he said .
" these efforts have not always gone according to plan , and in some areas we have fallen short of our hopes , " said bush , who made no mention of obama in his speech .
" it 's rather difficult to see that we did not see a sharp deterioration in the american position in the middle east , " said anthony cordesman , an expert at the center of strategic and international studies think tank .
" it 's very difficult to point to any achievement .
if there have been achievements almost all come from the united states military , " he told reporters . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to bush , few will be as " vexing " as the middle east . when barack obama takes his oath on january 20th to become the 44th president of the united states of america , he will not only be making history as the country 's first black leader but he will bringing to an end one of the most unpopular administrations in living memory .
however , while george w. bush and the majority of his colleagues will be replaced , many of the policies and situations engineered during the 43rd president 's term of office will remain .
these present obama and his team with monumental challenges .
which of bush 's policies will be reversed , which will be scrapped and which will remain ?
one of the most serious situations facing the new president will be that of the middle east .
bush himself has recently said that when he vacates the oval office , he will be handing obama a middle east which represents " the most vexing problem " ; a region in which iran still seeks nuclear arms and the arab-israeli conflict continues .
bush admitted last week that the middle east remains a huge problem with tehran and damascus still suspected of sponsoring terrorism , the iraq war continuing to be more bloody and costly than expected while the democratic reforms he had hoped for in the region had come " in fits and starts " while his peace efforts had suffered " unfortunate setbacks . "
but bush maintained that despite frustrations and disappointments , the middle east in 2008 was a freer , more hopeful , and more promising place than it was in 2001 .
obama shares bush 's views on nuclear iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama says he will not allow iran to reach its nuclear potential before obama is handed the keys to the white house , bush warned that iran 's suspect nuclear program " remains a major threat to peace " and warned anew that washington will not permit tehran to get an atomic arsenal .
obama has vowed to " do everything in my power " to that same end .
" we have made our bottom line clear : for the safety of our people and the peace of the world , america will not allow iran to develop a nuclear weapon , " said the out-going president .
bush , the first sitting us president to call for an independent palestinian state at peace with israel , defended his approach to ending the six-decade conflict despite a lack of concrete progress from us-backed negotiations .
" on the most vexing problem in the region - the israeli-palestinian conflict - there is now greater international consensus than at any point in recent memory , " he said .
israeli-palestinian resolution remains us priority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush claims credit for the progress made in israel bush called the two-state approach " one of the highest priorities of my presidency , " described talks following a us-sponsored november 2007 conference in annapolis , maryland , as " determined and substantial . "
" while the israelis and palestinians have not yet produced an agreement , they have made important progress , " he said .
" they have laid a new foundation of trust for the future . "
the bush administration blamed israeli political turmoil in november as it all but ruled out a peace deal in 2008 to pave the way for an independent palestinian state living side-by-side at peace with israel .
but even before that , revived peace efforts had yet to resolve any major core disputes , and progress seemed difficult in the face of the palestinian rift pitting president mahmoud abbas 's fatah against the islamists of hamas .
hamas has controlled gaza since seizing control in june 2007 , while abbas has controlled the west bank from his headquarters in ramallah .
obama has vowed to continue to support the talks .
bush defends iraq war and efforts to democratize region bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush 's presidency will be forever linked to the iraq war bush fiercely defended his decision to invade iraq in march 2003 , but called the war " longer and more costly than expected , " while pointing to iraq 's fledgling democracy as one of the hopeful signs in the region .
he also cited lebanon 's " cedar revolution " against syrian sway , libya 's decision to halt its quest for nuclear weapons , increased enthusiasm for democratic reforms , and prosperity in places such as the united arab emirates .
" iran is facing greater pressure from the international community than ever before , " while terrorist groups like al-qaeda " are increasingly facing ideological rejection in the arab world , " he said .
" these efforts have not always gone according to plan , and in some areas we have fallen short of our hopes , " said bush , who made no mention of obama in his speech .
" it 's rather difficult to see that we did not see a sharp deterioration in the american position in the middle east , " said anthony cordesman , an expert at the center of strategic and international studies think tank .
" it 's very difficult to point to any achievement .

audi followed up on friday with the confirmation that it will stop auto racing after nine years in the american le mans series . apart from banks and other financial companies , the world 's car industry is currently bearing the brunt of the global recession and scrambling for state loans to stay alive . losses have skyrocketed as sales slumped to levels of the early 1980s . not only the big us three of general motors , chrysler and ford have cut marketing and other costs dramatically as they seek a 34- billion dollar bailout from the government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : honda 's fukui moves to protect his firm 's core businesses honda president takeo fukui made it clear on friday that rather than continuing a mainly unsuccessful stint in f1 racing , the company " must protect its core business activities and secure the long term as widespread uncertainties in the economics around the globe continue to mount . " the examples of woods and the sailing team show that these uncertainties concern the full range of sport sponsoring . there are growing question marks over gm 's long-standing engagement in golf in general through its brand buick . doubts have been raised whether the international olympic committee will be successful in making a car manufacturer part of its elite sponsorship program . avoiding annual endorsement costs of more than 50 million dollars weigh heavier in current times than exclusive rights to olympic symbols such as the five rings . carmakers already became more cautious before the crisis fully hit this year . auto industry 's sponsorship of sport in danger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaka ca n't believe bwin replaced opel as milan 's sponsor long gone are the days when gm 's german division opel used to be the shirt sponsors of soccer teams such as bayern munich and ac milan , and endorsed athletes like german tennis heroine steffi graf . spanish top club valencia had toyota 's name on their jersey when they won the 2004 league title and the australian open tennis grand slam was once sponsored by ford . audi have trimmed their winter sport engagement down to being the main alpine skiing world cup sponsor . german yachtsman jochen schuemann had hoped that audi would help fund an america 's cup team but the timing was bad as the company is determined to save some 100 million euros . " audi is not allowed to sign new contracts , " schuemann said on thursday , with audi spokeswomen petra klaehn confirming that " the decision was made based on the current economic conditions . " audi cutting back in its involvement audi is also saving in motorsport with the withdrawal from the american le-mans racing series .
but it will continue in the german dtm series and the 24-hour race in le mans . " in view of the international economic and financial crisis , it is clear that motorsport must also make a contribution to reduce costs further , " audi motorsport boss wolfgang ullrich said last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : audi will continue in the le mans 24-hour race but the company 's technical development chief michael dick also said : " we know just how important motorsport is for the success of the brand .
therefore it goes without saying that audi must also be present on the race track in economically hard times . " dieck said that a positive cost-benefit calculation is a must in these days , a fact also applies to events in the us and the world 's showcase racing sport of formula one . nascar series team bosses are looking into how they can help the ailing us companies .
one measure currently discussed is limiting testing to race weekends and not at other times on other tracks . " when you figure in travel , accommodations , parts , tires , track rental you could save the -lrb- nascar -rrb- garage area $ 30 million a year , " the detroit free press quoted team owner rick hendrick as saying . formula one is also engaged in massive cost-cutting by planning for instance a standard engine , measures which prove even more necessary after honda 's pullout . motorsport supremo max mosley named f1 " unsustainable " two months ago and was quoted on friday as saying that other teams may follow honda . former racer gerhard berger , who only 10 days ago sold his 50 per cent share in the toro rosso team , told austria 's apa news agency said that honda 's withdrawal " is only the beginning " and that formula one could be in big danger . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to bush , few will be as " vexing " as the middle east . when barack obama takes his oath on january 20th to become the 44th president of the united states of america , he will not only be making history as the country 's first black leader but he will bringing to an end one of the most unpopular administrations in living memory .
however , while george w. bush and the majority of his colleagues will be replaced , many of the policies and situations engineered during the 43rd president 's term of office will remain .
these present obama and his team with monumental challenges .
which of bush 's policies will be reversed , which will be scrapped and which will remain ?
one of the most serious situations facing the new president will be that of the middle east .
bush himself has recently said that when he vacates the oval office , he will be handing obama a middle east which represents " the most vexing problem " ; a region in which iran still seeks nuclear arms and the arab-israeli conflict continues .
bush admitted last week that the middle east remains a huge problem with tehran and damascus still suspected of sponsoring terrorism , the iraq war continuing to be more bloody and costly than expected while the democratic reforms he had hoped for in the region had come " in fits and starts " while his peace efforts had suffered " unfortunate setbacks . "
but bush maintained that despite frustrations and disappointments , the middle east in 2008 was a freer , more hopeful , and more promising place than it was in 2001 .
obama shares bush 's views on nuclear iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama says he will not allow iran to reach its nuclear potential before obama is handed the keys to the white house , bush warned that iran 's suspect nuclear program " remains a major threat to peace " and warned anew that washington will not permit tehran to get an atomic arsenal .
obama has vowed to " do everything in my power " to that same end .
" we have made our bottom line clear : for the safety of our people and the peace of the world , america will not allow iran to develop a nuclear weapon , " said the out-going president .
bush , the first sitting us president to call for an independent palestinian state at peace with israel , defended his approach to ending the six-decade conflict despite a lack of concrete progress from us-backed negotiations .
" on the most vexing problem in the region - the israeli-palestinian conflict - there is now greater international consensus than at any point in recent memory , " he said .
israeli-palestinian resolution remains us priority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush claims credit for the progress made in israel bush called the two-state approach " one of the highest priorities of my presidency , " described talks following a us-sponsored november 2007 conference in annapolis , maryland , as " determined and substantial . "
" while the israelis and palestinians have not yet produced an agreement , they have made important progress , " he said .
" they have laid a new foundation of trust for the future . "
the bush administration blamed israeli political turmoil in november as it all but ruled out a peace deal in 2008 to pave the way for an independent palestinian state living side-by-side at peace with israel .
but even before that , revived peace efforts had yet to resolve any major core disputes , and progress seemed difficult in the face of the palestinian rift pitting president mahmoud abbas 's fatah against the islamists of hamas .
hamas has controlled gaza since seizing control in june 2007 , while abbas has controlled the west bank from his headquarters in ramallah .
obama has vowed to continue to support the talks .
bush defends iraq war and efforts to democratize region bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush 's presidency will be forever linked to the iraq war bush fiercely defended his decision to invade iraq in march 2003 , but called the war " longer and more costly than expected , " while pointing to iraq 's fledgling democracy as one of the hopeful signs in the region .
he also cited lebanon 's " cedar revolution " against syrian sway , libya 's decision to halt its quest for nuclear weapons , increased enthusiasm for democratic reforms , and prosperity in places such as the united arab emirates .
" iran is facing greater pressure from the international community than ever before , " while terrorist groups like al-qaeda " are increasingly facing ideological rejection in the arab world , " he said .
" these efforts have not always gone according to plan , and in some areas we have fallen short of our hopes , " said bush , who made no mention of obama in his speech .
" it 's rather difficult to see that we did not see a sharp deterioration in the american position in the middle east , " said anthony cordesman , an expert at the center of strategic and international studies think tank .
" it 's very difficult to point to any achievement .
if there have been achievements almost all come from the united states military , " he told reporters . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 07.12.2008 obama to inherit " vexing " middle east from departing bush großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama faces huge challenges in dealing with the myriad problems in the middle east when george w. bush makes way for barack obama in january , the new president will face many of the same issues that dogged the previous administration .
according to bush , few will be as " vexing " as the middle east . when barack obama takes his oath on january 20th to become the 44th president of the united states of america , he will not only be making history as the country 's first black leader but he will bringing to an end one of the most unpopular administrations in living memory .
however , while george w. bush and the majority of his colleagues will be replaced , many of the policies and situations engineered during the 43rd president 's term of office will remain .
these present obama and his team with monumental challenges .
which of bush 's policies will be reversed , which will be scrapped and which will remain ?
one of the most serious situations facing the new president will be that of the middle east .
bush himself has recently said that when he vacates the oval office , he will be handing obama a middle east which represents " the most vexing problem " ; a region in which iran still seeks nuclear arms and the arab-israeli conflict continues .
bush admitted last week that the middle east remains a huge problem with tehran and damascus still suspected of sponsoring terrorism , the iraq war continuing to be more bloody and costly than expected while the democratic reforms he had hoped for in the region had come " in fits and starts " while his peace efforts had suffered " unfortunate setbacks . "
but bush maintained that despite frustrations and disappointments , the middle east in 2008 was a freer , more hopeful , and more promising place than it was in 2001 .
obama shares bush 's views on nuclear iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama says he will not allow iran to reach its nuclear potential before obama is handed the keys to the white house , bush warned that iran 's suspect nuclear program " remains a major threat to peace " and warned anew that washington will not permit tehran to get an atomic arsenal .
obama has vowed to " do everything in my power " to that same end .
" we have made our bottom line clear : for the safety of our people and the peace of the world , america will not allow iran to develop a nuclear weapon , " said the out-going president .
bush , the first sitting us president to call for an independent palestinian state at peace with israel , defended his approach to ending the six-decade conflict despite a lack of concrete progress from us-backed negotiations .
" on the most vexing problem in the region - the israeli-palestinian conflict - there is now greater international consensus than at any point in recent memory , " he said .
israeli-palestinian resolution remains us priority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush claims credit for the progress made in israel bush called the two-state approach " one of the highest priorities of my presidency , " described talks following a us-sponsored november 2007 conference in annapolis , maryland , as " determined and substantial . "
" while the israelis and palestinians have not yet produced an agreement , they have made important progress , " he said .
" they have laid a new foundation of trust for the future . "
the bush administration blamed israeli political turmoil in november as it all but ruled out a peace deal in 2008 to pave the way for an independent palestinian state living side-by-side at peace with israel .
but even before that , revived peace efforts had yet to resolve any major core disputes , and progress seemed difficult in the face of the palestinian rift pitting president mahmoud abbas 's fatah against the islamists of hamas .
hamas has controlled gaza since seizing control in june 2007 , while abbas has controlled the west bank from his headquarters in ramallah .
obama has vowed to continue to support the talks .
bush defends iraq war and efforts to democratize region bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush 's presidency will be forever linked to the iraq war bush fiercely defended his decision to invade iraq in march 2003 , but called the war " longer and more costly than expected , " while pointing to iraq 's fledgling democracy as one of the hopeful signs in the region .
he also cited lebanon 's " cedar revolution " against syrian sway , libya 's decision to halt its quest for nuclear weapons , increased enthusiasm for democratic reforms , and prosperity in places such as the united arab emirates .
" iran is facing greater pressure from the international community than ever before , " while terrorist groups like al-qaeda " are increasingly facing ideological rejection in the arab world , " he said .
" these efforts have not always gone according to plan , and in some areas we have fallen short of our hopes , " said bush , who made no mention of obama in his speech .
" it 's rather difficult to see that we did not see a sharp deterioration in the american position in the middle east , " said anthony cordesman , an expert at the center of strategic and international studies think tank .
" it 's very difficult to point to any achievement .
if there have been achievements almost all come from the united states military , " he told reporters . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 07.12.2008 obama to inherit " vexing " middle east from departing bush großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama faces huge challenges in dealing with the myriad problems in the middle east when george w. bush makes way for barack obama in january , the new president will face many of the same issues that dogged the previous administration .
according to bush , few will be as " vexing " as the middle east . when barack obama takes his oath on january 20th to become the 44th president of the united states of america , he will not only be making history as the country 's first black leader but he will bringing to an end one of the most unpopular administrations in living memory .
however , while george w. bush and the majority of his colleagues will be replaced , many of the policies and situations engineered during the 43rd president 's term of office will remain .
these present obama and his team with monumental challenges .
which of bush 's policies will be reversed , which will be scrapped and which will remain ?
one of the most serious situations facing the new president will be that of the middle east .
bush himself has recently said that when he vacates the oval office , he will be handing obama a middle east which represents " the most vexing problem " ; a region in which iran still seeks nuclear arms and the arab-israeli conflict continues .
bush admitted last week that the middle east remains a huge problem with tehran and damascus still suspected of sponsoring terrorism , the iraq war continuing to be more bloody and costly than expected while the democratic reforms he had hoped for in the region had come " in fits and starts " while his peace efforts had suffered " unfortunate setbacks . "
but bush maintained that despite frustrations and disappointments , the middle east in 2008 was a freer , more hopeful , and more promising place than it was in 2001 .
obama shares bush 's views on nuclear iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama says he will not allow iran to reach its nuclear potential before obama is handed the keys to the white house , bush warned that iran 's suspect nuclear program " remains a major threat to peace " and warned anew that washington will not permit tehran to get an atomic arsenal .
obama has vowed to " do everything in my power " to that same end .
" we have made our bottom line clear : for the safety of our people and the peace of the world , america will not allow iran to develop a nuclear weapon , " said the out-going president .
bush , the first sitting us president to call for an independent palestinian state at peace with israel , defended his approach to ending the six-decade conflict despite a lack of concrete progress from us-backed negotiations .
" on the most vexing problem in the region - the israeli-palestinian conflict - there is now greater international consensus than at any point in recent memory , " he said .
israeli-palestinian resolution remains us priority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush claims credit for the progress made in israel bush called the two-state approach " one of the highest priorities of my presidency , " described talks following a us-sponsored november 2007 conference in annapolis , maryland , as " determined and substantial . "
" while the israelis and palestinians have not yet produced an agreement , they have made important progress , " he said .
" they have laid a new foundation of trust for the future . "
the bush administration blamed israeli political turmoil in november as it all but ruled out a peace deal in 2008 to pave the way for an independent palestinian state living side-by-side at peace with israel .
but even before that , revived peace efforts had yet to resolve any major core disputes , and progress seemed difficult in the face of the palestinian rift pitting president mahmoud abbas 's fatah against the islamists of hamas .
hamas has controlled gaza since seizing control in june 2007 , while abbas has controlled the west bank from his headquarters in ramallah .
obama has vowed to continue to support the talks .
bush defends iraq war and efforts to democratize region bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush 's presidency will be forever linked to the iraq war bush fiercely defended his decision to invade iraq in march 2003 , but called the war " longer and more costly than expected , " while pointing to iraq 's fledgling democracy as one of the hopeful signs in the region .
he also cited lebanon 's " cedar revolution " against syrian sway , libya 's decision to halt its quest for nuclear weapons , increased enthusiasm for democratic reforms , and prosperity in places such as the united arab emirates .
" iran is facing greater pressure from the international community than ever before , " while terrorist groups like al-qaeda " are increasingly facing ideological rejection in the arab world , " he said .
" these efforts have not always gone according to plan , and in some areas we have fallen short of our hopes , " said bush , who made no mention of obama in his speech .
" it 's rather difficult to see that we did not see a sharp deterioration in the american position in the middle east , " said anthony cordesman , an expert at the center of strategic and international studies think tank .
" it 's very difficult to point to any achievement .
if there have been achievements almost all come from the united states military , " he told reporters . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the czech republic is set to take over at eu 's helm from france on january 1 .

topolanek defeated bem in a second blow to party 's eurosceptic camp during this weekend 's party congress .

the czech republic is the bloc 's last member to vote on the lisbon treaty , which has been stalled since the irish voters rejected it in a referendum last june .
the pact , aimed at streamlining decision-making in the 27-member union in a bid to make it a stronger global player , must have unanimous approval by all eu countries to become valid .
the czech parliament 's lower house is set to begin debating it on tuesday .

the premier conceded that the upcoming eu presidency has protected his fragile government from a collapse .
" perhaps only the czech presidency and the economic threats next year are holding back all the players on the political scene , " topolanek said .
the governing parties fell out of voters ' favor after they introduced several unpopular public finance reforms , such as direct fees in health care .

it 's been 40 years since the first guest workers from the former yugoslavia arrived in west germany .
many have created families in germany , but as retirees , they often return home . pavle konopek , now 63 , is a self-employed entrepreneur .
in the spring of 1969 , he arrived from the north serbian region of srem to work in the german city of solingen .
in the former jugoslavia , he was trained as a machinist , but he studied electrical engineering in germany .
his wife also came with him , and his children and grandchildren continue to live in his adopted homeland .
" i 've never had negative experiences here .
to the contrary , i have a huge circle of friends and acquaintances in germany , " laughed konopek .
" i arrived in a foreign country , but the experience was never unpleasant .
there 's quite a difference between my old and new abode .
serbia will always be my mother country .
but home is wherever i hang my hat . "
answering a german ad for guest workers konopek was one of nearly 1.2 million people classified in germany as former yugoslavians , according to the federal ministry of statistics .
most yugoslav migrants responded to newspaper advertisements inviting guest workers to come .
west germany had sealed an agreement with the former socialist country on oct .
12 , 1968 to allow the entry of much needed labor to boost its wirtschaftswunder .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : about 1.2 million workers and their families come from the former yugoslavia forty years ago this december , the agreement between belgrade and the former german capital of bonn was ratified and the first wave of migrants arrived on feb .
4 , 1969 .
the first so-called guest workers ever to arrive germany , were the italians in 1955 until the flow from mediterranean rim countries , such as turkey , greece and portugal , officially ended in 1973 .
thirty-five years ago , savo pejovic arrived with a dozen fellow workers from pljevlja in montenegro , landing in the small northern town of soltau , south of hamburg .
he was 26 and goal-oriented .
after seven years of hard work at various jobs and further education , he became a trained mechanic .
" when i first arrived , i thought deutschmarks would fall from the trees " , said the father of two .
" but it was different from what i expected .
one could n't return home anymore and we had to think about adapting to life here .
still it was much easier then than it is today to find work , to switch jobs and move to another city , " he said .
well-trained workforce nearly 700,000 serbs , croatians or bosnians came to west germany for work between 1968 and the disintegration of the former yugoslavia in 1991 , but many have not stayed on .
in the first two decades of their arrival , the former yugoslav guest workers managed to remit an estimated 15 billion euros to their families back home .
as the german economy was growing by leaps and bounds , the guest workers made good use of their skills and training , according to leo monz , head of the foreign workers ' division of the german confederation of trade unions .
but do german politicos and businesses appreciate the contributions made by the " guest workers " ?
" we would have liked to see more recognition for them " , said monz .
" maybe there 's still a way to let them know that we recognize the contributions they have made to our country " .
first generation of pensioners the first wave of yugoslav guest workers are retiring now .
many plan to spend the remainder of their years in germany , where they have created families .
" we must think about how they can tap into their social security benefits in both germany and yugoslavia , so that they can feel at home in both countries " , said monz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first generation of immigrants are now pensioners " we need to work out our social system in caring for the elderly and ensure that there are caregivers who speak german and other languages , and have been immersed in other cultures , " he added .
some of the former guest workers do return to their home country .
milan stanojevic started out as an assembly worker in the automobile industry and ended his career as a labor mediator in gelsenkirchen 's industrial belt .
in 1970 , he left his small village in bosnia-herzegovina as a twenty year old with great hopes .
" i came with a small suitcase that contained a hand-knitted jumper , an old pair of shoes , socks and two cans of tinned food .
when the train left the platform , it dawned on me that i was on a long journey .
i became nostalgic for the parents and friends i left behind .
" but i was n't alone .
we numbered 2,500 altogether , but listlessness set in whenever i turned on the radio or telly , or when i went to sleep .
i can still see the images in my mind today : my parents , the family home , tombstones at the grave site .
" i only wanted to be away for one year , buy myself a moped in germany and go back .
it 's too bad that after 38 years , i never got that moped .
but i did manage to renovate the house that once belonged to my parents " . filip slavkovic -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 07.12.2008 obama to inherit " vexing " middle east from departing bush großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama faces huge challenges in dealing with the myriad problems in the middle east when george w. bush makes way for barack obama in january , the new president will face many of the same issues that dogged the previous administration .
according to bush , few will be as " vexing " as the middle east . when barack obama takes his oath on january 20th to become the 44th president of the united states of america , he will not only be making history as the country 's first black leader but he will bringing to an end one of the most unpopular administrations in living memory .
however , while george w. bush and the majority of his colleagues will be replaced , many of the policies and situations engineered during the 43rd president 's term of office will remain .
these present obama and his team with monumental challenges .
which of bush 's policies will be reversed , which will be scrapped and which will remain ?
one of the most serious situations facing the new president will be that of the middle east .
bush himself has recently said that when he vacates the oval office , he will be handing obama a middle east which represents " the most vexing problem " ; a region in which iran still seeks nuclear arms and the arab-israeli conflict continues .
bush admitted last week that the middle east remains a huge problem with tehran and damascus still suspected of sponsoring terrorism , the iraq war continuing to be more bloody and costly than expected while the democratic reforms he had hoped for in the region had come " in fits and starts " while his peace efforts had suffered " unfortunate setbacks . "
but bush maintained that despite frustrations and disappointments , the middle east in 2008 was a freer , more hopeful , and more promising place than it was in 2001 .
obama shares bush 's views on nuclear iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama says he will not allow iran to reach its nuclear potential before obama is handed the keys to the white house , bush warned that iran 's suspect nuclear program " remains a major threat to peace " and warned anew that washington will not permit tehran to get an atomic arsenal .
obama has vowed to " do everything in my power " to that same end .
" we have made our bottom line clear : for the safety of our people and the peace of the world , america will not allow iran to develop a nuclear weapon , " said the out-going president .
bush , the first sitting us president to call for an independent palestinian state at peace with israel , defended his approach to ending the six-decade conflict despite a lack of concrete progress from us-backed negotiations .
" on the most vexing problem in the region - the israeli-palestinian conflict - there is now greater international consensus than at any point in recent memory , " he said .
israeli-palestinian resolution remains us priority bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush claims credit for the progress made in israel bush called the two-state approach " one of the highest priorities of my presidency , " described talks following a us-sponsored november 2007 conference in annapolis , maryland , as " determined and substantial . "
" while the israelis and palestinians have not yet produced an agreement , they have made important progress , " he said .
" they have laid a new foundation of trust for the future . "
the bush administration blamed israeli political turmoil in november as it all but ruled out a peace deal in 2008 to pave the way for an independent palestinian state living side-by-side at peace with israel .
but even before that , revived peace efforts had yet to resolve any major core disputes , and progress seemed difficult in the face of the palestinian rift pitting president mahmoud abbas 's fatah against the islamists of hamas .
hamas has controlled gaza since seizing control in june 2007 , while abbas has controlled the west bank from his headquarters in ramallah .
obama has vowed to continue to support the talks .
bush defends iraq war and efforts to democratize region bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush 's presidency will be forever linked to the iraq war bush fiercely defended his decision to invade iraq in march 2003 , but called the war " longer and more costly than expected , " while pointing to iraq 's fledgling democracy as one of the hopeful signs in the region .
he also cited lebanon 's " cedar revolution " against syrian sway , libya 's decision to halt its quest for nuclear weapons , increased enthusiasm for democratic reforms , and prosperity in places such as the united arab emirates .
" iran is facing greater pressure from the international community than ever before , " while terrorist groups like al-qaeda " are increasingly facing ideological rejection in the arab world , " he said .
" these efforts have not always gone according to plan , and in some areas we have fallen short of our hopes , " said bush , who made no mention of obama in his speech .
" it 's rather difficult to see that we did not see a sharp deterioration in the american position in the middle east , " said anthony cordesman , an expert at the center of strategic and international studies think tank .
" it 's very difficult to point to any achievement .
if there have been achievements almost all come from the united states military , " he told reporters . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

well , apart from the obvious that they all occupied the oval office , they also all proposed some kind of universal health coverage programme - and they all failed to deliver .
with their failure in mind , barack obama has been more cautious .
he has not gone as far as to promise universal health care - but that is clearly his goal .
reduce costs so what are president-elect obama 's proposals ?
he wants to increase health coverage by reducing medical costs .
he also wants to improve quality .
how ?
well , on the campaign trail he promised to cut the average american family 's healthcare bill by $ 2,500 a year .
obama 's health plan cutting families 'annual health bill by $ 2,500 mandatory healthcare coverage for all children financial assistance for those who ca n't afford cover help for small businesses to meet the costs of covering employees he is also promising mandatory healthcare coverage for all children , financial assistance for people who can not afford health insurance and for small businesses to help meet the costs of giving their employees cover .
he also wants to bring down the costs of medication .
the challenge is huge .
around 50 million americans have no health insurance - millions more are under-insured .
his administration will have to tackle a complex system of private health insurance , vested interests and the mountains of paperwork involved in getting healthcare to those americans who rely on government support through medicare -lrb- for the elderly -rrb- and medicaid -lrb- for the poor -rrb- .
barack obama hopes to make savings of billions of dollars by cutting through red tape and computerising the system , but not everyone believes that it is going to be as easy as it sounds .
and there are more pressing domestic problems - namely the state of the us economy .
crisis or opportunity ?
while barack obama , hillary clinton and john mccain may have seen healthcare as a priority in the middle of the election campaign , it has been eclipsed by the financial meltdown .
the question now is - can america afford it ?
and can the president-elect give it the attention it needs ?
the us already spends 15 % of its wealth on healthcare - a greater proportion than most developed nations .
can it afford to spend more ?
henry aaron , a healthcare expert at the brookings institution , says that initially he was sceptical that a new obama administration would be able to deliver .
but now he argues the economic crisis could make it easier .
he believes it is now possible to link healthcare reform to an economic stimulus .
if the us is already spending a trillion dollars on an economic bail-out , then throwing money at healthcare is no longer such a problem .
mr aaron says it would cost about $ 100bn a year to cover the uninsured .
politically too , there may never be a better time to take on the issue .
deal-maker barack obama is not alone in promising to tackle healthcare reform .
the democratic party has strengthened its grip on congress and that can only help his efforts .
mr obama is expected to appoint a former majority leader of the senate - tom daschle - as his health secretary .
he is someone who knows his way round congress and , just importantly , is seen as a consensus-builder .
he has the necessary skills to bang heads together and reach a deal .
and tom dashcle will not have to work on his own .
the democratic senate finance committee chairman - max baucus - has just published his own 89-page plan .
it calls for a mandate on all americans to carry health insurance - more than mr obama is proposing .
but he is already consulting the president-elect .
as is the veteran senator ted kennedy , who , after surgery to remove a tumour on his brain , is now promising to put together a health bill within months .
it remains an enormous task , however .
and the past shows that good intentions are not enough .
getting politicians from both parties , as well as state governments , private health insurers and the pharmaceutical companies all on side will not be easy .
but there is at least a consensus that america 's healthcare system is in dire need of reform .
as to what it will look like , henry aaron says : " expect evolution not revolution " .
barack obama 's opponents may call him a socialist , but no american politician is advocating a british-style nationalised health service .

and there are more pressing domestic problems - namely the state of the us economy .
crisis or opportunity ?
while barack obama , hillary clinton and john mccain may have seen healthcare as a priority in the middle of the election campaign , it has been eclipsed by the financial meltdown .
the question now is - can america afford it ?
and can the president-elect give it the attention it needs ?
the us already spends 15 % of its wealth on healthcare - a greater proportion than most developed nations .
can it afford to spend more ?
tom daschle is expected to become the new health secretary henry aaron , a healthcare expert at the brookings institution , says that initially he was sceptical that a new obama administration would be able to deliver .
but now he argues the economic crisis could make it easier .
he believes it is now possible to link healthcare reform to an economic stimulus .
if the us is already spending a trillion dollars on an economic bail-out , then throwing money at healthcare is no longer such a problem .
mr aaron says it would cost about $ 100bn a year to cover the uninsured .
politically too , there may never be a better time to take on the issue .
deal-maker barack obama is not alone in promising to tackle healthcare reform .
the democratic party has strengthened its grip on congress and that can only help his efforts .
mr obama is expected to appoint a former majority leader of the senate - tom daschle - as his health secretary .
he is someone who knows his way round congress and , just importantly , is seen as a consensus-builder .
he has the necessary skills to bang heads together and reach a deal .
and tom dashcle will not have to work on his own .
the democratic senate finance committee chairman - max baucus - has just published his own 89-page plan .
it calls for a mandate on all americans to carry health insurance - more than mr obama is proposing .
but he is already consulting the president-elect .
as is the veteran senator ted kennedy , who , after surgery to remove a tumour on his brain , is now promising to put together a health bill within months .
it remains an enormous task , however .
and the past shows that good intentions are not enough .
getting politicians from both parties , as well as state governments , private health insurers and the pharmaceutical companies all on side will not be easy .
but there is at least a consensus that america 's healthcare system is in dire need of reform .
as to what it will look like , henry aaron says : " expect evolution not revolution " .
barack obama 's opponents may call him a socialist , but no american politician is advocating a british-style nationalised health service .

the us spends more of its gdp on healthcare than any other country well , apart from the obvious that they all occupied the oval office , they also all proposed some kind of universal health coverage programme - and they all failed to deliver .
with their failure in mind , barack obama has been more cautious .
he has not gone as far as to promise universal health care - but that is clearly his goal .
reduce costs so what are president-elect obama 's proposals ?
he wants to increase health coverage by reducing medical costs .
he also wants to improve quality .
how ?
well , on the campaign trail he promised to cut the average american family 's healthcare bill by $ 2,500 a year .
obama 's health plan cutting families 'annual health bill by $ 2,500 mandatory healthcare coverage for all children financial assistance for those who ca n't afford cover help for small businesses to meet the costs of covering employees he is also promising mandatory healthcare coverage for all children , financial assistance for people who can not afford health insurance and for small businesses to help meet the costs of giving their employees cover .
he also wants to bring down the costs of medication .
the challenge is huge .
around 50 million americans have no health insurance - millions more are under-insured .
his administration will have to tackle a complex system of private health insurance , vested interests and the mountains of paperwork involved in getting healthcare to those americans who rely on government support through medicare -lrb- for the elderly -rrb- and medicaid -lrb- for the poor -rrb- .

statistics have long suggested those born in august do less well in exams than those born the previous september .
but sir jim rose 's study will reject nut suggestions that summer-born children should have a delayed start .
instead , he will say all should start in the september after they turn four , but only part-time for the youngest .
' elbowed out ' at present , children in england and wales in many local authorities are expected to start school in the september after their fourth birthday .
however , some authorities delay school life for younger children until after christmas , while others make use of part-time starts .
sir jim was asked to examine the issue by children 's secretary ed balls following concerns about children born in the summer doing less well than their older classmates . "
teachers should n't mix up maturity with ability " ed balls childrens ' secretary his interim report , to be published on monday , will say it is better for children to start school as early as they can - so long as they have attended good nursery schools .
" parents need to be given the facts so they can make an informed choice about when their child starts school because evidence suggests it can have a major impact on the rest of their life , particularly if they come from a disadvantaged background , " sir jim said .
" but we also need to be sure that teachers are giving younger children the right support and are not letting them get elbowed out by older youngsters . "
his report will suggest children could be eased into school life by attending only in the mornings or afternoon , for 15 hours a week , at first .
' radical solution ' mr balls said he recognised parents ' concerns about their children being taught alongside older pupils .
" teachers should n't mix up maturity with ability , " he said .
" i do n't want a child wrongly held back as being low ability in primary school when it 's their age that 's the problem . "
christine blower , the national union of teachers ' acting general secretary , said a more radical solution would be to follow the example of scotland and wales and end national testing in english primaries .
" it is quite obvious that summer-born children lose a year in their education , but the current system treats all children as if they were all born in the autumn term , " she said .

biologists from fauna and flora international said they had found up to 20 tonkin snub-nosed monkeys in a remote forest .
the team said the new group offered a ray of hope because it included three infants , suggesting that the monkeys were breeding and increasing in number .
until now , fewer than 250 of the primates were thought to exist .
" when i saw the tonkin snub-nosed monkeys , i was overjoyed , " said biologist le khac quyet .
" this new discovery further underlines the importance of learning more about the monkeys ' range and distribution .
" there is still time to save this unique species , but with 200 or so left and the threat still strong , we need to act now , " he added .
under pressure the iucn red list of threatened species lists the monkeys as critically endangered because their numbers have continued to decline as a result of intensive hunting and deforestation .
until now , the monkeys had only been recorded in a few north-eastern areas within vietnam , with no group exceeding 50 mature adults .
the loss of habitat and human encroachment had " dramatically restricted " the animals ' distribution , the red list warned .
it also said that the creatures ' inquisitive nature also meant that they did not flee when approached by humans , increasing the risk of being shot by hunters .
however , fauna and flora international -lrb- ffi -rrb- hopes the discovery of the new sub-population will lead to increased efforts to protect the primates ' remaining habitat .
" all recent indications suggest that we have a fantastic opportunity to secure this population and significantly increase the chances of survival of this species , " explained paul insua-cao , ffi 's vietnam primate programme manager .
biologists observing the monkeys also found that they were more wary of people , issuing warning signs to each other .
the ffi team suggested that this group had associated humans with danger , perhaps as a result of ongoing threats from hunters .
a global assessment of the world 's primates published in august warned that 48 % of the order faced extinction .
the outlook , described as depressing by conservationists , warned that the main threat was habitat loss , primarily deforestation .
other threats include hunting of primates for food and the illegal wildlife trade .
the ffi team hopes its work , co-funded by the uk government , with local people will ease the pressures on the tonkin snub-nosed monkeys ' habitat .
measures including curbing the growing of crops in the area 's tropical forests and confiscating hunters ' guns have already been introduced since the new sub-population was first recorded in april 2008 .

advertisement fewer than 250 tonkin snub-nosed monkeys remain in the wild a new sub-population of a critically endangered species of monkey has been recorded in north-western vietnam .
biologists from fauna and flora international said they had found up to 20 tonkin snub-nosed monkeys in a remote forest .
the team said the new group offered a ray of hope because it included three infants , suggesting that the monkeys were breeding and increasing in number .
until now , fewer than 250 of the primates were thought to exist .
" when i saw the tonkin snub-nosed monkeys , i was overjoyed , " said biologist le khac quyet .
" this new discovery further underlines the importance of learning more about the monkeys ' range and distribution .
" there is still time to save this unique species , but with 200 or so left and the threat still strong , we need to act now , " he added .
under pressure the iucn red list of threatened species lists the monkeys as critically endangered because their numbers have continued to decline as a result of intensive hunting and deforestation .
hunting and deforestation has led to a continued decline in the species until now , the monkeys had only been recorded in a few north-eastern areas within vietnam , with no group exceeding 50 mature adults .
the loss of habitat and human encroachment had " dramatically restricted " the animals ' distribution , the red list warned .
it also said that the creatures ' inquisitive nature also meant that they did not flee when approached by humans , increasing the risk of being shot by hunters .
however , fauna and flora international -lrb- ffi -rrb- hopes the discovery of the new sub-population will lead to increased efforts to protect the primates ' remaining habitat .

millions of pounds a year of taxpayer 's money are paid by police to mobile phone companies in the course of criminal investigations .
using freedom of information legislation , we investigate the situation ...
in 2007 , police forces in the uk paid over £ 8.5m to mobile phone companies for information to help solve crimes .
there are 65 million active mobile phones in the uk -lrb- more than country 's population -rrb- each with a unique number - making mobile use like a digital fingerprint .
police increasingly rely on information such as when , where and to whom a call was made , or text being sent , to solve cases .
sir chris fox , former president of association of chief police officers , acpo , says : " the police use this type of information in every sort of inquiry , whether it be the missing person , or the drugs network or the gang violence outside of a club , the accident on a motorway where it may have been caused by someone actually using a mobile phone , or indeed at the top of the tree a terrorist attack , or the preparation for a terrorist attack . "
such information is provided on request by mobile companies .
taxpayer 's bill " so maybe the mobile phone companies should consider this their quid pro quo " tom brake mp but under the regulation of investigatory powers act 2000 , the companies are allowed to claim the cost of the research back , and charge the police , local authorities or government agencies .
coming from public budgets , taxpayers are ultimately footing the bill .
liberal democrat home affairs spokesman , tom brake mp , who sits on the house of commons home affairs select committee , says : " clearly people will be shocked to find out that £ 8.5 has been spent by police forces around the country to obtain data they need from the mobile phone companies .
" what the mobile phone companies may want to consider is that the police have spent an awful lot of their time in recent years trying to sort out crime that 's linked to mobile phones because the mobile phone companies did n't implement the very straightforward measures they could have done to switch mobile phones off when they 'd been stolen .
" so maybe the mobile phone companies should consider this their quid pro quo . "

the politics show has used freedom of information requests to find figures for 49 of the 52 regional police forces who , in total , spent £ 8.6m in the 2007/2008 financial year .
twenty five forces spent over £ 100,000 and four spent over £ 500,000 .
the metropolitan police force was the largest , spending £ 1.4 million .
there is no standard fee for a search , and whilst it can be waived -lrb- and sometimes is -rrb- forces tend to be billed on a case by case basis .
should it be free ?
the uk mobile market is worth £ 15bn annually to the companies involved but they do not feel that charging public bodies is in any way wrong , saying that it would be unfair to pass on such costs to their customers .
on the politics show on 7 december , former shadow home secretary , david davis , said : " companies should have a sense of civic responsibility , and in my view , that means this sort of material should be provided free . "
jack wraith from the telecommunications uk fraud forum , which advises mobile companies on this area explains : " we are required by that legislation to put into place communications experts in order to service the requests from the listed authorities as a matter of routine .
" and as a result , those people have got to be trained , they are auditable , they are answerable to the interceptions commissioner and if they make mistakes they are answerable by law .
" so all of these aspects require funding . "
given the crucial role in such important cases as ian huntley 's conviction for the soham murders , steve wright 's for the cambridge prostitute murders , and leads followed after the london bombings on 7/7 , there is an argument that in the public interest , the data should be provided to police for no charge .

mobile phone companies have charged massive sums ...
in 2007 , police forces in the uk paid over £ 8.5m to mobile phone companies for information to help solve crimes .
there are 65 million active mobile phones in the uk -lrb- more than country 's population -rrb- each with a unique number - making mobile use like a digital fingerprint .
police increasingly rely on information such as when , where and to whom a call was made , or text being sent , to solve cases .
sir chris fox , former president of association of chief police officers , acpo , says : " the police use this type of information in every sort of inquiry , whether it be the missing person , or the drugs network or the gang violence outside of a club , the accident on a motorway where it may have been caused by someone actually using a mobile phone , or indeed at the top of the tree a terrorist attack , or the preparation for a terrorist attack .

such information is provided on request by mobile companies .
taxpayer 's bill so maybe the mobile phone companies should consider this their quid pro quo tom brake mp but under the regulation of investigatory powers act 2000 , the companies are allowed to claim the cost of the research back , and charge the police , local authorities or government agencies .
coming from public budgets , taxpayers are ultimately footing the bill .
liberal democrat home affairs spokesman , tom brake mp , who sits on the house of commons home affairs select committee , says : " clearly people will be shocked to find out that £ 8.5 has been spent by police forces around the country to obtain data they need from the mobile phone companies .
" what the mobile phone companies may want to consider is that the police have spent an awful lot of their time in recent years trying to sort out crime that 's linked to mobile phones because the mobile phone companies did n't implement the very straightforward measures they could have done to switch mobile phones off when they 'd been stolen .
" so maybe the mobile phone companies should consider this their quid pro quo . "

a spokesman said the agency was awaiting confirmation from the irish authorities as to whether any of the affected products had been exported to the uk .
pizza he said they would assess the situation and take any action required to protect uk consumers .
consumers and retailers in the irish republic have been warned to destroy all irish pork and bacon products bought since 1 september as a precaution .
bacon , ham , sausages , white pudding and pizzas with ham toppings must be included in the withdrawal of stocks , the food safety authority of ireland said .
dioxins are formed during combustion processes , such as waste incineration , and during some industrial processes .
the presence of the dioxin polychlorinated biphenyls -lrb- pcbs -rrb- - a substance banned in the irish republic since the 1970s - in animal feed and pork samples was confirmed on saturday afternoon in test results from a uk laboratory .
chronic long-term exposure to the dioxin can have serious health effects , including causing cancers , but irish officials said the recall would ensure consumers only had minimum exposure to it .
the country 's chief medical officer , dr tony holohan , said anyone who had eaten pig meat did not need to seek medical help .
