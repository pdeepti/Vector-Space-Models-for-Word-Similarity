russia might be preparing to recognize abkhazia sovereignty .
the european union opposes the move . kosovo 's declaration of independence from serbia last month gave hope to rebels who have been fighting to do the same in the region of abkhazia , which borders the black sea . since abkhazia declared independence from georgia on friday , march 7 , russia made signs that it is preparing to recognize the region 's sovereignty by lifting a formal trade embargo . " there is a growing preoccupation and anxiety that russia may be paving the way for recognition of abkhazia , " eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said monday , march 10 . she reaffirmed eu support for georgia 's borders .
abkhazia 's declaration followed a similar vote on wednesday by georgia 's other separatist region , south ossetia .
both regions cited kosovo as a precedent , calling on the international community to recognize their self-declared independence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia wants eu support georgia 's pro-western government has accused moscow of trying to destabilize the region . " georgia 's territorial integrity has always been clearly supported by the eu ... this is absolutely clear , " ferrero-waldner said . the issue was on the agenda of an eu foreign ministers meeting held in brussels monday . " we will be discussing georgia and ... what can we do in order to support more strongly georgia in a difficult situation , " ferrero-waldner said . sweden and poland had written to the eu to call for the bloc to do more to stabilize georgia ahead of planned parliamentary elections in may .
ferrero-waldner suggested the eu could make it easier to get visas and launch a trade pact . further destabilization likely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the moment , no country officially recognizes abkhazia as an independent state moscow has had an official ban on trade with abkhazia since 1996 , although georgia has accused russia of providing financial aid to rebels .
the region uses the russia ruble as its currency . no country , including russia , currently recognizes the rebel provinces ' independence claims and georgia has sworn to regain control of the areas . abkhazia and south ossetia broke away from georgia in the early 1990s .
thousands of people were killed in the conflicts and hundreds of thousands of ethnic-georgians were forced to abandon their homes . georgian politicians have said that lifting russia 's sanctions will allow moscow to freely send weapons , military equipment and russian mercenaries , further destabilizing the region . the georgian foreign ministry said russia 's move was " an extremely dangerous provocation that encourages separatism and aims to deepen tensions in the conflict zone .

" georgia is a point of concern for us , because the russian federation and the confederation of independent states decided to draw certain parallels with kosovo on this issue , " slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel told reporters after a meeting of eu foreign ministers . russia vehemently opposed kosovo 's independence from serbia .
moscow had long argued that the west 's support of kosovo independence would set a precedent for other regions of the world .
the eu always argued that kosovo was a special case . sergei bagapsh , rebel leader of abkhazia , did n't agree with the european view .
he told interfax news agency that his province has as much right to independence as kosovo . " we call on the international community to refuse double standards and recognize the independence of abkhazia and south ossetia , " bagapsh said .
" for us the situation with the recognition of kosovo is a precedent and all talk of the uniqueness of that case is not credible .

the deal signals the end of an 11-month wage fight . two days of emergency negotiations averted an open-ended strike which threatened to plunge germany into transportation chaos by halting most passenger , freight and suburban trains .
the german train drivers ' union gdl planned to have its members walk off the job first thing monday morning .
the strike would have affected half of regional passenger services in western germany and 90 percent of those in the eastern part of the country where gdl has high membership .
" it 's a good day today , and what we had planned from tonight ... will not happen , " the head of gdl , manfred schell , told reporters sunday .
collective bargaining a sticking point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german commuters wo n't be kept waiting germany 's state-owned deutsche bahn had insisted that all three union representing railway employees be part of a collective wage contract .
this angered the gdl , which had come to a separate agreement with deutsche bahn in january after months of negotiations that included several strikes .
bahn chief hartmut mehdorn said his company had agreed on terms with the gdl and its two rival unions , transnet and the gdba , which represent the bulk of the railway 's employees .
train drivers will be granted a special status " that will fit into deutsche bahn 's collective wage contract without problems , " mehdorn said .
mehdorn described the 11-month negotiations , which led to short strikes in major cities and the freight sector last year , the worst labor dispute in deutsche bahn 's history .

the deal signals the end of an 11-month wage fight . two days of emergency negotiations averted an open-ended strike which threatened to plunge germany into transportation chaos by halting most passenger , freight and suburban trains .
the german train drivers ' union gdl planned to have its members walk off the job first thing monday morning .
the strike would have affected half of regional passenger services in western germany and 90 percent of those in the eastern part of the country where gdl has high membership .
" it 's a good day today , and what we had planned from tonight ... will not happen , " the head of gdl , manfred schell , told reporters sunday .
collective bargaining a sticking point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german commuters wo n't be kept waiting germany 's state-owned deutsche bahn had insisted that all three union representing railway employees be part of a collective wage contract .
this angered the gdl , which had come to a separate agreement with deutsche bahn in january after months of negotiations that included several strikes .
bahn chief hartmut mehdorn said his company had agreed on terms with the gdl and its two rival unions , transnet and the gdba , which represent the bulk of the railway 's employees .
train drivers will be granted a special status " that will fit into deutsche bahn 's collective wage contract without problems , " mehdorn said .
mehdorn described the 11-month negotiations , which led to short strikes in major cities and the freight sector last year , the worst labor dispute in deutsche bahn 's history .
" we have a result which brings calm for the next few years , " mehdorn told reporters .
" i am very happy for deutsche bahn and for our clients . "
berlin strike continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was concern that a strike would hurt the german economy in berlin , a separate , ongoing wage disagreement brought local transportation services to a halt on wednesday .
there had been concerns that the gdl strike would further paralyze the city .
germany had also been faced with warning strikes from public sector employees represented by the trade union verdi .
those were put on hold friday to give arbitrators a chance to try and reach a compromise over pay and working hours .
the agreement covers some 2 million federal and local government staff .
the head of germany 's bda employers association , dieter hundt , said excessive wage deals could “ threaten the current positive development of the economy and of the labor market . "
" continued strikes could lead to a situation , where the number of unemployed will be decreasing by less than the expected 300,000 to 400,000 this year , " hundt told bild am sonntag newspaper . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there is a growing preoccupation and anxiety that russia may be paving the way for recognition of abkhazia , " eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said monday , march 10 . she reaffirmed eu support for georgia 's borders .

russia might be preparing to recognize abkhazia sovereignty .
the european union opposes the move . kosovo 's declaration of independence from serbia last month gave hope to rebels who have been fighting to do the same in the region of abkhazia , which borders the black sea . since abkhazia declared independence from georgia on friday , march 7 , russia made signs that it is preparing to recognize the region 's sovereignty by lifting a formal trade embargo . " there is a growing preoccupation and anxiety that russia may be paving the way for recognition of abkhazia , " eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said monday , march 10 . she reaffirmed eu support for georgia 's borders .
abkhazia 's declaration followed a similar vote on wednesday by georgia 's other separatist region , south ossetia .
both regions cited kosovo as a precedent , calling on the international community to recognize their self-declared independence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia wants eu support georgia 's pro-western government has accused moscow of trying to destabilize the region .

european union officials hope the vote will end in victory for west-leaning parties . kostunica 's government formally stepped down on monday , march 10 , and called for early elections in may after its coalition parties fell out over the issue of how to deal with the european union following the support of many eu states for kosovo 's secession . european union officials said they hoped the coming polls would benefit pro-european parties . " with the coming elections , we hope that the european forces will win , " said slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency . eu foreign ministers meeting in brussels were unanimous in calling on the people of serbia not to turn their backs on europe by supporting serbia 's nationalistic parties in the election . " europe needs serbia and serbia needs europe , " sweden 's foreign minister carl bildt said .

the european union opposes the move . kosovo 's declaration of independence from serbia last month gave hope to rebels who have been fighting to do the same in the region of abkhazia , which borders the black sea . since abkhazia declared independence from georgia on friday , march 7 , russia made signs that it is preparing to recognize the region 's sovereignty by lifting a formal trade embargo . " there is a growing preoccupation and anxiety that russia may be paving the way for recognition of abkhazia , " eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said monday , march 10 . she reaffirmed eu support for georgia 's borders .
abkhazia 's declaration followed a similar vote on wednesday by georgia 's other separatist region , south ossetia .

" we will be discussing georgia and ... what can we do in order to support more strongly georgia in a difficult situation , " ferrero-waldner said . sweden and poland had written to the eu to call for the bloc to do more to stabilize georgia ahead of planned parliamentary elections in may .

the region uses the russia ruble as its currency . no country , including russia , currently recognizes the rebel provinces ' independence claims and georgia has sworn to regain control of the areas . abkhazia and south ossetia broke away from georgia in the early 1990s .
thousands of people were killed in the conflicts and hundreds of thousands of ethnic-georgians were forced to abandon their homes . georgian politicians have said that lifting russia 's sanctions will allow moscow to freely send weapons , military equipment and russian mercenaries , further destabilizing the region . the georgian foreign ministry said russia 's move was " an extremely dangerous provocation that encourages separatism and aims to deepen tensions in the conflict zone .

moscow had long argued that the west 's support of kosovo independence would set a precedent for other regions of the world .
the eu always argued that kosovo was a special case . sergei bagapsh , rebel leader of abkhazia , did n't agree with the european view .
he told interfax news agency that his province has as much right to independence as kosovo . " we call on the international community to refuse double standards and recognize the independence of abkhazia and south ossetia , " bagapsh said .

" there is a growing preoccupation and anxiety that russia may be paving the way for recognition of abkhazia , " eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said monday , march 10 . she reaffirmed eu support for georgia 's borders .
abkhazia 's declaration followed a similar vote on wednesday by georgia 's other separatist region , south ossetia .
both regions cited kosovo as a precedent , calling on the international community to recognize their self-declared independence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia wants eu support georgia 's pro-western government has accused moscow of trying to destabilize the region . " georgia 's territorial integrity has always been clearly supported by the eu ... this is absolutely clear , " ferrero-waldner said . the issue was on the agenda of an eu foreign ministers meeting held in brussels monday . " we will be discussing georgia and ... what can we do in order to support more strongly georgia in a difficult situation , " ferrero-waldner said . sweden and poland had written to the eu to call for the bloc to do more to stabilize georgia ahead of planned parliamentary elections in may .
ferrero-waldner suggested the eu could make it easier to get visas and launch a trade pact . further destabilization likely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the moment , no country officially recognizes abkhazia as an independent state moscow has had an official ban on trade with abkhazia since 1996 , although georgia has accused russia of providing financial aid to rebels .
the region uses the russia ruble as its currency . no country , including russia , currently recognizes the rebel provinces ' independence claims and georgia has sworn to regain control of the areas . abkhazia and south ossetia broke away from georgia in the early 1990s .
thousands of people were killed in the conflicts and hundreds of thousands of ethnic-georgians were forced to abandon their homes . georgian politicians have said that lifting russia 's sanctions will allow moscow to freely send weapons , military equipment and russian mercenaries , further destabilizing the region . the georgian foreign ministry said russia 's move was " an extremely dangerous provocation that encourages separatism and aims to deepen tensions in the conflict zone . " the statement accused moscow of " trying to violate georgia 's sovereignty . " blame kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the georgian military has tried to retake control abkhazia renewed its diplomatic effort for international recognition in the weeks after kosovo 's independence . " georgia is a point of concern for us , because the russian federation and the confederation of independent states decided to draw certain parallels with kosovo on this issue , " slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel told reporters after a meeting of eu foreign ministers . russia vehemently opposed kosovo 's independence from serbia .
moscow had long argued that the west 's support of kosovo independence would set a precedent for other regions of the world .
the eu always argued that kosovo was a special case . sergei bagapsh , rebel leader of abkhazia , did n't agree with the european view .
he told interfax news agency that his province has as much right to independence as kosovo . " we call on the international community to refuse double standards and recognize the independence of abkhazia and south ossetia , " bagapsh said .
" for us the situation with the recognition of kosovo is a precedent and all talk of the uniqueness of that case is not credible . " in a statement friday , the abkhaz parliament asked the united nations and individual countries to " consider the recognition of the republic of abkhazia as an independent , sovereign state . "
a separate statement asked russia 's government to do the same . russia 's duma will consider abkhazia 's independence at a hearing on march 13 , the deputy chairman of its international affairs committee , leonid slutsky , told russia 's itar-tass news agency . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the wwf blamed the deaths on lack of ice covering , which has lured seal pups into the water too early . a warm winter is wreaking havoc on the young seal population in the baltic sea north of germany with the international conservation organization wwf fearing that between 300 and 400 pups have died . " the situation is dire .
in some regions perhaps not a single one of the pups born in recent weeks will survive , " wwf baltic spokeswoman cathrin muenster said on monday , march 10 . lack of ice cover has been blamed for the deaths .
seal pups are going into the water too early where they " starve and die a painful death from the cold , " muenster added . because of the lack of ice , some seal mothers had given birth on small islands or on the mainland , where predators will likely kill the pups , said antti hallka , a seal expert with wwf finland said . seal population had been recovering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warmer weather might be good for swimmers , but not for seals the ringed seal is an earless seal found in northern waters all round the world .
the baltic subspecies , which numbers between 7,000 and 10,000 , is red-listed by the world conservation union as endangered . there are estimated to have been 180,000 ringed seals in the baltic in 1900 .
the population was severely reduced by hunting and pollution , but began to recover in the 1980s . now global warming is posing a new threat . the baltic sea has experienced of one of the warmest winters in almost 300 years , which scientists say is part of a general warming trend that could increase surface water temperatures 2 degrees celsius to 4 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degree fahrenheit to 7.2 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- by 2100 .
this degree of warming would cut the ice cover nearly in half . the seals required 90 days of ice covering to breed successfully , but indications were that by the end of the century the southern range of the seals ' breeding grounds would see its ice covering cut to as little as 18 days , the wwf said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildt , who recently returned from a visit to kosovo , said he sees the vote as " an opportunity to choose the european course more firmly than they have done before . " proposals for eu incentives " what we have to do is to show the serbian population that we want them in the european union , " said external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner . to do this , the commission offered several proposals last week for building a stronger relationship with serbia .
incentives include easier visa procedures , a doubling of scholarships and better eu-serbia transport links . the eu already has initialed , though not signed , a stabilization and association agreement with belgrade , the first step on the long road to membership in the bloc .

ultimately , voters might have opted for giving prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero a second term , but his victory was by no means a resounding one .
his socialist government is now set to continue on its path with an increased tally of seats - not so much in comparison to the opposition popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- of mariano rajoy but definitely in comparison to the regional parties , which have seen their influence in spanish politics subside .
the ruling socialist workers party -lrb- psoe -rrb- might still be short of an absolute majority , but zapatero 's party does have an expanded majority with 16 more seats than the pp .

both parties are seemingly unable to break the deadlock - and the country will continue to be blocked by its polarization .
whether the pp will be able to relinquish its confrontational tactics and find a way back to political consensus depends largely on how open to the opposition the government is now prepared to be . dominated by domestic policy issues , the campaign pitted two diverging versions of spanish society against one another .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 10.03.2008 opinion : spanish socialists ca n't risk complacency großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's ruling socialists won a second term in elections sunday , march 9 , but they 're not in a position to rest on the laurels , says guenther maihold from the german institute for international and security affairs . surveys ahead of sunday 's election predicted a tight race , and that 's exactly what it was .
ultimately , voters might have opted for giving prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero a second term , but his victory was by no means a resounding one .
his socialist government is now set to continue on its path with an increased tally of seats - not so much in comparison to the opposition popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- of mariano rajoy but definitely in comparison to the regional parties , which have seen their influence in spanish politics subside .
the ruling socialist workers party -lrb- psoe -rrb- might still be short of an absolute majority , but zapatero 's party does have an expanded majority with 16 more seats than the pp .
and for opposition leader mariano rajoy , it was the second time he 'd failed to lead his party to power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guenther maihold but the election reflected something of a political impasse .
divided into two , almost equally large camps , the public is unwilling to give either the socialists or the popular party a clear majority .
both parties are seemingly unable to break the deadlock - and the country will continue to be blocked by its polarization .
whether the pp will be able to relinquish its confrontational tactics and find a way back to political consensus depends largely on how open to the opposition the government is now prepared to be . dominated by domestic policy issues , the campaign pitted two diverging versions of spanish society against one another .
while the pp represents a nation based on catholic values , zapatero has always championed the diversity of modern spain , a country tolerant of its minorities and immigrants .
the catholic church backed the opposition , and will inevitably be stung by its defeat - which will result in heightened tension between the socialist government and the conservative leader of the spanish bishops ' conference cardinal rouco varela .
the role of the church is , after all , a central conflict within spanish society - and looks set to remain so . the spanish economy , meanwhile , has not been immune to the current turbulence on the international financial markets and growth has fallen off .
regaining economic stability will therefore be a key task for zapatero 's government .
it will also have to demonstrate resolve in its dealings with the basque separatist group eta , while keeping peace talks firmly on the agenda . on the international stage , spain will remain a known quantity .
no one need fear any unexpected new departures in terms of foreign policy , although spain would do well to raise its international profile if it wants to fulfill its potential . günther maihold is deputy director at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russia might be preparing to recognize abkhazia sovereignty .
the european union opposes the move . kosovo 's declaration of independence from serbia last month gave hope to rebels who have been fighting to do the same in the region of abkhazia , which borders the black sea . since abkhazia declared independence from georgia on friday , march 7 , russia made signs that it is preparing to recognize the region 's sovereignty by lifting a formal trade embargo . " there is a growing preoccupation and anxiety that russia may be paving the way for recognition of abkhazia , " eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said monday , march 10 . she reaffirmed eu support for georgia 's borders .
abkhazia 's declaration followed a similar vote on wednesday by georgia 's other separatist region , south ossetia .
both regions cited kosovo as a precedent , calling on the international community to recognize their self-declared independence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia wants eu support georgia 's pro-western government has accused moscow of trying to destabilize the region . " georgia 's territorial integrity has always been clearly supported by the eu ... this is absolutely clear , " ferrero-waldner said . the issue was on the agenda of an eu foreign ministers meeting held in brussels monday . " we will be discussing georgia and ... what can we do in order to support more strongly georgia in a difficult situation , " ferrero-waldner said . sweden and poland had written to the eu to call for the bloc to do more to stabilize georgia ahead of planned parliamentary elections in may .
ferrero-waldner suggested the eu could make it easier to get visas and launch a trade pact . further destabilization likely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the moment , no country officially recognizes abkhazia as an independent state moscow has had an official ban on trade with abkhazia since 1996 , although georgia has accused russia of providing financial aid to rebels .
the region uses the russia ruble as its currency . no country , including russia , currently recognizes the rebel provinces ' independence claims and georgia has sworn to regain control of the areas . abkhazia and south ossetia broke away from georgia in the early 1990s .
thousands of people were killed in the conflicts and hundreds of thousands of ethnic-georgians were forced to abandon their homes . georgian politicians have said that lifting russia 's sanctions will allow moscow to freely send weapons , military equipment and russian mercenaries , further destabilizing the region . the georgian foreign ministry said russia 's move was " an extremely dangerous provocation that encourages separatism and aims to deepen tensions in the conflict zone . " the statement accused moscow of " trying to violate georgia 's sovereignty . " blame kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the georgian military has tried to retake control abkhazia renewed its diplomatic effort for international recognition in the weeks after kosovo 's independence . " georgia is a point of concern for us , because the russian federation and the confederation of independent states decided to draw certain parallels with kosovo on this issue , " slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel told reporters after a meeting of eu foreign ministers . russia vehemently opposed kosovo 's independence from serbia .
moscow had long argued that the west 's support of kosovo independence would set a precedent for other regions of the world .
the eu always argued that kosovo was a special case . sergei bagapsh , rebel leader of abkhazia , did n't agree with the european view .
he told interfax news agency that his province has as much right to independence as kosovo . " we call on the international community to refuse double standards and recognize the independence of abkhazia and south ossetia , " bagapsh said .
" for us the situation with the recognition of kosovo is a precedent and all talk of the uniqueness of that case is not credible . " in a statement friday , the abkhaz parliament asked the united nations and individual countries to " consider the recognition of the republic of abkhazia as an independent , sovereign state . "
a separate statement asked russia 's government to do the same . russia 's duma will consider abkhazia 's independence at a hearing on march 13 , the deputy chairman of its international affairs committee , leonid slutsky , told russia 's itar-tass news agency . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 10.03.2008 opinion : spanish socialists ca n't risk complacency großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's ruling socialists won a second term in elections sunday , march 9 , but they 're not in a position to rest on the laurels , says guenther maihold from the german institute for international and security affairs . surveys ahead of sunday 's election predicted a tight race , and that 's exactly what it was .
ultimately , voters might have opted for giving prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero a second term , but his victory was by no means a resounding one .
his socialist government is now set to continue on its path with an increased tally of seats - not so much in comparison to the opposition popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- of mariano rajoy but definitely in comparison to the regional parties , which have seen their influence in spanish politics subside .
the ruling socialist workers party -lrb- psoe -rrb- might still be short of an absolute majority , but zapatero 's party does have an expanded majority with 16 more seats than the pp .
and for opposition leader mariano rajoy , it was the second time he 'd failed to lead his party to power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guenther maihold but the election reflected something of a political impasse .
divided into two , almost equally large camps , the public is unwilling to give either the socialists or the popular party a clear majority .
both parties are seemingly unable to break the deadlock - and the country will continue to be blocked by its polarization .
whether the pp will be able to relinquish its confrontational tactics and find a way back to political consensus depends largely on how open to the opposition the government is now prepared to be . dominated by domestic policy issues , the campaign pitted two diverging versions of spanish society against one another .
while the pp represents a nation based on catholic values , zapatero has always championed the diversity of modern spain , a country tolerant of its minorities and immigrants .
the catholic church backed the opposition , and will inevitably be stung by its defeat - which will result in heightened tension between the socialist government and the conservative leader of the spanish bishops ' conference cardinal rouco varela .
the role of the church is , after all , a central conflict within spanish society - and looks set to remain so . the spanish economy , meanwhile , has not been immune to the current turbulence on the international financial markets and growth has fallen off .
regaining economic stability will therefore be a key task for zapatero 's government .
it will also have to demonstrate resolve in its dealings with the basque separatist group eta , while keeping peace talks firmly on the agenda . on the international stage , spain will remain a known quantity .
no one need fear any unexpected new departures in terms of foreign policy , although spain would do well to raise its international profile if it wants to fulfill its potential . günther maihold is deputy director at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the vote was seen as a referendum on the right-wing president , who is battling a collapse in popularity .
exit polls showed the opposition socialists well-placed to score big gains over sarkozy 's union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- in next sunday 's decisive second election round .

turnout was high , estimated at close to 70 percent .
socialists show their strength the socialists retained a firm grip on the capital , paris , and cemented their hold on france 's third city lyon - clinching victory in the first round - as well as on the northern city of lille .
paris mayor bertrand delanoe , a rising star of the left and one of france 's most popular politicians , received a resounding thumbs-up for his pro-environment urban policies , with about 41.6 percent of first round votes , against 27.9 for his right-wing rival francoise de panafieu .
delanoe 's green party allies won 6.7 percent of the vote .
socialist leader francois hollande said voters had sent " a warning to the president of the republic and the government on the policies conducted over the past nine months . "
in sarkozy 's camp , prime minister francois fillon accused the left-wing opposition of " mixing up local and national issues " during the campaign .
but ump chief patrick devedjian admitted on television the results were " not good . "
planned reforms could be endangered right-wing former prime minister alain juppe held on to the south-western wine capital bordeaux , winning reelection in the first round .
but the socialists appeared well-placed to seize the eastern city of strasbourg - one of three key trophies up for grabs along with the second city , marseille , on the mediterranean , and southwestern toulouse , where the outgoing mayors and their socialist challengers were headed for a face-off sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarko ' torrid romance with carla bruni did not endear him to voters the symbolic loss of one or more major city further hurts sarkozy 's reputation and could undermine his ability to plough ahead with wide-ranging reforms .
sarkozy 's approval rating has plummeted from 67 percent , in july , to around one third of the electorate since he was triumphantly voted into office , in may , on a pledge to overhaul france 's economy and curb rising costs .
president 's personal life is liability the president 's divorce from his second wife cecilia , followed by a jet-setting romance and swift marriage to supermodel and singer carla bruni , gave many voters the impression he was neglecting their concerns .
the socialists have accused the president of hobnobbing with the rich and famous while drawing up an austerity plan for ordinary folk .

in the wake of the first series of investigations , which included searches of 120 offices and homes of tax evaders , authorities plan to look at a further 30 suspects , the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper reported monday , march 10 .
the latest cases to come under scrutiny are said to be more complicated and larger than in the last round , requiring more detailed investigations , the paper reported .

he asked them to provide him with a new identity so that he can relocate to south america , but his request has been refused , focus reported .

ultimately , voters might have opted for giving prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero a second term , but his victory was by no means a resounding one .
his socialist government is now set to continue on its path with an increased tally of seats - not so much in comparison to the opposition popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- of mariano rajoy but definitely in comparison to the regional parties , which have seen their influence in spanish politics subside .
the ruling socialist workers party -lrb- psoe -rrb- might still be short of an absolute majority , but zapatero 's party does have an expanded majority with 16 more seats than the pp .
and for opposition leader mariano rajoy , it was the second time he 'd failed to lead his party to power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guenther maihold but the election reflected something of a political impasse .
divided into two , almost equally large camps , the public is unwilling to give either the socialists or the popular party a clear majority .
both parties are seemingly unable to break the deadlock - and the country will continue to be blocked by its polarization .
whether the pp will be able to relinquish its confrontational tactics and find a way back to political consensus depends largely on how open to the opposition the government is now prepared to be . dominated by domestic policy issues , the campaign pitted two diverging versions of spanish society against one another .
while the pp represents a nation based on catholic values , zapatero has always championed the diversity of modern spain , a country tolerant of its minorities and immigrants .
the catholic church backed the opposition , and will inevitably be stung by its defeat - which will result in heightened tension between the socialist government and the conservative leader of the spanish bishops ' conference cardinal rouco varela .
the role of the church is , after all , a central conflict within spanish society - and looks set to remain so . the spanish economy , meanwhile , has not been immune to the current turbulence on the international financial markets and growth has fallen off .
regaining economic stability will therefore be a key task for zapatero 's government .
it will also have to demonstrate resolve in its dealings with the basque separatist group eta , while keeping peace talks firmly on the agenda . on the international stage , spain will remain a known quantity .
no one need fear any unexpected new departures in terms of foreign policy , although spain would do well to raise its international profile if it wants to fulfill its potential . günther maihold is deputy director at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

delanoe 's green party allies won 6.7 percent of the vote .
socialist leader francois hollande said voters had sent " a warning to the president of the republic and the government on the policies conducted over the past nine months . "
in sarkozy 's camp , prime minister francois fillon accused the left-wing opposition of " mixing up local and national issues " during the campaign .
but ump chief patrick devedjian admitted on television the results were " not good . "
planned reforms could be endangered right-wing former prime minister alain juppe held on to the south-western wine capital bordeaux , winning reelection in the first round .
but the socialists appeared well-placed to seize the eastern city of strasbourg - one of three key trophies up for grabs along with the second city , marseille , on the mediterranean , and southwestern toulouse , where the outgoing mayors and their socialist challengers were headed for a face-off sunday .

sarkozy 's approval rating has plummeted from 67 percent , in july , to around one third of the electorate since he was triumphantly voted into office , in may , on a pledge to overhaul france 's economy and curb rising costs .
president 's personal life is liability the president 's divorce from his second wife cecilia , followed by a jet-setting romance and swift marriage to supermodel and singer carla bruni , gave many voters the impression he was neglecting their concerns .
the socialists have accused the president of hobnobbing with the rich and famous while drawing up an austerity plan for ordinary folk .

beck attempted to refocus his party , which has been in disarray in recent weeks . there have been calls for beck 's resignation in recent weeks as the spd has floundered in a political quagmire in the western german state of hesse .
the spd has been in an uproar over the decision to rely on the left party in order to form a government in the region . andrea ypsilanti , the spd candidate for hesse 's top post , broke a pre-election pledge not to make any kind of political deal with the left party , which is made up of former communists and far-left former spd members .
her about face has enraged some spd members . beck , who has been out with the flu for two weeks , attempted to downplay the divisions in the spd and said he would not quit on monday , march 10 .
beck also denied that he had broken his word by agreeing to tolerate deals with the left at a state level . " parties must be able to adjust to new situations , " beck said .
" i do n't think they lose their credibility by doing that . " left seen as adversary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left is making inroads in western germany beck did concede monday that the spd 's attempt to stifle the rise of the new left party has failed .
beck said that while he will tolerate partnerships at the local level , he will not involve the party in a future national government . " the left is an adversarial party and that is how it will stay , " beck said . beck cited " irreconcilable differences " between the spd and left in financial , social and foreign policy . currently , the spd is the junior coalition partner of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
the " grand coalition " has left the spd with a bit of an identity crisis as approval ratings continue a downward slide . a dimap infratest poll showed beck would get 20 percent of german votes if the election were held today , compared with more than 60 percent for merkel . some spd members still angry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd has been looking for new partners beck has gotten support from some senior party members .
but others want him to resign and let someone else take on merkel in the general elections next year . " to my mind , his candidacy for the chancellorship is out of the question as he will not get over the credibility crisis , " the spd 's gerd andres told the hannoversche allgemeine zeitung newspaper . der spiegel newsmagazine quoted finance minister peer steinbrueck as saying the spd had handed the next election to the cdu . oskar niedermayer , a political scientist at berlin 's free university , said beck 's press conference monday was attempting a " damage control exercise . " niedermayer predicted merkel 's cdu will revive the issue of beck ’ s credibility ahead of the next federal elections , which must be held by september 2009 . when asked monday if he had lost his authority over the spd , beck said : " the only thing i have lost in the last two weeks is 5 or 6 kilos . " looking for a way forward in hesse bildunterschrift : andrea ypsilanti has been making headlines on sunday , beck had suggested during crisis talks with party leadership about the hesse situation that ypsilanti withdraw .
but ypsilanti beat him to the punch by confirming monday that she would be shelving her candidacy . events took a dramatic turn friday when dagmar metzger , one of the spd 's members of the state legislature , said she would not play along with ypsilanti 's moves to do a deal with the left party . over the weekend , ypsilanti 's supporters put pressure on metzger , calling on her to rethink her decision or resign from parliament and allow a replacement legislator to vote for the party leader as premier . beck said monday he would not pressure metzger to resign . the lure of the left bildunterschrift : who will govern hesse ?
spd officials , however , are not ruling out that ypsilanti , a member of the party 's left-wing , might have another shot at the premiership in may . ypsilanti 's tactics have opened up a debate in spd on the future course of the party after gains by the left in recent state elections ploughed up the german political field , forcing the main parties to seek arrangements with smaller parties they had previously kept at arm 's length . ypsilanti is dependent on the support of the left to become premier after her party secured 42 seats in the 110-seat state legislature in jan .
27 elections , level with the christian democrats , led by incumbent premier roland koch . with the free democrats , the cdu 's preferred partner , securing 11 seats and the greens nine , neither of the main blocs could form a majority government .

the wwf blamed the deaths on lack of ice covering , which has lured seal pups into the water too early . a warm winter is wreaking havoc on the young seal population in the baltic sea north of germany with the international conservation organization wwf fearing that between 300 and 400 pups have died . " the situation is dire .
in some regions perhaps not a single one of the pups born in recent weeks will survive , " wwf baltic spokeswoman cathrin muenster said on monday , march 10 . lack of ice cover has been blamed for the deaths .
seal pups are going into the water too early where they " starve and die a painful death from the cold , " muenster added . because of the lack of ice , some seal mothers had given birth on small islands or on the mainland , where predators will likely kill the pups , said antti hallka , a seal expert with wwf finland said . seal population had been recovering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warmer weather might be good for swimmers , but not for seals the ringed seal is an earless seal found in northern waters all round the world .
the baltic subspecies , which numbers between 7,000 and 10,000 , is red-listed by the world conservation union as endangered . there are estimated to have been 180,000 ringed seals in the baltic in 1900 .
the population was severely reduced by hunting and pollution , but began to recover in the 1980s . now global warming is posing a new threat . the baltic sea has experienced of one of the warmest winters in almost 300 years , which scientists say is part of a general warming trend that could increase surface water temperatures 2 degrees celsius to 4 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degree fahrenheit to 7.2 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- by 2100 .
this degree of warming would cut the ice cover nearly in half . the seals required 90 days of ice covering to breed successfully , but indications were that by the end of the century the southern range of the seals ' breeding grounds would see its ice covering cut to as little as 18 days , the wwf said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but they ended up drawing lines in the sand instead . there 's always going to be trouble in paradise .
despite the glorious trappings , passengers on board p & o 's 77,000-ton oceana liner were getting royally fed up with the lack of available deck chairs , accusing certain errant holidaymakers of using towels , books and bags to reserve places . in the british mind , this could mean one thing , and one thing only : germans were at work , seeking as ever to expand their lebensraum . brilliantly witty - or culturally backward ? over in merry old england , the deck chair prejudice is a cultural stereotype that simply refuses to die .
it might mean nothing to germans themselves , but it 's embedded in mainstream british culture , and there it will remain , a source of much unreconstructed hilarity . several years ago , for example , the spitfire beer company ran an advertisement with the slogan " have the sunbeds , we 're off to the bar . "
not long after , another british beer brand , carling black label , launched a similar ad featuring an english bloke on holiday foiling germans trying to steal the deck chairs early in the morning . so perhaps captain christopher wells can be forgiven for making the obvious reference when he used the ship loudspeaker to tell passengers in no uncertain terms not to reserve loungers .
and as a sailor , he 's allowed to have a colorful turn of phrase . " we do n't want that kind of germanic behavior here ! " he joked . but not all the passengers were amused . " captain wells apologizes unreservedly for any offence caused , " said a spokesman for p & o , but it was too late . the captain now faces an inquiry by the equality and human rights commission over whether his remarks were racist . bed-bagging bildunterschrift : bed bagging never happened on the " the love boat " one female passenger said the crew had tried unsuccessfully to stop the " bed bagging . " " there were enough loungers for everyone , provided they were not reserved when not in use , " she told british daily the telegraph .
" crew members did their best , sometimes removing the towels , but then passengers reserved the sun beds with their own items . " initially , the captain tried allowing passengers to reclaim chairs which had remained unused for 20 minutes . however , that only led to more confrontation when some holidaymakers used stopwatches to monitor occupancy .
so much for a relaxing holiday in the sun . " this led to heated arguments and complaints - some people nearly came to blows , " said the anonymous female passenger . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the vote was seen as a referendum on the right-wing president , who is battling a collapse in popularity .
exit polls showed the opposition socialists well-placed to score big gains over sarkozy 's union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- in next sunday 's decisive second election round .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socialist leader hollande called the vote " a warning " nationwide , left-wing parties took some 47.5 percent of the vote , well ahead of the ump and its allies , which had 40 percent , according to a csa survey .
turnout was high , estimated at close to 70 percent .
socialists show their strength the socialists retained a firm grip on the capital , paris , and cemented their hold on france 's third city lyon - clinching victory in the first round - as well as on the northern city of lille .
paris mayor bertrand delanoe , a rising star of the left and one of france 's most popular politicians , received a resounding thumbs-up for his pro-environment urban policies , with about 41.6 percent of first round votes , against 27.9 for his right-wing rival francoise de panafieu .
delanoe 's green party allies won 6.7 percent of the vote .
socialist leader francois hollande said voters had sent " a warning to the president of the republic and the government on the policies conducted over the past nine months . "
in sarkozy 's camp , prime minister francois fillon accused the left-wing opposition of " mixing up local and national issues " during the campaign .
but ump chief patrick devedjian admitted on television the results were " not good . "
planned reforms could be endangered right-wing former prime minister alain juppe held on to the south-western wine capital bordeaux , winning reelection in the first round .
but the socialists appeared well-placed to seize the eastern city of strasbourg - one of three key trophies up for grabs along with the second city , marseille , on the mediterranean , and southwestern toulouse , where the outgoing mayors and their socialist challengers were headed for a face-off sunday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarko ' torrid romance with carla bruni did not endear him to voters the symbolic loss of one or more major city further hurts sarkozy 's reputation and could undermine his ability to plough ahead with wide-ranging reforms .
sarkozy 's approval rating has plummeted from 67 percent , in july , to around one third of the electorate since he was triumphantly voted into office , in may , on a pledge to overhaul france 's economy and curb rising costs .
president 's personal life is liability the president 's divorce from his second wife cecilia , followed by a jet-setting romance and swift marriage to supermodel and singer carla bruni , gave many voters the impression he was neglecting their concerns .
the socialists have accused the president of hobnobbing with the rich and famous while drawing up an austerity plan for ordinary folk .

but they ended up drawing lines in the sand instead . there 's always going to be trouble in paradise .
despite the glorious trappings , passengers on board p & o 's 77,000-ton oceana liner were getting royally fed up with the lack of available deck chairs , accusing certain errant holidaymakers of using towels , books and bags to reserve places . in the british mind , this could mean one thing , and one thing only : germans were at work , seeking as ever to expand their lebensraum . brilliantly witty - or culturally backward ? over in merry old england , the deck chair prejudice is a cultural stereotype that simply refuses to die .
it might mean nothing to germans themselves , but it 's embedded in mainstream british culture , and there it will remain , a source of much unreconstructed hilarity . several years ago , for example , the spitfire beer company ran an advertisement with the slogan " have the sunbeds , we 're off to the bar .

the wwf blamed the deaths on lack of ice covering , which has lured seal pups into the water too early . a warm winter is wreaking havoc on the young seal population in the baltic sea north of germany with the international conservation organization wwf fearing that between 300 and 400 pups have died . " the situation is dire .
in some regions perhaps not a single one of the pups born in recent weeks will survive , " wwf baltic spokeswoman cathrin muenster said on monday , march 10 . lack of ice cover has been blamed for the deaths .
seal pups are going into the water too early where they " starve and die a painful death from the cold , " muenster added . because of the lack of ice , some seal mothers had given birth on small islands or on the mainland , where predators will likely kill the pups , said antti hallka , a seal expert with wwf finland said . seal population had been recovering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warmer weather might be good for swimmers , but not for seals the ringed seal is an earless seal found in northern waters all round the world .
the baltic subspecies , which numbers between 7,000 and 10,000 , is red-listed by the world conservation union as endangered . there are estimated to have been 180,000 ringed seals in the baltic in 1900 .
the population was severely reduced by hunting and pollution , but began to recover in the 1980s . now global warming is posing a new threat . the baltic sea has experienced of one of the warmest winters in almost 300 years , which scientists say is part of a general warming trend that could increase surface water temperatures 2 degrees celsius to 4 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degree fahrenheit to 7.2 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- by 2100 .
this degree of warming would cut the ice cover nearly in half . the seals required 90 days of ice covering to breed successfully , but indications were that by the end of the century the southern range of the seals ' breeding grounds would see its ice covering cut to as little as 18 days , the wwf said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

beck attempted to refocus his party , which has been in disarray in recent weeks . there have been calls for beck 's resignation in recent weeks as the spd has floundered in a political quagmire in the western german state of hesse .
the spd has been in an uproar over the decision to rely on the left party in order to form a government in the region . andrea ypsilanti , the spd candidate for hesse 's top post , broke a pre-election pledge not to make any kind of political deal with the left party , which is made up of former communists and far-left former spd members .
her about face has enraged some spd members . beck , who has been out with the flu for two weeks , attempted to downplay the divisions in the spd and said he would not quit on monday , march 10 .
beck also denied that he had broken his word by agreeing to tolerate deals with the left at a state level . " parties must be able to adjust to new situations , " beck said .
" i do n't think they lose their credibility by doing that . " left seen as adversary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left is making inroads in western germany beck did concede monday that the spd 's attempt to stifle the rise of the new left party has failed .
beck said that while he will tolerate partnerships at the local level , he will not involve the party in a future national government . " the left is an adversarial party and that is how it will stay , " beck said . beck cited " irreconcilable differences " between the spd and left in financial , social and foreign policy . currently , the spd is the junior coalition partner of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
the " grand coalition " has left the spd with a bit of an identity crisis as approval ratings continue a downward slide . a dimap infratest poll showed beck would get 20 percent of german votes if the election were held today , compared with more than 60 percent for merkel . some spd members still angry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd has been looking for new partners beck has gotten support from some senior party members .
but others want him to resign and let someone else take on merkel in the general elections next year . " to my mind , his candidacy for the chancellorship is out of the question as he will not get over the credibility crisis , " the spd 's gerd andres told the hannoversche allgemeine zeitung newspaper . der spiegel newsmagazine quoted finance minister peer steinbrueck as saying the spd had handed the next election to the cdu . oskar niedermayer , a political scientist at berlin 's free university , said beck 's press conference monday was attempting a " damage control exercise . " niedermayer predicted merkel 's cdu will revive the issue of beck ’ s credibility ahead of the next federal elections , which must be held by september 2009 . when asked monday if he had lost his authority over the spd , beck said : " the only thing i have lost in the last two weeks is 5 or 6 kilos .

spd officials , however , are not ruling out that ypsilanti , a member of the party 's left-wing , might have another shot at the premiership in may . ypsilanti 's tactics have opened up a debate in spd on the future course of the party after gains by the left in recent state elections ploughed up the german political field , forcing the main parties to seek arrangements with smaller parties they had previously kept at arm 's length . ypsilanti is dependent on the support of the left to become premier after her party secured 42 seats in the 110-seat state legislature in jan .
27 elections , level with the christian democrats , led by incumbent premier roland koch . with the free democrats , the cdu 's preferred partner , securing 11 seats and the greens nine , neither of the main blocs could form a majority government .

the wwf blamed the deaths on lack of ice covering , which has lured seal pups into the water too early . a warm winter is wreaking havoc on the young seal population in the baltic sea north of germany with the international conservation organization wwf fearing that between 300 and 400 pups have died . " the situation is dire .
in some regions perhaps not a single one of the pups born in recent weeks will survive , " wwf baltic spokeswoman cathrin muenster said on monday , march 10 . lack of ice cover has been blamed for the deaths .
seal pups are going into the water too early where they " starve and die a painful death from the cold , " muenster added . because of the lack of ice , some seal mothers had given birth on small islands or on the mainland , where predators will likely kill the pups , said antti hallka , a seal expert with wwf finland said . seal population had been recovering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warmer weather might be good for swimmers , but not for seals the ringed seal is an earless seal found in northern waters all round the world .
the baltic subspecies , which numbers between 7,000 and 10,000 , is red-listed by the world conservation union as endangered . there are estimated to have been 180,000 ringed seals in the baltic in 1900 .
the population was severely reduced by hunting and pollution , but began to recover in the 1980s . now global warming is posing a new threat . the baltic sea has experienced of one of the warmest winters in almost 300 years , which scientists say is part of a general warming trend that could increase surface water temperatures 2 degrees celsius to 4 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degree fahrenheit to 7.2 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- by 2100 .
this degree of warming would cut the ice cover nearly in half . the seals required 90 days of ice covering to breed successfully , but indications were that by the end of the century the southern range of the seals ' breeding grounds would see its ice covering cut to as little as 18 days , the wwf said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 10.03.2008 opinion : spanish socialists ca n't risk complacency großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's ruling socialists won a second term in elections sunday , march 9 , but they 're not in a position to rest on the laurels , says guenther maihold from the german institute for international and security affairs . surveys ahead of sunday 's election predicted a tight race , and that 's exactly what it was .
ultimately , voters might have opted for giving prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero a second term , but his victory was by no means a resounding one .
his socialist government is now set to continue on its path with an increased tally of seats - not so much in comparison to the opposition popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- of mariano rajoy but definitely in comparison to the regional parties , which have seen their influence in spanish politics subside .
the ruling socialist workers party -lrb- psoe -rrb- might still be short of an absolute majority , but zapatero 's party does have an expanded majority with 16 more seats than the pp .
and for opposition leader mariano rajoy , it was the second time he 'd failed to lead his party to power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guenther maihold but the election reflected something of a political impasse .
divided into two , almost equally large camps , the public is unwilling to give either the socialists or the popular party a clear majority .
both parties are seemingly unable to break the deadlock - and the country will continue to be blocked by its polarization .
whether the pp will be able to relinquish its confrontational tactics and find a way back to political consensus depends largely on how open to the opposition the government is now prepared to be . dominated by domestic policy issues , the campaign pitted two diverging versions of spanish society against one another .
while the pp represents a nation based on catholic values , zapatero has always championed the diversity of modern spain , a country tolerant of its minorities and immigrants .
the catholic church backed the opposition , and will inevitably be stung by its defeat - which will result in heightened tension between the socialist government and the conservative leader of the spanish bishops ' conference cardinal rouco varela .

ultimately , voters might have opted for giving prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero a second term , but his victory was by no means a resounding one .
his socialist government is now set to continue on its path with an increased tally of seats - not so much in comparison to the opposition popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- of mariano rajoy but definitely in comparison to the regional parties , which have seen their influence in spanish politics subside .
the ruling socialist workers party -lrb- psoe -rrb- might still be short of an absolute majority , but zapatero 's party does have an expanded majority with 16 more seats than the pp .
and for opposition leader mariano rajoy , it was the second time he 'd failed to lead his party to power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guenther maihold but the election reflected something of a political impasse .
divided into two , almost equally large camps , the public is unwilling to give either the socialists or the popular party a clear majority .
both parties are seemingly unable to break the deadlock - and the country will continue to be blocked by its polarization .
whether the pp will be able to relinquish its confrontational tactics and find a way back to political consensus depends largely on how open to the opposition the government is now prepared to be . dominated by domestic policy issues , the campaign pitted two diverging versions of spanish society against one another .
while the pp represents a nation based on catholic values , zapatero has always championed the diversity of modern spain , a country tolerant of its minorities and immigrants .

european union officials hope the vote will end in victory for west-leaning parties . kostunica 's government formally stepped down on monday , march 10 , and called for early elections in may after its coalition parties fell out over the issue of how to deal with the european union following the support of many eu states for kosovo 's secession . european union officials said they hoped the coming polls would benefit pro-european parties . " with the coming elections , we hope that the european forces will win , " said slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency . eu foreign ministers meeting in brussels were unanimous in calling on the people of serbia not to turn their backs on europe by supporting serbia 's nationalistic parties in the election . " europe needs serbia and serbia needs europe , " sweden 's foreign minister carl bildt said . " were serbia to sink into self-isolation , it would clearly be to the detriment of the economy -lrb- and -rrb- politics ... of serbia , but also of the entire region . " kostunica opposes eu support of kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic 's course has received support from the eu and us eu officials , who supported the re-election of serbian president boris tadic last month , were concerned last week after serbian nationalists , including kostunica , called for a parliamentary vote to stop serbia 's further integration into the eu . the resolution , which was ultimately turned down on thursday , crafted in response to many eu member states ' support for kosovo 's declaration of independence , also condemned the eu 's deployment of a peace and justice mission to help supervise the new state 's institutions . as a result , kostunica resigned saturday , opening the door for new elections , expected to take place on may 11 .
bildt , who recently returned from a visit to kosovo , said he sees the vote as " an opportunity to choose the european course more firmly than they have done before . " proposals for eu incentives " what we have to do is to show the serbian population that we want them in the european union , " said external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner . to do this , the commission offered several proposals last week for building a stronger relationship with serbia .
incentives include easier visa procedures , a doubling of scholarships and better eu-serbia transport links . the eu already has initialed , though not signed , a stabilization and association agreement with belgrade , the first step on the long road to membership in the bloc .
pro-western president tadic has insisted that despite disagreements over kosovo , belgrade has no alternative but to join the bloc as soon as possible . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the wwf blamed the deaths on lack of ice covering , which has lured seal pups into the water too early . a warm winter is wreaking havoc on the young seal population in the baltic sea north of germany with the international conservation organization wwf fearing that between 300 and 400 pups have died . " the situation is dire .
in some regions perhaps not a single one of the pups born in recent weeks will survive , " wwf baltic spokeswoman cathrin muenster said on monday , march 10 . lack of ice cover has been blamed for the deaths .
seal pups are going into the water too early where they " starve and die a painful death from the cold , " muenster added . because of the lack of ice , some seal mothers had given birth on small islands or on the mainland , where predators will likely kill the pups , said antti hallka , a seal expert with wwf finland said . seal population had been recovering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warmer weather might be good for swimmers , but not for seals the ringed seal is an earless seal found in northern waters all round the world .

this degree of warming would cut the ice cover nearly in half . the seals required 90 days of ice covering to breed successfully , but indications were that by the end of the century the southern range of the seals ' breeding grounds would see its ice covering cut to as little as 18 days , the wwf said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but they ended up drawing lines in the sand instead . there 's always going to be trouble in paradise .
despite the glorious trappings , passengers on board p & o 's 77,000-ton oceana liner were getting royally fed up with the lack of available deck chairs , accusing certain errant holidaymakers of using towels , books and bags to reserve places . in the british mind , this could mean one thing , and one thing only : germans were at work , seeking as ever to expand their lebensraum . brilliantly witty - or culturally backward ? over in merry old england , the deck chair prejudice is a cultural stereotype that simply refuses to die .
it might mean nothing to germans themselves , but it 's embedded in mainstream british culture , and there it will remain , a source of much unreconstructed hilarity . several years ago , for example , the spitfire beer company ran an advertisement with the slogan " have the sunbeds , we 're off to the bar . "
not long after , another british beer brand , carling black label , launched a similar ad featuring an english bloke on holiday foiling germans trying to steal the deck chairs early in the morning . so perhaps captain christopher wells can be forgiven for making the obvious reference when he used the ship loudspeaker to tell passengers in no uncertain terms not to reserve loungers .
and as a sailor , he 's allowed to have a colorful turn of phrase . " we do n't want that kind of germanic behavior here ! " he joked . but not all the passengers were amused . " captain wells apologizes unreservedly for any offence caused , " said a spokesman for p & o , but it was too late . the captain now faces an inquiry by the equality and human rights commission over whether his remarks were racist . bed-bagging bildunterschrift : bed bagging never happened on the " the love boat " one female passenger said the crew had tried unsuccessfully to stop the " bed bagging . " " there were enough loungers for everyone , provided they were not reserved when not in use , " she told british daily the telegraph .
" crew members did their best , sometimes removing the towels , but then passengers reserved the sun beds with their own items . " initially , the captain tried allowing passengers to reclaim chairs which had remained unused for 20 minutes . however , that only led to more confrontation when some holidaymakers used stopwatches to monitor occupancy .
so much for a relaxing holiday in the sun .

russia might be preparing to recognize abkhazia sovereignty .
the european union opposes the move . kosovo 's declaration of independence from serbia last month gave hope to rebels who have been fighting to do the same in the region of abkhazia , which borders the black sea . since abkhazia declared independence from georgia on friday , march 7 , russia made signs that it is preparing to recognize the region 's sovereignty by lifting a formal trade embargo . " there is a growing preoccupation and anxiety that russia may be paving the way for recognition of abkhazia , " eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said monday , march 10 . she reaffirmed eu support for georgia 's borders .
abkhazia 's declaration followed a similar vote on wednesday by georgia 's other separatist region , south ossetia .
both regions cited kosovo as a precedent , calling on the international community to recognize their self-declared independence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia wants eu support georgia 's pro-western government has accused moscow of trying to destabilize the region . " georgia 's territorial integrity has always been clearly supported by the eu ... this is absolutely clear , " ferrero-waldner said . the issue was on the agenda of an eu foreign ministers meeting held in brussels monday . " we will be discussing georgia and ... what can we do in order to support more strongly georgia in a difficult situation , " ferrero-waldner said . sweden and poland had written to the eu to call for the bloc to do more to stabilize georgia ahead of planned parliamentary elections in may .

the region uses the russia ruble as its currency . no country , including russia , currently recognizes the rebel provinces ' independence claims and georgia has sworn to regain control of the areas . abkhazia and south ossetia broke away from georgia in the early 1990s .
thousands of people were killed in the conflicts and hundreds of thousands of ethnic-georgians were forced to abandon their homes . georgian politicians have said that lifting russia 's sanctions will allow moscow to freely send weapons , military equipment and russian mercenaries , further destabilizing the region . the georgian foreign ministry said russia 's move was " an extremely dangerous provocation that encourages separatism and aims to deepen tensions in the conflict zone .

" georgia is a point of concern for us , because the russian federation and the confederation of independent states decided to draw certain parallels with kosovo on this issue , " slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel told reporters after a meeting of eu foreign ministers . russia vehemently opposed kosovo 's independence from serbia .
moscow had long argued that the west 's support of kosovo independence would set a precedent for other regions of the world .
the eu always argued that kosovo was a special case . sergei bagapsh , rebel leader of abkhazia , did n't agree with the european view .
he told interfax news agency that his province has as much right to independence as kosovo . " we call on the international community to refuse double standards and recognize the independence of abkhazia and south ossetia , " bagapsh said .
" for us the situation with the recognition of kosovo is a precedent and all talk of the uniqueness of that case is not credible . " in a statement friday , the abkhaz parliament asked the united nations and individual countries to " consider the recognition of the republic of abkhazia as an independent , sovereign state . "

russia might be preparing to recognize abkhazia sovereignty .
the european union opposes the move . kosovo 's declaration of independence from serbia last month gave hope to rebels who have been fighting to do the same in the region of abkhazia , which borders the black sea . since abkhazia declared independence from georgia on friday , march 7 , russia made signs that it is preparing to recognize the region 's sovereignty by lifting a formal trade embargo . " there is a growing preoccupation and anxiety that russia may be paving the way for recognition of abkhazia , " eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said monday , march 10 . she reaffirmed eu support for georgia 's borders .
abkhazia 's declaration followed a similar vote on wednesday by georgia 's other separatist region , south ossetia .
both regions cited kosovo as a precedent , calling on the international community to recognize their self-declared independence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia wants eu support georgia 's pro-western government has accused moscow of trying to destabilize the region . " georgia 's territorial integrity has always been clearly supported by the eu ... this is absolutely clear , " ferrero-waldner said . the issue was on the agenda of an eu foreign ministers meeting held in brussels monday . " we will be discussing georgia and ... what can we do in order to support more strongly georgia in a difficult situation , " ferrero-waldner said . sweden and poland had written to the eu to call for the bloc to do more to stabilize georgia ahead of planned parliamentary elections in may .
ferrero-waldner suggested the eu could make it easier to get visas and launch a trade pact . further destabilization likely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the moment , no country officially recognizes abkhazia as an independent state moscow has had an official ban on trade with abkhazia since 1996 , although georgia has accused russia of providing financial aid to rebels .
the region uses the russia ruble as its currency . no country , including russia , currently recognizes the rebel provinces ' independence claims and georgia has sworn to regain control of the areas . abkhazia and south ossetia broke away from georgia in the early 1990s .
thousands of people were killed in the conflicts and hundreds of thousands of ethnic-georgians were forced to abandon their homes . georgian politicians have said that lifting russia 's sanctions will allow moscow to freely send weapons , military equipment and russian mercenaries , further destabilizing the region . the georgian foreign ministry said russia 's move was " an extremely dangerous provocation that encourages separatism and aims to deepen tensions in the conflict zone . " the statement accused moscow of " trying to violate georgia 's sovereignty . " blame kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the georgian military has tried to retake control abkhazia renewed its diplomatic effort for international recognition in the weeks after kosovo 's independence . " georgia is a point of concern for us , because the russian federation and the confederation of independent states decided to draw certain parallels with kosovo on this issue , " slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel told reporters after a meeting of eu foreign ministers . russia vehemently opposed kosovo 's independence from serbia .
moscow had long argued that the west 's support of kosovo independence would set a precedent for other regions of the world .
the eu always argued that kosovo was a special case . sergei bagapsh , rebel leader of abkhazia , did n't agree with the european view .
he told interfax news agency that his province has as much right to independence as kosovo . " we call on the international community to refuse double standards and recognize the independence of abkhazia and south ossetia , " bagapsh said .
" for us the situation with the recognition of kosovo is a precedent and all talk of the uniqueness of that case is not credible . " in a statement friday , the abkhaz parliament asked the united nations and individual countries to " consider the recognition of the republic of abkhazia as an independent , sovereign state . "

" there is a growing preoccupation and anxiety that russia may be paving the way for recognition of abkhazia , " eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said monday , march 10 . she reaffirmed eu support for georgia 's borders .

russia might be preparing to recognize abkhazia sovereignty .
the european union opposes the move . kosovo 's declaration of independence from serbia last month gave hope to rebels who have been fighting to do the same in the region of abkhazia , which borders the black sea . since abkhazia declared independence from georgia on friday , march 7 , russia made signs that it is preparing to recognize the region 's sovereignty by lifting a formal trade embargo . " there is a growing preoccupation and anxiety that russia may be paving the way for recognition of abkhazia , " eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said monday , march 10 . she reaffirmed eu support for georgia 's borders .
abkhazia 's declaration followed a similar vote on wednesday by georgia 's other separatist region , south ossetia .
both regions cited kosovo as a precedent , calling on the international community to recognize their self-declared independence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia wants eu support georgia 's pro-western government has accused moscow of trying to destabilize the region . " georgia 's territorial integrity has always been clearly supported by the eu ... this is absolutely clear , " ferrero-waldner said . the issue was on the agenda of an eu foreign ministers meeting held in brussels monday . " we will be discussing georgia and ... what can we do in order to support more strongly georgia in a difficult situation , " ferrero-waldner said . sweden and poland had written to the eu to call for the bloc to do more to stabilize georgia ahead of planned parliamentary elections in may .
ferrero-waldner suggested the eu could make it easier to get visas and launch a trade pact . further destabilization likely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the moment , no country officially recognizes abkhazia as an independent state moscow has had an official ban on trade with abkhazia since 1996 , although georgia has accused russia of providing financial aid to rebels .
the region uses the russia ruble as its currency . no country , including russia , currently recognizes the rebel provinces ' independence claims and georgia has sworn to regain control of the areas . abkhazia and south ossetia broke away from georgia in the early 1990s .
thousands of people were killed in the conflicts and hundreds of thousands of ethnic-georgians were forced to abandon their homes . georgian politicians have said that lifting russia 's sanctions will allow moscow to freely send weapons , military equipment and russian mercenaries , further destabilizing the region . the georgian foreign ministry said russia 's move was " an extremely dangerous provocation that encourages separatism and aims to deepen tensions in the conflict zone . " the statement accused moscow of " trying to violate georgia 's sovereignty . " blame kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the georgian military has tried to retake control abkhazia renewed its diplomatic effort for international recognition in the weeks after kosovo 's independence . " georgia is a point of concern for us , because the russian federation and the confederation of independent states decided to draw certain parallels with kosovo on this issue , " slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel told reporters after a meeting of eu foreign ministers . russia vehemently opposed kosovo 's independence from serbia .
moscow had long argued that the west 's support of kosovo independence would set a precedent for other regions of the world .
the eu always argued that kosovo was a special case . sergei bagapsh , rebel leader of abkhazia , did n't agree with the european view .
he told interfax news agency that his province has as much right to independence as kosovo . " we call on the international community to refuse double standards and recognize the independence of abkhazia and south ossetia , " bagapsh said .
" for us the situation with the recognition of kosovo is a precedent and all talk of the uniqueness of that case is not credible . " in a statement friday , the abkhaz parliament asked the united nations and individual countries to " consider the recognition of the republic of abkhazia as an independent , sovereign state . "
a separate statement asked russia 's government to do the same . russia 's duma will consider abkhazia 's independence at a hearing on march 13 , the deputy chairman of its international affairs committee , leonid slutsky , told russia 's itar-tass news agency . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 10.03.2008 opinion : spanish socialists ca n't risk complacency großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's ruling socialists won a second term in elections sunday , march 9 , but they 're not in a position to rest on the laurels , says guenther maihold from the german institute for international and security affairs . surveys ahead of sunday 's election predicted a tight race , and that 's exactly what it was .
ultimately , voters might have opted for giving prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero a second term , but his victory was by no means a resounding one .
his socialist government is now set to continue on its path with an increased tally of seats - not so much in comparison to the opposition popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- of mariano rajoy but definitely in comparison to the regional parties , which have seen their influence in spanish politics subside .
the ruling socialist workers party -lrb- psoe -rrb- might still be short of an absolute majority , but zapatero 's party does have an expanded majority with 16 more seats than the pp .
and for opposition leader mariano rajoy , it was the second time he 'd failed to lead his party to power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guenther maihold but the election reflected something of a political impasse .
divided into two , almost equally large camps , the public is unwilling to give either the socialists or the popular party a clear majority .
both parties are seemingly unable to break the deadlock - and the country will continue to be blocked by its polarization .
whether the pp will be able to relinquish its confrontational tactics and find a way back to political consensus depends largely on how open to the opposition the government is now prepared to be . dominated by domestic policy issues , the campaign pitted two diverging versions of spanish society against one another .
while the pp represents a nation based on catholic values , zapatero has always championed the diversity of modern spain , a country tolerant of its minorities and immigrants .
the catholic church backed the opposition , and will inevitably be stung by its defeat - which will result in heightened tension between the socialist government and the conservative leader of the spanish bishops ' conference cardinal rouco varela .
the role of the church is , after all , a central conflict within spanish society - and looks set to remain so . the spanish economy , meanwhile , has not been immune to the current turbulence on the international financial markets and growth has fallen off .
regaining economic stability will therefore be a key task for zapatero 's government .
it will also have to demonstrate resolve in its dealings with the basque separatist group eta , while keeping peace talks firmly on the agenda . on the international stage , spain will remain a known quantity .
no one need fear any unexpected new departures in terms of foreign policy , although spain would do well to raise its international profile if it wants to fulfill its potential . günther maihold is deputy director at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ultimately , voters might have opted for giving prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero a second term , but his victory was by no means a resounding one .
his socialist government is now set to continue on its path with an increased tally of seats - not so much in comparison to the opposition popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- of mariano rajoy but definitely in comparison to the regional parties , which have seen their influence in spanish politics subside .
the ruling socialist workers party -lrb- psoe -rrb- might still be short of an absolute majority , but zapatero 's party does have an expanded majority with 16 more seats than the pp .
and for opposition leader mariano rajoy , it was the second time he 'd failed to lead his party to power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guenther maihold but the election reflected something of a political impasse .
divided into two , almost equally large camps , the public is unwilling to give either the socialists or the popular party a clear majority .
both parties are seemingly unable to break the deadlock - and the country will continue to be blocked by its polarization .
whether the pp will be able to relinquish its confrontational tactics and find a way back to political consensus depends largely on how open to the opposition the government is now prepared to be . dominated by domestic policy issues , the campaign pitted two diverging versions of spanish society against one another .
while the pp represents a nation based on catholic values , zapatero has always championed the diversity of modern spain , a country tolerant of its minorities and immigrants .
the catholic church backed the opposition , and will inevitably be stung by its defeat - which will result in heightened tension between the socialist government and the conservative leader of the spanish bishops ' conference cardinal rouco varela .
the role of the church is , after all , a central conflict within spanish society - and looks set to remain so . the spanish economy , meanwhile , has not been immune to the current turbulence on the international financial markets and growth has fallen off .
regaining economic stability will therefore be a key task for zapatero 's government .
it will also have to demonstrate resolve in its dealings with the basque separatist group eta , while keeping peace talks firmly on the agenda . on the international stage , spain will remain a known quantity .

the deal signals the end of an 11-month wage fight . two days of emergency negotiations averted an open-ended strike which threatened to plunge germany into transportation chaos by halting most passenger , freight and suburban trains .
the german train drivers ' union gdl planned to have its members walk off the job first thing monday morning .
the strike would have affected half of regional passenger services in western germany and 90 percent of those in the eastern part of the country where gdl has high membership .
" it 's a good day today , and what we had planned from tonight ... will not happen , " the head of gdl , manfred schell , told reporters sunday .
collective bargaining a sticking point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german commuters wo n't be kept waiting germany 's state-owned deutsche bahn had insisted that all three union representing railway employees be part of a collective wage contract .
this angered the gdl , which had come to a separate agreement with deutsche bahn in january after months of negotiations that included several strikes .
bahn chief hartmut mehdorn said his company had agreed on terms with the gdl and its two rival unions , transnet and the gdba , which represent the bulk of the railway 's employees .
train drivers will be granted a special status " that will fit into deutsche bahn 's collective wage contract without problems , " mehdorn said .
mehdorn described the 11-month negotiations , which led to short strikes in major cities and the freight sector last year , the worst labor dispute in deutsche bahn 's history .
" we have a result which brings calm for the next few years , " mehdorn told reporters .
" i am very happy for deutsche bahn and for our clients . "
berlin strike continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was concern that a strike would hurt the german economy in berlin , a separate , ongoing wage disagreement brought local transportation services to a halt on wednesday .
there had been concerns that the gdl strike would further paralyze the city .
germany had also been faced with warning strikes from public sector employees represented by the trade union verdi .
those were put on hold friday to give arbitrators a chance to try and reach a compromise over pay and working hours .
the agreement covers some 2 million federal and local government staff .
the head of germany 's bda employers association , dieter hundt , said excessive wage deals could “ threaten the current positive development of the economy and of the labor market . "
" continued strikes could lead to a situation , where the number of unemployed will be decreasing by less than the expected 300,000 to 400,000 this year , " hundt told bild am sonntag newspaper . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

beck attempted to refocus his party , which has been in disarray in recent weeks . there have been calls for beck 's resignation in recent weeks as the spd has floundered in a political quagmire in the western german state of hesse .
the spd has been in an uproar over the decision to rely on the left party in order to form a government in the region . andrea ypsilanti , the spd candidate for hesse 's top post , broke a pre-election pledge not to make any kind of political deal with the left party , which is made up of former communists and far-left former spd members .
her about face has enraged some spd members . beck , who has been out with the flu for two weeks , attempted to downplay the divisions in the spd and said he would not quit on monday , march 10 .
beck also denied that he had broken his word by agreeing to tolerate deals with the left at a state level . " parties must be able to adjust to new situations , " beck said .
" i do n't think they lose their credibility by doing that . " left seen as adversary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left is making inroads in western germany beck did concede monday that the spd 's attempt to stifle the rise of the new left party has failed .
beck said that while he will tolerate partnerships at the local level , he will not involve the party in a future national government . " the left is an adversarial party and that is how it will stay , " beck said . beck cited " irreconcilable differences " between the spd and left in financial , social and foreign policy . currently , the spd is the junior coalition partner of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
the " grand coalition " has left the spd with a bit of an identity crisis as approval ratings continue a downward slide . a dimap infratest poll showed beck would get 20 percent of german votes if the election were held today , compared with more than 60 percent for merkel . some spd members still angry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd has been looking for new partners beck has gotten support from some senior party members .
but others want him to resign and let someone else take on merkel in the general elections next year . " to my mind , his candidacy for the chancellorship is out of the question as he will not get over the credibility crisis , " the spd 's gerd andres told the hannoversche allgemeine zeitung newspaper . der spiegel newsmagazine quoted finance minister peer steinbrueck as saying the spd had handed the next election to the cdu . oskar niedermayer , a political scientist at berlin 's free university , said beck 's press conference monday was attempting a " damage control exercise . " niedermayer predicted merkel 's cdu will revive the issue of beck ’ s credibility ahead of the next federal elections , which must be held by september 2009 . when asked monday if he had lost his authority over the spd , beck said : " the only thing i have lost in the last two weeks is 5 or 6 kilos . " looking for a way forward in hesse bildunterschrift : andrea ypsilanti has been making headlines on sunday , beck had suggested during crisis talks with party leadership about the hesse situation that ypsilanti withdraw .
but ypsilanti beat him to the punch by confirming monday that she would be shelving her candidacy . events took a dramatic turn friday when dagmar metzger , one of the spd 's members of the state legislature , said she would not play along with ypsilanti 's moves to do a deal with the left party . over the weekend , ypsilanti 's supporters put pressure on metzger , calling on her to rethink her decision or resign from parliament and allow a replacement legislator to vote for the party leader as premier . beck said monday he would not pressure metzger to resign . the lure of the left bildunterschrift : who will govern hesse ?
spd officials , however , are not ruling out that ypsilanti , a member of the party 's left-wing , might have another shot at the premiership in may . ypsilanti 's tactics have opened up a debate in spd on the future course of the party after gains by the left in recent state elections ploughed up the german political field , forcing the main parties to seek arrangements with smaller parties they had previously kept at arm 's length . ypsilanti is dependent on the support of the left to become premier after her party secured 42 seats in the 110-seat state legislature in jan .
27 elections , level with the christian democrats , led by incumbent premier roland koch . with the free democrats , the cdu 's preferred partner , securing 11 seats and the greens nine , neither of the main blocs could form a majority government .

beck attempted to refocus his party , which has been in disarray in recent weeks . there have been calls for beck 's resignation in recent weeks as the spd has floundered in a political quagmire in the western german state of hesse .
the spd has been in an uproar over the decision to rely on the left party in order to form a government in the region . andrea ypsilanti , the spd candidate for hesse 's top post , broke a pre-election pledge not to make any kind of political deal with the left party , which is made up of former communists and far-left former spd members .
her about face has enraged some spd members . beck , who has been out with the flu for two weeks , attempted to downplay the divisions in the spd and said he would not quit on monday , march 10 .
beck also denied that he had broken his word by agreeing to tolerate deals with the left at a state level . " parties must be able to adjust to new situations , " beck said .
" i do n't think they lose their credibility by doing that . " left seen as adversary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left is making inroads in western germany beck did concede monday that the spd 's attempt to stifle the rise of the new left party has failed .
beck said that while he will tolerate partnerships at the local level , he will not involve the party in a future national government . " the left is an adversarial party and that is how it will stay , " beck said . beck cited " irreconcilable differences " between the spd and left in financial , social and foreign policy . currently , the spd is the junior coalition partner of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
the " grand coalition " has left the spd with a bit of an identity crisis as approval ratings continue a downward slide . a dimap infratest poll showed beck would get 20 percent of german votes if the election were held today , compared with more than 60 percent for merkel . some spd members still angry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd has been looking for new partners beck has gotten support from some senior party members .
but others want him to resign and let someone else take on merkel in the general elections next year . " to my mind , his candidacy for the chancellorship is out of the question as he will not get over the credibility crisis , " the spd 's gerd andres told the hannoversche allgemeine zeitung newspaper . der spiegel newsmagazine quoted finance minister peer steinbrueck as saying the spd had handed the next election to the cdu . oskar niedermayer , a political scientist at berlin 's free university , said beck 's press conference monday was attempting a " damage control exercise . " niedermayer predicted merkel 's cdu will revive the issue of beck ’ s credibility ahead of the next federal elections , which must be held by september 2009 . when asked monday if he had lost his authority over the spd , beck said : " the only thing i have lost in the last two weeks is 5 or 6 kilos . " looking for a way forward in hesse bildunterschrift : andrea ypsilanti has been making headlines on sunday , beck had suggested during crisis talks with party leadership about the hesse situation that ypsilanti withdraw .
but ypsilanti beat him to the punch by confirming monday that she would be shelving her candidacy . events took a dramatic turn friday when dagmar metzger , one of the spd 's members of the state legislature , said she would not play along with ypsilanti 's moves to do a deal with the left party . over the weekend , ypsilanti 's supporters put pressure on metzger , calling on her to rethink her decision or resign from parliament and allow a replacement legislator to vote for the party leader as premier . beck said monday he would not pressure metzger to resign . the lure of the left bildunterschrift : who will govern hesse ?
spd officials , however , are not ruling out that ypsilanti , a member of the party 's left-wing , might have another shot at the premiership in may . ypsilanti 's tactics have opened up a debate in spd on the future course of the party after gains by the left in recent state elections ploughed up the german political field , forcing the main parties to seek arrangements with smaller parties they had previously kept at arm 's length . ypsilanti is dependent on the support of the left to become premier after her party secured 42 seats in the 110-seat state legislature in jan .
27 elections , level with the christian democrats , led by incumbent premier roland koch . with the free democrats , the cdu 's preferred partner , securing 11 seats and the greens nine , neither of the main blocs could form a majority government .

beck attempted to refocus his party , which has been in disarray in recent weeks . there have been calls for beck 's resignation in recent weeks as the spd has floundered in a political quagmire in the western german state of hesse .
the spd has been in an uproar over the decision to rely on the left party in order to form a government in the region . andrea ypsilanti , the spd candidate for hesse 's top post , broke a pre-election pledge not to make any kind of political deal with the left party , which is made up of former communists and far-left former spd members .
her about face has enraged some spd members . beck , who has been out with the flu for two weeks , attempted to downplay the divisions in the spd and said he would not quit on monday , march 10 .
beck also denied that he had broken his word by agreeing to tolerate deals with the left at a state level . " parties must be able to adjust to new situations , " beck said .
" i do n't think they lose their credibility by doing that . " left seen as adversary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left is making inroads in western germany beck did concede monday that the spd 's attempt to stifle the rise of the new left party has failed .
beck said that while he will tolerate partnerships at the local level , he will not involve the party in a future national government . " the left is an adversarial party and that is how it will stay , " beck said . beck cited " irreconcilable differences " between the spd and left in financial , social and foreign policy . currently , the spd is the junior coalition partner of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
the " grand coalition " has left the spd with a bit of an identity crisis as approval ratings continue a downward slide . a dimap infratest poll showed beck would get 20 percent of german votes if the election were held today , compared with more than 60 percent for merkel . some spd members still angry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd has been looking for new partners beck has gotten support from some senior party members .
but others want him to resign and let someone else take on merkel in the general elections next year . " to my mind , his candidacy for the chancellorship is out of the question as he will not get over the credibility crisis , " the spd 's gerd andres told the hannoversche allgemeine zeitung newspaper . der spiegel newsmagazine quoted finance minister peer steinbrueck as saying the spd had handed the next election to the cdu . oskar niedermayer , a political scientist at berlin 's free university , said beck 's press conference monday was attempting a " damage control exercise . " niedermayer predicted merkel 's cdu will revive the issue of beck ’ s credibility ahead of the next federal elections , which must be held by september 2009 . when asked monday if he had lost his authority over the spd , beck said : " the only thing i have lost in the last two weeks is 5 or 6 kilos . " looking for a way forward in hesse bildunterschrift : andrea ypsilanti has been making headlines on sunday , beck had suggested during crisis talks with party leadership about the hesse situation that ypsilanti withdraw .
but ypsilanti beat him to the punch by confirming monday that she would be shelving her candidacy . events took a dramatic turn friday when dagmar metzger , one of the spd 's members of the state legislature , said she would not play along with ypsilanti 's moves to do a deal with the left party . over the weekend , ypsilanti 's supporters put pressure on metzger , calling on her to rethink her decision or resign from parliament and allow a replacement legislator to vote for the party leader as premier . beck said monday he would not pressure metzger to resign . the lure of the left bildunterschrift : who will govern hesse ?
spd officials , however , are not ruling out that ypsilanti , a member of the party 's left-wing , might have another shot at the premiership in may . ypsilanti 's tactics have opened up a debate in spd on the future course of the party after gains by the left in recent state elections ploughed up the german political field , forcing the main parties to seek arrangements with smaller parties they had previously kept at arm 's length . ypsilanti is dependent on the support of the left to become premier after her party secured 42 seats in the 110-seat state legislature in jan .
27 elections , level with the christian democrats , led by incumbent premier roland koch . with the free democrats , the cdu 's preferred partner , securing 11 seats and the greens nine , neither of the main blocs could form a majority government .
the left holds the balance with six seats . dw staff -lrb- th / jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the vote was seen as a referendum on the right-wing president , who is battling a collapse in popularity .
exit polls showed the opposition socialists well-placed to score big gains over sarkozy 's union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- in next sunday 's decisive second election round .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socialist leader hollande called the vote " a warning " nationwide , left-wing parties took some 47.5 percent of the vote , well ahead of the ump and its allies , which had 40 percent , according to a csa survey .
turnout was high , estimated at close to 70 percent .
socialists show their strength the socialists retained a firm grip on the capital , paris , and cemented their hold on france 's third city lyon - clinching victory in the first round - as well as on the northern city of lille .
paris mayor bertrand delanoe , a rising star of the left and one of france 's most popular politicians , received a resounding thumbs-up for his pro-environment urban policies , with about 41.6 percent of first round votes , against 27.9 for his right-wing rival francoise de panafieu .
delanoe 's green party allies won 6.7 percent of the vote .
socialist leader francois hollande said voters had sent " a warning to the president of the republic and the government on the policies conducted over the past nine months . "
in sarkozy 's camp , prime minister francois fillon accused the left-wing opposition of " mixing up local and national issues " during the campaign .
but ump chief patrick devedjian admitted on television the results were " not good . "
planned reforms could be endangered right-wing former prime minister alain juppe held on to the south-western wine capital bordeaux , winning reelection in the first round .
but the socialists appeared well-placed to seize the eastern city of strasbourg - one of three key trophies up for grabs along with the second city , marseille , on the mediterranean , and southwestern toulouse , where the outgoing mayors and their socialist challengers were headed for a face-off sunday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 10.03.2008 opinion : spanish socialists ca n't risk complacency großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's ruling socialists won a second term in elections sunday , march 9 , but they 're not in a position to rest on the laurels , says guenther maihold from the german institute for international and security affairs . surveys ahead of sunday 's election predicted a tight race , and that 's exactly what it was .
ultimately , voters might have opted for giving prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero a second term , but his victory was by no means a resounding one .
his socialist government is now set to continue on its path with an increased tally of seats - not so much in comparison to the opposition popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- of mariano rajoy but definitely in comparison to the regional parties , which have seen their influence in spanish politics subside .
the ruling socialist workers party -lrb- psoe -rrb- might still be short of an absolute majority , but zapatero 's party does have an expanded majority with 16 more seats than the pp .
and for opposition leader mariano rajoy , it was the second time he 'd failed to lead his party to power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guenther maihold but the election reflected something of a political impasse .
divided into two , almost equally large camps , the public is unwilling to give either the socialists or the popular party a clear majority .
both parties are seemingly unable to break the deadlock - and the country will continue to be blocked by its polarization .
whether the pp will be able to relinquish its confrontational tactics and find a way back to political consensus depends largely on how open to the opposition the government is now prepared to be . dominated by domestic policy issues , the campaign pitted two diverging versions of spanish society against one another .
while the pp represents a nation based on catholic values , zapatero has always championed the diversity of modern spain , a country tolerant of its minorities and immigrants .
the catholic church backed the opposition , and will inevitably be stung by its defeat - which will result in heightened tension between the socialist government and the conservative leader of the spanish bishops ' conference cardinal rouco varela .
the role of the church is , after all , a central conflict within spanish society - and looks set to remain so . the spanish economy , meanwhile , has not been immune to the current turbulence on the international financial markets and growth has fallen off .
regaining economic stability will therefore be a key task for zapatero 's government .
it will also have to demonstrate resolve in its dealings with the basque separatist group eta , while keeping peace talks firmly on the agenda . on the international stage , spain will remain a known quantity .
no one need fear any unexpected new departures in terms of foreign policy , although spain would do well to raise its international profile if it wants to fulfill its potential . günther maihold is deputy director at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the deal signals the end of an 11-month wage fight . two days of emergency negotiations averted an open-ended strike which threatened to plunge germany into transportation chaos by halting most passenger , freight and suburban trains .
the german train drivers ' union gdl planned to have its members walk off the job first thing monday morning .
the strike would have affected half of regional passenger services in western germany and 90 percent of those in the eastern part of the country where gdl has high membership .
" it 's a good day today , and what we had planned from tonight ... will not happen , " the head of gdl , manfred schell , told reporters sunday .
collective bargaining a sticking point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german commuters wo n't be kept waiting germany 's state-owned deutsche bahn had insisted that all three union representing railway employees be part of a collective wage contract .
this angered the gdl , which had come to a separate agreement with deutsche bahn in january after months of negotiations that included several strikes .
bahn chief hartmut mehdorn said his company had agreed on terms with the gdl and its two rival unions , transnet and the gdba , which represent the bulk of the railway 's employees .
train drivers will be granted a special status " that will fit into deutsche bahn 's collective wage contract without problems , " mehdorn said .
mehdorn described the 11-month negotiations , which led to short strikes in major cities and the freight sector last year , the worst labor dispute in deutsche bahn 's history .
" we have a result which brings calm for the next few years , " mehdorn told reporters .
" i am very happy for deutsche bahn and for our clients . "
berlin strike continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was concern that a strike would hurt the german economy in berlin , a separate , ongoing wage disagreement brought local transportation services to a halt on wednesday .
there had been concerns that the gdl strike would further paralyze the city .

but they ended up drawing lines in the sand instead . there 's always going to be trouble in paradise .
despite the glorious trappings , passengers on board p & o 's 77,000-ton oceana liner were getting royally fed up with the lack of available deck chairs , accusing certain errant holidaymakers of using towels , books and bags to reserve places . in the british mind , this could mean one thing , and one thing only : germans were at work , seeking as ever to expand their lebensraum . brilliantly witty - or culturally backward ? over in merry old england , the deck chair prejudice is a cultural stereotype that simply refuses to die .
it might mean nothing to germans themselves , but it 's embedded in mainstream british culture , and there it will remain , a source of much unreconstructed hilarity . several years ago , for example , the spitfire beer company ran an advertisement with the slogan " have the sunbeds , we 're off to the bar . "
not long after , another british beer brand , carling black label , launched a similar ad featuring an english bloke on holiday foiling germans trying to steal the deck chairs early in the morning . so perhaps captain christopher wells can be forgiven for making the obvious reference when he used the ship loudspeaker to tell passengers in no uncertain terms not to reserve loungers .
and as a sailor , he 's allowed to have a colorful turn of phrase . " we do n't want that kind of germanic behavior here ! " he joked . but not all the passengers were amused . " captain wells apologizes unreservedly for any offence caused , " said a spokesman for p & o , but it was too late . the captain now faces an inquiry by the equality and human rights commission over whether his remarks were racist . bed-bagging bildunterschrift : bed bagging never happened on the " the love boat " one female passenger said the crew had tried unsuccessfully to stop the " bed bagging . " " there were enough loungers for everyone , provided they were not reserved when not in use , " she told british daily the telegraph .
" crew members did their best , sometimes removing the towels , but then passengers reserved the sun beds with their own items . " initially , the captain tried allowing passengers to reclaim chairs which had remained unused for 20 minutes . however , that only led to more confrontation when some holidaymakers used stopwatches to monitor occupancy .
so much for a relaxing holiday in the sun . " this led to heated arguments and complaints - some people nearly came to blows , " said the anonymous female passenger . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the wwf blamed the deaths on lack of ice covering , which has lured seal pups into the water too early . a warm winter is wreaking havoc on the young seal population in the baltic sea north of germany with the international conservation organization wwf fearing that between 300 and 400 pups have died . " the situation is dire .
in some regions perhaps not a single one of the pups born in recent weeks will survive , " wwf baltic spokeswoman cathrin muenster said on monday , march 10 . lack of ice cover has been blamed for the deaths .
seal pups are going into the water too early where they " starve and die a painful death from the cold , " muenster added . because of the lack of ice , some seal mothers had given birth on small islands or on the mainland , where predators will likely kill the pups , said antti hallka , a seal expert with wwf finland said . seal population had been recovering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warmer weather might be good for swimmers , but not for seals the ringed seal is an earless seal found in northern waters all round the world .
the baltic subspecies , which numbers between 7,000 and 10,000 , is red-listed by the world conservation union as endangered . there are estimated to have been 180,000 ringed seals in the baltic in 1900 .
the population was severely reduced by hunting and pollution , but began to recover in the 1980s . now global warming is posing a new threat . the baltic sea has experienced of one of the warmest winters in almost 300 years , which scientists say is part of a general warming trend that could increase surface water temperatures 2 degrees celsius to 4 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degree fahrenheit to 7.2 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- by 2100 .
this degree of warming would cut the ice cover nearly in half . the seals required 90 days of ice covering to breed successfully , but indications were that by the end of the century the southern range of the seals ' breeding grounds would see its ice covering cut to as little as 18 days , the wwf said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russia might be preparing to recognize abkhazia sovereignty .
the european union opposes the move . kosovo 's declaration of independence from serbia last month gave hope to rebels who have been fighting to do the same in the region of abkhazia , which borders the black sea . since abkhazia declared independence from georgia on friday , march 7 , russia made signs that it is preparing to recognize the region 's sovereignty by lifting a formal trade embargo . " there is a growing preoccupation and anxiety that russia may be paving the way for recognition of abkhazia , " eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said monday , march 10 . she reaffirmed eu support for georgia 's borders .
abkhazia 's declaration followed a similar vote on wednesday by georgia 's other separatist region , south ossetia .
both regions cited kosovo as a precedent , calling on the international community to recognize their self-declared independence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia wants eu support georgia 's pro-western government has accused moscow of trying to destabilize the region . " georgia 's territorial integrity has always been clearly supported by the eu ... this is absolutely clear , " ferrero-waldner said . the issue was on the agenda of an eu foreign ministers meeting held in brussels monday . " we will be discussing georgia and ... what can we do in order to support more strongly georgia in a difficult situation , " ferrero-waldner said . sweden and poland had written to the eu to call for the bloc to do more to stabilize georgia ahead of planned parliamentary elections in may .
ferrero-waldner suggested the eu could make it easier to get visas and launch a trade pact . further destabilization likely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the moment , no country officially recognizes abkhazia as an independent state moscow has had an official ban on trade with abkhazia since 1996 , although georgia has accused russia of providing financial aid to rebels .
the region uses the russia ruble as its currency . no country , including russia , currently recognizes the rebel provinces ' independence claims and georgia has sworn to regain control of the areas . abkhazia and south ossetia broke away from georgia in the early 1990s .
thousands of people were killed in the conflicts and hundreds of thousands of ethnic-georgians were forced to abandon their homes . georgian politicians have said that lifting russia 's sanctions will allow moscow to freely send weapons , military equipment and russian mercenaries , further destabilizing the region . the georgian foreign ministry said russia 's move was " an extremely dangerous provocation that encourages separatism and aims to deepen tensions in the conflict zone .

moscow had long argued that the west 's support of kosovo independence would set a precedent for other regions of the world .
the eu always argued that kosovo was a special case . sergei bagapsh , rebel leader of abkhazia , did n't agree with the european view .
he told interfax news agency that his province has as much right to independence as kosovo . " we call on the international community to refuse double standards and recognize the independence of abkhazia and south ossetia , " bagapsh said .

but they ended up drawing lines in the sand instead . there 's always going to be trouble in paradise .
despite the glorious trappings , passengers on board p & o 's 77,000-ton oceana liner were getting royally fed up with the lack of available deck chairs , accusing certain errant holidaymakers of using towels , books and bags to reserve places . in the british mind , this could mean one thing , and one thing only : germans were at work , seeking as ever to expand their lebensraum . brilliantly witty - or culturally backward ? over in merry old england , the deck chair prejudice is a cultural stereotype that simply refuses to die .
it might mean nothing to germans themselves , but it 's embedded in mainstream british culture , and there it will remain , a source of much unreconstructed hilarity . several years ago , for example , the spitfire beer company ran an advertisement with the slogan " have the sunbeds , we 're off to the bar . "
not long after , another british beer brand , carling black label , launched a similar ad featuring an english bloke on holiday foiling germans trying to steal the deck chairs early in the morning . so perhaps captain christopher wells can be forgiven for making the obvious reference when he used the ship loudspeaker to tell passengers in no uncertain terms not to reserve loungers .
and as a sailor , he 's allowed to have a colorful turn of phrase . " we do n't want that kind of germanic behavior here ! " he joked . but not all the passengers were amused . " captain wells apologizes unreservedly for any offence caused , " said a spokesman for p & o , but it was too late . the captain now faces an inquiry by the equality and human rights commission over whether his remarks were racist . bed-bagging bildunterschrift : bed bagging never happened on the " the love boat " one female passenger said the crew had tried unsuccessfully to stop the " bed bagging . " " there were enough loungers for everyone , provided they were not reserved when not in use , " she told british daily the telegraph .
" crew members did their best , sometimes removing the towels , but then passengers reserved the sun beds with their own items . " initially , the captain tried allowing passengers to reclaim chairs which had remained unused for 20 minutes . however , that only led to more confrontation when some holidaymakers used stopwatches to monitor occupancy .
so much for a relaxing holiday in the sun . " this led to heated arguments and complaints - some people nearly came to blows , " said the anonymous female passenger . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russia might be preparing to recognize abkhazia sovereignty .
the european union opposes the move . kosovo 's declaration of independence from serbia last month gave hope to rebels who have been fighting to do the same in the region of abkhazia , which borders the black sea . since abkhazia declared independence from georgia on friday , march 7 , russia made signs that it is preparing to recognize the region 's sovereignty by lifting a formal trade embargo . " there is a growing preoccupation and anxiety that russia may be paving the way for recognition of abkhazia , " eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said monday , march 10 . she reaffirmed eu support for georgia 's borders .
abkhazia 's declaration followed a similar vote on wednesday by georgia 's other separatist region , south ossetia .
both regions cited kosovo as a precedent , calling on the international community to recognize their self-declared independence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia wants eu support georgia 's pro-western government has accused moscow of trying to destabilize the region . " georgia 's territorial integrity has always been clearly supported by the eu ... this is absolutely clear , " ferrero-waldner said . the issue was on the agenda of an eu foreign ministers meeting held in brussels monday . " we will be discussing georgia and ... what can we do in order to support more strongly georgia in a difficult situation , " ferrero-waldner said . sweden and poland had written to the eu to call for the bloc to do more to stabilize georgia ahead of planned parliamentary elections in may .
ferrero-waldner suggested the eu could make it easier to get visas and launch a trade pact . further destabilization likely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the moment , no country officially recognizes abkhazia as an independent state moscow has had an official ban on trade with abkhazia since 1996 , although georgia has accused russia of providing financial aid to rebels .
the region uses the russia ruble as its currency . no country , including russia , currently recognizes the rebel provinces ' independence claims and georgia has sworn to regain control of the areas . abkhazia and south ossetia broke away from georgia in the early 1990s .
thousands of people were killed in the conflicts and hundreds of thousands of ethnic-georgians were forced to abandon their homes . georgian politicians have said that lifting russia 's sanctions will allow moscow to freely send weapons , military equipment and russian mercenaries , further destabilizing the region . the georgian foreign ministry said russia 's move was " an extremely dangerous provocation that encourages separatism and aims to deepen tensions in the conflict zone . " the statement accused moscow of " trying to violate georgia 's sovereignty . " blame kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the georgian military has tried to retake control abkhazia renewed its diplomatic effort for international recognition in the weeks after kosovo 's independence . " georgia is a point of concern for us , because the russian federation and the confederation of independent states decided to draw certain parallels with kosovo on this issue , " slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel told reporters after a meeting of eu foreign ministers . russia vehemently opposed kosovo 's independence from serbia .
moscow had long argued that the west 's support of kosovo independence would set a precedent for other regions of the world .
the eu always argued that kosovo was a special case . sergei bagapsh , rebel leader of abkhazia , did n't agree with the european view .
he told interfax news agency that his province has as much right to independence as kosovo . " we call on the international community to refuse double standards and recognize the independence of abkhazia and south ossetia , " bagapsh said .
" for us the situation with the recognition of kosovo is a precedent and all talk of the uniqueness of that case is not credible . " in a statement friday , the abkhaz parliament asked the united nations and individual countries to " consider the recognition of the republic of abkhazia as an independent , sovereign state . "
a separate statement asked russia 's government to do the same . russia 's duma will consider abkhazia 's independence at a hearing on march 13 , the deputy chairman of its international affairs committee , leonid slutsky , told russia 's itar-tass news agency . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

beck attempted to refocus his party , which has been in disarray in recent weeks . there have been calls for beck 's resignation in recent weeks as the spd has floundered in a political quagmire in the western german state of hesse .
the spd has been in an uproar over the decision to rely on the left party in order to form a government in the region . andrea ypsilanti , the spd candidate for hesse 's top post , broke a pre-election pledge not to make any kind of political deal with the left party , which is made up of former communists and far-left former spd members .
her about face has enraged some spd members . beck , who has been out with the flu for two weeks , attempted to downplay the divisions in the spd and said he would not quit on monday , march 10 .
beck also denied that he had broken his word by agreeing to tolerate deals with the left at a state level . " parties must be able to adjust to new situations , " beck said .
" i do n't think they lose their credibility by doing that . " left seen as adversary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left is making inroads in western germany beck did concede monday that the spd 's attempt to stifle the rise of the new left party has failed .
beck said that while he will tolerate partnerships at the local level , he will not involve the party in a future national government . " the left is an adversarial party and that is how it will stay , " beck said . beck cited " irreconcilable differences " between the spd and left in financial , social and foreign policy . currently , the spd is the junior coalition partner of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
the " grand coalition " has left the spd with a bit of an identity crisis as approval ratings continue a downward slide . a dimap infratest poll showed beck would get 20 percent of german votes if the election were held today , compared with more than 60 percent for merkel . some spd members still angry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd has been looking for new partners beck has gotten support from some senior party members .
but others want him to resign and let someone else take on merkel in the general elections next year . " to my mind , his candidacy for the chancellorship is out of the question as he will not get over the credibility crisis , " the spd 's gerd andres told the hannoversche allgemeine zeitung newspaper . der spiegel newsmagazine quoted finance minister peer steinbrueck as saying the spd had handed the next election to the cdu . oskar niedermayer , a political scientist at berlin 's free university , said beck 's press conference monday was attempting a " damage control exercise . " niedermayer predicted merkel 's cdu will revive the issue of beck ’ s credibility ahead of the next federal elections , which must be held by september 2009 . when asked monday if he had lost his authority over the spd , beck said : " the only thing i have lost in the last two weeks is 5 or 6 kilos . " looking for a way forward in hesse bildunterschrift : andrea ypsilanti has been making headlines on sunday , beck had suggested during crisis talks with party leadership about the hesse situation that ypsilanti withdraw .
but ypsilanti beat him to the punch by confirming monday that she would be shelving her candidacy . events took a dramatic turn friday when dagmar metzger , one of the spd 's members of the state legislature , said she would not play along with ypsilanti 's moves to do a deal with the left party . over the weekend , ypsilanti 's supporters put pressure on metzger , calling on her to rethink her decision or resign from parliament and allow a replacement legislator to vote for the party leader as premier . beck said monday he would not pressure metzger to resign . the lure of the left bildunterschrift : who will govern hesse ?
spd officials , however , are not ruling out that ypsilanti , a member of the party 's left-wing , might have another shot at the premiership in may . ypsilanti 's tactics have opened up a debate in spd on the future course of the party after gains by the left in recent state elections ploughed up the german political field , forcing the main parties to seek arrangements with smaller parties they had previously kept at arm 's length . ypsilanti is dependent on the support of the left to become premier after her party secured 42 seats in the 110-seat state legislature in jan .
27 elections , level with the christian democrats , led by incumbent premier roland koch . with the free democrats , the cdu 's preferred partner , securing 11 seats and the greens nine , neither of the main blocs could form a majority government .

european union officials hope the vote will end in victory for west-leaning parties . kostunica 's government formally stepped down on monday , march 10 , and called for early elections in may after its coalition parties fell out over the issue of how to deal with the european union following the support of many eu states for kosovo 's secession . european union officials said they hoped the coming polls would benefit pro-european parties . " with the coming elections , we hope that the european forces will win , " said slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency . eu foreign ministers meeting in brussels were unanimous in calling on the people of serbia not to turn their backs on europe by supporting serbia 's nationalistic parties in the election . " europe needs serbia and serbia needs europe , " sweden 's foreign minister carl bildt said . " were serbia to sink into self-isolation , it would clearly be to the detriment of the economy -lrb- and -rrb- politics ... of serbia , but also of the entire region . " kostunica opposes eu support of kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic 's course has received support from the eu and us eu officials , who supported the re-election of serbian president boris tadic last month , were concerned last week after serbian nationalists , including kostunica , called for a parliamentary vote to stop serbia 's further integration into the eu . the resolution , which was ultimately turned down on thursday , crafted in response to many eu member states ' support for kosovo 's declaration of independence , also condemned the eu 's deployment of a peace and justice mission to help supervise the new state 's institutions . as a result , kostunica resigned saturday , opening the door for new elections , expected to take place on may 11 .
bildt , who recently returned from a visit to kosovo , said he sees the vote as " an opportunity to choose the european course more firmly than they have done before . " proposals for eu incentives " what we have to do is to show the serbian population that we want them in the european union , " said external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner . to do this , the commission offered several proposals last week for building a stronger relationship with serbia .
incentives include easier visa procedures , a doubling of scholarships and better eu-serbia transport links . the eu already has initialed , though not signed , a stabilization and association agreement with belgrade , the first step on the long road to membership in the bloc .
pro-western president tadic has insisted that despite disagreements over kosovo , belgrade has no alternative but to join the bloc as soon as possible . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

despite the glorious trappings , passengers on board p & o 's 77,000-ton oceana liner were getting royally fed up with the lack of available deck chairs , accusing certain errant holidaymakers of using towels , books and bags to reserve places . in the british mind , this could mean one thing , and one thing only : germans were at work , seeking as ever to expand their lebensraum . brilliantly witty - or culturally backward ? over in merry old england , the deck chair prejudice is a cultural stereotype that simply refuses to die .

"
not long after , another british beer brand , carling black label , launched a similar ad featuring an english bloke on holiday foiling germans trying to steal the deck chairs early in the morning . so perhaps captain christopher wells can be forgiven for making the obvious reference when he used the ship loudspeaker to tell passengers in no uncertain terms not to reserve loungers .
and as a sailor , he 's allowed to have a colorful turn of phrase . " we do n't want that kind of germanic behavior here ! " he joked . but not all the passengers were amused . " captain wells apologizes unreservedly for any offence caused , " said a spokesman for p & o , but it was too late . the captain now faces an inquiry by the equality and human rights commission over whether his remarks were racist . bed-bagging bildunterschrift : bed bagging never happened on the " the love boat " one female passenger said the crew had tried unsuccessfully to stop the " bed bagging . " " there were enough loungers for everyone , provided they were not reserved when not in use , " she told british daily the telegraph .
" crew members did their best , sometimes removing the towels , but then passengers reserved the sun beds with their own items . " initially , the captain tried allowing passengers to reclaim chairs which had remained unused for 20 minutes . however , that only led to more confrontation when some holidaymakers used stopwatches to monitor occupancy .

european union officials hope the vote will end in victory for west-leaning parties . kostunica 's government formally stepped down on monday , march 10 , and called for early elections in may after its coalition parties fell out over the issue of how to deal with the european union following the support of many eu states for kosovo 's secession . european union officials said they hoped the coming polls would benefit pro-european parties . " with the coming elections , we hope that the european forces will win , " said slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency . eu foreign ministers meeting in brussels were unanimous in calling on the people of serbia not to turn their backs on europe by supporting serbia 's nationalistic parties in the election . " europe needs serbia and serbia needs europe , " sweden 's foreign minister carl bildt said . " were serbia to sink into self-isolation , it would clearly be to the detriment of the economy -lrb- and -rrb- politics ... of serbia , but also of the entire region . " kostunica opposes eu support of kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic 's course has received support from the eu and us eu officials , who supported the re-election of serbian president boris tadic last month , were concerned last week after serbian nationalists , including kostunica , called for a parliamentary vote to stop serbia 's further integration into the eu . the resolution , which was ultimately turned down on thursday , crafted in response to many eu member states ' support for kosovo 's declaration of independence , also condemned the eu 's deployment of a peace and justice mission to help supervise the new state 's institutions . as a result , kostunica resigned saturday , opening the door for new elections , expected to take place on may 11 .
bildt , who recently returned from a visit to kosovo , said he sees the vote as " an opportunity to choose the european course more firmly than they have done before . " proposals for eu incentives " what we have to do is to show the serbian population that we want them in the european union , " said external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner . to do this , the commission offered several proposals last week for building a stronger relationship with serbia .
incentives include easier visa procedures , a doubling of scholarships and better eu-serbia transport links . the eu already has initialed , though not signed , a stabilization and association agreement with belgrade , the first step on the long road to membership in the bloc .
pro-western president tadic has insisted that despite disagreements over kosovo , belgrade has no alternative but to join the bloc as soon as possible . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

beck attempted to refocus his party , which has been in disarray in recent weeks . there have been calls for beck 's resignation in recent weeks as the spd has floundered in a political quagmire in the western german state of hesse .
the spd has been in an uproar over the decision to rely on the left party in order to form a government in the region . andrea ypsilanti , the spd candidate for hesse 's top post , broke a pre-election pledge not to make any kind of political deal with the left party , which is made up of former communists and far-left former spd members .
her about face has enraged some spd members . beck , who has been out with the flu for two weeks , attempted to downplay the divisions in the spd and said he would not quit on monday , march 10 .
beck also denied that he had broken his word by agreeing to tolerate deals with the left at a state level . " parties must be able to adjust to new situations , " beck said .
" i do n't think they lose their credibility by doing that . " left seen as adversary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left is making inroads in western germany beck did concede monday that the spd 's attempt to stifle the rise of the new left party has failed .
beck said that while he will tolerate partnerships at the local level , he will not involve the party in a future national government . " the left is an adversarial party and that is how it will stay , " beck said . beck cited " irreconcilable differences " between the spd and left in financial , social and foreign policy . currently , the spd is the junior coalition partner of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
the " grand coalition " has left the spd with a bit of an identity crisis as approval ratings continue a downward slide . a dimap infratest poll showed beck would get 20 percent of german votes if the election were held today , compared with more than 60 percent for merkel . some spd members still angry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd has been looking for new partners beck has gotten support from some senior party members .
but others want him to resign and let someone else take on merkel in the general elections next year . " to my mind , his candidacy for the chancellorship is out of the question as he will not get over the credibility crisis , " the spd 's gerd andres told the hannoversche allgemeine zeitung newspaper . der spiegel newsmagazine quoted finance minister peer steinbrueck as saying the spd had handed the next election to the cdu . oskar niedermayer , a political scientist at berlin 's free university , said beck 's press conference monday was attempting a " damage control exercise . " niedermayer predicted merkel 's cdu will revive the issue of beck ’ s credibility ahead of the next federal elections , which must be held by september 2009 . when asked monday if he had lost his authority over the spd , beck said : " the only thing i have lost in the last two weeks is 5 or 6 kilos . " looking for a way forward in hesse bildunterschrift : andrea ypsilanti has been making headlines on sunday , beck had suggested during crisis talks with party leadership about the hesse situation that ypsilanti withdraw .
but ypsilanti beat him to the punch by confirming monday that she would be shelving her candidacy . events took a dramatic turn friday when dagmar metzger , one of the spd 's members of the state legislature , said she would not play along with ypsilanti 's moves to do a deal with the left party . over the weekend , ypsilanti 's supporters put pressure on metzger , calling on her to rethink her decision or resign from parliament and allow a replacement legislator to vote for the party leader as premier . beck said monday he would not pressure metzger to resign . the lure of the left bildunterschrift : who will govern hesse ?
spd officials , however , are not ruling out that ypsilanti , a member of the party 's left-wing , might have another shot at the premiership in may . ypsilanti 's tactics have opened up a debate in spd on the future course of the party after gains by the left in recent state elections ploughed up the german political field , forcing the main parties to seek arrangements with smaller parties they had previously kept at arm 's length . ypsilanti is dependent on the support of the left to become premier after her party secured 42 seats in the 110-seat state legislature in jan .
27 elections , level with the christian democrats , led by incumbent premier roland koch . with the free democrats , the cdu 's preferred partner , securing 11 seats and the greens nine , neither of the main blocs could form a majority government .

but they ended up drawing lines in the sand instead . there 's always going to be trouble in paradise .
despite the glorious trappings , passengers on board p & o 's 77,000-ton oceana liner were getting royally fed up with the lack of available deck chairs , accusing certain errant holidaymakers of using towels , books and bags to reserve places . in the british mind , this could mean one thing , and one thing only : germans were at work , seeking as ever to expand their lebensraum . brilliantly witty - or culturally backward ? over in merry old england , the deck chair prejudice is a cultural stereotype that simply refuses to die .
it might mean nothing to germans themselves , but it 's embedded in mainstream british culture , and there it will remain , a source of much unreconstructed hilarity . several years ago , for example , the spitfire beer company ran an advertisement with the slogan " have the sunbeds , we 're off to the bar . "
not long after , another british beer brand , carling black label , launched a similar ad featuring an english bloke on holiday foiling germans trying to steal the deck chairs early in the morning . so perhaps captain christopher wells can be forgiven for making the obvious reference when he used the ship loudspeaker to tell passengers in no uncertain terms not to reserve loungers .
and as a sailor , he 's allowed to have a colorful turn of phrase . " we do n't want that kind of germanic behavior here ! " he joked . but not all the passengers were amused . " captain wells apologizes unreservedly for any offence caused , " said a spokesman for p & o , but it was too late . the captain now faces an inquiry by the equality and human rights commission over whether his remarks were racist . bed-bagging bildunterschrift : bed bagging never happened on the " the love boat " one female passenger said the crew had tried unsuccessfully to stop the " bed bagging . " " there were enough loungers for everyone , provided they were not reserved when not in use , " she told british daily the telegraph .
" crew members did their best , sometimes removing the towels , but then passengers reserved the sun beds with their own items . " initially , the captain tried allowing passengers to reclaim chairs which had remained unused for 20 minutes . however , that only led to more confrontation when some holidaymakers used stopwatches to monitor occupancy .
so much for a relaxing holiday in the sun . " this led to heated arguments and complaints - some people nearly came to blows , " said the anonymous female passenger . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russia might be preparing to recognize abkhazia sovereignty .
the european union opposes the move . kosovo 's declaration of independence from serbia last month gave hope to rebels who have been fighting to do the same in the region of abkhazia , which borders the black sea . since abkhazia declared independence from georgia on friday , march 7 , russia made signs that it is preparing to recognize the region 's sovereignty by lifting a formal trade embargo . " there is a growing preoccupation and anxiety that russia may be paving the way for recognition of abkhazia , " eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said monday , march 10 . she reaffirmed eu support for georgia 's borders .
abkhazia 's declaration followed a similar vote on wednesday by georgia 's other separatist region , south ossetia .
both regions cited kosovo as a precedent , calling on the international community to recognize their self-declared independence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia wants eu support georgia 's pro-western government has accused moscow of trying to destabilize the region . " georgia 's territorial integrity has always been clearly supported by the eu ... this is absolutely clear , " ferrero-waldner said . the issue was on the agenda of an eu foreign ministers meeting held in brussels monday . " we will be discussing georgia and ... what can we do in order to support more strongly georgia in a difficult situation , " ferrero-waldner said . sweden and poland had written to the eu to call for the bloc to do more to stabilize georgia ahead of planned parliamentary elections in may .
ferrero-waldner suggested the eu could make it easier to get visas and launch a trade pact . further destabilization likely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the moment , no country officially recognizes abkhazia as an independent state moscow has had an official ban on trade with abkhazia since 1996 , although georgia has accused russia of providing financial aid to rebels .
the region uses the russia ruble as its currency . no country , including russia , currently recognizes the rebel provinces ' independence claims and georgia has sworn to regain control of the areas . abkhazia and south ossetia broke away from georgia in the early 1990s .
thousands of people were killed in the conflicts and hundreds of thousands of ethnic-georgians were forced to abandon their homes . georgian politicians have said that lifting russia 's sanctions will allow moscow to freely send weapons , military equipment and russian mercenaries , further destabilizing the region . the georgian foreign ministry said russia 's move was " an extremely dangerous provocation that encourages separatism and aims to deepen tensions in the conflict zone . " the statement accused moscow of " trying to violate georgia 's sovereignty . " blame kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the georgian military has tried to retake control abkhazia renewed its diplomatic effort for international recognition in the weeks after kosovo 's independence . " georgia is a point of concern for us , because the russian federation and the confederation of independent states decided to draw certain parallels with kosovo on this issue , " slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel told reporters after a meeting of eu foreign ministers . russia vehemently opposed kosovo 's independence from serbia .
moscow had long argued that the west 's support of kosovo independence would set a precedent for other regions of the world .
the eu always argued that kosovo was a special case . sergei bagapsh , rebel leader of abkhazia , did n't agree with the european view .
he told interfax news agency that his province has as much right to independence as kosovo . " we call on the international community to refuse double standards and recognize the independence of abkhazia and south ossetia , " bagapsh said .
" for us the situation with the recognition of kosovo is a precedent and all talk of the uniqueness of that case is not credible . " in a statement friday , the abkhaz parliament asked the united nations and individual countries to " consider the recognition of the republic of abkhazia as an independent , sovereign state . "
a separate statement asked russia 's government to do the same . russia 's duma will consider abkhazia 's independence at a hearing on march 13 , the deputy chairman of its international affairs committee , leonid slutsky , told russia 's itar-tass news agency . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the wwf blamed the deaths on lack of ice covering , which has lured seal pups into the water too early . a warm winter is wreaking havoc on the young seal population in the baltic sea north of germany with the international conservation organization wwf fearing that between 300 and 400 pups have died . " the situation is dire .
in some regions perhaps not a single one of the pups born in recent weeks will survive , " wwf baltic spokeswoman cathrin muenster said on monday , march 10 . lack of ice cover has been blamed for the deaths .
seal pups are going into the water too early where they " starve and die a painful death from the cold , " muenster added . because of the lack of ice , some seal mothers had given birth on small islands or on the mainland , where predators will likely kill the pups , said antti hallka , a seal expert with wwf finland said . seal population had been recovering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warmer weather might be good for swimmers , but not for seals the ringed seal is an earless seal found in northern waters all round the world .
the baltic subspecies , which numbers between 7,000 and 10,000 , is red-listed by the world conservation union as endangered . there are estimated to have been 180,000 ringed seals in the baltic in 1900 .
the population was severely reduced by hunting and pollution , but began to recover in the 1980s . now global warming is posing a new threat . the baltic sea has experienced of one of the warmest winters in almost 300 years , which scientists say is part of a general warming trend that could increase surface water temperatures 2 degrees celsius to 4 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degree fahrenheit to 7.2 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- by 2100 .
this degree of warming would cut the ice cover nearly in half . the seals required 90 days of ice covering to breed successfully , but indications were that by the end of the century the southern range of the seals ' breeding grounds would see its ice covering cut to as little as 18 days , the wwf said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the deal signals the end of an 11-month wage fight . two days of emergency negotiations averted an open-ended strike which threatened to plunge germany into transportation chaos by halting most passenger , freight and suburban trains .
the german train drivers ' union gdl planned to have its members walk off the job first thing monday morning .
the strike would have affected half of regional passenger services in western germany and 90 percent of those in the eastern part of the country where gdl has high membership .
" it 's a good day today , and what we had planned from tonight ... will not happen , " the head of gdl , manfred schell , told reporters sunday .
collective bargaining a sticking point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german commuters wo n't be kept waiting germany 's state-owned deutsche bahn had insisted that all three union representing railway employees be part of a collective wage contract .
this angered the gdl , which had come to a separate agreement with deutsche bahn in january after months of negotiations that included several strikes .
bahn chief hartmut mehdorn said his company had agreed on terms with the gdl and its two rival unions , transnet and the gdba , which represent the bulk of the railway 's employees .
train drivers will be granted a special status " that will fit into deutsche bahn 's collective wage contract without problems , " mehdorn said .
mehdorn described the 11-month negotiations , which led to short strikes in major cities and the freight sector last year , the worst labor dispute in deutsche bahn 's history .
" we have a result which brings calm for the next few years , " mehdorn told reporters .
" i am very happy for deutsche bahn and for our clients . "

there had been concerns that the gdl strike would further paralyze the city .
germany had also been faced with warning strikes from public sector employees represented by the trade union verdi .
those were put on hold friday to give arbitrators a chance to try and reach a compromise over pay and working hours .
the agreement covers some 2 million federal and local government staff .
the head of germany 's bda employers association , dieter hundt , said excessive wage deals could “ threaten the current positive development of the economy and of the labor market . "
" continued strikes could lead to a situation , where the number of unemployed will be decreasing by less than the expected 300,000 to 400,000 this year , " hundt told bild am sonntag newspaper . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there is a growing preoccupation and anxiety that russia may be paving the way for recognition of abkhazia , " eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said monday , march 10 . she reaffirmed eu support for georgia 's borders .
abkhazia 's declaration followed a similar vote on wednesday by georgia 's other separatist region , south ossetia .

moscow had long argued that the west 's support of kosovo independence would set a precedent for other regions of the world .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 10.03.2008 opinion : spanish socialists ca n't risk complacency großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's ruling socialists won a second term in elections sunday , march 9 , but they 're not in a position to rest on the laurels , says guenther maihold from the german institute for international and security affairs . surveys ahead of sunday 's election predicted a tight race , and that 's exactly what it was .
ultimately , voters might have opted for giving prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero a second term , but his victory was by no means a resounding one .
his socialist government is now set to continue on its path with an increased tally of seats - not so much in comparison to the opposition popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- of mariano rajoy but definitely in comparison to the regional parties , which have seen their influence in spanish politics subside .
the ruling socialist workers party -lrb- psoe -rrb- might still be short of an absolute majority , but zapatero 's party does have an expanded majority with 16 more seats than the pp .
and for opposition leader mariano rajoy , it was the second time he 'd failed to lead his party to power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guenther maihold but the election reflected something of a political impasse .
divided into two , almost equally large camps , the public is unwilling to give either the socialists or the popular party a clear majority .
both parties are seemingly unable to break the deadlock - and the country will continue to be blocked by its polarization .
whether the pp will be able to relinquish its confrontational tactics and find a way back to political consensus depends largely on how open to the opposition the government is now prepared to be . dominated by domestic policy issues , the campaign pitted two diverging versions of spanish society against one another .
while the pp represents a nation based on catholic values , zapatero has always championed the diversity of modern spain , a country tolerant of its minorities and immigrants .
the catholic church backed the opposition , and will inevitably be stung by its defeat - which will result in heightened tension between the socialist government and the conservative leader of the spanish bishops ' conference cardinal rouco varela .
the role of the church is , after all , a central conflict within spanish society - and looks set to remain so . the spanish economy , meanwhile , has not been immune to the current turbulence on the international financial markets and growth has fallen off .
regaining economic stability will therefore be a key task for zapatero 's government .
it will also have to demonstrate resolve in its dealings with the basque separatist group eta , while keeping peace talks firmly on the agenda . on the international stage , spain will remain a known quantity .
no one need fear any unexpected new departures in terms of foreign policy , although spain would do well to raise its international profile if it wants to fulfill its potential . günther maihold is deputy director at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the deal signals the end of an 11-month wage fight . two days of emergency negotiations averted an open-ended strike which threatened to plunge germany into transportation chaos by halting most passenger , freight and suburban trains .
the german train drivers ' union gdl planned to have its members walk off the job first thing monday morning .
the strike would have affected half of regional passenger services in western germany and 90 percent of those in the eastern part of the country where gdl has high membership .
" it 's a good day today , and what we had planned from tonight ... will not happen , " the head of gdl , manfred schell , told reporters sunday .
collective bargaining a sticking point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german commuters wo n't be kept waiting germany 's state-owned deutsche bahn had insisted that all three union representing railway employees be part of a collective wage contract .
this angered the gdl , which had come to a separate agreement with deutsche bahn in january after months of negotiations that included several strikes .
bahn chief hartmut mehdorn said his company had agreed on terms with the gdl and its two rival unions , transnet and the gdba , which represent the bulk of the railway 's employees .
train drivers will be granted a special status " that will fit into deutsche bahn 's collective wage contract without problems , " mehdorn said .
mehdorn described the 11-month negotiations , which led to short strikes in major cities and the freight sector last year , the worst labor dispute in deutsche bahn 's history .
" we have a result which brings calm for the next few years , " mehdorn told reporters .
" i am very happy for deutsche bahn and for our clients . "

germany had also been faced with warning strikes from public sector employees represented by the trade union verdi .
those were put on hold friday to give arbitrators a chance to try and reach a compromise over pay and working hours .
the agreement covers some 2 million federal and local government staff .
the head of germany 's bda employers association , dieter hundt , said excessive wage deals could “ threaten the current positive development of the economy and of the labor market . "
" continued strikes could lead to a situation , where the number of unemployed will be decreasing by less than the expected 300,000 to 400,000 this year , " hundt told bild am sonntag newspaper . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

european union officials hope the vote will end in victory for west-leaning parties . kostunica 's government formally stepped down on monday , march 10 , and called for early elections in may after its coalition parties fell out over the issue of how to deal with the european union following the support of many eu states for kosovo 's secession . european union officials said they hoped the coming polls would benefit pro-european parties . " with the coming elections , we hope that the european forces will win , " said slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency . eu foreign ministers meeting in brussels were unanimous in calling on the people of serbia not to turn their backs on europe by supporting serbia 's nationalistic parties in the election .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de unions -pipe- 10.03.2008 last-minute deal averts german rail strike großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deal goes forward a massive german rail strike planned for monday , march 9 , has been called off thanks to an agreement between train drivers and rail operator deutsche bahn .
the deal signals the end of an 11-month wage fight . two days of emergency negotiations averted an open-ended strike which threatened to plunge germany into transportation chaos by halting most passenger , freight and suburban trains .
the german train drivers ' union gdl planned to have its members walk off the job first thing monday morning .
the strike would have affected half of regional passenger services in western germany and 90 percent of those in the eastern part of the country where gdl has high membership .
" it 's a good day today , and what we had planned from tonight ... will not happen , " the head of gdl , manfred schell , told reporters sunday .
collective bargaining a sticking point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german commuters wo n't be kept waiting germany 's state-owned deutsche bahn had insisted that all three union representing railway employees be part of a collective wage contract .
this angered the gdl , which had come to a separate agreement with deutsche bahn in january after months of negotiations that included several strikes .
bahn chief hartmut mehdorn said his company had agreed on terms with the gdl and its two rival unions , transnet and the gdba , which represent the bulk of the railway 's employees .
train drivers will be granted a special status " that will fit into deutsche bahn 's collective wage contract without problems , " mehdorn said .
mehdorn described the 11-month negotiations , which led to short strikes in major cities and the freight sector last year , the worst labor dispute in deutsche bahn 's history .

russia might be preparing to recognize abkhazia sovereignty .
the european union opposes the move . kosovo 's declaration of independence from serbia last month gave hope to rebels who have been fighting to do the same in the region of abkhazia , which borders the black sea . since abkhazia declared independence from georgia on friday , march 7 , russia made signs that it is preparing to recognize the region 's sovereignty by lifting a formal trade embargo . " there is a growing preoccupation and anxiety that russia may be paving the way for recognition of abkhazia , " eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said monday , march 10 . she reaffirmed eu support for georgia 's borders .
abkhazia 's declaration followed a similar vote on wednesday by georgia 's other separatist region , south ossetia .
both regions cited kosovo as a precedent , calling on the international community to recognize their self-declared independence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia wants eu support georgia 's pro-western government has accused moscow of trying to destabilize the region . " georgia 's territorial integrity has always been clearly supported by the eu ... this is absolutely clear , " ferrero-waldner said . the issue was on the agenda of an eu foreign ministers meeting held in brussels monday . " we will be discussing georgia and ... what can we do in order to support more strongly georgia in a difficult situation , " ferrero-waldner said . sweden and poland had written to the eu to call for the bloc to do more to stabilize georgia ahead of planned parliamentary elections in may .
ferrero-waldner suggested the eu could make it easier to get visas and launch a trade pact . further destabilization likely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the moment , no country officially recognizes abkhazia as an independent state moscow has had an official ban on trade with abkhazia since 1996 , although georgia has accused russia of providing financial aid to rebels .
the region uses the russia ruble as its currency . no country , including russia , currently recognizes the rebel provinces ' independence claims and georgia has sworn to regain control of the areas . abkhazia and south ossetia broke away from georgia in the early 1990s .
thousands of people were killed in the conflicts and hundreds of thousands of ethnic-georgians were forced to abandon their homes . georgian politicians have said that lifting russia 's sanctions will allow moscow to freely send weapons , military equipment and russian mercenaries , further destabilizing the region . the georgian foreign ministry said russia 's move was " an extremely dangerous provocation that encourages separatism and aims to deepen tensions in the conflict zone .

" georgia is a point of concern for us , because the russian federation and the confederation of independent states decided to draw certain parallels with kosovo on this issue , " slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel told reporters after a meeting of eu foreign ministers . russia vehemently opposed kosovo 's independence from serbia .
moscow had long argued that the west 's support of kosovo independence would set a precedent for other regions of the world .
the eu always argued that kosovo was a special case . sergei bagapsh , rebel leader of abkhazia , did n't agree with the european view .
he told interfax news agency that his province has as much right to independence as kosovo . " we call on the international community to refuse double standards and recognize the independence of abkhazia and south ossetia , " bagapsh said .
" for us the situation with the recognition of kosovo is a precedent and all talk of the uniqueness of that case is not credible . " in a statement friday , the abkhaz parliament asked the united nations and individual countries to " consider the recognition of the republic of abkhazia as an independent , sovereign state . "

european union officials hope the vote will end in victory for west-leaning parties . kostunica 's government formally stepped down on monday , march 10 , and called for early elections in may after its coalition parties fell out over the issue of how to deal with the european union following the support of many eu states for kosovo 's secession . european union officials said they hoped the coming polls would benefit pro-european parties . " with the coming elections , we hope that the european forces will win , " said slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency . eu foreign ministers meeting in brussels were unanimous in calling on the people of serbia not to turn their backs on europe by supporting serbia 's nationalistic parties in the election . " europe needs serbia and serbia needs europe , " sweden 's foreign minister carl bildt said . " were serbia to sink into self-isolation , it would clearly be to the detriment of the economy -lrb- and -rrb- politics ... of serbia , but also of the entire region . " kostunica opposes eu support of kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic 's course has received support from the eu and us eu officials , who supported the re-election of serbian president boris tadic last month , were concerned last week after serbian nationalists , including kostunica , called for a parliamentary vote to stop serbia 's further integration into the eu . the resolution , which was ultimately turned down on thursday , crafted in response to many eu member states ' support for kosovo 's declaration of independence , also condemned the eu 's deployment of a peace and justice mission to help supervise the new state 's institutions . as a result , kostunica resigned saturday , opening the door for new elections , expected to take place on may 11 .
bildt , who recently returned from a visit to kosovo , said he sees the vote as " an opportunity to choose the european course more firmly than they have done before . " proposals for eu incentives " what we have to do is to show the serbian population that we want them in the european union , " said external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner . to do this , the commission offered several proposals last week for building a stronger relationship with serbia .
incentives include easier visa procedures , a doubling of scholarships and better eu-serbia transport links . the eu already has initialed , though not signed , a stabilization and association agreement with belgrade , the first step on the long road to membership in the bloc .
pro-western president tadic has insisted that despite disagreements over kosovo , belgrade has no alternative but to join the bloc as soon as possible . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russia might be preparing to recognize abkhazia sovereignty .
the european union opposes the move . kosovo 's declaration of independence from serbia last month gave hope to rebels who have been fighting to do the same in the region of abkhazia , which borders the black sea . since abkhazia declared independence from georgia on friday , march 7 , russia made signs that it is preparing to recognize the region 's sovereignty by lifting a formal trade embargo . " there is a growing preoccupation and anxiety that russia may be paving the way for recognition of abkhazia , " eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said monday , march 10 . she reaffirmed eu support for georgia 's borders .
abkhazia 's declaration followed a similar vote on wednesday by georgia 's other separatist region , south ossetia .
both regions cited kosovo as a precedent , calling on the international community to recognize their self-declared independence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia wants eu support georgia 's pro-western government has accused moscow of trying to destabilize the region . " georgia 's territorial integrity has always been clearly supported by the eu ... this is absolutely clear , " ferrero-waldner said . the issue was on the agenda of an eu foreign ministers meeting held in brussels monday . " we will be discussing georgia and ... what can we do in order to support more strongly georgia in a difficult situation , " ferrero-waldner said . sweden and poland had written to the eu to call for the bloc to do more to stabilize georgia ahead of planned parliamentary elections in may .
ferrero-waldner suggested the eu could make it easier to get visas and launch a trade pact . further destabilization likely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the moment , no country officially recognizes abkhazia as an independent state moscow has had an official ban on trade with abkhazia since 1996 , although georgia has accused russia of providing financial aid to rebels .
the region uses the russia ruble as its currency . no country , including russia , currently recognizes the rebel provinces ' independence claims and georgia has sworn to regain control of the areas . abkhazia and south ossetia broke away from georgia in the early 1990s .
thousands of people were killed in the conflicts and hundreds of thousands of ethnic-georgians were forced to abandon their homes . georgian politicians have said that lifting russia 's sanctions will allow moscow to freely send weapons , military equipment and russian mercenaries , further destabilizing the region . the georgian foreign ministry said russia 's move was " an extremely dangerous provocation that encourages separatism and aims to deepen tensions in the conflict zone . " the statement accused moscow of " trying to violate georgia 's sovereignty . " blame kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the georgian military has tried to retake control abkhazia renewed its diplomatic effort for international recognition in the weeks after kosovo 's independence . " georgia is a point of concern for us , because the russian federation and the confederation of independent states decided to draw certain parallels with kosovo on this issue , " slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel told reporters after a meeting of eu foreign ministers . russia vehemently opposed kosovo 's independence from serbia .
moscow had long argued that the west 's support of kosovo independence would set a precedent for other regions of the world .
the eu always argued that kosovo was a special case . sergei bagapsh , rebel leader of abkhazia , did n't agree with the european view .
he told interfax news agency that his province has as much right to independence as kosovo . " we call on the international community to refuse double standards and recognize the independence of abkhazia and south ossetia , " bagapsh said .

the deal signals the end of an 11-month wage fight . two days of emergency negotiations averted an open-ended strike which threatened to plunge germany into transportation chaos by halting most passenger , freight and suburban trains .
the german train drivers ' union gdl planned to have its members walk off the job first thing monday morning .
the strike would have affected half of regional passenger services in western germany and 90 percent of those in the eastern part of the country where gdl has high membership .
" it 's a good day today , and what we had planned from tonight ... will not happen , " the head of gdl , manfred schell , told reporters sunday .
collective bargaining a sticking point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german commuters wo n't be kept waiting germany 's state-owned deutsche bahn had insisted that all three union representing railway employees be part of a collective wage contract .
this angered the gdl , which had come to a separate agreement with deutsche bahn in january after months of negotiations that included several strikes .
bahn chief hartmut mehdorn said his company had agreed on terms with the gdl and its two rival unions , transnet and the gdba , which represent the bulk of the railway 's employees .
train drivers will be granted a special status " that will fit into deutsche bahn 's collective wage contract without problems , " mehdorn said .
mehdorn described the 11-month negotiations , which led to short strikes in major cities and the freight sector last year , the worst labor dispute in deutsche bahn 's history .
" we have a result which brings calm for the next few years , " mehdorn told reporters .
" i am very happy for deutsche bahn and for our clients . "
berlin strike continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was concern that a strike would hurt the german economy in berlin , a separate , ongoing wage disagreement brought local transportation services to a halt on wednesday .
there had been concerns that the gdl strike would further paralyze the city .
germany had also been faced with warning strikes from public sector employees represented by the trade union verdi .
those were put on hold friday to give arbitrators a chance to try and reach a compromise over pay and working hours .
the agreement covers some 2 million federal and local government staff .
the head of germany 's bda employers association , dieter hundt , said excessive wage deals could “ threaten the current positive development of the economy and of the labor market . "
" continued strikes could lead to a situation , where the number of unemployed will be decreasing by less than the expected 300,000 to 400,000 this year , " hundt told bild am sonntag newspaper . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

european union officials hope the vote will end in victory for west-leaning parties . kostunica 's government formally stepped down on monday , march 10 , and called for early elections in may after its coalition parties fell out over the issue of how to deal with the european union following the support of many eu states for kosovo 's secession . european union officials said they hoped the coming polls would benefit pro-european parties . " with the coming elections , we hope that the european forces will win , " said slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency . eu foreign ministers meeting in brussels were unanimous in calling on the people of serbia not to turn their backs on europe by supporting serbia 's nationalistic parties in the election . " europe needs serbia and serbia needs europe , " sweden 's foreign minister carl bildt said . " were serbia to sink into self-isolation , it would clearly be to the detriment of the economy -lrb- and -rrb- politics ... of serbia , but also of the entire region . " kostunica opposes eu support of kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic 's course has received support from the eu and us eu officials , who supported the re-election of serbian president boris tadic last month , were concerned last week after serbian nationalists , including kostunica , called for a parliamentary vote to stop serbia 's further integration into the eu . the resolution , which was ultimately turned down on thursday , crafted in response to many eu member states ' support for kosovo 's declaration of independence , also condemned the eu 's deployment of a peace and justice mission to help supervise the new state 's institutions . as a result , kostunica resigned saturday , opening the door for new elections , expected to take place on may 11 .
bildt , who recently returned from a visit to kosovo , said he sees the vote as " an opportunity to choose the european course more firmly than they have done before . " proposals for eu incentives " what we have to do is to show the serbian population that we want them in the european union , " said external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner . to do this , the commission offered several proposals last week for building a stronger relationship with serbia .
incentives include easier visa procedures , a doubling of scholarships and better eu-serbia transport links . the eu already has initialed , though not signed , a stabilization and association agreement with belgrade , the first step on the long road to membership in the bloc .
pro-western president tadic has insisted that despite disagreements over kosovo , belgrade has no alternative but to join the bloc as soon as possible . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russia might be preparing to recognize abkhazia sovereignty .
the european union opposes the move . kosovo 's declaration of independence from serbia last month gave hope to rebels who have been fighting to do the same in the region of abkhazia , which borders the black sea . since abkhazia declared independence from georgia on friday , march 7 , russia made signs that it is preparing to recognize the region 's sovereignty by lifting a formal trade embargo . " there is a growing preoccupation and anxiety that russia may be paving the way for recognition of abkhazia , " eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said monday , march 10 . she reaffirmed eu support for georgia 's borders .
abkhazia 's declaration followed a similar vote on wednesday by georgia 's other separatist region , south ossetia .
both regions cited kosovo as a precedent , calling on the international community to recognize their self-declared independence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia wants eu support georgia 's pro-western government has accused moscow of trying to destabilize the region . " georgia 's territorial integrity has always been clearly supported by the eu ... this is absolutely clear , " ferrero-waldner said . the issue was on the agenda of an eu foreign ministers meeting held in brussels monday . " we will be discussing georgia and ... what can we do in order to support more strongly georgia in a difficult situation , " ferrero-waldner said . sweden and poland had written to the eu to call for the bloc to do more to stabilize georgia ahead of planned parliamentary elections in may .
ferrero-waldner suggested the eu could make it easier to get visas and launch a trade pact . further destabilization likely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the moment , no country officially recognizes abkhazia as an independent state moscow has had an official ban on trade with abkhazia since 1996 , although georgia has accused russia of providing financial aid to rebels .
the region uses the russia ruble as its currency . no country , including russia , currently recognizes the rebel provinces ' independence claims and georgia has sworn to regain control of the areas . abkhazia and south ossetia broke away from georgia in the early 1990s .
thousands of people were killed in the conflicts and hundreds of thousands of ethnic-georgians were forced to abandon their homes . georgian politicians have said that lifting russia 's sanctions will allow moscow to freely send weapons , military equipment and russian mercenaries , further destabilizing the region . the georgian foreign ministry said russia 's move was " an extremely dangerous provocation that encourages separatism and aims to deepen tensions in the conflict zone . " the statement accused moscow of " trying to violate georgia 's sovereignty . " blame kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the georgian military has tried to retake control abkhazia renewed its diplomatic effort for international recognition in the weeks after kosovo 's independence . " georgia is a point of concern for us , because the russian federation and the confederation of independent states decided to draw certain parallels with kosovo on this issue , " slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel told reporters after a meeting of eu foreign ministers . russia vehemently opposed kosovo 's independence from serbia .
moscow had long argued that the west 's support of kosovo independence would set a precedent for other regions of the world .
the eu always argued that kosovo was a special case . sergei bagapsh , rebel leader of abkhazia , did n't agree with the european view .
he told interfax news agency that his province has as much right to independence as kosovo . " we call on the international community to refuse double standards and recognize the independence of abkhazia and south ossetia , " bagapsh said .
" for us the situation with the recognition of kosovo is a precedent and all talk of the uniqueness of that case is not credible . " in a statement friday , the abkhaz parliament asked the united nations and individual countries to " consider the recognition of the republic of abkhazia as an independent , sovereign state . "
a separate statement asked russia 's government to do the same . russia 's duma will consider abkhazia 's independence at a hearing on march 13 , the deputy chairman of its international affairs committee , leonid slutsky , told russia 's itar-tass news agency . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russia might be preparing to recognize abkhazia sovereignty .
the european union opposes the move . kosovo 's declaration of independence from serbia last month gave hope to rebels who have been fighting to do the same in the region of abkhazia , which borders the black sea . since abkhazia declared independence from georgia on friday , march 7 , russia made signs that it is preparing to recognize the region 's sovereignty by lifting a formal trade embargo . " there is a growing preoccupation and anxiety that russia may be paving the way for recognition of abkhazia , " eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said monday , march 10 . she reaffirmed eu support for georgia 's borders .
abkhazia 's declaration followed a similar vote on wednesday by georgia 's other separatist region , south ossetia .
both regions cited kosovo as a precedent , calling on the international community to recognize their self-declared independence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia wants eu support georgia 's pro-western government has accused moscow of trying to destabilize the region . " georgia 's territorial integrity has always been clearly supported by the eu ... this is absolutely clear , " ferrero-waldner said . the issue was on the agenda of an eu foreign ministers meeting held in brussels monday . " we will be discussing georgia and ... what can we do in order to support more strongly georgia in a difficult situation , " ferrero-waldner said . sweden and poland had written to the eu to call for the bloc to do more to stabilize georgia ahead of planned parliamentary elections in may .
ferrero-waldner suggested the eu could make it easier to get visas and launch a trade pact . further destabilization likely bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the moment , no country officially recognizes abkhazia as an independent state moscow has had an official ban on trade with abkhazia since 1996 , although georgia has accused russia of providing financial aid to rebels .
the region uses the russia ruble as its currency . no country , including russia , currently recognizes the rebel provinces ' independence claims and georgia has sworn to regain control of the areas . abkhazia and south ossetia broke away from georgia in the early 1990s .
thousands of people were killed in the conflicts and hundreds of thousands of ethnic-georgians were forced to abandon their homes . georgian politicians have said that lifting russia 's sanctions will allow moscow to freely send weapons , military equipment and russian mercenaries , further destabilizing the region . the georgian foreign ministry said russia 's move was " an extremely dangerous provocation that encourages separatism and aims to deepen tensions in the conflict zone . " the statement accused moscow of " trying to violate georgia 's sovereignty . " blame kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the georgian military has tried to retake control abkhazia renewed its diplomatic effort for international recognition in the weeks after kosovo 's independence . " georgia is a point of concern for us , because the russian federation and the confederation of independent states decided to draw certain parallels with kosovo on this issue , " slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel told reporters after a meeting of eu foreign ministers . russia vehemently opposed kosovo 's independence from serbia .
moscow had long argued that the west 's support of kosovo independence would set a precedent for other regions of the world .
the eu always argued that kosovo was a special case . sergei bagapsh , rebel leader of abkhazia , did n't agree with the european view .
he told interfax news agency that his province has as much right to independence as kosovo . " we call on the international community to refuse double standards and recognize the independence of abkhazia and south ossetia , " bagapsh said .
" for us the situation with the recognition of kosovo is a precedent and all talk of the uniqueness of that case is not credible . " in a statement friday , the abkhaz parliament asked the united nations and individual countries to " consider the recognition of the republic of abkhazia as an independent , sovereign state . "
a separate statement asked russia 's government to do the same . russia 's duma will consider abkhazia 's independence at a hearing on march 13 , the deputy chairman of its international affairs committee , leonid slutsky , told russia 's itar-tass news agency . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

european union officials hope the vote will end in victory for west-leaning parties . kostunica 's government formally stepped down on monday , march 10 , and called for early elections in may after its coalition parties fell out over the issue of how to deal with the european union following the support of many eu states for kosovo 's secession . european union officials said they hoped the coming polls would benefit pro-european parties . " with the coming elections , we hope that the european forces will win , " said slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency . eu foreign ministers meeting in brussels were unanimous in calling on the people of serbia not to turn their backs on europe by supporting serbia 's nationalistic parties in the election . " europe needs serbia and serbia needs europe , " sweden 's foreign minister carl bildt said . " were serbia to sink into self-isolation , it would clearly be to the detriment of the economy -lrb- and -rrb- politics ... of serbia , but also of the entire region . " kostunica opposes eu support of kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic 's course has received support from the eu and us eu officials , who supported the re-election of serbian president boris tadic last month , were concerned last week after serbian nationalists , including kostunica , called for a parliamentary vote to stop serbia 's further integration into the eu . the resolution , which was ultimately turned down on thursday , crafted in response to many eu member states ' support for kosovo 's declaration of independence , also condemned the eu 's deployment of a peace and justice mission to help supervise the new state 's institutions . as a result , kostunica resigned saturday , opening the door for new elections , expected to take place on may 11 .
bildt , who recently returned from a visit to kosovo , said he sees the vote as " an opportunity to choose the european course more firmly than they have done before . " proposals for eu incentives " what we have to do is to show the serbian population that we want them in the european union , " said external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner . to do this , the commission offered several proposals last week for building a stronger relationship with serbia .
incentives include easier visa procedures , a doubling of scholarships and better eu-serbia transport links . the eu already has initialed , though not signed , a stabilization and association agreement with belgrade , the first step on the long road to membership in the bloc .
pro-western president tadic has insisted that despite disagreements over kosovo , belgrade has no alternative but to join the bloc as soon as possible . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

european union officials hope the vote will end in victory for west-leaning parties . kostunica 's government formally stepped down on monday , march 10 , and called for early elections in may after its coalition parties fell out over the issue of how to deal with the european union following the support of many eu states for kosovo 's secession . european union officials said they hoped the coming polls would benefit pro-european parties . " with the coming elections , we hope that the european forces will win , " said slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency . eu foreign ministers meeting in brussels were unanimous in calling on the people of serbia not to turn their backs on europe by supporting serbia 's nationalistic parties in the election . " europe needs serbia and serbia needs europe , " sweden 's foreign minister carl bildt said . " were serbia to sink into self-isolation , it would clearly be to the detriment of the economy -lrb- and -rrb- politics ... of serbia , but also of the entire region . " kostunica opposes eu support of kosovo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadic 's course has received support from the eu and us eu officials , who supported the re-election of serbian president boris tadic last month , were concerned last week after serbian nationalists , including kostunica , called for a parliamentary vote to stop serbia 's further integration into the eu . the resolution , which was ultimately turned down on thursday , crafted in response to many eu member states ' support for kosovo 's declaration of independence , also condemned the eu 's deployment of a peace and justice mission to help supervise the new state 's institutions . as a result , kostunica resigned saturday , opening the door for new elections , expected to take place on may 11 .
bildt , who recently returned from a visit to kosovo , said he sees the vote as " an opportunity to choose the european course more firmly than they have done before . " proposals for eu incentives " what we have to do is to show the serbian population that we want them in the european union , " said external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner . to do this , the commission offered several proposals last week for building a stronger relationship with serbia .
incentives include easier visa procedures , a doubling of scholarships and better eu-serbia transport links . the eu already has initialed , though not signed , a stabilization and association agreement with belgrade , the first step on the long road to membership in the bloc .
pro-western president tadic has insisted that despite disagreements over kosovo , belgrade has no alternative but to join the bloc as soon as possible . dw staff -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ultimately , voters might have opted for giving prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero a second term , but his victory was by no means a resounding one .
his socialist government is now set to continue on its path with an increased tally of seats - not so much in comparison to the opposition popular party -lrb- pp -rrb- of mariano rajoy but definitely in comparison to the regional parties , which have seen their influence in spanish politics subside .
the ruling socialist workers party -lrb- psoe -rrb- might still be short of an absolute majority , but zapatero 's party does have an expanded majority with 16 more seats than the pp .
and for opposition leader mariano rajoy , it was the second time he 'd failed to lead his party to power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guenther maihold but the election reflected something of a political impasse .
divided into two , almost equally large camps , the public is unwilling to give either the socialists or the popular party a clear majority .
both parties are seemingly unable to break the deadlock - and the country will continue to be blocked by its polarization .
whether the pp will be able to relinquish its confrontational tactics and find a way back to political consensus depends largely on how open to the opposition the government is now prepared to be . dominated by domestic policy issues , the campaign pitted two diverging versions of spanish society against one another .
while the pp represents a nation based on catholic values , zapatero has always championed the diversity of modern spain , a country tolerant of its minorities and immigrants .
the catholic church backed the opposition , and will inevitably be stung by its defeat - which will result in heightened tension between the socialist government and the conservative leader of the spanish bishops ' conference cardinal rouco varela .
the role of the church is , after all , a central conflict within spanish society - and looks set to remain so . the spanish economy , meanwhile , has not been immune to the current turbulence on the international financial markets and growth has fallen off .
regaining economic stability will therefore be a key task for zapatero 's government .
it will also have to demonstrate resolve in its dealings with the basque separatist group eta , while keeping peace talks firmly on the agenda . on the international stage , spain will remain a known quantity .

the wwf blamed the deaths on lack of ice covering , which has lured seal pups into the water too early . a warm winter is wreaking havoc on the young seal population in the baltic sea north of germany with the international conservation organization wwf fearing that between 300 and 400 pups have died . " the situation is dire .
in some regions perhaps not a single one of the pups born in recent weeks will survive , " wwf baltic spokeswoman cathrin muenster said on monday , march 10 . lack of ice cover has been blamed for the deaths .
seal pups are going into the water too early where they " starve and die a painful death from the cold , " muenster added . because of the lack of ice , some seal mothers had given birth on small islands or on the mainland , where predators will likely kill the pups , said antti hallka , a seal expert with wwf finland said . seal population had been recovering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warmer weather might be good for swimmers , but not for seals the ringed seal is an earless seal found in northern waters all round the world .
the baltic subspecies , which numbers between 7,000 and 10,000 , is red-listed by the world conservation union as endangered . there are estimated to have been 180,000 ringed seals in the baltic in 1900 .
the population was severely reduced by hunting and pollution , but began to recover in the 1980s . now global warming is posing a new threat . the baltic sea has experienced of one of the warmest winters in almost 300 years , which scientists say is part of a general warming trend that could increase surface water temperatures 2 degrees celsius to 4 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degree fahrenheit to 7.2 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- by 2100 .
this degree of warming would cut the ice cover nearly in half . the seals required 90 days of ice covering to breed successfully , but indications were that by the end of the century the southern range of the seals ' breeding grounds would see its ice covering cut to as little as 18 days , the wwf said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

beck attempted to refocus his party , which has been in disarray in recent weeks . there have been calls for beck 's resignation in recent weeks as the spd has floundered in a political quagmire in the western german state of hesse .
the spd has been in an uproar over the decision to rely on the left party in order to form a government in the region . andrea ypsilanti , the spd candidate for hesse 's top post , broke a pre-election pledge not to make any kind of political deal with the left party , which is made up of former communists and far-left former spd members .
her about face has enraged some spd members . beck , who has been out with the flu for two weeks , attempted to downplay the divisions in the spd and said he would not quit on monday , march 10 .
beck also denied that he had broken his word by agreeing to tolerate deals with the left at a state level . " parties must be able to adjust to new situations , " beck said .
" i do n't think they lose their credibility by doing that . " left seen as adversary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left is making inroads in western germany beck did concede monday that the spd 's attempt to stifle the rise of the new left party has failed .
beck said that while he will tolerate partnerships at the local level , he will not involve the party in a future national government . " the left is an adversarial party and that is how it will stay , " beck said . beck cited " irreconcilable differences " between the spd and left in financial , social and foreign policy . currently , the spd is the junior coalition partner of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
the " grand coalition " has left the spd with a bit of an identity crisis as approval ratings continue a downward slide . a dimap infratest poll showed beck would get 20 percent of german votes if the election were held today , compared with more than 60 percent for merkel . some spd members still angry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd has been looking for new partners beck has gotten support from some senior party members .
but others want him to resign and let someone else take on merkel in the general elections next year . " to my mind , his candidacy for the chancellorship is out of the question as he will not get over the credibility crisis , " the spd 's gerd andres told the hannoversche allgemeine zeitung newspaper . der spiegel newsmagazine quoted finance minister peer steinbrueck as saying the spd had handed the next election to the cdu . oskar niedermayer , a political scientist at berlin 's free university , said beck 's press conference monday was attempting a " damage control exercise . " niedermayer predicted merkel 's cdu will revive the issue of beck ’ s credibility ahead of the next federal elections , which must be held by september 2009 . when asked monday if he had lost his authority over the spd , beck said : " the only thing i have lost in the last two weeks is 5 or 6 kilos . " looking for a way forward in hesse bildunterschrift : andrea ypsilanti has been making headlines on sunday , beck had suggested during crisis talks with party leadership about the hesse situation that ypsilanti withdraw .
but ypsilanti beat him to the punch by confirming monday that she would be shelving her candidacy . events took a dramatic turn friday when dagmar metzger , one of the spd 's members of the state legislature , said she would not play along with ypsilanti 's moves to do a deal with the left party . over the weekend , ypsilanti 's supporters put pressure on metzger , calling on her to rethink her decision or resign from parliament and allow a replacement legislator to vote for the party leader as premier . beck said monday he would not pressure metzger to resign . the lure of the left bildunterschrift : who will govern hesse ?
spd officials , however , are not ruling out that ypsilanti , a member of the party 's left-wing , might have another shot at the premiership in may . ypsilanti 's tactics have opened up a debate in spd on the future course of the party after gains by the left in recent state elections ploughed up the german political field , forcing the main parties to seek arrangements with smaller parties they had previously kept at arm 's length . ypsilanti is dependent on the support of the left to become premier after her party secured 42 seats in the 110-seat state legislature in jan .
27 elections , level with the christian democrats , led by incumbent premier roland koch . with the free democrats , the cdu 's preferred partner , securing 11 seats and the greens nine , neither of the main blocs could form a majority government .

beck attempted to refocus his party , which has been in disarray in recent weeks . there have been calls for beck 's resignation in recent weeks as the spd has floundered in a political quagmire in the western german state of hesse .
the spd has been in an uproar over the decision to rely on the left party in order to form a government in the region . andrea ypsilanti , the spd candidate for hesse 's top post , broke a pre-election pledge not to make any kind of political deal with the left party , which is made up of former communists and far-left former spd members .
her about face has enraged some spd members . beck , who has been out with the flu for two weeks , attempted to downplay the divisions in the spd and said he would not quit on monday , march 10 .
beck also denied that he had broken his word by agreeing to tolerate deals with the left at a state level . " parties must be able to adjust to new situations , " beck said .
" i do n't think they lose their credibility by doing that . " left seen as adversary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left is making inroads in western germany beck did concede monday that the spd 's attempt to stifle the rise of the new left party has failed .
beck said that while he will tolerate partnerships at the local level , he will not involve the party in a future national government . " the left is an adversarial party and that is how it will stay , " beck said . beck cited " irreconcilable differences " between the spd and left in financial , social and foreign policy . currently , the spd is the junior coalition partner of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- .
the " grand coalition " has left the spd with a bit of an identity crisis as approval ratings continue a downward slide . a dimap infratest poll showed beck would get 20 percent of german votes if the election were held today , compared with more than 60 percent for merkel . some spd members still angry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd has been looking for new partners beck has gotten support from some senior party members .
but others want him to resign and let someone else take on merkel in the general elections next year . " to my mind , his candidacy for the chancellorship is out of the question as he will not get over the credibility crisis , " the spd 's gerd andres told the hannoversche allgemeine zeitung newspaper . der spiegel newsmagazine quoted finance minister peer steinbrueck as saying the spd had handed the next election to the cdu . oskar niedermayer , a political scientist at berlin 's free university , said beck 's press conference monday was attempting a " damage control exercise . " niedermayer predicted merkel 's cdu will revive the issue of beck ’ s credibility ahead of the next federal elections , which must be held by september 2009 . when asked monday if he had lost his authority over the spd , beck said : " the only thing i have lost in the last two weeks is 5 or 6 kilos . " looking for a way forward in hesse bildunterschrift : andrea ypsilanti has been making headlines on sunday , beck had suggested during crisis talks with party leadership about the hesse situation that ypsilanti withdraw .
but ypsilanti beat him to the punch by confirming monday that she would be shelving her candidacy . events took a dramatic turn friday when dagmar metzger , one of the spd 's members of the state legislature , said she would not play along with ypsilanti 's moves to do a deal with the left party . over the weekend , ypsilanti 's supporters put pressure on metzger , calling on her to rethink her decision or resign from parliament and allow a replacement legislator to vote for the party leader as premier . beck said monday he would not pressure metzger to resign . the lure of the left bildunterschrift : who will govern hesse ?
spd officials , however , are not ruling out that ypsilanti , a member of the party 's left-wing , might have another shot at the premiership in may . ypsilanti 's tactics have opened up a debate in spd on the future course of the party after gains by the left in recent state elections ploughed up the german political field , forcing the main parties to seek arrangements with smaller parties they had previously kept at arm 's length . ypsilanti is dependent on the support of the left to become premier after her party secured 42 seats in the 110-seat state legislature in jan .
27 elections , level with the christian democrats , led by incumbent premier roland koch . with the free democrats , the cdu 's preferred partner , securing 11 seats and the greens nine , neither of the main blocs could form a majority government .

the deal signals the end of an 11-month wage fight . two days of emergency negotiations averted an open-ended strike which threatened to plunge germany into transportation chaos by halting most passenger , freight and suburban trains .
the german train drivers ' union gdl planned to have its members walk off the job first thing monday morning .
the strike would have affected half of regional passenger services in western germany and 90 percent of those in the eastern part of the country where gdl has high membership .
" it 's a good day today , and what we had planned from tonight ... will not happen , " the head of gdl , manfred schell , told reporters sunday .
collective bargaining a sticking point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german commuters wo n't be kept waiting germany 's state-owned deutsche bahn had insisted that all three union representing railway employees be part of a collective wage contract .
this angered the gdl , which had come to a separate agreement with deutsche bahn in january after months of negotiations that included several strikes .
bahn chief hartmut mehdorn said his company had agreed on terms with the gdl and its two rival unions , transnet and the gdba , which represent the bulk of the railway 's employees .
train drivers will be granted a special status " that will fit into deutsche bahn 's collective wage contract without problems , " mehdorn said .
mehdorn described the 11-month negotiations , which led to short strikes in major cities and the freight sector last year , the worst labor dispute in deutsche bahn 's history .
" we have a result which brings calm for the next few years , " mehdorn told reporters .
" i am very happy for deutsche bahn and for our clients . "
berlin strike continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was concern that a strike would hurt the german economy in berlin , a separate , ongoing wage disagreement brought local transportation services to a halt on wednesday .
there had been concerns that the gdl strike would further paralyze the city .
germany had also been faced with warning strikes from public sector employees represented by the trade union verdi .
those were put on hold friday to give arbitrators a chance to try and reach a compromise over pay and working hours .
the agreement covers some 2 million federal and local government staff .
the head of germany 's bda employers association , dieter hundt , said excessive wage deals could “ threaten the current positive development of the economy and of the labor market . "
" continued strikes could lead to a situation , where the number of unemployed will be decreasing by less than the expected 300,000 to 400,000 this year , " hundt told bild am sonntag newspaper . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the deal signals the end of an 11-month wage fight . two days of emergency negotiations averted an open-ended strike which threatened to plunge germany into transportation chaos by halting most passenger , freight and suburban trains .
the german train drivers ' union gdl planned to have its members walk off the job first thing monday morning .
the strike would have affected half of regional passenger services in western germany and 90 percent of those in the eastern part of the country where gdl has high membership .
" it 's a good day today , and what we had planned from tonight ... will not happen , " the head of gdl , manfred schell , told reporters sunday .
collective bargaining a sticking point bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german commuters wo n't be kept waiting germany 's state-owned deutsche bahn had insisted that all three union representing railway employees be part of a collective wage contract .
this angered the gdl , which had come to a separate agreement with deutsche bahn in january after months of negotiations that included several strikes .
bahn chief hartmut mehdorn said his company had agreed on terms with the gdl and its two rival unions , transnet and the gdba , which represent the bulk of the railway 's employees .
train drivers will be granted a special status " that will fit into deutsche bahn 's collective wage contract without problems , " mehdorn said .
mehdorn described the 11-month negotiations , which led to short strikes in major cities and the freight sector last year , the worst labor dispute in deutsche bahn 's history .
" we have a result which brings calm for the next few years , " mehdorn told reporters .
" i am very happy for deutsche bahn and for our clients . "
berlin strike continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there was concern that a strike would hurt the german economy in berlin , a separate , ongoing wage disagreement brought local transportation services to a halt on wednesday .
there had been concerns that the gdl strike would further paralyze the city .
germany had also been faced with warning strikes from public sector employees represented by the trade union verdi .
those were put on hold friday to give arbitrators a chance to try and reach a compromise over pay and working hours .
the agreement covers some 2 million federal and local government staff .
the head of germany 's bda employers association , dieter hundt , said excessive wage deals could “ threaten the current positive development of the economy and of the labor market . "
" continued strikes could lead to a situation , where the number of unemployed will be decreasing by less than the expected 300,000 to 400,000 this year , " hundt told bild am sonntag newspaper . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but they ended up drawing lines in the sand instead . there 's always going to be trouble in paradise .
despite the glorious trappings , passengers on board p & o 's 77,000-ton oceana liner were getting royally fed up with the lack of available deck chairs , accusing certain errant holidaymakers of using towels , books and bags to reserve places . in the british mind , this could mean one thing , and one thing only : germans were at work , seeking as ever to expand their lebensraum . brilliantly witty - or culturally backward ? over in merry old england , the deck chair prejudice is a cultural stereotype that simply refuses to die .
it might mean nothing to germans themselves , but it 's embedded in mainstream british culture , and there it will remain , a source of much unreconstructed hilarity . several years ago , for example , the spitfire beer company ran an advertisement with the slogan " have the sunbeds , we 're off to the bar . "
not long after , another british beer brand , carling black label , launched a similar ad featuring an english bloke on holiday foiling germans trying to steal the deck chairs early in the morning . so perhaps captain christopher wells can be forgiven for making the obvious reference when he used the ship loudspeaker to tell passengers in no uncertain terms not to reserve loungers .
and as a sailor , he 's allowed to have a colorful turn of phrase . " we do n't want that kind of germanic behavior here ! " he joked . but not all the passengers were amused . " captain wells apologizes unreservedly for any offence caused , " said a spokesman for p & o , but it was too late . the captain now faces an inquiry by the equality and human rights commission over whether his remarks were racist . bed-bagging bildunterschrift : bed bagging never happened on the " the love boat " one female passenger said the crew had tried unsuccessfully to stop the " bed bagging . " " there were enough loungers for everyone , provided they were not reserved when not in use , " she told british daily the telegraph .
" crew members did their best , sometimes removing the towels , but then passengers reserved the sun beds with their own items . " initially , the captain tried allowing passengers to reclaim chairs which had remained unused for 20 minutes . however , that only led to more confrontation when some holidaymakers used stopwatches to monitor occupancy .
so much for a relaxing holiday in the sun . " this led to heated arguments and complaints - some people nearly came to blows , " said the anonymous female passenger . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

scotland 's defeat of england in the six nations rugby union championship was relayed to a london cinema audience .
the project was carried out with production group , the 3d firm .
bbc news website video journalists andrew webb -lrb- edinburgh -rrb- and john galliver -lrb- london -rrb- were at both ends of the transmission .

water carriers will ' kill us ' 3 .
' resist the urge ' 2 .
rain almost spoils the fun 1 .
preparation : water carriers will ' kill us ' building the 3d broadcast system in murrayfield it was a doom-laden prediction : " the water carriers are gonna kill us . "
director rhys edwards made the dire warning moments after meeting the cameramen who were to film the historic event .
his fear was that people would walk too close to pitch-level cameras .
he had only three camera rigs at his disposal - a far cry from the 10 or more he is used to flicking between .
but this was an attempt to give 200 industry insiders the experience of sitting at murrayfield - not a chance to come face to face with jonny wilkinson or chris paterson .
return to list 2 .
broadcast : rain almost spoils the fun last minute scramble to keep the cameras dry scotland , as we all know , gets its fair share of rain .
so it was of little surprise that torrential downpours led to a rapid rethink of the best-laid plans .
two of the three camera rigs had been positioned in the open .
but if any raindrops hit the lenses , the 3d effect would disintegrate .
evasive action was called for .
return to list 3 .
viewers : ' resist the urge ' the cinema viewers ' verdicts of the 3d spectacle the makeshift cinema was packed with tech-heads and journalists and there were certainly a few sceptics in the crowd .
up until this point , for me , 3d has meant just one thing - an exploding shark at the end of jaws 3d .
would my mind be changed ?
glasses on , the broadcast started and it was immediately apparent that this was going to be good .
one of the first shots of the crowd showed a fan waving a large flag back and forth .
it seemed to come right into the room and i had to resist the urge to reach out and touch it .
once the action kicked off , the experience was totally immersive .
scrums appeared to be just feet away , while the sense of depth within the crowds in the background took you right into the stadium .
however , the 3 cameras covering the match felt limiting after a while .
sports fans might also have missed the instant replays and on-screen match statistics we are used to in tv sports coverage .
these are minor grumbles .
as one of my fellow audience members put it , this was n't like watching tv , it was like being at the match .
and you know what , it really was .

scotland 's defeat of england in the six nations rugby union championship was relayed to a london cinema audience .
the project was carried out with production group , the 3d firm .
bbc news website video journalists andrew webb -lrb- edinburgh -rrb- and john galliver -lrb- london -rrb- were at both ends of the transmission .

water carriers will ' kill us ' 3 .
' resist the urge ' 2 .
rain almost spoils the fun 1 .
preparation : water carriers will ' kill us ' building the 3d broadcast system in murrayfield it was a doom-laden prediction : " the water carriers are gonna kill us . "
director rhys edwards made the dire warning moments after meeting the cameramen who were to film the historic event .
his fear was that people would walk too close to pitch-level cameras .
he had only three camera rigs at his disposal - a far cry from the 10 or more he is used to flicking between .
but this was an attempt to give 200 industry insiders the experience of sitting at murrayfield - not a chance to come face to face with jonny wilkinson or chris paterson .
return to list 2 .
broadcast : rain almost spoils the fun last minute scramble to keep the cameras dry scotland , as we all know , gets its fair share of rain .
so it was of little surprise that torrential downpours led to a rapid rethink of the best-laid plans .
two of the three camera rigs had been positioned in the open .
but if any raindrops hit the lenses , the 3d effect would disintegrate .
evasive action was called for .
return to list 3 .
viewers : ' resist the urge ' the cinema viewers ' verdicts of the 3d spectacle the makeshift cinema was packed with tech-heads and journalists and there were certainly a few sceptics in the crowd .
up until this point , for me , 3d has meant just one thing - an exploding shark at the end of jaws 3d .
would my mind be changed ?
glasses on , the broadcast started and it was immediately apparent that this was going to be good .
one of the first shots of the crowd showed a fan waving a large flag back and forth .
it seemed to come right into the room and i had to resist the urge to reach out and touch it .
once the action kicked off , the experience was totally immersive .
scrums appeared to be just feet away , while the sense of depth within the crowds in the background took you right into the stadium .
however , the 3 cameras covering the match felt limiting after a while .
sports fans might also have missed the instant replays and on-screen match statistics we are used to in tv sports coverage .
these are minor grumbles .
as one of my fellow audience members put it , this was n't like watching tv , it was like being at the match .
and you know what , it really was .

scotland 's defeat of england in the six nations rugby union championship was relayed to a london cinema audience .
the project was carried out with production group , the 3d firm .
bbc news website video journalists andrew webb -lrb- edinburgh -rrb- and john galliver -lrb- london -rrb- were at both ends of the transmission .

rain almost spoils the fun 1 .
preparation : water carriers will ' kill us ' building the 3d broadcast system in murrayfield it was a doom-laden prediction : " the water carriers are gonna kill us . "
director rhys edwards made the dire warning moments after meeting the cameramen who were to film the historic event .
his fear was that people would walk too close to pitch-level cameras .
he had only three camera rigs at his disposal - a far cry from the 10 or more he is used to flicking between .
but this was an attempt to give 200 industry insiders the experience of sitting at murrayfield - not a chance to come face to face with jonny wilkinson or chris paterson .

broadcast : rain almost spoils the fun last minute scramble to keep the cameras dry scotland , as we all know , gets its fair share of rain .
so it was of little surprise that torrential downpours led to a rapid rethink of the best-laid plans .
two of the three camera rigs had been positioned in the open .
but if any raindrops hit the lenses , the 3d effect would disintegrate .
evasive action was called for .

viewers : ' resist the urge ' the cinema viewers ' verdicts of the 3d spectacle the makeshift cinema was packed with tech-heads and journalists and there were certainly a few sceptics in the crowd .
up until this point , for me , 3d has meant just one thing - an exploding shark at the end of jaws 3d .
would my mind be changed ?
glasses on , the broadcast started and it was immediately apparent that this was going to be good .
one of the first shots of the crowd showed a fan waving a large flag back and forth .
it seemed to come right into the room and i had to resist the urge to reach out and touch it .
once the action kicked off , the experience was totally immersive .
scrums appeared to be just feet away , while the sense of depth within the crowds in the background took you right into the stadium .
however , the 3 cameras covering the match felt limiting after a while .
sports fans might also have missed the instant replays and on-screen match statistics we are used to in tv sports coverage .
these are minor grumbles .
as one of my fellow audience members put it , this was n't like watching tv , it was like being at the match .
and you know what , it really was .

china exported $ 8.6bn -lrb- £ 4.3bn -rrb- more than it imported last month , down from $ 23.7bn in february last year , according to government figures .
but economists warned that february data are very sensitive to the timing of china 's lunar new year celebrations .
there was more concern that factory gate prices had risen 6.6 % in the year to february .
factory gate prices measure the amount that manufacturers are paid for their products and is a key indicator of consumer inflation to come .
premier wen jiabao told parliament last week that the battle against inflation is his top economic priority for the year .
" virtually everything is on the rise - not just fuel , but coal and iron ore , " said jun ma , chief china economist at deutsche bank in hong kong .
" all these things are growing much stronger than fuel , plus labour costs are going up too . "
consumer prices figures are due out on tuesday .

but as he delivers his first budget this week , at least he can take solace in the knowledge that he is not the first chancellor to face a tough political battle or a tottering economy .
philip snowdon : 1924 & 1929-1931 philip snowdon was the first labour chancellor and his 1931 budget took place in the midst of the great depression .
taxes were raised and unemployment benefits and the salaries of government employees were slashed - the latter leading to the invergordon naval mutiny , and demonstrations by teachers and others .
this led to the formation of the national government after some labour cabinet ministers resigned .
these measures were designed to end the financial crisis and keep the pound sterling on the gold standard ; however a week or so later britain left the gold standard and devalued the pound .
hugh dalton : 1945-1947 for weeks the media has been awash with details of what is likely to appear in the chancellor 's 2008 budget - though what mr darling will actually reveal is supposed to be a closely guarded secret .
so spare a thought for hugh dalton who resigned as labour 's chancellor after it emerged that he had inadvertently divulged his plans to a lobby journalist on the eve of his 1947 budget statement .
the news appeared in the star newspaper on the morning of the budget , leaving dalton with no alternative but to apologise to the house and resign .
anthony barber : 1970-1974 anthony barber delivered the first budget of the new conservative government in 1971 , which announced the introduction of value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , to come into play from 1973 .
by 1972 , the economy was dominated by industrial unrest and stagflation - a combination of inflation and slow growth - which until this point , most economists had thought was unlikely .
barber 's budget of that year saw large tax cuts to deal with rising unemployment but led to high inflation , which prompted efforts to rein it in .
the 1973 oil crisis added to price woes , and prompted added turmoil among workers such as miners - militancy which led to a miners strike and the three-day week .
when ted heath called an election in 1974 , the labour government won out .
denis healey : 1974-1979 during denis healey 's time at 11 downing street , britain asked the international monetary fund for a £ 2.3bn bail out - saying unemployment and inflation were at exceptional levels .
the handout meant that the country was subject to imf supervision and the imposition of budget cuts .
in 1976 at the labour party conference , mr healey was called upon to stem a revolt over economic policies .
he agreed , leaving heathrow airport from where he was due to travel to the us to meet the imf , and instead flying back to blackpool .
the then labour party chairman tom bradley , who had urged healey to return later recalled : " when denis arrived i called his name to come up to the platform and they booed and hissed him all the way to the microphone . "
healey later had freeze on public spending and tried to introduce a national pay deal which , opposed by the unions , backfired and led to the winter of discontent in 1978-79 .
despite his tough times , many labour party members referred to him as " the best prime minister we never had " .
norman lamont : 1990-1993 having hiked vat from 15 % to 17.5 % in 1991 to reduce the controversial poll tax or community charge by about £ 140 , - the leader of the opposition , neil kinnock , described mr lamont 's actions as the " biggest climb-down in modern political history " .
but easily his most humbling act came in 1992 when , having insisted that he would not have to withdraw the pound from the european exchange rate mechanism -lrb- erm -rrb- , he did just that only a week later on black wednesday .
one of his political advisers at about this time was a certain david cameron .
after the recession struck in 1992 , mr lamont later said that " the green shoots of recovery " could be seen all around - though few such signs ever materialised .
he left office with a huge budget deficit , which grew further under his successor , and was inherited by labour when they took power in 1997 .
alistair darling : 2007-present mr darling has a cat called sybil - reportedly named after the long-suffering wife of the even-longer-suffering hotelier in the tv sitcom fawlty towers .
but it hard to imagine even poor basil enduring a series of calamities on the scale of those which have befallen the chancellor since he came to office in late june last year .
gordon brown , it seems , got out just in time before a string of unfortunate events struck the treasury .
mr darling has been unfortunate to be in charge of the purse strings during the sub-prime mortgage crisis - which has savaged global markets .
the liquidity crisis which ensued prompted the woes at northern rock - which suffered the first run on a british bank in almost 150 years resulting in it being propped up by taxpayer money .
and last month , after much uncertainty , the chancellor decided to take the beleaguered lender into temporary public ownership - the first uk nationalisation since the 1970s .
also on mr darling 's watch came the child benefit data scandal - when the confidential details of about 25 million people seemingly went missing after computer discs were lost .
and he appears not to have appreciated the upshot of some of his own actions - changes to capital gains tax and the tax regime for non-doms - both of which have been seen as reactions to apparently popular tory policies .
the chancellor will be hoping that this budget proves to be a turning point .

but as he delivers his first budget this week , at least he can take solace in the knowledge that he is not the first chancellor to face a tough political battle or a tottering economy .
philip snowdon : 1924 & 1929-1931 philip snowdon was the first labour chancellor philip snowdon was the first labour chancellor and his 1931 budget took place in the midst of the great depression .
taxes were raised and unemployment benefits and the salaries of government employees were slashed - the latter leading to the invergordon naval mutiny , and demonstrations by teachers and others .
this led to the formation of the national government after some labour cabinet ministers resigned .
these measures were designed to end the financial crisis and keep the pound sterling on the gold standard ; however a week or so later britain left the gold standard and devalued the pound .
hugh dalton : 1945-1947 mr dalton 's indiscretion cost him his job for weeks the media has been awash with details of what is likely to appear in the chancellor 's 2008 budget - though what mr darling will actually reveal is supposed to be a closely guarded secret .
so spare a thought for hugh dalton who resigned as labour 's chancellor after it emerged that he had inadvertently divulged his plans to a lobby journalist on the eve of his 1947 budget statement .
the news appeared in the star newspaper on the morning of the budget , leaving dalton with no alternative but to apologise to the house and resign .
anthony barber : 1970-1974 anthony barber was not helped by the 1973 oil crisis anthony barber delivered the first budget of the new conservative government in 1971 , which announced the introduction of value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , to come into play from 1973 .
by 1972 , the economy was dominated by industrial unrest and stagflation - a combination of inflation and slow growth - which until this point , most economists had thought was unlikely .
barber 's budget of that year saw large tax cuts to deal with rising unemployment but led to high inflation , which prompted efforts to rein it in .
the 1973 oil crisis added to price woes , and prompted added turmoil among workers such as miners - militancy which led to a miners strike and the three-day week .
when ted heath called an election in 1974 , the labour government won out .
denis healey : 1974-1979 denis healey 's policies often split the labour party during denis healey 's time at 11 downing street , britain asked the international monetary fund for a £ 2.3bn bail out - saying unemployment and inflation were at exceptional levels .
the handout meant that the country was subject to imf supervision and the imposition of budget cuts .
in 1976 at the labour party conference , mr healey was called upon to stem a revolt over economic policies .
he agreed , leaving heathrow airport from where he was due to travel to the us to meet the imf , and instead flying back to blackpool .
the then labour party chairman tom bradley , who had urged healey to return later recalled : " when denis arrived i called his name to come up to the platform and they booed and hissed him all the way to the microphone . "
healey later had freeze on public spending and tried to introduce a national pay deal which , opposed by the unions , backfired and led to the winter of discontent in 1978-79 .
despite his tough times , many labour party members referred to him as " the best prime minister we never had " .
norman lamont : 1990-1993 mr lamont talked of " green shoots of recovery " which did not materialise having hiked vat from 15 % to 17.5 % in 1991 to reduce the controversial poll tax or community charge by about £ 140 , - the leader of the opposition , neil kinnock , described mr lamont 's actions as the " biggest climb-down in modern political history " .
but easily his most humbling act came in 1992 when , having insisted that he would not have to withdraw the pound from the european exchange rate mechanism -lrb- erm -rrb- , he did just that only a week later on black wednesday .
one of his political advisers at about this time was a certain david cameron .
after the recession struck in 1992 , mr lamont later said that " the green shoots of recovery " could be seen all around - though few such signs ever materialised .
he left office with a huge budget deficit , which grew further under his successor , and was inherited by labour when they took power in 1997 .
alistair darling : 2007-present mr darling has become chancellor at a difficult time mr darling has a cat called sybil - reportedly named after the long-suffering wife of the even-longer-suffering hotelier in the tv sitcom fawlty towers .
but it hard to imagine even poor basil enduring a series of calamities on the scale of those which have befallen the chancellor since he came to office in late june last year .
gordon brown , it seems , got out just in time before a string of unfortunate events struck the treasury .
mr darling has been unfortunate to be in charge of the purse strings during the sub-prime mortgage crisis - which has savaged global markets .
the liquidity crisis which ensued prompted the woes at northern rock - which suffered the first run on a british bank in almost 150 years resulting in it being propped up by taxpayer money .
and last month , after much uncertainty , the chancellor decided to take the beleaguered lender into temporary public ownership - the first uk nationalisation since the 1970s .

dutch amateur archaeologist jan meulmeester found the 100,000-year-old hand axes in gravel dredged from eight miles -lrb- 13km -rrb- off great yarmouth .
bones and teeth were also found along with the 28 axes .
man used to roam the area now covered by the north sea using flint tools to butcher animals such as mammoths .
" massively important " the axes date to the palaeolithic -lrb- or old stone age -rrb- era .
experts said the discovery offered rare evidence of life before the north sea existed .
phil harding , of wessex archaeology and channel 4 's time team , described the findings as " massively important " .
the hand-axes would have been used by hunters in butchering the carcasses of animals like mammoths phil harding " although we do n't know their precise date , we can say that these hand-axes are the single most important find of ice age material from below the north sea , " he said .

they were named " ones to watch " on several critical lists , including the bbc 's sound of 2008 poll , but the band nearly ended before they began .
" we got signed at a point where we had n't really talked to each other for the last six months , " confesses lead singer and guitarist andrew vanwyngarden .
" we had never thought of mgmt as a real band .
we did n't even have a live act . "
the group began at connecticut 's wesleyan university , where vanwyngarden met keyboard player and co-vocalist ben goldwasser in 2002 .
the pair constructed an eccentric live show that was part art project , part musical experiment .
concerts consisted of karaoke-style performances , where they would sing over a pre-recorded backing track played from a laptop .
myth-making " that was the first year of the band , " explains vanwyngarden .
" we did n't have any real songs , so we would just make something up and play it for everybody . "
eventually , mgmt began to delve deeper into their laptop , creating songs that were " a little more structured " . "
the songwriting sessions for this album was the first time we ever took it seriously " ben goldwasser " they actually had lyrics and that kind of thing , " vanwyngarden laughs .
there is a certain degree of understatement and myth behind the band 's origins .
as obnoxious as they claim to have been , they built up a cult following - recording an ep in 2005 and touring with off-kilter pop combo of montreal .
one fan - " a friend of a friend " , according to vanwyngarden - passed the ep to a talent scout at columbia records , who contacted the band by e-mail to offer them a recording contract .
within months , the band were holed up in a studio with flaming lips producer dave fridmann concocting their heady mix of squiggly synths , euphoric melodies and shimmering , ghostly harmonies .
" the songwriting sessions for this album were the first time we ever took it seriously , " admits goldwasser .
" when we used to write songs in college , we 'd think ' how can we make this sound like a real song , " ' adds vanwyngarden .
reviewers have responded positively to their experiments .
rolling stone magazine called oracular spectacular an " intergalactic odyssey " , while the nme gushed " you 'll be hard-pressed to find a record with more musical depth and warmth this year " .
rock fantasy the track that has attracted the most attention so far is the lead single , time to pretend .
originally the title track of their debut ep , it has been given a fresh coat of paint and transformed into an off-the-wall pop epic . "
we 'd like to make our shows more theatrical " ben goldwasser its lyrics reveal a vision of rock star excess : " let 's make some music , make some money , find some models for wives ...
we 'll choke on our vomit and that will be the end . "
do the band plan to turn this into reality now that they 're on the cusp of musical success ?
" hopefully not all of them , " laughs vanwyngarden .
" probably the most rock and roll thing i could do right now is start drinking , forget all my lyrics and smash my guitar on the drums . "
" we have n't considered putting on kiss make-up yet , " adds goldwasser .
" but we 'd like to make our shows more theatrical . "
" yes , " his bandmate agrees .
" right now they 're pretty boring .
we 're not very exciting in real life . "
some reviewers have been less than kind about their embryonic live act .
' little bubble ' music website popjustice described mgmt 's concert as the " impressive sight of several men taking a very listenable album and , via the magic of live musicianship , making it seem terrible " .
perhaps it 's a good thing that the band do n't read their own press .
" if they say something bad you just take it to heart , " admits vanwyngarden .
but their fans are more forgiving than the critics , packing out a series of uk shows before mgmt 's album was even released .
" it was surprising to see how many people had actually heard about us , " says goldwasser .
" it 's especially weird because we were locked up in the studio for a while , just kind of messing around in brooklyn and playing music in a little bubble .
" then we came over here and everyone 's talking about us .
it 's kind of crazy . "
oracular spectacular is out now .

" we got signed at a point where we had n't really talked to each other for the last six months , " confesses lead singer and guitarist andrew vanwyngarden .
" we had never thought of mgmt as a real band .
we did n't even have a live act . "
the group began at connecticut 's wesleyan university , where vanwyngarden met keyboard player and co-vocalist ben goldwasser in 2002 .
the pair constructed an eccentric live show that was part art project , part musical experiment .
concerts consisted of karaoke-style performances , where they would sing over a pre-recorded backing track played from a laptop .
myth-making " that was the first year of the band , " explains vanwyngarden .
" we did n't have any real songs , so we would just make something up and play it for everybody . "
eventually , mgmt began to delve deeper into their laptop , creating songs that were " a little more structured " .
the songwriting sessions for this album was the first time we ever took it seriously ben goldwasser " they actually had lyrics and that kind of thing , " vanwyngarden laughs .
there is a certain degree of understatement and myth behind the band 's origins .
as obnoxious as they claim to have been , they built up a cult following - recording an ep in 2005 and touring with off-kilter pop combo of montreal .
one fan - " a friend of a friend " , according to vanwyngarden - passed the ep to a talent scout at columbia records , who contacted the band by e-mail to offer them a recording contract .
within months , the band were holed up in a studio with flaming lips producer dave fridmann concocting their heady mix of squiggly synths , euphoric melodies and shimmering , ghostly harmonies .
the group eschew jeans and t-shirts for flamboyant stage costumes " the songwriting sessions for this album were the first time we ever took it seriously , " admits goldwasser .
" when we used to write songs in college , we 'd think ' how can we make this sound like a real song , " ' adds vanwyngarden .
reviewers have responded positively to their experiments .
rolling stone magazine called oracular spectacular an " intergalactic odyssey " , while the nme gushed " you 'll be hard-pressed to find a record with more musical depth and warmth this year " .
rock fantasy the track that has attracted the most attention so far is the lead single , time to pretend .
originally the title track of their debut ep , it has been given a fresh coat of paint and transformed into an off-the-wall pop epic .
we 'd like to make our shows more theatrical ben goldwasser its lyrics reveal a vision of rock star excess : " let 's make some music , make some money , find some models for wives ...
we 'll choke on our vomit and that will be the end . "
do the band plan to turn this into reality now that they 're on the cusp of musical success ?
" hopefully not all of them , " laughs vanwyngarden .
" probably the most rock and roll thing i could do right now is start drinking , forget all my lyrics and smash my guitar on the drums . "
" we have n't considered putting on kiss make-up yet , " adds goldwasser .
" but we 'd like to make our shows more theatrical . "
" yes , " his bandmate agrees .
" right now they 're pretty boring .
we 're not very exciting in real life . "
some reviewers have been less than kind about their embryonic live act .
' little bubble ' music website popjustice described mgmt 's concert as the " impressive sight of several men taking a very listenable album and , via the magic of live musicianship , making it seem terrible " .
perhaps it 's a good thing that the band do n't read their own press .
" if they say something bad you just take it to heart , " admits vanwyngarden .
but their fans are more forgiving than the critics , packing out a series of uk shows before mgmt 's album was even released .
" it was surprising to see how many people had actually heard about us , " says goldwasser .
" it 's especially weird because we were locked up in the studio for a while , just kind of messing around in brooklyn and playing music in a little bubble .
" then we came over here and everyone 's talking about us .
it 's kind of crazy . "
oracular spectacular is out now .

yi so-yeon , 29 , is to replace ko san , 31 , on a russian flight to the international space station in april .
russia 's federal space agency requested the change because mr ko broke training centre rules , a senior official said .
south korean officials played down the breaches , which involved removing reading material from the centre .
on one occasion , mr ko sent a training book back to south korea - something he said was by mistake .
on another , he received a book from a russian colleague that he was not meant to read , said lee sang-mok of south korea 's ministry of education , science and technology .
mr ko was replaced at the request of russia " the russians emphasised the importance of abiding by the rules , as even small mistakes can bring about grave consequences in space , " mr lee said .
mr ko , who beat more than 36,000 other applicants to the position , has been training in russia since last year .
he will now serve as the back-up astronaut when ms yi flies with two russian cosmonauts to the international space station in early april .
ms yi will spend seven or eight days there , conducting a series of scientific tests .
the mission will make south korea the sixth asian country to put an astronaut in space .
