the imperious critic whose words have helped make and break many authors over the years seems to live in a world that reveres sublime poetry and profound minds and sneers at money-making and public popularity . so it was a wonder back in 1988 when he broke the mold he 'd developed as head of the book review section at the prestigious frankfurter allgemeine zeitung to become a television personality .
for 13 years , the cranky critic held court on broadcaster zdf with his book-reviewing program , das literarische quartett . on the show , reich-ranicki chaired a panel of four as they praised , or trashed , new books . over the course of 77 episodes , viewers became fascinated by the stocky , balding reich-ranicki , who seemed like a bulldog as he barked out his judgments with astounding energy . wagging his finger and glaring at his fellow panelists when they politely disagreed , reich-ranicki became more recognizable in the german-speaking world than most of the authors he lauded or savaged . a fellow critic , joachim kaiser , once called him " germany 's most read , most feared , most watched and thus most hated literary critic . " " the author of himself " to depict the holocaust years but the made-for-television movie will not concentrate on reich-ranicki 's rise to fame as a literary critic .
instead the 90-minute biopic will adapt reich-ranicki 's 1999 publication , " the author of himself : the life of marcel reich-ranicki , " a memoir that retells the critics extraordinary life as a jew who survived the nazi era . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reich-ranicki escaped from the warsaw ghetto in 1943 though born in poland , marcel reich moved to berlin in 1929 and was educated in berlin until his expulsion to poland as a jew in 1938 .
the film is expected to depict the discrimination he suffered after the nazis ' rise to power and follow reich-ranicki and his family into the warsaw ghetto , from which and his later wife teofila succeeded in making a daring escape . after the war , he adopted the cover name marceli ranicki and worked as a polish espionage officer in london from 1948 to1949 before returning to poland to work as a writer and critic .
after an absence of nearly 20 years , reich-ranicki fled to the federal republic of germany in 1958 , the point at which the film will stop . if reich-ranicki is to be believed , he does not expect the film will slavishly follow his 400-page tome .
instead , he says he will be satisfied if the audience grasps the feeling of a world in destruction which made the autobiography so compelling as a book . the critic takes a step back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german actor matthias schweighoefer will play reich-ranicki reich-ranicki coyly said recently he would not interfere with israeli-born director dror zahavi 's 5.3 million-euro -lrb- $ 8.3 million -rrb- film project . " i hope it turns out well , " said reich-ranicki , who has voiced fury in the past over the delays in bringing the book to the small screen .
" i 'm worried something will go wrong .
i think both are justified : hope and worry . " director zahavi admits that depicting on screen the passion for writing of one of europe 's best read men is a tall order . " i 've been thinking about it the whole time , " he said .
" how do you make literature visual ? " that earned him a typical reich-ranicki brush-off . " do n't concentrate on the theme , " he said .
" concentrate on the audience . " when the film is complete , i shall assess whether it is an interesting , quality film and worth seeing , not whether it perfectly reproduces each chapter of my book , " reich-ranicki said . the film is scheduled to air on german public broadcaster ard next april . dw staff / dpa -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

experts disagree on whether this is an example of a new trend , or simply the exception to the rule . the flight of german businesses has long been a favorite topic among hosts of the country 's political talk shows .
experts and politicians keep pointing out that high labor costs and tax burdens force companies to relocate abroad .
asia attracts entrepreneurs who plan ahead , and china 's the big market of the future , they say . that 's why many eyebrows were raised in germany this week when toymaker steiff announced that it will be shutting down production in china by 2009 .
the german engineers ' association -lrb- vdi -rrb- followed suit by announcing that steiff was not the exception . according to a study commissioned by vdi , almost one in five companies that relocated production abroad returns to germany after a few years . while every 11th company still moves production to other countries , it 's a receding trend , according to vdi officials .

"
treier added that there have always been companies that have returned production to germany .
the number has remained relatively steady over the last few years . treier bases his view on an annual dihk survey among 8,000 companies . " there 's still a strong trend to invest abroad - which should n't be confused with moving production abroad , " he said , adding that a third of those companies surveyed still see china as a prime market . saying that an increasing number of companies is leaving china is wrong , treier said . while companies indicated that the need to move production abroad declined between 2003 and 2007 , the rise of the euro has again made production facilities abroad more attractive for those firms that want to sell their goods in dollars , treier said . short-sighted flight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it takes time to build networks abroad he added that shutting down production abroad was a short-sighted reaction on the part of some firms . " start-up periods , the need for local networks or costs for supervision and quality controls are often ignored , " treier said . he added that some companies are also unpleasantly surprised by the lack of skilled workers at a foreign location .
product safety is especially a concern for companies in china and a reason to leave the market again , treier said . this seems to have been the case with toymaker steiff , where officials cited a lack of quality and long transportation routes as the main reason for returning to germany .
they also said that employees would quickly change jobs if they found work elsewhere that was paid slightly better . rising energy costs could also become a reason for companies to return home in the future .

france , which took over the rotating eu presidency on july 1 , has cited the harmonization of the block 's immigration policy as one of its top priorities of its six-month eu stewardship .
" i think we are very close to an accord , " french prime minister francois fillon said on tuesday .
" there are only a few problems of semantics to resolve . "
under the proposal , eu leaders would pledge to boost the fight against those who cross the block 's borders illegally and expel more illegal immigrants .
once the eu ministers agree on the text of the proposal , the pact could be officially adopted by the leaders of the 27 states in october .
international reactions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to make sure that all its member states follow the same immigration policy the pact would be partially built upon the eu 's newly agreed returns directive which obliges the 27 member states of the eu to choose between issuing residency or other permits to illegal immigrants or returning them to their countries of origin , while empowers the authorities to detain people for up to 18 months if needed during processing .
the directive , which the european parliament adopted in june , has caused an outrage in some countries , especially in latin america .
argentine president cristina fernandez said the law recalled " times of xenophobia " and venezuelan president hugo chavez said europe had " legalised barbarity " .
he has threatened to stop selling oil to european states if they apply the new law and to cancel investments in venezuela by european countries .
unfair criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso has stood up for the eu 's immigration rules the eu has rejected accusations of intolerance .
" honestly i dont believe that the criticism is fair , " european commission president jose manuel barroso said on friday .
" the rules … are more generous than ones latin american countries have between themselves , " he told reporters .
eu officials have argued for tougher measures against illegal immigrants as a way of convincing europeans to be more welcoming of legal immigrants , which are needed in some countries considering the bloc 's negative demographics .
french immigration minister brice hortefeux attributed the failure of the irish eu reform referendum last month partly to the irish voters ' concern about immigration .
the european commission estimates there are up to 8 million illegal migrants in the eu .
more than 200,000 were arrested in the first half of 2007 with less than 90,000 expelled . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 06.07.2008 the pope of german letters returns to tv großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marcel reich-ranicki 's keeping his hands off the film project depicting his wartime youth filming begins in july on a biopic depicting the holocaust years of one of germany 's most extraordinary literary figures : an intense critic whose judgment about new books has been akin to law for the past 35 years . marcel reich-ranicki , 88 , is in many ways a european intellectual of the old school .
the imperious critic whose words have helped make and break many authors over the years seems to live in a world that reveres sublime poetry and profound minds and sneers at money-making and public popularity . so it was a wonder back in 1988 when he broke the mold he 'd developed as head of the book review section at the prestigious frankfurter allgemeine zeitung to become a television personality .
for 13 years , the cranky critic held court on broadcaster zdf with his book-reviewing program , das literarische quartett . on the show , reich-ranicki chaired a panel of four as they praised , or trashed , new books . over the course of 77 episodes , viewers became fascinated by the stocky , balding reich-ranicki , who seemed like a bulldog as he barked out his judgments with astounding energy . wagging his finger and glaring at his fellow panelists when they politely disagreed , reich-ranicki became more recognizable in the german-speaking world than most of the authors he lauded or savaged . a fellow critic , joachim kaiser , once called him " germany 's most read , most feared , most watched and thus most hated literary critic . " " the author of himself " to depict the holocaust years but the made-for-television movie will not concentrate on reich-ranicki 's rise to fame as a literary critic .
instead the 90-minute biopic will adapt reich-ranicki 's 1999 publication , " the author of himself : the life of marcel reich-ranicki , " a memoir that retells the critics extraordinary life as a jew who survived the nazi era . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reich-ranicki escaped from the warsaw ghetto in 1943 though born in poland , marcel reich moved to berlin in 1929 and was educated in berlin until his expulsion to poland as a jew in 1938 .
the film is expected to depict the discrimination he suffered after the nazis ' rise to power and follow reich-ranicki and his family into the warsaw ghetto , from which and his later wife teofila succeeded in making a daring escape . after the war , he adopted the cover name marceli ranicki and worked as a polish espionage officer in london from 1948 to1949 before returning to poland to work as a writer and critic .
after an absence of nearly 20 years , reich-ranicki fled to the federal republic of germany in 1958 , the point at which the film will stop . if reich-ranicki is to be believed , he does not expect the film will slavishly follow his 400-page tome .
instead , he says he will be satisfied if the audience grasps the feeling of a world in destruction which made the autobiography so compelling as a book . the critic takes a step back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german actor matthias schweighoefer will play reich-ranicki reich-ranicki coyly said recently he would not interfere with israeli-born director dror zahavi 's 5.3 million-euro -lrb- $ 8.3 million -rrb- film project . " i hope it turns out well , " said reich-ranicki , who has voiced fury in the past over the delays in bringing the book to the small screen .
" i 'm worried something will go wrong .
i think both are justified : hope and worry . " director zahavi admits that depicting on screen the passion for writing of one of europe 's best read men is a tall order . " i 've been thinking about it the whole time , " he said .
" how do you make literature visual ? " that earned him a typical reich-ranicki brush-off . " do n't concentrate on the theme , " he said .
" concentrate on the audience . " when the film is complete , i shall assess whether it is an interesting , quality film and worth seeing , not whether it perfectly reproduces each chapter of my book , " reich-ranicki said . the film is scheduled to air on german public broadcaster ard next april . dw staff / dpa -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" on the other hand , more and more countries see in nuclear energy an - at least temporary - solution to stop climate change and to reduce our dependency on oil and gas , " he added .
the german government - consisting of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their coalition partners , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- - is itself deeply divided on the issue .
while conservatives near merkel have repeatedly demanded that germany slash a scheduled nuclear energy phase-out , the spd has remained in favor of the plan to shut down germany 's 17 nuclear reactors by 2021 .

" we know that nuclear energy is a delicate issue in germany , " barroso told bild am sonntag newspaper , in an interview published on sunday , july 6 .
" on the other hand , more and more countries see in nuclear energy an - at least temporary - solution to stop climate change and to reduce our dependency on oil and gas , " he added .
the german government - consisting of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their coalition partners , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- - is itself deeply divided on the issue .
while conservatives near merkel have repeatedly demanded that germany slash a scheduled nuclear energy phase-out , the spd has remained in favor of the plan to shut down germany 's 17 nuclear reactors by 2021 .

his extensive plans could drastically reduce the number of troops in germany . sarkozy said that the reforms would include the reduction of the 320,000-strong armed forces by around 54,000 mostly non-combat personnel , the redeployment of remaining troops and the construction of new military bases .
the president also laid out plans to invest more of the defense budget in satellites , airborne drones and other high-tech surveillance equipment .
sarkozy added that the new investment will come from cuts to the armed forces and closures of dozens of garrisons , army bases and military facilities across france and beyond .
this is expected to mean a reduction or complete withdrawal of french troops from germany .
france has between 2,800 and 4,000 soldiers stationed in the country .
french redeployment could threaten euro corps bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french armored regiments are based in germany sarkozy 's plans would also endanger the future of the joint franco-german brigade formed in 1987 .
there are some 5,400 french and german soldiers serving in the brigade , based in several southwest german towns .
the brigade is also part of the strasbourg-based euro corps which includes also soldiers from other european union countries .
the reduction or removal of the french troops - in charge of the armored regiment and the mechanized infantry within the franco-german brigade - would mean only the german light infantry , engineering and artillery units would remain under the euro corps command in germany .
it would also mean the end of an era which started with the occupation of germany after world war ii .
france was among the three western powers which were given zones to control militarily after the end of the war .
the other western powers , britain and the united states , have also been reducing troops in germany since the end of the cold war and the unification of the country .
britain and us also pulling out britain announced in 2006 that it would reduce its total armed forces in germany by 2,200 troops by 2009 as part of a " rebalancing " following the end of the cold war .
the british army still has around 22,000 troops stationed in germany .
though 4,400 troops will return to england , scotland and northern ireland , the armed forces will deploy another 2,200 military personnel in support of two armored brigades , for a net reduction of 2,200 troops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's role as a us hop-off point for iraq is ending germany has also seen a reduction in the number of us troops stationed at bases around the country , also due to a general structural shift in the us army prompted by the fight against terrorism .
dozens of american units based in germany have already been inactivated , or moved in the last two years , affecting roughly 7,200 military positions the us army wants to redeploy many of the 62,000 troops it has stationed throughout europe , and plans to reduce that number to around 24 , 000 over the next three years . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his extensive plans could drastically reduce the number of troops in germany . sarkozy said that the reforms would include the reduction of the 320,000-strong armed forces by around 54,000 mostly non-combat personnel , the redeployment of remaining troops and the construction of new military bases .
the president also laid out plans to invest more of the defense budget in satellites , airborne drones and other high-tech surveillance equipment .
sarkozy added that the new investment will come from cuts to the armed forces and closures of dozens of garrisons , army bases and military facilities across france and beyond .
this is expected to mean a reduction or complete withdrawal of french troops from germany .

his extensive plans could drastically reduce the number of troops in germany . sarkozy said that the reforms would include the reduction of the 320,000-strong armed forces by around 54,000 mostly non-combat personnel , the redeployment of remaining troops and the construction of new military bases .
the president also laid out plans to invest more of the defense budget in satellites , airborne drones and other high-tech surveillance equipment .
sarkozy added that the new investment will come from cuts to the armed forces and closures of dozens of garrisons , army bases and military facilities across france and beyond .
this is expected to mean a reduction or complete withdrawal of french troops from germany .
france has between 2,800 and 4,000 soldiers stationed in the country .
french redeployment could threaten euro corps bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french armored regiments are based in germany sarkozy 's plans would also endanger the future of the joint franco-german brigade formed in 1987 .
there are some 5,400 french and german soldiers serving in the brigade , based in several southwest german towns .
the brigade is also part of the strasbourg-based euro corps which includes also soldiers from other european union countries .
the reduction or removal of the french troops - in charge of the armored regiment and the mechanized infantry within the franco-german brigade - would mean only the german light infantry , engineering and artillery units would remain under the euro corps command in germany .
it would also mean the end of an era which started with the occupation of germany after world war ii .
france was among the three western powers which were given zones to control militarily after the end of the war .
the other western powers , britain and the united states , have also been reducing troops in germany since the end of the cold war and the unification of the country .
britain and us also pulling out britain announced in 2006 that it would reduce its total armed forces in germany by 2,200 troops by 2009 as part of a " rebalancing " following the end of the cold war .
the british army still has around 22,000 troops stationed in germany .
though 4,400 troops will return to england , scotland and northern ireland , the armed forces will deploy another 2,200 military personnel in support of two armored brigades , for a net reduction of 2,200 troops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's role as a us hop-off point for iraq is ending germany has also seen a reduction in the number of us troops stationed at bases around the country , also due to a general structural shift in the us army prompted by the fight against terrorism .
dozens of american units based in germany have already been inactivated , or moved in the last two years , affecting roughly 7,200 military positions the us army wants to redeploy many of the 62,000 troops it has stationed throughout europe , and plans to reduce that number to around 24 , 000 over the next three years . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the imperious critic whose words have helped make and break many authors over the years seems to live in a world that reveres sublime poetry and profound minds and sneers at money-making and public popularity . so it was a wonder back in 1988 when he broke the mold he 'd developed as head of the book review section at the prestigious frankfurter allgemeine zeitung to become a television personality .
for 13 years , the cranky critic held court on broadcaster zdf with his book-reviewing program , das literarische quartett . on the show , reich-ranicki chaired a panel of four as they praised , or trashed , new books . over the course of 77 episodes , viewers became fascinated by the stocky , balding reich-ranicki , who seemed like a bulldog as he barked out his judgments with astounding energy . wagging his finger and glaring at his fellow panelists when they politely disagreed , reich-ranicki became more recognizable in the german-speaking world than most of the authors he lauded or savaged . a fellow critic , joachim kaiser , once called him " germany 's most read , most feared , most watched and thus most hated literary critic . " " the author of himself " to depict the holocaust years but the made-for-television movie will not concentrate on reich-ranicki 's rise to fame as a literary critic .
instead the 90-minute biopic will adapt reich-ranicki 's 1999 publication , " the author of himself : the life of marcel reich-ranicki , " a memoir that retells the critics extraordinary life as a jew who survived the nazi era . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reich-ranicki escaped from the warsaw ghetto in 1943 though born in poland , marcel reich moved to berlin in 1929 and was educated in berlin until his expulsion to poland as a jew in 1938 .
the film is expected to depict the discrimination he suffered after the nazis ' rise to power and follow reich-ranicki and his family into the warsaw ghetto , from which and his later wife teofila succeeded in making a daring escape . after the war , he adopted the cover name marceli ranicki and worked as a polish espionage officer in london from 1948 to1949 before returning to poland to work as a writer and critic .
after an absence of nearly 20 years , reich-ranicki fled to the federal republic of germany in 1958 , the point at which the film will stop . if reich-ranicki is to be believed , he does not expect the film will slavishly follow his 400-page tome .
instead , he says he will be satisfied if the audience grasps the feeling of a world in destruction which made the autobiography so compelling as a book . the critic takes a step back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german actor matthias schweighoefer will play reich-ranicki reich-ranicki coyly said recently he would not interfere with israeli-born director dror zahavi 's 5.3 million-euro -lrb- $ 8.3 million -rrb- film project .

the imperious critic whose words have helped make and break many authors over the years seems to live in a world that reveres sublime poetry and profound minds and sneers at money-making and public popularity . so it was a wonder back in 1988 when he broke the mold he 'd developed as head of the book review section at the prestigious frankfurter allgemeine zeitung to become a television personality .
for 13 years , the cranky critic held court on broadcaster zdf with his book-reviewing program , das literarische quartett . on the show , reich-ranicki chaired a panel of four as they praised , or trashed , new books . over the course of 77 episodes , viewers became fascinated by the stocky , balding reich-ranicki , who seemed like a bulldog as he barked out his judgments with astounding energy . wagging his finger and glaring at his fellow panelists when they politely disagreed , reich-ranicki became more recognizable in the german-speaking world than most of the authors he lauded or savaged . a fellow critic , joachim kaiser , once called him " germany 's most read , most feared , most watched and thus most hated literary critic . " " the author of himself " to depict the holocaust years but the made-for-television movie will not concentrate on reich-ranicki 's rise to fame as a literary critic .
instead the 90-minute biopic will adapt reich-ranicki 's 1999 publication , " the author of himself : the life of marcel reich-ranicki , " a memoir that retells the critics extraordinary life as a jew who survived the nazi era . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reich-ranicki escaped from the warsaw ghetto in 1943 though born in poland , marcel reich moved to berlin in 1929 and was educated in berlin until his expulsion to poland as a jew in 1938 .
the film is expected to depict the discrimination he suffered after the nazis ' rise to power and follow reich-ranicki and his family into the warsaw ghetto , from which and his later wife teofila succeeded in making a daring escape . after the war , he adopted the cover name marceli ranicki and worked as a polish espionage officer in london from 1948 to1949 before returning to poland to work as a writer and critic .
after an absence of nearly 20 years , reich-ranicki fled to the federal republic of germany in 1958 , the point at which the film will stop . if reich-ranicki is to be believed , he does not expect the film will slavishly follow his 400-page tome .
instead , he says he will be satisfied if the audience grasps the feeling of a world in destruction which made the autobiography so compelling as a book . the critic takes a step back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german actor matthias schweighoefer will play reich-ranicki reich-ranicki coyly said recently he would not interfere with israeli-born director dror zahavi 's 5.3 million-euro -lrb- $ 8.3 million -rrb- film project . " i hope it turns out well , " said reich-ranicki , who has voiced fury in the past over the delays in bringing the book to the small screen .
" i 'm worried something will go wrong .
i think both are justified : hope and worry . " director zahavi admits that depicting on screen the passion for writing of one of europe 's best read men is a tall order . " i 've been thinking about it the whole time , " he said .
" how do you make literature visual ? " that earned him a typical reich-ranicki brush-off . " do n't concentrate on the theme , " he said .
" concentrate on the audience . " when the film is complete , i shall assess whether it is an interesting , quality film and worth seeing , not whether it perfectly reproduces each chapter of my book , " reich-ranicki said . the film is scheduled to air on german public broadcaster ard next april . dw staff / dpa -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the imperious critic whose words have helped make and break many authors over the years seems to live in a world that reveres sublime poetry and profound minds and sneers at money-making and public popularity . so it was a wonder back in 1988 when he broke the mold he 'd developed as head of the book review section at the prestigious frankfurter allgemeine zeitung to become a television personality .
for 13 years , the cranky critic held court on broadcaster zdf with his book-reviewing program , das literarische quartett . on the show , reich-ranicki chaired a panel of four as they praised , or trashed , new books . over the course of 77 episodes , viewers became fascinated by the stocky , balding reich-ranicki , who seemed like a bulldog as he barked out his judgments with astounding energy . wagging his finger and glaring at his fellow panelists when they politely disagreed , reich-ranicki became more recognizable in the german-speaking world than most of the authors he lauded or savaged . a fellow critic , joachim kaiser , once called him " germany 's most read , most feared , most watched and thus most hated literary critic . " " the author of himself " to depict the holocaust years but the made-for-television movie will not concentrate on reich-ranicki 's rise to fame as a literary critic .
instead the 90-minute biopic will adapt reich-ranicki 's 1999 publication , " the author of himself : the life of marcel reich-ranicki , " a memoir that retells the critics extraordinary life as a jew who survived the nazi era . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reich-ranicki escaped from the warsaw ghetto in 1943 though born in poland , marcel reich moved to berlin in 1929 and was educated in berlin until his expulsion to poland as a jew in 1938 .
the film is expected to depict the discrimination he suffered after the nazis ' rise to power and follow reich-ranicki and his family into the warsaw ghetto , from which and his later wife teofila succeeded in making a daring escape . after the war , he adopted the cover name marceli ranicki and worked as a polish espionage officer in london from 1948 to1949 before returning to poland to work as a writer and critic .
after an absence of nearly 20 years , reich-ranicki fled to the federal republic of germany in 1958 , the point at which the film will stop . if reich-ranicki is to be believed , he does not expect the film will slavishly follow his 400-page tome .
instead , he says he will be satisfied if the audience grasps the feeling of a world in destruction which made the autobiography so compelling as a book . the critic takes a step back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german actor matthias schweighoefer will play reich-ranicki reich-ranicki coyly said recently he would not interfere with israeli-born director dror zahavi 's 5.3 million-euro -lrb- $ 8.3 million -rrb- film project . " i hope it turns out well , " said reich-ranicki , who has voiced fury in the past over the delays in bringing the book to the small screen .
" i 'm worried something will go wrong .
i think both are justified : hope and worry . " director zahavi admits that depicting on screen the passion for writing of one of europe 's best read men is a tall order . " i 've been thinking about it the whole time , " he said .
" how do you make literature visual ? " that earned him a typical reich-ranicki brush-off . " do n't concentrate on the theme , " he said .
" concentrate on the audience .

the imperious critic whose words have helped make and break many authors over the years seems to live in a world that reveres sublime poetry and profound minds and sneers at money-making and public popularity . so it was a wonder back in 1988 when he broke the mold he 'd developed as head of the book review section at the prestigious frankfurter allgemeine zeitung to become a television personality .
for 13 years , the cranky critic held court on broadcaster zdf with his book-reviewing program , das literarische quartett . on the show , reich-ranicki chaired a panel of four as they praised , or trashed , new books . over the course of 77 episodes , viewers became fascinated by the stocky , balding reich-ranicki , who seemed like a bulldog as he barked out his judgments with astounding energy . wagging his finger and glaring at his fellow panelists when they politely disagreed , reich-ranicki became more recognizable in the german-speaking world than most of the authors he lauded or savaged . a fellow critic , joachim kaiser , once called him " germany 's most read , most feared , most watched and thus most hated literary critic . " " the author of himself " to depict the holocaust years but the made-for-television movie will not concentrate on reich-ranicki 's rise to fame as a literary critic .
instead the 90-minute biopic will adapt reich-ranicki 's 1999 publication , " the author of himself : the life of marcel reich-ranicki , " a memoir that retells the critics extraordinary life as a jew who survived the nazi era . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reich-ranicki escaped from the warsaw ghetto in 1943 though born in poland , marcel reich moved to berlin in 1929 and was educated in berlin until his expulsion to poland as a jew in 1938 .
the film is expected to depict the discrimination he suffered after the nazis ' rise to power and follow reich-ranicki and his family into the warsaw ghetto , from which and his later wife teofila succeeded in making a daring escape . after the war , he adopted the cover name marceli ranicki and worked as a polish espionage officer in london from 1948 to1949 before returning to poland to work as a writer and critic .
after an absence of nearly 20 years , reich-ranicki fled to the federal republic of germany in 1958 , the point at which the film will stop . if reich-ranicki is to be believed , he does not expect the film will slavishly follow his 400-page tome .
instead , he says he will be satisfied if the audience grasps the feeling of a world in destruction which made the autobiography so compelling as a book . the critic takes a step back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german actor matthias schweighoefer will play reich-ranicki reich-ranicki coyly said recently he would not interfere with israeli-born director dror zahavi 's 5.3 million-euro -lrb- $ 8.3 million -rrb- film project . " i hope it turns out well , " said reich-ranicki , who has voiced fury in the past over the delays in bringing the book to the small screen .
" i 'm worried something will go wrong .
i think both are justified : hope and worry . " director zahavi admits that depicting on screen the passion for writing of one of europe 's best read men is a tall order . " i 've been thinking about it the whole time , " he said .
" how do you make literature visual ? " that earned him a typical reich-ranicki brush-off . " do n't concentrate on the theme , " he said .
" concentrate on the audience . " when the film is complete , i shall assess whether it is an interesting , quality film and worth seeing , not whether it perfectly reproduces each chapter of my book , " reich-ranicki said . the film is scheduled to air on german public broadcaster ard next april . dw staff / dpa -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

experts disagree on whether this is an example of a new trend , or simply the exception to the rule . the flight of german businesses has long been a favorite topic among hosts of the country 's political talk shows .
experts and politicians keep pointing out that high labor costs and tax burdens force companies to relocate abroad .
asia attracts entrepreneurs who plan ahead , and china 's the big market of the future , they say . that 's why many eyebrows were raised in germany this week when toymaker steiff announced that it will be shutting down production in china by 2009 .
the german engineers ' association -lrb- vdi -rrb- followed suit by announcing that steiff was not the exception . according to a study commissioned by vdi , almost one in five companies that relocated production abroad returns to germany after a few years . while every 11th company still moves production to other countries , it 's a receding trend , according to vdi officials . " the numbers show that the ' made in germany ' label continues to be a quality seal , " bruno o. braun , vdi 's president , said in a statement . china still attractive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many german firms still like to invest in china it 's a view that 's not shared by volker treier , the chief economist of the association of german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , who said that the vdi numbers were " clearly too high . "
treier added that there have always been companies that have returned production to germany .
the number has remained relatively steady over the last few years . treier bases his view on an annual dihk survey among 8,000 companies . " there 's still a strong trend to invest abroad - which should n't be confused with moving production abroad , " he said , adding that a third of those companies surveyed still see china as a prime market . saying that an increasing number of companies is leaving china is wrong , treier said . while companies indicated that the need to move production abroad declined between 2003 and 2007 , the rise of the euro has again made production facilities abroad more attractive for those firms that want to sell their goods in dollars , treier said . short-sighted flight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it takes time to build networks abroad he added that shutting down production abroad was a short-sighted reaction on the part of some firms . " start-up periods , the need for local networks or costs for supervision and quality controls are often ignored , " treier said . he added that some companies are also unpleasantly surprised by the lack of skilled workers at a foreign location .
product safety is especially a concern for companies in china and a reason to leave the market again , treier said . this seems to have been the case with toymaker steiff , where officials cited a lack of quality and long transportation routes as the main reason for returning to germany .
they also said that employees would quickly change jobs if they found work elsewhere that was paid slightly better . rising energy costs could also become a reason for companies to return home in the future .
while computer and car producers are currently still getting parts where they are cheapest and ship , fly or truck them to where they need them for assembly , transportation costs may end up playing a bigger role in the equation in the future . steffen leidel -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

international reactions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to make sure that all its member states follow the same immigration policy the pact would be partially built upon the eu 's newly agreed returns directive which obliges the 27 member states of the eu to choose between issuing residency or other permits to illegal immigrants or returning them to their countries of origin , while empowers the authorities to detain people for up to 18 months if needed during processing .
the directive , which the european parliament adopted in june , has caused an outrage in some countries , especially in latin america .
argentine president cristina fernandez said the law recalled " times of xenophobia " and venezuelan president hugo chavez said europe had " legalised barbarity " .
he has threatened to stop selling oil to european states if they apply the new law and to cancel investments in venezuela by european countries .
unfair criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso has stood up for the eu 's immigration rules the eu has rejected accusations of intolerance .
" honestly i dont believe that the criticism is fair , " european commission president jose manuel barroso said on friday .
" the rules … are more generous than ones latin american countries have between themselves , " he told reporters .
eu officials have argued for tougher measures against illegal immigrants as a way of convincing europeans to be more welcoming of legal immigrants , which are needed in some countries considering the bloc 's negative demographics .
french immigration minister brice hortefeux attributed the failure of the irish eu reform referendum last month partly to the irish voters ' concern about immigration .
the european commission estimates there are up to 8 million illegal migrants in the eu .
more than 200,000 were arrested in the first half of 2007 with less than 90,000 expelled . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de globalization -pipe- 06.07.2008 german companies eye moving production back home großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he wo n't be made in china in the future german toymaker steiff announced this week that it is relocating production to germany from china .
experts disagree on whether this is an example of a new trend , or simply the exception to the rule . the flight of german businesses has long been a favorite topic among hosts of the country 's political talk shows .
experts and politicians keep pointing out that high labor costs and tax burdens force companies to relocate abroad .
asia attracts entrepreneurs who plan ahead , and china 's the big market of the future , they say . that 's why many eyebrows were raised in germany this week when toymaker steiff announced that it will be shutting down production in china by 2009 .
the german engineers ' association -lrb- vdi -rrb- followed suit by announcing that steiff was not the exception . according to a study commissioned by vdi , almost one in five companies that relocated production abroad returns to germany after a few years . while every 11th company still moves production to other countries , it 's a receding trend , according to vdi officials . " the numbers show that the ' made in germany ' label continues to be a quality seal , " bruno o. braun , vdi 's president , said in a statement . china still attractive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many german firms still like to invest in china it 's a view that 's not shared by volker treier , the chief economist of the association of german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , who said that the vdi numbers were " clearly too high . "
treier added that there have always been companies that have returned production to germany .

experts disagree on whether this is an example of a new trend , or simply the exception to the rule . the flight of german businesses has long been a favorite topic among hosts of the country 's political talk shows .
experts and politicians keep pointing out that high labor costs and tax burdens force companies to relocate abroad .
asia attracts entrepreneurs who plan ahead , and china 's the big market of the future , they say . that 's why many eyebrows were raised in germany this week when toymaker steiff announced that it will be shutting down production in china by 2009 .
the german engineers ' association -lrb- vdi -rrb- followed suit by announcing that steiff was not the exception . according to a study commissioned by vdi , almost one in five companies that relocated production abroad returns to germany after a few years . while every 11th company still moves production to other countries , it 's a receding trend , according to vdi officials . " the numbers show that the ' made in germany ' label continues to be a quality seal , " bruno o. braun , vdi 's president , said in a statement . china still attractive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many german firms still like to invest in china it 's a view that 's not shared by volker treier , the chief economist of the association of german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , who said that the vdi numbers were " clearly too high . "
treier added that there have always been companies that have returned production to germany .
the number has remained relatively steady over the last few years . treier bases his view on an annual dihk survey among 8,000 companies . " there 's still a strong trend to invest abroad - which should n't be confused with moving production abroad , " he said , adding that a third of those companies surveyed still see china as a prime market . saying that an increasing number of companies is leaving china is wrong , treier said . while companies indicated that the need to move production abroad declined between 2003 and 2007 , the rise of the euro has again made production facilities abroad more attractive for those firms that want to sell their goods in dollars , treier said . short-sighted flight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it takes time to build networks abroad he added that shutting down production abroad was a short-sighted reaction on the part of some firms .

his extensive plans could drastically reduce the number of troops in germany . sarkozy said that the reforms would include the reduction of the 320,000-strong armed forces by around 54,000 mostly non-combat personnel , the redeployment of remaining troops and the construction of new military bases .
the president also laid out plans to invest more of the defense budget in satellites , airborne drones and other high-tech surveillance equipment .
sarkozy added that the new investment will come from cuts to the armed forces and closures of dozens of garrisons , army bases and military facilities across france and beyond .
this is expected to mean a reduction or complete withdrawal of french troops from germany .
france has between 2,800 and 4,000 soldiers stationed in the country .
french redeployment could threaten euro corps bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french armored regiments are based in germany sarkozy 's plans would also endanger the future of the joint franco-german brigade formed in 1987 .
there are some 5,400 french and german soldiers serving in the brigade , based in several southwest german towns .
the brigade is also part of the strasbourg-based euro corps which includes also soldiers from other european union countries .
the reduction or removal of the french troops - in charge of the armored regiment and the mechanized infantry within the franco-german brigade - would mean only the german light infantry , engineering and artillery units would remain under the euro corps command in germany .
it would also mean the end of an era which started with the occupation of germany after world war ii .
france was among the three western powers which were given zones to control militarily after the end of the war .
the other western powers , britain and the united states , have also been reducing troops in germany since the end of the cold war and the unification of the country .
britain and us also pulling out britain announced in 2006 that it would reduce its total armed forces in germany by 2,200 troops by 2009 as part of a " rebalancing " following the end of the cold war .
the british army still has around 22,000 troops stationed in germany .
though 4,400 troops will return to england , scotland and northern ireland , the armed forces will deploy another 2,200 military personnel in support of two armored brigades , for a net reduction of 2,200 troops .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 06.07.2008 the pope of german letters returns to tv großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marcel reich-ranicki 's keeping his hands off the film project depicting his wartime youth filming begins in july on a biopic depicting the holocaust years of one of germany 's most extraordinary literary figures : an intense critic whose judgment about new books has been akin to law for the past 35 years . marcel reich-ranicki , 88 , is in many ways a european intellectual of the old school .
the imperious critic whose words have helped make and break many authors over the years seems to live in a world that reveres sublime poetry and profound minds and sneers at money-making and public popularity . so it was a wonder back in 1988 when he broke the mold he 'd developed as head of the book review section at the prestigious frankfurter allgemeine zeitung to become a television personality .
for 13 years , the cranky critic held court on broadcaster zdf with his book-reviewing program , das literarische quartett . on the show , reich-ranicki chaired a panel of four as they praised , or trashed , new books . over the course of 77 episodes , viewers became fascinated by the stocky , balding reich-ranicki , who seemed like a bulldog as he barked out his judgments with astounding energy . wagging his finger and glaring at his fellow panelists when they politely disagreed , reich-ranicki became more recognizable in the german-speaking world than most of the authors he lauded or savaged . a fellow critic , joachim kaiser , once called him " germany 's most read , most feared , most watched and thus most hated literary critic . " " the author of himself " to depict the holocaust years but the made-for-television movie will not concentrate on reich-ranicki 's rise to fame as a literary critic .
instead the 90-minute biopic will adapt reich-ranicki 's 1999 publication , " the author of himself : the life of marcel reich-ranicki , " a memoir that retells the critics extraordinary life as a jew who survived the nazi era . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reich-ranicki escaped from the warsaw ghetto in 1943 though born in poland , marcel reich moved to berlin in 1929 and was educated in berlin until his expulsion to poland as a jew in 1938 .
the film is expected to depict the discrimination he suffered after the nazis ' rise to power and follow reich-ranicki and his family into the warsaw ghetto , from which and his later wife teofila succeeded in making a daring escape . after the war , he adopted the cover name marceli ranicki and worked as a polish espionage officer in london from 1948 to1949 before returning to poland to work as a writer and critic .

his extensive plans could drastically reduce the number of troops in germany . sarkozy said that the reforms would include the reduction of the 320,000-strong armed forces by around 54,000 mostly non-combat personnel , the redeployment of remaining troops and the construction of new military bases .
the president also laid out plans to invest more of the defense budget in satellites , airborne drones and other high-tech surveillance equipment .
sarkozy added that the new investment will come from cuts to the armed forces and closures of dozens of garrisons , army bases and military facilities across france and beyond .
this is expected to mean a reduction or complete withdrawal of french troops from germany .
france has between 2,800 and 4,000 soldiers stationed in the country .
french redeployment could threaten euro corps bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french armored regiments are based in germany sarkozy 's plans would also endanger the future of the joint franco-german brigade formed in 1987 .
there are some 5,400 french and german soldiers serving in the brigade , based in several southwest german towns .
the brigade is also part of the strasbourg-based euro corps which includes also soldiers from other european union countries .
the reduction or removal of the french troops - in charge of the armored regiment and the mechanized infantry within the franco-german brigade - would mean only the german light infantry , engineering and artillery units would remain under the euro corps command in germany .
it would also mean the end of an era which started with the occupation of germany after world war ii .
france was among the three western powers which were given zones to control militarily after the end of the war .
the other western powers , britain and the united states , have also been reducing troops in germany since the end of the cold war and the unification of the country .
britain and us also pulling out britain announced in 2006 that it would reduce its total armed forces in germany by 2,200 troops by 2009 as part of a " rebalancing " following the end of the cold war .
the british army still has around 22,000 troops stationed in germany .
though 4,400 troops will return to england , scotland and northern ireland , the armed forces will deploy another 2,200 military personnel in support of two armored brigades , for a net reduction of 2,200 troops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's role as a us hop-off point for iraq is ending germany has also seen a reduction in the number of us troops stationed at bases around the country , also due to a general structural shift in the us army prompted by the fight against terrorism .
dozens of american units based in germany have already been inactivated , or moved in the last two years , affecting roughly 7,200 military positions the us army wants to redeploy many of the 62,000 troops it has stationed throughout europe , and plans to reduce that number to around 24 , 000 over the next three years . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his extensive plans could drastically reduce the number of troops in germany . sarkozy said that the reforms would include the reduction of the 320,000-strong armed forces by around 54,000 mostly non-combat personnel , the redeployment of remaining troops and the construction of new military bases .
the president also laid out plans to invest more of the defense budget in satellites , airborne drones and other high-tech surveillance equipment .
sarkozy added that the new investment will come from cuts to the armed forces and closures of dozens of garrisons , army bases and military facilities across france and beyond .
this is expected to mean a reduction or complete withdrawal of french troops from germany .

his extensive plans could drastically reduce the number of troops in germany . sarkozy said that the reforms would include the reduction of the 320,000-strong armed forces by around 54,000 mostly non-combat personnel , the redeployment of remaining troops and the construction of new military bases .
the president also laid out plans to invest more of the defense budget in satellites , airborne drones and other high-tech surveillance equipment .
sarkozy added that the new investment will come from cuts to the armed forces and closures of dozens of garrisons , army bases and military facilities across france and beyond .
this is expected to mean a reduction or complete withdrawal of french troops from germany .
france has between 2,800 and 4,000 soldiers stationed in the country .
french redeployment could threaten euro corps bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french armored regiments are based in germany sarkozy 's plans would also endanger the future of the joint franco-german brigade formed in 1987 .
there are some 5,400 french and german soldiers serving in the brigade , based in several southwest german towns .
the brigade is also part of the strasbourg-based euro corps which includes also soldiers from other european union countries .
the reduction or removal of the french troops - in charge of the armored regiment and the mechanized infantry within the franco-german brigade - would mean only the german light infantry , engineering and artillery units would remain under the euro corps command in germany .
it would also mean the end of an era which started with the occupation of germany after world war ii .
france was among the three western powers which were given zones to control militarily after the end of the war .
the other western powers , britain and the united states , have also been reducing troops in germany since the end of the cold war and the unification of the country .
britain and us also pulling out britain announced in 2006 that it would reduce its total armed forces in germany by 2,200 troops by 2009 as part of a " rebalancing " following the end of the cold war .
the british army still has around 22,000 troops stationed in germany .
though 4,400 troops will return to england , scotland and northern ireland , the armed forces will deploy another 2,200 military personnel in support of two armored brigades , for a net reduction of 2,200 troops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's role as a us hop-off point for iraq is ending germany has also seen a reduction in the number of us troops stationed at bases around the country , also due to a general structural shift in the us army prompted by the fight against terrorism .
dozens of american units based in germany have already been inactivated , or moved in the last two years , affecting roughly 7,200 military positions the us army wants to redeploy many of the 62,000 troops it has stationed throughout europe , and plans to reduce that number to around 24 , 000 over the next three years . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

helgoland , an island in the north sea which was once fiercely contested between britain and germany , could nearly double in size under a land reclamation project which won official clearance this week . the island was a british possession from 1807 till 1890 , then became a major german submarine base in two world wars .
in an explosion described at the time as the largest non-nuclear detonation in history , britain blew up the submarine pens in 1947 . the only part of germany which is not in sight of the mainland is a sleepy tourist resort nowadays , but a hamburg businessman arne weber wants to change that , reclaiming a gap between the island 's two halves and selling the new land . bildunterschrift : helgoland currently exists of two parts ... although large bits of helgoland collapsed in the 1947 blast , the division of the island was not the work of the british but of a storm in 1721 that washed away much of its ancient sand dunes . investing millions weber envisages an investment of 80 million euros -lrb- $ 125 million -rrb- to constantly dredge up sand for 12 months and pack it in the shallow gap to create 1 square kilometer -lrb- 0.38 square miles -rrb- of dry land as a site for apartments , hotels and a new beach . bildunterschrift : ... that weber wants to connect again this would supplement the present 1.7 square kilometers of the island , says weber , whose ancestors lived on the island .
the reclaimed land would be protected from storms in the age of global warming by walls of steel piles . the ministry of the economy of the state of schleswig-holstein said this week the project was bold but viable .
state and federal officials would be asked to throw their weight behind the project . fading tourism helgoland is hardly a world-class tourist destination , but many older germans have fond memories of crossing the sea by launch to visit it and being rowed ashore through the shallows in small boats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helgoland 's landmark , the long anna rock on the left , might collapse soon in the days before germans jetted to beaches all over the globe , it seemed like an exotic trip abroad . smokers can still buy duty-free cigarettes and whisky while staying on the island , but the holiday trade has halved since the 1970s , when 800,000 germans visited the island every year . surrounded by open sea , helgoland has a milder climate in the colder seasons than the german mainland , but there is not much to do or see on the island other than enjoy the big sky .
for some , that is an attraction . a stay on the island can resemble an ocean cruise without the sea-sickness , although the trip there and back can be rough if there is a heavy swell or a stiff breeze blowing over the north sea . bright future ahead ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helgoland 's not ready to disappear ino the sunset quite yet in the 19th century , germany was so eager to recover the bare island that it granted colonialist britain in exchange a free hand to seize the east african sultanate of zanzibar . helgoland 's mayor , frank botter , said the 1,500 residents are not quite sure what to make of the plan .
some think it is mad . others think it could bring new hope to the declining community , especially if weber introduces a better ferry service to the mainland and a pier for cruise ships is built on the island . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

france , which took over the rotating eu presidency on july 1 , has cited the harmonization of the block 's immigration policy as one of its top priorities of its six-month eu stewardship .
" i think we are very close to an accord , " french prime minister francois fillon said on tuesday .
" there are only a few problems of semantics to resolve . "
under the proposal , eu leaders would pledge to boost the fight against those who cross the block 's borders illegally and expel more illegal immigrants .
once the eu ministers agree on the text of the proposal , the pact could be officially adopted by the leaders of the 27 states in october .
international reactions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to make sure that all its member states follow the same immigration policy the pact would be partially built upon the eu 's newly agreed returns directive which obliges the 27 member states of the eu to choose between issuing residency or other permits to illegal immigrants or returning them to their countries of origin , while empowers the authorities to detain people for up to 18 months if needed during processing .
the directive , which the european parliament adopted in june , has caused an outrage in some countries , especially in latin america .
argentine president cristina fernandez said the law recalled " times of xenophobia " and venezuelan president hugo chavez said europe had " legalised barbarity " .
he has threatened to stop selling oil to european states if they apply the new law and to cancel investments in venezuela by european countries .
unfair criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso has stood up for the eu 's immigration rules the eu has rejected accusations of intolerance .
" honestly i dont believe that the criticism is fair , " european commission president jose manuel barroso said on friday .
" the rules … are more generous than ones latin american countries have between themselves , " he told reporters .
eu officials have argued for tougher measures against illegal immigrants as a way of convincing europeans to be more welcoming of legal immigrants , which are needed in some countries considering the bloc 's negative demographics .
french immigration minister brice hortefeux attributed the failure of the irish eu reform referendum last month partly to the irish voters ' concern about immigration .

france , which took over the rotating eu presidency on july 1 , has cited the harmonization of the block 's immigration policy as one of its top priorities of its six-month eu stewardship .
" i think we are very close to an accord , " french prime minister francois fillon said on tuesday .

" we know that nuclear energy is a delicate issue in germany , " barroso told bild am sonntag newspaper , in an interview published on sunday , july 6 .
" on the other hand , more and more countries see in nuclear energy an - at least temporary - solution to stop climate change and to reduce our dependency on oil and gas , " he added .
the german government - consisting of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their coalition partners , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- - is itself deeply divided on the issue .
while conservatives near merkel have repeatedly demanded that germany slash a scheduled nuclear energy phase-out , the spd has remained in favor of the plan to shut down germany 's 17 nuclear reactors by 2021 .
the gradual phase-out of all germany 's nuclear power plants was agreed upon in 2000 by the government of former social democratic chancellor gerhard schroeder and his coalition partners at the time , the greens .
an eerie comeback ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has vocal environmental activists who oppose nuclear energy with soaring oil prices in the world and reports indicating that biofuels may have contributed to the increase of food prices all over the globe , the question of nuclear energy in germany no longer seems to be a closed chapter .
" nuclear power ?
the eerie comeback " , ran the front-page headline on the latest edition of der spiegel magazine .
technology minister annette schavan , a conservative , called for the phase-out deal to be abandoned for pragmatic reasons .
" we need to exit the exit resolution , " she told bild am sonntag .
" we urgently need the life-span extension - as a contribution to global climate protection and for a lasting energy supply . "
" in germany today , the issue is not about building new nuclear power plants but who can say whether that will still apply in 10 years ? "
schavan asked .
the social democrats ' parliamentary floor leader peter struck , however , rejected the idea of prolonging the atomic power plants ' life-span .
" that is irresponsible , so long as the question of the disposal of highly radioactive waste is not solved , " struck told sunday 's edition of der tagesspiegel newspaper .
windy alternative bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is planning a massive wind energy project in the north transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee , a social democrat , told welt am sonntag he had finalized plans to build up to 30 offshore windfarms in the baltic and north seas in an attempt to meet the government 's renewable energy targets .
" we believe in renewable energy and not in nuclear energy , " he said .
the first windfarm is expected to go up off borkum island in the north sea later this year .
" the government is aiming to obtain " 25,000 megawatts of energy from windfarms by 2030 " , tiefensee said . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the imperious critic whose words have helped make and break many authors over the years seems to live in a world that reveres sublime poetry and profound minds and sneers at money-making and public popularity . so it was a wonder back in 1988 when he broke the mold he 'd developed as head of the book review section at the prestigious frankfurter allgemeine zeitung to become a television personality .
for 13 years , the cranky critic held court on broadcaster zdf with his book-reviewing program , das literarische quartett . on the show , reich-ranicki chaired a panel of four as they praised , or trashed , new books . over the course of 77 episodes , viewers became fascinated by the stocky , balding reich-ranicki , who seemed like a bulldog as he barked out his judgments with astounding energy . wagging his finger and glaring at his fellow panelists when they politely disagreed , reich-ranicki became more recognizable in the german-speaking world than most of the authors he lauded or savaged . a fellow critic , joachim kaiser , once called him " germany 's most read , most feared , most watched and thus most hated literary critic . " " the author of himself " to depict the holocaust years but the made-for-television movie will not concentrate on reich-ranicki 's rise to fame as a literary critic .
instead the 90-minute biopic will adapt reich-ranicki 's 1999 publication , " the author of himself : the life of marcel reich-ranicki , " a memoir that retells the critics extraordinary life as a jew who survived the nazi era . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reich-ranicki escaped from the warsaw ghetto in 1943 though born in poland , marcel reich moved to berlin in 1929 and was educated in berlin until his expulsion to poland as a jew in 1938 .
the film is expected to depict the discrimination he suffered after the nazis ' rise to power and follow reich-ranicki and his family into the warsaw ghetto , from which and his later wife teofila succeeded in making a daring escape . after the war , he adopted the cover name marceli ranicki and worked as a polish espionage officer in london from 1948 to1949 before returning to poland to work as a writer and critic .
after an absence of nearly 20 years , reich-ranicki fled to the federal republic of germany in 1958 , the point at which the film will stop . if reich-ranicki is to be believed , he does not expect the film will slavishly follow his 400-page tome .
instead , he says he will be satisfied if the audience grasps the feeling of a world in destruction which made the autobiography so compelling as a book . the critic takes a step back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german actor matthias schweighoefer will play reich-ranicki reich-ranicki coyly said recently he would not interfere with israeli-born director dror zahavi 's 5.3 million-euro -lrb- $ 8.3 million -rrb- film project . " i hope it turns out well , " said reich-ranicki , who has voiced fury in the past over the delays in bringing the book to the small screen .
" i 'm worried something will go wrong .
i think both are justified : hope and worry . " director zahavi admits that depicting on screen the passion for writing of one of europe 's best read men is a tall order . " i 've been thinking about it the whole time , " he said .

the imperious critic whose words have helped make and break many authors over the years seems to live in a world that reveres sublime poetry and profound minds and sneers at money-making and public popularity . so it was a wonder back in 1988 when he broke the mold he 'd developed as head of the book review section at the prestigious frankfurter allgemeine zeitung to become a television personality .
for 13 years , the cranky critic held court on broadcaster zdf with his book-reviewing program , das literarische quartett . on the show , reich-ranicki chaired a panel of four as they praised , or trashed , new books . over the course of 77 episodes , viewers became fascinated by the stocky , balding reich-ranicki , who seemed like a bulldog as he barked out his judgments with astounding energy . wagging his finger and glaring at his fellow panelists when they politely disagreed , reich-ranicki became more recognizable in the german-speaking world than most of the authors he lauded or savaged . a fellow critic , joachim kaiser , once called him " germany 's most read , most feared , most watched and thus most hated literary critic . " " the author of himself " to depict the holocaust years but the made-for-television movie will not concentrate on reich-ranicki 's rise to fame as a literary critic .

the film is expected to depict the discrimination he suffered after the nazis ' rise to power and follow reich-ranicki and his family into the warsaw ghetto , from which and his later wife teofila succeeded in making a daring escape . after the war , he adopted the cover name marceli ranicki and worked as a polish espionage officer in london from 1948 to1949 before returning to poland to work as a writer and critic .
after an absence of nearly 20 years , reich-ranicki fled to the federal republic of germany in 1958 , the point at which the film will stop . if reich-ranicki is to be believed , he does not expect the film will slavishly follow his 400-page tome .

his extensive plans could drastically reduce the number of troops in germany . sarkozy said that the reforms would include the reduction of the 320,000-strong armed forces by around 54,000 mostly non-combat personnel , the redeployment of remaining troops and the construction of new military bases .
the president also laid out plans to invest more of the defense budget in satellites , airborne drones and other high-tech surveillance equipment .
sarkozy added that the new investment will come from cuts to the armed forces and closures of dozens of garrisons , army bases and military facilities across france and beyond .
this is expected to mean a reduction or complete withdrawal of french troops from germany .
france has between 2,800 and 4,000 soldiers stationed in the country .
french redeployment could threaten euro corps bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french armored regiments are based in germany sarkozy 's plans would also endanger the future of the joint franco-german brigade formed in 1987 .
there are some 5,400 french and german soldiers serving in the brigade , based in several southwest german towns .
the brigade is also part of the strasbourg-based euro corps which includes also soldiers from other european union countries .
the reduction or removal of the french troops - in charge of the armored regiment and the mechanized infantry within the franco-german brigade - would mean only the german light infantry , engineering and artillery units would remain under the euro corps command in germany .
it would also mean the end of an era which started with the occupation of germany after world war ii .
france was among the three western powers which were given zones to control militarily after the end of the war .
the other western powers , britain and the united states , have also been reducing troops in germany since the end of the cold war and the unification of the country .
britain and us also pulling out britain announced in 2006 that it would reduce its total armed forces in germany by 2,200 troops by 2009 as part of a " rebalancing " following the end of the cold war .
the british army still has around 22,000 troops stationed in germany .
though 4,400 troops will return to england , scotland and northern ireland , the armed forces will deploy another 2,200 military personnel in support of two armored brigades , for a net reduction of 2,200 troops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's role as a us hop-off point for iraq is ending germany has also seen a reduction in the number of us troops stationed at bases around the country , also due to a general structural shift in the us army prompted by the fight against terrorism .
dozens of american units based in germany have already been inactivated , or moved in the last two years , affecting roughly 7,200 military positions the us army wants to redeploy many of the 62,000 troops it has stationed throughout europe , and plans to reduce that number to around 24 , 000 over the next three years . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

france , which took over the rotating eu presidency on july 1 , has cited the harmonization of the block 's immigration policy as one of its top priorities of its six-month eu stewardship .
" i think we are very close to an accord , " french prime minister francois fillon said on tuesday .
" there are only a few problems of semantics to resolve . "
under the proposal , eu leaders would pledge to boost the fight against those who cross the block 's borders illegally and expel more illegal immigrants .
once the eu ministers agree on the text of the proposal , the pact could be officially adopted by the leaders of the 27 states in october .
international reactions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to make sure that all its member states follow the same immigration policy the pact would be partially built upon the eu 's newly agreed returns directive which obliges the 27 member states of the eu to choose between issuing residency or other permits to illegal immigrants or returning them to their countries of origin , while empowers the authorities to detain people for up to 18 months if needed during processing .
the directive , which the european parliament adopted in june , has caused an outrage in some countries , especially in latin america .
argentine president cristina fernandez said the law recalled " times of xenophobia " and venezuelan president hugo chavez said europe had " legalised barbarity " .
he has threatened to stop selling oil to european states if they apply the new law and to cancel investments in venezuela by european countries .

" honestly i dont believe that the criticism is fair , " european commission president jose manuel barroso said on friday .
" the rules … are more generous than ones latin american countries have between themselves , " he told reporters .
eu officials have argued for tougher measures against illegal immigrants as a way of convincing europeans to be more welcoming of legal immigrants , which are needed in some countries considering the bloc 's negative demographics .

france , which took over the rotating eu presidency on july 1 , has cited the harmonization of the block 's immigration policy as one of its top priorities of its six-month eu stewardship .
" i think we are very close to an accord , " french prime minister francois fillon said on tuesday .
" there are only a few problems of semantics to resolve . "
under the proposal , eu leaders would pledge to boost the fight against those who cross the block 's borders illegally and expel more illegal immigrants .
once the eu ministers agree on the text of the proposal , the pact could be officially adopted by the leaders of the 27 states in october .
international reactions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to make sure that all its member states follow the same immigration policy the pact would be partially built upon the eu 's newly agreed returns directive which obliges the 27 member states of the eu to choose between issuing residency or other permits to illegal immigrants or returning them to their countries of origin , while empowers the authorities to detain people for up to 18 months if needed during processing .

experts disagree on whether this is an example of a new trend , or simply the exception to the rule . the flight of german businesses has long been a favorite topic among hosts of the country 's political talk shows .
experts and politicians keep pointing out that high labor costs and tax burdens force companies to relocate abroad .
asia attracts entrepreneurs who plan ahead , and china 's the big market of the future , they say . that 's why many eyebrows were raised in germany this week when toymaker steiff announced that it will be shutting down production in china by 2009 .
the german engineers ' association -lrb- vdi -rrb- followed suit by announcing that steiff was not the exception . according to a study commissioned by vdi , almost one in five companies that relocated production abroad returns to germany after a few years . while every 11th company still moves production to other countries , it 's a receding trend , according to vdi officials . " the numbers show that the ' made in germany ' label continues to be a quality seal , " bruno o. braun , vdi 's president , said in a statement . china still attractive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many german firms still like to invest in china it 's a view that 's not shared by volker treier , the chief economist of the association of german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , who said that the vdi numbers were " clearly too high . "
treier added that there have always been companies that have returned production to germany .
the number has remained relatively steady over the last few years . treier bases his view on an annual dihk survey among 8,000 companies . " there 's still a strong trend to invest abroad - which should n't be confused with moving production abroad , " he said , adding that a third of those companies surveyed still see china as a prime market . saying that an increasing number of companies is leaving china is wrong , treier said . while companies indicated that the need to move production abroad declined between 2003 and 2007 , the rise of the euro has again made production facilities abroad more attractive for those firms that want to sell their goods in dollars , treier said . short-sighted flight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it takes time to build networks abroad he added that shutting down production abroad was a short-sighted reaction on the part of some firms .

" we know that nuclear energy is a delicate issue in germany , " barroso told bild am sonntag newspaper , in an interview published on sunday , july 6 .
" on the other hand , more and more countries see in nuclear energy an - at least temporary - solution to stop climate change and to reduce our dependency on oil and gas , " he added .
the german government - consisting of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their coalition partners , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- - is itself deeply divided on the issue .
while conservatives near merkel have repeatedly demanded that germany slash a scheduled nuclear energy phase-out , the spd has remained in favor of the plan to shut down germany 's 17 nuclear reactors by 2021 .
the gradual phase-out of all germany 's nuclear power plants was agreed upon in 2000 by the government of former social democratic chancellor gerhard schroeder and his coalition partners at the time , the greens .

" nuclear power ?
the eerie comeback " , ran the front-page headline on the latest edition of der spiegel magazine .
technology minister annette schavan , a conservative , called for the phase-out deal to be abandoned for pragmatic reasons .
" we need to exit the exit resolution , " she told bild am sonntag .
" we urgently need the life-span extension - as a contribution to global climate protection and for a lasting energy supply . "
" in germany today , the issue is not about building new nuclear power plants but who can say whether that will still apply in 10 years ? "
schavan asked .
the social democrats ' parliamentary floor leader peter struck , however , rejected the idea of prolonging the atomic power plants ' life-span .
" that is irresponsible , so long as the question of the disposal of highly radioactive waste is not solved , " struck told sunday 's edition of der tagesspiegel newspaper .

but at 347 -lrb- 215 miles -rrb- kilometers per hour , maybe the co-driver is best left at home .
a prototype of the new veritas recently turned heads at sports car event in monte carlo and at the spa-francorchamps racetrack in belgium .
vermot ag , a sports car manufacturer based south of the western german city of cologne , plans to build 30 veritas rs iii super sports cars annually with the first models to be delivered by the end of the year .
racing legend re-invented bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this version had room for a co-driver the veritas , launched in the early days of 1948 , won some 13 german championships and 29 first places , making it one of the most successful german racing cars .
it was the first german formula 1 car in 1951 .
built without dynamic stability control , the vehicle is designed to provide a " true race feeling . "
the new version is being launched on the car 's 60th anniversary .
owners will be able to choose between a v8 and a v10 engine .
the v8 is listed with a top speed of 329 kilometers per hour and the v10 at 347 kph .
acceleration from zero to 100 kph is 3.6 and 3.2 seconds respectively .
the single-seater is built on a tubular framework with a lightweight carbon-kevlar body .
vermont is also planning a hard-top coupe version designed to seat a single passenger for next year .

the imperious critic whose words have helped make and break many authors over the years seems to live in a world that reveres sublime poetry and profound minds and sneers at money-making and public popularity . so it was a wonder back in 1988 when he broke the mold he 'd developed as head of the book review section at the prestigious frankfurter allgemeine zeitung to become a television personality .
for 13 years , the cranky critic held court on broadcaster zdf with his book-reviewing program , das literarische quartett . on the show , reich-ranicki chaired a panel of four as they praised , or trashed , new books . over the course of 77 episodes , viewers became fascinated by the stocky , balding reich-ranicki , who seemed like a bulldog as he barked out his judgments with astounding energy . wagging his finger and glaring at his fellow panelists when they politely disagreed , reich-ranicki became more recognizable in the german-speaking world than most of the authors he lauded or savaged . a fellow critic , joachim kaiser , once called him " germany 's most read , most feared , most watched and thus most hated literary critic . " " the author of himself " to depict the holocaust years but the made-for-television movie will not concentrate on reich-ranicki 's rise to fame as a literary critic .

the film is expected to depict the discrimination he suffered after the nazis ' rise to power and follow reich-ranicki and his family into the warsaw ghetto , from which and his later wife teofila succeeded in making a daring escape . after the war , he adopted the cover name marceli ranicki and worked as a polish espionage officer in london from 1948 to1949 before returning to poland to work as a writer and critic .
after an absence of nearly 20 years , reich-ranicki fled to the federal republic of germany in 1958 , the point at which the film will stop . if reich-ranicki is to be believed , he does not expect the film will slavishly follow his 400-page tome .
instead , he says he will be satisfied if the audience grasps the feeling of a world in destruction which made the autobiography so compelling as a book . the critic takes a step back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german actor matthias schweighoefer will play reich-ranicki reich-ranicki coyly said recently he would not interfere with israeli-born director dror zahavi 's 5.3 million-euro -lrb- $ 8.3 million -rrb- film project .

the imperious critic whose words have helped make and break many authors over the years seems to live in a world that reveres sublime poetry and profound minds and sneers at money-making and public popularity . so it was a wonder back in 1988 when he broke the mold he 'd developed as head of the book review section at the prestigious frankfurter allgemeine zeitung to become a television personality .
for 13 years , the cranky critic held court on broadcaster zdf with his book-reviewing program , das literarische quartett . on the show , reich-ranicki chaired a panel of four as they praised , or trashed , new books . over the course of 77 episodes , viewers became fascinated by the stocky , balding reich-ranicki , who seemed like a bulldog as he barked out his judgments with astounding energy . wagging his finger and glaring at his fellow panelists when they politely disagreed , reich-ranicki became more recognizable in the german-speaking world than most of the authors he lauded or savaged . a fellow critic , joachim kaiser , once called him " germany 's most read , most feared , most watched and thus most hated literary critic . " " the author of himself " to depict the holocaust years but the made-for-television movie will not concentrate on reich-ranicki 's rise to fame as a literary critic .
instead the 90-minute biopic will adapt reich-ranicki 's 1999 publication , " the author of himself : the life of marcel reich-ranicki , " a memoir that retells the critics extraordinary life as a jew who survived the nazi era . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reich-ranicki escaped from the warsaw ghetto in 1943 though born in poland , marcel reich moved to berlin in 1929 and was educated in berlin until his expulsion to poland as a jew in 1938 .
the film is expected to depict the discrimination he suffered after the nazis ' rise to power and follow reich-ranicki and his family into the warsaw ghetto , from which and his later wife teofila succeeded in making a daring escape . after the war , he adopted the cover name marceli ranicki and worked as a polish espionage officer in london from 1948 to1949 before returning to poland to work as a writer and critic .
after an absence of nearly 20 years , reich-ranicki fled to the federal republic of germany in 1958 , the point at which the film will stop . if reich-ranicki is to be believed , he does not expect the film will slavishly follow his 400-page tome .
instead , he says he will be satisfied if the audience grasps the feeling of a world in destruction which made the autobiography so compelling as a book . the critic takes a step back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german actor matthias schweighoefer will play reich-ranicki reich-ranicki coyly said recently he would not interfere with israeli-born director dror zahavi 's 5.3 million-euro -lrb- $ 8.3 million -rrb- film project . " i hope it turns out well , " said reich-ranicki , who has voiced fury in the past over the delays in bringing the book to the small screen .
" i 'm worried something will go wrong .
i think both are justified : hope and worry . " director zahavi admits that depicting on screen the passion for writing of one of europe 's best read men is a tall order . " i 've been thinking about it the whole time , " he said .
" how do you make literature visual ? " that earned him a typical reich-ranicki brush-off . " do n't concentrate on the theme , " he said .
" concentrate on the audience . " when the film is complete , i shall assess whether it is an interesting , quality film and worth seeing , not whether it perfectly reproduces each chapter of my book , " reich-ranicki said . the film is scheduled to air on german public broadcaster ard next april . dw staff / dpa -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it was the first german formula 1 car in 1951 .
built without dynamic stability control , the vehicle is designed to provide a " true race feeling . "
the new version is being launched on the car 's 60th anniversary .
owners will be able to choose between a v8 and a v10 engine .
the v8 is listed with a top speed of 329 kilometers per hour and the v10 at 347 kph .
acceleration from zero to 100 kph is 3.6 and 3.2 seconds respectively .
the single-seater is built on a tubular framework with a lightweight carbon-kevlar body .
vermont is also planning a hard-top coupe version designed to seat a single passenger for next year .

the imperious critic whose words have helped make and break many authors over the years seems to live in a world that reveres sublime poetry and profound minds and sneers at money-making and public popularity . so it was a wonder back in 1988 when he broke the mold he 'd developed as head of the book review section at the prestigious frankfurter allgemeine zeitung to become a television personality .
for 13 years , the cranky critic held court on broadcaster zdf with his book-reviewing program , das literarische quartett . on the show , reich-ranicki chaired a panel of four as they praised , or trashed , new books . over the course of 77 episodes , viewers became fascinated by the stocky , balding reich-ranicki , who seemed like a bulldog as he barked out his judgments with astounding energy . wagging his finger and glaring at his fellow panelists when they politely disagreed , reich-ranicki became more recognizable in the german-speaking world than most of the authors he lauded or savaged . a fellow critic , joachim kaiser , once called him " germany 's most read , most feared , most watched and thus most hated literary critic . " " the author of himself " to depict the holocaust years but the made-for-television movie will not concentrate on reich-ranicki 's rise to fame as a literary critic .
instead the 90-minute biopic will adapt reich-ranicki 's 1999 publication , " the author of himself : the life of marcel reich-ranicki , " a memoir that retells the critics extraordinary life as a jew who survived the nazi era . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reich-ranicki escaped from the warsaw ghetto in 1943 though born in poland , marcel reich moved to berlin in 1929 and was educated in berlin until his expulsion to poland as a jew in 1938 .
the film is expected to depict the discrimination he suffered after the nazis ' rise to power and follow reich-ranicki and his family into the warsaw ghetto , from which and his later wife teofila succeeded in making a daring escape . after the war , he adopted the cover name marceli ranicki and worked as a polish espionage officer in london from 1948 to1949 before returning to poland to work as a writer and critic .

" we know that nuclear energy is a delicate issue in germany , " barroso told bild am sonntag newspaper , in an interview published on sunday , july 6 .
" on the other hand , more and more countries see in nuclear energy an - at least temporary - solution to stop climate change and to reduce our dependency on oil and gas , " he added .
the german government - consisting of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their coalition partners , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- - is itself deeply divided on the issue .
while conservatives near merkel have repeatedly demanded that germany slash a scheduled nuclear energy phase-out , the spd has remained in favor of the plan to shut down germany 's 17 nuclear reactors by 2021 .
the gradual phase-out of all germany 's nuclear power plants was agreed upon in 2000 by the government of former social democratic chancellor gerhard schroeder and his coalition partners at the time , the greens .
an eerie comeback ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has vocal environmental activists who oppose nuclear energy with soaring oil prices in the world and reports indicating that biofuels may have contributed to the increase of food prices all over the globe , the question of nuclear energy in germany no longer seems to be a closed chapter .
" nuclear power ?
the eerie comeback " , ran the front-page headline on the latest edition of der spiegel magazine .
technology minister annette schavan , a conservative , called for the phase-out deal to be abandoned for pragmatic reasons .
" we need to exit the exit resolution , " she told bild am sonntag .
" we urgently need the life-span extension - as a contribution to global climate protection and for a lasting energy supply . "
" in germany today , the issue is not about building new nuclear power plants but who can say whether that will still apply in 10 years ? "
schavan asked .
the social democrats ' parliamentary floor leader peter struck , however , rejected the idea of prolonging the atomic power plants ' life-span .
" that is irresponsible , so long as the question of the disposal of highly radioactive waste is not solved , " struck told sunday 's edition of der tagesspiegel newspaper .
windy alternative bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is planning a massive wind energy project in the north transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee , a social democrat , told welt am sonntag he had finalized plans to build up to 30 offshore windfarms in the baltic and north seas in an attempt to meet the government 's renewable energy targets .
" we believe in renewable energy and not in nuclear energy , " he said .
the first windfarm is expected to go up off borkum island in the north sea later this year .
" the government is aiming to obtain " 25,000 megawatts of energy from windfarms by 2030 " , tiefensee said . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we know that nuclear energy is a delicate issue in germany , " barroso told bild am sonntag newspaper , in an interview published on sunday , july 6 .
" on the other hand , more and more countries see in nuclear energy an - at least temporary - solution to stop climate change and to reduce our dependency on oil and gas , " he added .
the german government - consisting of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their coalition partners , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- - is itself deeply divided on the issue .

" we know that nuclear energy is a delicate issue in germany , " barroso told bild am sonntag newspaper , in an interview published on sunday , july 6 .
" on the other hand , more and more countries see in nuclear energy an - at least temporary - solution to stop climate change and to reduce our dependency on oil and gas , " he added .
the german government - consisting of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their coalition partners , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- - is itself deeply divided on the issue .
while conservatives near merkel have repeatedly demanded that germany slash a scheduled nuclear energy phase-out , the spd has remained in favor of the plan to shut down germany 's 17 nuclear reactors by 2021 .
the gradual phase-out of all germany 's nuclear power plants was agreed upon in 2000 by the government of former social democratic chancellor gerhard schroeder and his coalition partners at the time , the greens .
an eerie comeback ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has vocal environmental activists who oppose nuclear energy with soaring oil prices in the world and reports indicating that biofuels may have contributed to the increase of food prices all over the globe , the question of nuclear energy in germany no longer seems to be a closed chapter .
" nuclear power ?
the eerie comeback " , ran the front-page headline on the latest edition of der spiegel magazine .
technology minister annette schavan , a conservative , called for the phase-out deal to be abandoned for pragmatic reasons .
" we need to exit the exit resolution , " she told bild am sonntag .
" we urgently need the life-span extension - as a contribution to global climate protection and for a lasting energy supply . "
" in germany today , the issue is not about building new nuclear power plants but who can say whether that will still apply in 10 years ? "
schavan asked .
the social democrats ' parliamentary floor leader peter struck , however , rejected the idea of prolonging the atomic power plants ' life-span .
" that is irresponsible , so long as the question of the disposal of highly radioactive waste is not solved , " struck told sunday 's edition of der tagesspiegel newspaper .
windy alternative bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is planning a massive wind energy project in the north transportation minister wolfgang tiefensee , a social democrat , told welt am sonntag he had finalized plans to build up to 30 offshore windfarms in the baltic and north seas in an attempt to meet the government 's renewable energy targets .
" we believe in renewable energy and not in nuclear energy , " he said .
the first windfarm is expected to go up off borkum island in the north sea later this year .
" the government is aiming to obtain " 25,000 megawatts of energy from windfarms by 2030 " , tiefensee said . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his extensive plans could drastically reduce the number of troops in germany . sarkozy said that the reforms would include the reduction of the 320,000-strong armed forces by around 54,000 mostly non-combat personnel , the redeployment of remaining troops and the construction of new military bases .
the president also laid out plans to invest more of the defense budget in satellites , airborne drones and other high-tech surveillance equipment .
sarkozy added that the new investment will come from cuts to the armed forces and closures of dozens of garrisons , army bases and military facilities across france and beyond .
this is expected to mean a reduction or complete withdrawal of french troops from germany .
france has between 2,800 and 4,000 soldiers stationed in the country .
french redeployment could threaten euro corps bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french armored regiments are based in germany sarkozy 's plans would also endanger the future of the joint franco-german brigade formed in 1987 .
there are some 5,400 french and german soldiers serving in the brigade , based in several southwest german towns .
the brigade is also part of the strasbourg-based euro corps which includes also soldiers from other european union countries .
the reduction or removal of the french troops - in charge of the armored regiment and the mechanized infantry within the franco-german brigade - would mean only the german light infantry , engineering and artillery units would remain under the euro corps command in germany .
it would also mean the end of an era which started with the occupation of germany after world war ii .
france was among the three western powers which were given zones to control militarily after the end of the war .
the other western powers , britain and the united states , have also been reducing troops in germany since the end of the cold war and the unification of the country .
britain and us also pulling out britain announced in 2006 that it would reduce its total armed forces in germany by 2,200 troops by 2009 as part of a " rebalancing " following the end of the cold war .
the british army still has around 22,000 troops stationed in germany .
though 4,400 troops will return to england , scotland and northern ireland , the armed forces will deploy another 2,200 military personnel in support of two armored brigades , for a net reduction of 2,200 troops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's role as a us hop-off point for iraq is ending germany has also seen a reduction in the number of us troops stationed at bases around the country , also due to a general structural shift in the us army prompted by the fight against terrorism .
dozens of american units based in germany have already been inactivated , or moved in the last two years , affecting roughly 7,200 military positions the us army wants to redeploy many of the 62,000 troops it has stationed throughout europe , and plans to reduce that number to around 24 , 000 over the next three years . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

experts disagree on whether this is an example of a new trend , or simply the exception to the rule . the flight of german businesses has long been a favorite topic among hosts of the country 's political talk shows .
experts and politicians keep pointing out that high labor costs and tax burdens force companies to relocate abroad .
asia attracts entrepreneurs who plan ahead , and china 's the big market of the future , they say . that 's why many eyebrows were raised in germany this week when toymaker steiff announced that it will be shutting down production in china by 2009 .
the german engineers ' association -lrb- vdi -rrb- followed suit by announcing that steiff was not the exception . according to a study commissioned by vdi , almost one in five companies that relocated production abroad returns to germany after a few years . while every 11th company still moves production to other countries , it 's a receding trend , according to vdi officials .

" there 's still a strong trend to invest abroad - which should n't be confused with moving production abroad , " he said , adding that a third of those companies surveyed still see china as a prime market . saying that an increasing number of companies is leaving china is wrong , treier said . while companies indicated that the need to move production abroad declined between 2003 and 2007 , the rise of the euro has again made production facilities abroad more attractive for those firms that want to sell their goods in dollars , treier said . short-sighted flight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it takes time to build networks abroad he added that shutting down production abroad was a short-sighted reaction on the part of some firms . " start-up periods , the need for local networks or costs for supervision and quality controls are often ignored , " treier said . he added that some companies are also unpleasantly surprised by the lack of skilled workers at a foreign location .
product safety is especially a concern for companies in china and a reason to leave the market again , treier said . this seems to have been the case with toymaker steiff , where officials cited a lack of quality and long transportation routes as the main reason for returning to germany .
they also said that employees would quickly change jobs if they found work elsewhere that was paid slightly better . rising energy costs could also become a reason for companies to return home in the future .

his extensive plans could drastically reduce the number of troops in germany . sarkozy said that the reforms would include the reduction of the 320,000-strong armed forces by around 54,000 mostly non-combat personnel , the redeployment of remaining troops and the construction of new military bases .
the president also laid out plans to invest more of the defense budget in satellites , airborne drones and other high-tech surveillance equipment .
sarkozy added that the new investment will come from cuts to the armed forces and closures of dozens of garrisons , army bases and military facilities across france and beyond .
this is expected to mean a reduction or complete withdrawal of french troops from germany .
france has between 2,800 and 4,000 soldiers stationed in the country .
french redeployment could threaten euro corps bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french armored regiments are based in germany sarkozy 's plans would also endanger the future of the joint franco-german brigade formed in 1987 .
there are some 5,400 french and german soldiers serving in the brigade , based in several southwest german towns .
the brigade is also part of the strasbourg-based euro corps which includes also soldiers from other european union countries .
the reduction or removal of the french troops - in charge of the armored regiment and the mechanized infantry within the franco-german brigade - would mean only the german light infantry , engineering and artillery units would remain under the euro corps command in germany .
it would also mean the end of an era which started with the occupation of germany after world war ii .
france was among the three western powers which were given zones to control militarily after the end of the war .
the other western powers , britain and the united states , have also been reducing troops in germany since the end of the cold war and the unification of the country .
britain and us also pulling out britain announced in 2006 that it would reduce its total armed forces in germany by 2,200 troops by 2009 as part of a " rebalancing " following the end of the cold war .
the british army still has around 22,000 troops stationed in germany .
though 4,400 troops will return to england , scotland and northern ireland , the armed forces will deploy another 2,200 military personnel in support of two armored brigades , for a net reduction of 2,200 troops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's role as a us hop-off point for iraq is ending germany has also seen a reduction in the number of us troops stationed at bases around the country , also due to a general structural shift in the us army prompted by the fight against terrorism .

his extensive plans could drastically reduce the number of troops in germany . sarkozy said that the reforms would include the reduction of the 320,000-strong armed forces by around 54,000 mostly non-combat personnel , the redeployment of remaining troops and the construction of new military bases .
the president also laid out plans to invest more of the defense budget in satellites , airborne drones and other high-tech surveillance equipment .
sarkozy added that the new investment will come from cuts to the armed forces and closures of dozens of garrisons , army bases and military facilities across france and beyond .
this is expected to mean a reduction or complete withdrawal of french troops from germany .
france has between 2,800 and 4,000 soldiers stationed in the country .
french redeployment could threaten euro corps bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french armored regiments are based in germany sarkozy 's plans would also endanger the future of the joint franco-german brigade formed in 1987 .
there are some 5,400 french and german soldiers serving in the brigade , based in several southwest german towns .
the brigade is also part of the strasbourg-based euro corps which includes also soldiers from other european union countries .
the reduction or removal of the french troops - in charge of the armored regiment and the mechanized infantry within the franco-german brigade - would mean only the german light infantry , engineering and artillery units would remain under the euro corps command in germany .
it would also mean the end of an era which started with the occupation of germany after world war ii .
france was among the three western powers which were given zones to control militarily after the end of the war .
the other western powers , britain and the united states , have also been reducing troops in germany since the end of the cold war and the unification of the country .
britain and us also pulling out britain announced in 2006 that it would reduce its total armed forces in germany by 2,200 troops by 2009 as part of a " rebalancing " following the end of the cold war .
the british army still has around 22,000 troops stationed in germany .
though 4,400 troops will return to england , scotland and northern ireland , the armed forces will deploy another 2,200 military personnel in support of two armored brigades , for a net reduction of 2,200 troops .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's role as a us hop-off point for iraq is ending germany has also seen a reduction in the number of us troops stationed at bases around the country , also due to a general structural shift in the us army prompted by the fight against terrorism .
dozens of american units based in germany have already been inactivated , or moved in the last two years , affecting roughly 7,200 military positions the us army wants to redeploy many of the 62,000 troops it has stationed throughout europe , and plans to reduce that number to around 24 , 000 over the next three years . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

product safety is especially a concern for companies in china and a reason to leave the market again , treier said . this seems to have been the case with toymaker steiff , where officials cited a lack of quality and long transportation routes as the main reason for returning to germany .

experts disagree on whether this is an example of a new trend , or simply the exception to the rule . the flight of german businesses has long been a favorite topic among hosts of the country 's political talk shows .
experts and politicians keep pointing out that high labor costs and tax burdens force companies to relocate abroad .
asia attracts entrepreneurs who plan ahead , and china 's the big market of the future , they say . that 's why many eyebrows were raised in germany this week when toymaker steiff announced that it will be shutting down production in china by 2009 .
the german engineers ' association -lrb- vdi -rrb- followed suit by announcing that steiff was not the exception . according to a study commissioned by vdi , almost one in five companies that relocated production abroad returns to germany after a few years . while every 11th company still moves production to other countries , it 's a receding trend , according to vdi officials . " the numbers show that the ' made in germany ' label continues to be a quality seal , " bruno o. braun , vdi 's president , said in a statement . china still attractive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many german firms still like to invest in china it 's a view that 's not shared by volker treier , the chief economist of the association of german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , who said that the vdi numbers were " clearly too high . "
treier added that there have always been companies that have returned production to germany .
the number has remained relatively steady over the last few years . treier bases his view on an annual dihk survey among 8,000 companies . " there 's still a strong trend to invest abroad - which should n't be confused with moving production abroad , " he said , adding that a third of those companies surveyed still see china as a prime market . saying that an increasing number of companies is leaving china is wrong , treier said . while companies indicated that the need to move production abroad declined between 2003 and 2007 , the rise of the euro has again made production facilities abroad more attractive for those firms that want to sell their goods in dollars , treier said . short-sighted flight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it takes time to build networks abroad he added that shutting down production abroad was a short-sighted reaction on the part of some firms . " start-up periods , the need for local networks or costs for supervision and quality controls are often ignored , " treier said . he added that some companies are also unpleasantly surprised by the lack of skilled workers at a foreign location .
product safety is especially a concern for companies in china and a reason to leave the market again , treier said . this seems to have been the case with toymaker steiff , where officials cited a lack of quality and long transportation routes as the main reason for returning to germany .
they also said that employees would quickly change jobs if they found work elsewhere that was paid slightly better . rising energy costs could also become a reason for companies to return home in the future .
while computer and car producers are currently still getting parts where they are cheapest and ship , fly or truck them to where they need them for assembly , transportation costs may end up playing a bigger role in the equation in the future . steffen leidel -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

helgoland , an island in the north sea which was once fiercely contested between britain and germany , could nearly double in size under a land reclamation project which won official clearance this week . the island was a british possession from 1807 till 1890 , then became a major german submarine base in two world wars .
in an explosion described at the time as the largest non-nuclear detonation in history , britain blew up the submarine pens in 1947 . the only part of germany which is not in sight of the mainland is a sleepy tourist resort nowadays , but a hamburg businessman arne weber wants to change that , reclaiming a gap between the island 's two halves and selling the new land . bildunterschrift : helgoland currently exists of two parts ... although large bits of helgoland collapsed in the 1947 blast , the division of the island was not the work of the british but of a storm in 1721 that washed away much of its ancient sand dunes . investing millions weber envisages an investment of 80 million euros -lrb- $ 125 million -rrb- to constantly dredge up sand for 12 months and pack it in the shallow gap to create 1 square kilometer -lrb- 0.38 square miles -rrb- of dry land as a site for apartments , hotels and a new beach . bildunterschrift : ... that weber wants to connect again this would supplement the present 1.7 square kilometers of the island , says weber , whose ancestors lived on the island .
the reclaimed land would be protected from storms in the age of global warming by walls of steel piles . the ministry of the economy of the state of schleswig-holstein said this week the project was bold but viable .
state and federal officials would be asked to throw their weight behind the project . fading tourism helgoland is hardly a world-class tourist destination , but many older germans have fond memories of crossing the sea by launch to visit it and being rowed ashore through the shallows in small boats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helgoland 's landmark , the long anna rock on the left , might collapse soon in the days before germans jetted to beaches all over the globe , it seemed like an exotic trip abroad . smokers can still buy duty-free cigarettes and whisky while staying on the island , but the holiday trade has halved since the 1970s , when 800,000 germans visited the island every year . surrounded by open sea , helgoland has a milder climate in the colder seasons than the german mainland , but there is not much to do or see on the island other than enjoy the big sky .
for some , that is an attraction . a stay on the island can resemble an ocean cruise without the sea-sickness , although the trip there and back can be rough if there is a heavy swell or a stiff breeze blowing over the north sea . bright future ahead ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helgoland 's not ready to disappear ino the sunset quite yet in the 19th century , germany was so eager to recover the bare island that it granted colonialist britain in exchange a free hand to seize the east african sultanate of zanzibar . helgoland 's mayor , frank botter , said the 1,500 residents are not quite sure what to make of the plan .
some think it is mad . others think it could bring new hope to the declining community , especially if weber introduces a better ferry service to the mainland and a pier for cruise ships is built on the island . dpa news agency -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 06.07.2008 france to push for tougher measures against illegal immigrants großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the french eu presidency sees the fight against illegal immigration as one of its priorities as part of its eu presidency , france is planning to present on monday plans for combating illegal immigration in the 27-member-block despite criticism and accusations of xenophobia . immigration minister brice hortefeux will present a " european pact on immigration and asylum " at informal talks in the french riviera resort city of cannes .
france , which took over the rotating eu presidency on july 1 , has cited the harmonization of the block 's immigration policy as one of its top priorities of its six-month eu stewardship .
" i think we are very close to an accord , " french prime minister francois fillon said on tuesday .
" there are only a few problems of semantics to resolve . "
under the proposal , eu leaders would pledge to boost the fight against those who cross the block 's borders illegally and expel more illegal immigrants .
once the eu ministers agree on the text of the proposal , the pact could be officially adopted by the leaders of the 27 states in october .
international reactions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to make sure that all its member states follow the same immigration policy the pact would be partially built upon the eu 's newly agreed returns directive which obliges the 27 member states of the eu to choose between issuing residency or other permits to illegal immigrants or returning them to their countries of origin , while empowers the authorities to detain people for up to 18 months if needed during processing .
the directive , which the european parliament adopted in june , has caused an outrage in some countries , especially in latin america .
argentine president cristina fernandez said the law recalled " times of xenophobia " and venezuelan president hugo chavez said europe had " legalised barbarity " .
he has threatened to stop selling oil to european states if they apply the new law and to cancel investments in venezuela by european countries .
unfair criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso has stood up for the eu 's immigration rules the eu has rejected accusations of intolerance .
" honestly i dont believe that the criticism is fair , " european commission president jose manuel barroso said on friday .
" the rules … are more generous than ones latin american countries have between themselves , " he told reporters .
eu officials have argued for tougher measures against illegal immigrants as a way of convincing europeans to be more welcoming of legal immigrants , which are needed in some countries considering the bloc 's negative demographics .
french immigration minister brice hortefeux attributed the failure of the irish eu reform referendum last month partly to the irish voters ' concern about immigration .
the european commission estimates there are up to 8 million illegal migrants in the eu .
more than 200,000 were arrested in the first half of 2007 with less than 90,000 expelled . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

france , which took over the rotating eu presidency on july 1 , has cited the harmonization of the block 's immigration policy as one of its top priorities of its six-month eu stewardship .
" i think we are very close to an accord , " french prime minister francois fillon said on tuesday .
" there are only a few problems of semantics to resolve . "
under the proposal , eu leaders would pledge to boost the fight against those who cross the block 's borders illegally and expel more illegal immigrants .
once the eu ministers agree on the text of the proposal , the pact could be officially adopted by the leaders of the 27 states in october .
international reactions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to make sure that all its member states follow the same immigration policy the pact would be partially built upon the eu 's newly agreed returns directive which obliges the 27 member states of the eu to choose between issuing residency or other permits to illegal immigrants or returning them to their countries of origin , while empowers the authorities to detain people for up to 18 months if needed during processing .
the directive , which the european parliament adopted in june , has caused an outrage in some countries , especially in latin america .
argentine president cristina fernandez said the law recalled " times of xenophobia " and venezuelan president hugo chavez said europe had " legalised barbarity " .
he has threatened to stop selling oil to european states if they apply the new law and to cancel investments in venezuela by european countries .
unfair criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso has stood up for the eu 's immigration rules the eu has rejected accusations of intolerance .
" honestly i dont believe that the criticism is fair , " european commission president jose manuel barroso said on friday .
" the rules … are more generous than ones latin american countries have between themselves , " he told reporters .
eu officials have argued for tougher measures against illegal immigrants as a way of convincing europeans to be more welcoming of legal immigrants , which are needed in some countries considering the bloc 's negative demographics .
french immigration minister brice hortefeux attributed the failure of the irish eu reform referendum last month partly to the irish voters ' concern about immigration .
the european commission estimates there are up to 8 million illegal migrants in the eu .
more than 200,000 were arrested in the first half of 2007 with less than 90,000 expelled . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a commons foreign affairs committee report raises concerns over allegations of corruption and intimidation in the turks and caicos islands .
the mps criticise the foreign office and british governor richard tauwhare for failing to act over the claims .
the islands ' premier , michael misick , denied corruption when he appeared before mps in london in december .
witness protection mr misick is alleged to have amassed a fortune worth millions of dollars since being elected in 2003 .
the committee is calling on the british government to set up a commission of inquiry and guarantee full protection for witnesses .
its report says mr misick is under investigation by us authorities over the alleged rape of an american citizen .
members of our committee who visited were quite shocked by the climate of fear that they discovered mike gapes foreign affairs committee the committee was contacted by more than 50 islanders with claims of corruption when it launched an inquiry into the administration of the uk 's overseas territories .

opposition leader floyd seymour told the committee mr misick had bought a £ 1.2m property outright , despite declaring assets of just £ 25,000 when he entered office .
another witness told the committee : " it appears that any and every investment in the country is gotten as a result of kick-back to a government minister or his / her immediate family . "
the mps found evidence of threats to members of the opposition who had helped the committee .
" it is deplorable and totally unacceptable for any individual who has assisted the committee with its inquiry to be subjected to threats , intimidation , or personal sanctions or violence in any form , " the mps said .
their report concluded : " the onus has been placed on local people to substantiate allegations in tci .

the vulcan , which cost £ 7m to restore , flew in a five minute display at the raf waddington international air show in lincolnshire on saturday .
the civil aviation authority gave permission for the plane to fly from its base in bruntingthorpe in leicestershire on friday .
about 125,000 people turned out to see the vulcan 's milestone flight .
some 20,000 people have contributed to the restoration fund for the bomber .
a total of £ 2.7m funding also came from the heritage lottery fund .
pilot david thomas said it was hard work flying the vulcan .
he said : " the cockpit is very small and gets very , very hot so by the time i 've done that five minute display , i 'm really covered in sweat . "
" it really is the people 's aircraft " dr robert pleming , vulcan to the sky as well as the raf waddington show , the vulcan has been given the green light to take part in the royal international air tattoo in fairford , gloucestershire , and the farnborough airshow in hampshire .
dr robert pleming , from the vulcan to the sky trust , said : " i feel so proud .
" of course this is a massive team effort , not only my own relatively small team but all the companies around the uk and the tens of thousands of the public who have supported us .
" it really is the people 's aircraft . "
the vulcan was restored over a 15-year period in bruntingthorpe but raf waddington was its home when it was operational .
earlier this year , the aircraft passed its first inspection - equivalent to an mot for planes - at the airfield where it has been kept since being decommissioned in 1993 .
designed in 1948 by roy chadwick , the aircraft could travel at speeds of up to 645mph and was capable of carrying nuclear bombs .
there were 134 vulcans built and the plane also saw action during the falklands conflict .

the vulcan , which cost £ 7m to restore , flew in a five minute display at the raf waddington international air show in lincolnshire on saturday .
the civil aviation authority gave permission for the plane to fly from its base in bruntingthorpe in leicestershire on friday .
about 125,000 people turned out to see the vulcan 's milestone flight .
some 20,000 people have contributed to the restoration fund for the bomber .
a total of £ 2.7m funding also came from the heritage lottery fund .
pilot david thomas said it was hard work flying the vulcan .
he said : " the cockpit is very small and gets very , very hot so by the time i 've done that five minute display , i 'm really covered in sweat . "

" of course this is a massive team effort , not only my own relatively small team but all the companies around the uk and the tens of thousands of the public who have supported us .
" it really is the people 's aircraft . "
the vulcan was restored over a 15-year period in bruntingthorpe but raf waddington was its home when it was operational .
earlier this year , the aircraft passed its first inspection - equivalent to an mot for planes - at the airfield where it has been kept since being decommissioned in 1993 .
designed in 1948 by roy chadwick , the aircraft could travel at speeds of up to 645mph and was capable of carrying nuclear bombs .
there were 134 vulcans built and the plane also saw action during the falklands conflict .

the vulcan , which cost £ 7m to restore , flew in a five minute display at the raf waddington international air show in lincolnshire on saturday .
the civil aviation authority gave permission for the plane to fly from its base in bruntingthorpe in leicestershire on friday .
about 125,000 people turned out to see the vulcan 's milestone flight .
some 20,000 people have contributed to the restoration fund for the bomber .
a total of £ 2.7m funding also came from the heritage lottery fund .
pilot david thomas said it was hard work flying the vulcan .
he said : " the cockpit is very small and gets very , very hot so by the time i 've done that five minute display , i 'm really covered in sweat . "
it really is the people 's aircraft dr robert pleming , vulcan to the sky as well as the raf waddington show , the vulcan has been given the green light to take part in the royal international air tattoo in fairford , gloucestershire , and the farnborough airshow in hampshire .
dr robert pleming , from the vulcan to the sky trust , said : " i feel so proud .
" of course this is a massive team effort , not only my own relatively small team but all the companies around the uk and the tens of thousands of the public who have supported us .
" it really is the people 's aircraft . "
the vulcan was restored over a 15-year period in bruntingthorpe but raf waddington was its home when it was operational .
earlier this year , the aircraft passed its first inspection - equivalent to an mot for planes - at the airfield where it has been kept since being decommissioned in 1993 .
designed in 1948 by roy chadwick , the aircraft could travel at speeds of up to 645mph and was capable of carrying nuclear bombs .
there were 134 vulcans built and the plane also saw action during the falklands conflict .
