but is culture itself , in many parts of the world , the real problem ? " a scandal " - that was german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul 's response to the un 's findings that women around the world still suffer disproportionally from poverty , lack of education , health problems and oppression .
the report , which was published on wednesday , november 12 , points out that three-fifths of the world 's poorest people are women .
women also account for the two-thirds of the world 's illiterate and 70 percent of all children without access to education .
the report also points out that sexual violence has become a part of almost all armed conflicts , and half-a-million women die , and 10-15 million more are permanently disabled , from preventable complications associated with childbirth and pregnancy .
but the un population fund 's findings are hardly a surprise .
the question is : what can be done to alleviate the plight of many of the world 's women ?
sensitivity training ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : female genital mutilation is a practice still common in some parts of the world the report recommended adapting programs aimed at helping women to local cultures .
" culturally sensitive programming is key to building this common ground , " the report concluded .
" it provides a practical and strategic response to the observation that cultural beliefs and perceptions are at the root of gender inequalities in many societies . "
the report cites examples of women being disadvantaged and oppressed in a number of countries in africa , the middle east , south america and asia .

the possibility of a gas cartel was previously discussed among russia , qatar and iran .
putin met with the egyptian prime minister while the latter was paying a four-day visit to moscow .
his comments came one day after he said the country had to act to bolster oil prices hit by the global economic crisis .

a government plan to subsidize car sales also unraveled , suggesting that berlin had not yet reached a final decision on auto industry aid . with us-based gm teetering , the multinational 's german arm opel had earlier written to german chancellor angela merkel requesting she push harder for a 40 billion euro -lrb- $ 51.4 billion -rrb- loan from the european investment bank -lrb- eib -rrb- to carmakers . opel also requested loans to german buyers of new cars and a government buy-in of elderly cars to stimulate the flagging german car market . gm , the world 's largest carmaker , meanwhile appealed to its 55,000 workers in europe to skip pay increases .
a german labor leader , rainer einenkel , rejected that , saying opel workers wanted raises . after dropping 23 percent on monday , gm shares fell another 11 percent tuesday to $ 2.99 , a 65-year low .
deutsche bank analysts predicted the share prices would fall to zero . tax breaks for low-emissions cars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cleaner cars will be rewarded with tax breaks under the current german plan no automotive aid in addition to that adopted by merkel 's cabinet last week was planned , a government spokesman told the german dpa news agency . merkel 's coalition government agreed last week on an economic stimulus package that includes a suspension of vehicle tax for one year on new cars bought in germany , with a double rebate for low-emission cars . however , that plan came unstuck tuesday , nov .
12 , with the parliamentary caucus of the social democratic party objecting to its equal treatment of large and small cars .
social democrats , who share power with merkel 's christian conservatives in a coalition government , demanded a preference for smaller cars that use less fuel . critics also said the rebate , expected to cost the government 1.4 billion euros , would be a free gift to consumers who had been planning to buy cars anyway . observers said reopening the issue might conceivably lead to aid that would be more similar to opel 's proposals . bmw to idle plant bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bmw will be stopping production at one plant during a prolonged winter break the government spokesman said in berlin the eib credit to the auto industry was likely to be decided by european union leaders at a summit next month .
he defended berlin 's stimulus package , saying it also included loans to smaller companies , which could be claimed by many auto industry suppliers . in another sign of the industry 's surplus inventory of unsold cars , premium maker bmw confirmed it would idle one of its factories for four weeks .
the site at regensburg would close from dec .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 12.11.2008 expert panel : no growth ahead as germany nears recession großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dealers are already giving deep discounts on cars , fearful that next year could see sales stagnate zero - that 's the amount of growth five leading economic institutions say germany can expect in 2009 .
they recommend more deficit spending , but can that turn around an economy on the verge of recession ? people were expecting the report issued on wednesday , nov .
12 , by the " five wise men " - as the german council of economic experts is known colloquially - to be bleak .
and it lived up to its advance billing .
" the shock waves emanating from the financial crisis have fully hit the german economy , " wrote the experts at the beginning of the report .
" after a surprisingly good start in the first quarter of 2008 , the situation has become so gloomy that germany is on the edge of recession . "
germany experienced negative growth in the second quarter of 2008 , and if data to be released on thursday confirms that the economy shrank in the third quarter as well , germany will officially be in recession .
and the new year , the experts said , wo n't bring any immediate relief .
" gross domestic product may have increased by 1.7 percent in the ongoing year , but 2009 will bring stagnation in economic output , " the council concluded .
the council put the blame for the economic downturn squarely on financial markets inside and outside of germany .
although the property market was nowhere near as overheated as in the us or britain , for example , the experts saw no chance that the german economy could escape the negative pull of the global financial crisis .
where to next ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the numbers , say those who should know , are n't going to be good the report was generally positive about the government 's short-term attempts to stave off an acute financial disaster and encouraged berlin to focus on restructuring financial institutions .
but the experts also came out against across-the-board bailouts .
" it would be wrong to keep the greatest possible number of banks alive at any cost , " the report recommended , adding that the swedish government 's response to sweden 's banking crisis in the 1990s could serve as a model .
nor did the experts have much good to say about neo-socialist calls for the state to permanently alter the system and become more involved in financial markets .
the goal , the report said , was to use restructuring to restore " an efficient and competitive " banking landscape in germany .
" that presupposes that the state backs off after a successful process of stabilization and restructuring , and concentrates on its core tasks , " the council concluded .
run up some debt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany , say the five wise men , needs more projects like this on the issue of economic stimulus , the experts reversed the trend of recent years and said germany should no longer prioritize a balanced budget .
instead , the experts recommended , berlin should try to stimulate internal consumer demand and pump money into public-works projects .
" there are good arguments for expanding net public investments next year and financing them with a higher deficit , " the report asserted .
" particularly suitable are already approved public projects in transportation infrastructure , which have been delayed due to lack of financing . "
the report also said that the european central bank should lower interest rates .
the experts did hold out some hope that falling oil prices might help boost the german economy in the latter stages of 2009 - but not enough to get the country growing again .
on saturday , leaders from the world 's biggest economies convene in washington to discuss global solutions to the financial crisis and the economic problems it has created .
but if the council of economic experts is right , germany is still going to be in for a long and bumpy ride in 2009 - roads or no roads . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" after a surprisingly good start in the first quarter of 2008 , the situation has become so gloomy that germany is on the edge of recession . "
germany experienced negative growth in the second quarter of 2008 , and if data to be released on thursday confirms that the economy shrank in the third quarter as well , germany will officially be in recession .
and the new year , the experts said , wo n't bring any immediate relief .
" gross domestic product may have increased by 1.7 percent in the ongoing year , but 2009 will bring stagnation in economic output , " the council concluded .
the council put the blame for the economic downturn squarely on financial markets inside and outside of germany .
although the property market was nowhere near as overheated as in the us or britain , for example , the experts saw no chance that the german economy could escape the negative pull of the global financial crisis .

nor did the experts have much good to say about neo-socialist calls for the state to permanently alter the system and become more involved in financial markets .

" there are good arguments for expanding net public investments next year and financing them with a higher deficit , " the report asserted .
" particularly suitable are already approved public projects in transportation infrastructure , which have been delayed due to lack of financing . "
the report also said that the european central bank should lower interest rates .
the experts did hold out some hope that falling oil prices might help boost the german economy in the latter stages of 2009 - but not enough to get the country growing again .

12 . but the plan has changed after belgrade , which continues to fight kosovo 's slide to full-fledged independence , won concessions from the west . eulex , a european law-enforcing presence of 2,000 police , judicial and customs officials , was to take over from a un mission that governed kosovo since nato ousted serbian forces from there in 1999 . in february , backed by the west , pristina unilaterally declared independence from serbia , which continues to regard the province as its territory .
kosovo is vastly dominated by albanians , though part of its northern region has a serb majority . dividing eulex ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thaci wants eulex to stick to its original mission backed by its ally russia , serbia locked the un in kosovo as it was under the nine-year-old mandate and eventually swayed brussels into reshaping eulex . pristina , on monday , was offered a modified plan for a mission that would remain under un command - and there ultimately under belgrade 's influence - in the northern , serb section of kosovo .
eulex would be run by brussels in the rest of kosovo . kosovo albanian leaders rejected the plan , fearing it would only cement the already existing partition of the territory along ethnic lines . belgrade said it would endorse the plan if the mission remains under the un 's auspices and was declared neutral in regard to kosovo 's legal status . thaci 's position caused a delay of a un security council meeting on tuesday , at which secretary-general ban ki-moon was due to present the modified plan and formally pave the way for the eulex . disputed diplomacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a total of 52 countries have recognized kosovo ban urged the kosovo government tuesday to show " pragmatism and flexibility " by agreeing to the mission with a revamped framework , but thaci maintained that eulex operate in all of kosovo . " the international community understands ... that eulex deploys in the entire territory of kosovo , " he told reporters in pristina .
" in this regard , our door has always been open . " so far 52 countries , including united states and most eu nations , have recognized kosovo , but its full promotion in the un was blocked by russia , which has veto power in the security council . in a bid to discourage more states from recognizing kosovo , serbia has filed a petition to the international court of justice at the hague for an advisory opinion on whether kosovo 's declaration of independence was legal under international law . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

having gotten the nod from the polish-born architect , the liberal jewish congregation with some 250 members is calling for donations to help finance the building .
historic site sought the site has not yet been determined , but matthias strauss , a board member of the friends of beth shalom , said he hoped it would be built on westenrieder strasse , where munich 's first synagogue was built in 1850 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2006 , a synagogue opened in munich that caters to the orthodox libeskind is expected to present his design next spring in munich , strauss said .
the group is aiming to complete the building by 2018 .
beth shalom is a member of the world union for progressive judaism , the largest jewish religious organization in the world , representing about 1.5 million jews in nearly 40 countries .
strains of judaism liberal , or reform , jews differ from orthodox jews in many ways , including the key fact that liberal jews stress equality of the sexes .
in liberal services , women and men sit together and take equal part in the liturgy , while in orthodox synagogues , women sit in upstairs galleries or behind screens , and do not take an active role in the service .
in liberal judaism , women can also become rabbis and lead congregations .

having gotten the nod from the polish-born architect , the liberal jewish congregation with some 250 members is calling for donations to help finance the building .
historic site sought the site has not yet been determined , but matthias strauss , a board member of the friends of beth shalom , said he hoped it would be built on westenrieder strasse , where munich 's first synagogue was built in 1850 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2006 , a synagogue opened in munich that caters to the orthodox libeskind is expected to present his design next spring in munich , strauss said .
the group is aiming to complete the building by 2018 .
beth shalom is a member of the world union for progressive judaism , the largest jewish religious organization in the world , representing about 1.5 million jews in nearly 40 countries .
strains of judaism liberal , or reform , jews differ from orthodox jews in many ways , including the key fact that liberal jews stress equality of the sexes .
in liberal services , women and men sit together and take equal part in the liturgy , while in orthodox synagogues , women sit in upstairs galleries or behind screens , and do not take an active role in the service .
in liberal judaism , women can also become rabbis and lead congregations .
reform judaism began in the 1920s in germany . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russia 's parliament said it will fast-track a bill to extend the term of the presidency , as early as this week .
the move may be a bid to return vladimir putin to power . approval of a kremlin bill to extend the presidential term from four to six years will be fast-tracked by the legislature and enacted by friday , russia 's parliamentary committee on constitutional legislation said wednesday , nov .
12 .
the legislation may be paving the way for prime minister vladimir putin to return to the presidency , some analysts said .
president dmitry medvedev announced he was seeking the constitutional amendment in his first state-of-the-nation address last week .
vote could be this week " we recommend that the necessary three readings of the draft law be discharged in one time , " lawmaker vladimir pligin , who heads the constitutional committee , was quoted by news agency interfax as saying .
he said the legislature could vote on the amendment as soon as friday , nov .
15 .
pligin 's comments came one day after the kremlin submitted the bill to the duma , russia 's lower house of parliament .

12 . but the plan has changed after belgrade , which continues to fight kosovo 's slide to full-fledged independence , won concessions from the west . eulex , a european law-enforcing presence of 2,000 police , judicial and customs officials , was to take over from a un mission that governed kosovo since nato ousted serbian forces from there in 1999 . in february , backed by the west , pristina unilaterally declared independence from serbia , which continues to regard the province as its territory .

eulex would be run by brussels in the rest of kosovo . kosovo albanian leaders rejected the plan , fearing it would only cement the already existing partition of the territory along ethnic lines . belgrade said it would endorse the plan if the mission remains under the un 's auspices and was declared neutral in regard to kosovo 's legal status . thaci 's position caused a delay of a un security council meeting on tuesday , at which secretary-general ban ki-moon was due to present the modified plan and formally pave the way for the eulex . disputed diplomacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a total of 52 countries have recognized kosovo ban urged the kosovo government tuesday to show " pragmatism and flexibility " by agreeing to the mission with a revamped framework , but thaci maintained that eulex operate in all of kosovo . " the international community understands ... that eulex deploys in the entire territory of kosovo , " he told reporters in pristina .
" in this regard , our door has always been open . " so far 52 countries , including united states and most eu nations , have recognized kosovo , but its full promotion in the un was blocked by russia , which has veto power in the security council . in a bid to discourage more states from recognizing kosovo , serbia has filed a petition to the international court of justice at the hague for an advisory opinion on whether kosovo 's declaration of independence was legal under international law . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

grimsson , who does not have formal powers , expressed his views at a recent luncheon for diplomats .
iceland had previously secured a tentative deal with the international monetary fund for a $ 2.1 billion loan , but the imf board has yet to approve it .
however , on wednesday , nov .
12 , it looked as if that deal were in danger of unraveling .
on tuesday , some two weeks after it initially struck the loan agreement , the imf said it was waiting for a loan for the crisis-hit island to be " fully financed " before it could be submitted to the imf executive board .
offer for moscow the imf 's backpedaling now has put a $ 6 billion loan pact under threat .
iceland 's nordic neighbors and european countries have said they want imf approval in place before they support such a package .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaupthing , iceland 's biggest bank , was taken over by the government according to an account in norway 's klassekampen , the icelandic president 's search for new friends included his offering russia the use of the former us military base keflavik , a key nato installation during the cold war .
the us pulled out of kefalavik in 2006 .
the russian ambassador , who also was present at the luncheon , said moscow had no need for the base , the report said .
at the luncheon , grimsson praised neighbors norway and the faroe islands for offering assistance , but he was critical of britain , sweden and denmark .
ongoing problems britain and the netherlands have been in talks with iceland over how to cover the money of british and dutch savers with deposits in the collapsed icelandic internet bank icesave .
last month , britain froze icelandic bank assets in its territory because of a dispute over bank deposit guarantees .
eu chief jose manuel barroso has told iceland that planned eu loans to help it out of its financial crisis are conditional .
he said the country must resolve its disputes with eu countries over compensation for depositors that lost money in icelandic banks .
iceland 's once booming financial sector has crumbled under the weight of the worldwide credit crunch , forcing the government last month to take control of major banks as its currency has nosedived . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

historic site sought the site has not yet been determined , but matthias strauss , a board member of the friends of beth shalom , said he hoped it would be built on westenrieder strasse , where munich 's first synagogue was built in 1850 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2006 , a synagogue opened in munich that caters to the orthodox libeskind is expected to present his design next spring in munich , strauss said .
the group is aiming to complete the building by 2018 .
beth shalom is a member of the world union for progressive judaism , the largest jewish religious organization in the world , representing about 1.5 million jews in nearly 40 countries .
strains of judaism liberal , or reform , jews differ from orthodox jews in many ways , including the key fact that liberal jews stress equality of the sexes .
in liberal services , women and men sit together and take equal part in the liturgy , while in orthodox synagogues , women sit in upstairs galleries or behind screens , and do not take an active role in the service .
in liberal judaism , women can also become rabbis and lead congregations .

but europe remains split of how to deal with the increasingly dire economic situation . as the world 's leading economic nations and the eu prepare to convene for the emergency economic summit in the american capital , european politicians are stressing their commitment to unity - at least in words .
even britain , traditionally somewhat of an outsider in europe , is talking togetherness .
" if we have fiscal stimulus in britain and it is not repeated in other countries , then it will have far less effect and far less benefit than if it were done in every other major economy in the world , " british prime minister gordon brown said on tuesday , nov .
11 .
those sentiments were seconded by statements coming out of brussels .
" if the eu , and in particular the euro area , is not coordinating the different actions , all the euro-area countries will lose , " said eu economics affairs head joaquin almunia .
but the very mention of the euro zone , of which britain is not a part , underscores the differing european economic attitudes that could make it difficult for the bloc to put up a unified front .
france and italy are , generally speaking , far more positively inclined toward state intervention in the economy than england or even germany .
thus , while some eu states may see the financial crisis as an occasion for governments to rein in out-of-control capitalism , others are more likely to view it as a problem to be overcome while preserving the basics of the current system .

opinion is divided even in britain , usually considered to be on the free-market extreme of the eu spectrum .
british labour legislator john mcdonnell is one of those who hopes that the response to the financial crisis goes beyond emergency cash infusions .
" there are opportunities for the left to explain how the economic system works at present , how unfair it is and what the alternatives are , " mcdonnell told reuters news agency .
but others warn that the crisis could be used as an excuse for pursuing a neo-socialist agenda .
" some governments are actually quite keen to exploit the precedent that has been set to reestablish a more … interventionist industrial policy , or economic policy more generally , " simon tilford , chief economist at the london-based think tank centre for european reform , told reuters .
the outlook is gloomy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the numbers are n't looking good however much eu member states may disagree about solutions to the crisis , the latest economic news - especially in the bloc 's largest economy - is consistently bad .
on wednesday , the five leading economic institutes in germany are expected to announce that they do not expect the country 's economy to grow at all in 2009 .
industrial output was also down across the continent in september , with the drops ranging from 0.5 percent in france to 3.6 percent in germany .
the one somewhat bright spot was provided by germany 's center for european economic research , which announced a slight improvement in its poll of investor sentiment .
at a near record low last month , the mood has improved slightly as investors have observed the government taking action to respond to the crisis .
but many experts , including unicredit economist alexander koch , still believe an economic downturn is inevitable , if indeed not already here .
" there is no doubt about it , " koch told afp news agency .
" the german economy is sliding into depression . "

amidst the financial crisis , the european commission has put forward new rules to improve assessments of companies ' creditworthiness . the regulations officially proposed in brussels on wednesday , november 12 are the brainchild of european internal market commissioner charlie mccreevy and are designed , in his words , " to restore market confidence . "
credit rating agencies , or cras , vastly overestimated the health of financial institutions such as the now-defunct lehman brothers investment bank in the us , helping to precipitate the current financial crisis .
many agencies still gave lehman brothers a fairly positive aa rating just days before it went bankrupt .
" it would be unjust and insensitive to single out the rating agencies as the single cause for the financial turbulences , but they have played their part , " mccreevy said at a press conference .
the new regulations , if approved by eu member states and the eu parliament , would subject cras to greater government supervision and dictate how they operate .
" the general drift in the eu is to try to prevent future financial crises by tightening the regulatory screw , " said philip whyte , analyst at the centre for european reform .
the message internal market commissioner mccreevy would like to send is : there 's no more business as usual .
watching the watchdogs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccreevy hopes the proposed new rules will force cras to improve under the proposed new rules , cras would be banned from providing advisory services and from rating financial instruments without sufficient information to make qualified assessments .
they would be required to disclose their methods , publish annual transparency reports and conduct independent internal review of the quality of their ratings .
the reviewers would consist of three directors whose pay would not depend on the agency 's business performance .
american companies like moody 's and standard & poor 's would also be forced to register subsidiaries in the eu .
but some eu lawmakers are n't happy with the fact that monitoring and enforcement would be carried out at the national level .
" we should quickly establish eu-wide supervision , " markus ferber , a conservative mep from germany , told dpa news agency .
going global ?
bildunterschrift : cras gave lehman brothers the thumbs up - and the bank went bankrupt still mccreevy characterizes the proposed reforms as part of an international reform effort he would like to see .
" while we are setting standards for the eu , we want these to become global standards and we will discuss them with our main international partners with that objective in mind , " mccreevy said .
those discussions will likely commence at the financial summit of the world 's leading twenty economies , which takes place this saturday in washington .
on the agenda is the role played by cras in the current global economic crisis - and how to correct the shortcomings .
if the european commission gets its way , part of the solution will be regulations to ensure that organizations responsible for evaluating the world 's major financial institutions are themselves up to the job . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but europe remains split of how to deal with the increasingly dire economic situation . as the world 's leading economic nations and the eu prepare to convene for the emergency economic summit in the american capital , european politicians are stressing their commitment to unity - at least in words .
even britain , traditionally somewhat of an outsider in europe , is talking togetherness .
" if we have fiscal stimulus in britain and it is not repeated in other countries , then it will have far less effect and far less benefit than if it were done in every other major economy in the world , " british prime minister gordon brown said on tuesday , nov .
11 .
those sentiments were seconded by statements coming out of brussels .
" if the eu , and in particular the euro area , is not coordinating the different actions , all the euro-area countries will lose , " said eu economics affairs head joaquin almunia .
but the very mention of the euro zone , of which britain is not a part , underscores the differing european economic attitudes that could make it difficult for the bloc to put up a unified front .
france and italy are , generally speaking , far more positively inclined toward state intervention in the economy than england or even germany .
thus , while some eu states may see the financial crisis as an occasion for governments to rein in out-of-control capitalism , others are more likely to view it as a problem to be overcome while preserving the basics of the current system .
to turn left , or not bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu could be heading left and the disagreements occur not only between nations but within the individual societies that make up the eu .
opinion is divided even in britain , usually considered to be on the free-market extreme of the eu spectrum .
british labour legislator john mcdonnell is one of those who hopes that the response to the financial crisis goes beyond emergency cash infusions .
" there are opportunities for the left to explain how the economic system works at present , how unfair it is and what the alternatives are , " mcdonnell told reuters news agency .
but others warn that the crisis could be used as an excuse for pursuing a neo-socialist agenda .
" some governments are actually quite keen to exploit the precedent that has been set to reestablish a more … interventionist industrial policy , or economic policy more generally , " simon tilford , chief economist at the london-based think tank centre for european reform , told reuters .
the outlook is gloomy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the numbers are n't looking good however much eu member states may disagree about solutions to the crisis , the latest economic news - especially in the bloc 's largest economy - is consistently bad .
on wednesday , the five leading economic institutes in germany are expected to announce that they do not expect the country 's economy to grow at all in 2009 .
industrial output was also down across the continent in september , with the drops ranging from 0.5 percent in france to 3.6 percent in germany .
the one somewhat bright spot was provided by germany 's center for european economic research , which announced a slight improvement in its poll of investor sentiment .
at a near record low last month , the mood has improved slightly as investors have observed the government taking action to respond to the crisis .
but many experts , including unicredit economist alexander koch , still believe an economic downturn is inevitable , if indeed not already here .
" there is no doubt about it , " koch told afp news agency .
" the german economy is sliding into depression . "
on thursday , the german government will publish its third-quarter growth figures .
if they turn out to be negative , germany will officially be in recession , which most economists define as two consecutive quarters of economic shrinkage . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a government plan to subsidize car sales also unraveled , suggesting that berlin had not yet reached a final decision on auto industry aid . with us-based gm teetering , the multinational 's german arm opel had earlier written to german chancellor angela merkel requesting she push harder for a 40 billion euro -lrb- $ 51.4 billion -rrb- loan from the european investment bank -lrb- eib -rrb- to carmakers . opel also requested loans to german buyers of new cars and a government buy-in of elderly cars to stimulate the flagging german car market . gm , the world 's largest carmaker , meanwhile appealed to its 55,000 workers in europe to skip pay increases .
a german labor leader , rainer einenkel , rejected that , saying opel workers wanted raises . after dropping 23 percent on monday , gm shares fell another 11 percent tuesday to $ 2.99 , a 65-year low .
deutsche bank analysts predicted the share prices would fall to zero . tax breaks for low-emissions cars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cleaner cars will be rewarded with tax breaks under the current german plan no automotive aid in addition to that adopted by merkel 's cabinet last week was planned , a government spokesman told the german dpa news agency . merkel 's coalition government agreed last week on an economic stimulus package that includes a suspension of vehicle tax for one year on new cars bought in germany , with a double rebate for low-emission cars . however , that plan came unstuck tuesday , nov .
12 , with the parliamentary caucus of the social democratic party objecting to its equal treatment of large and small cars .
social democrats , who share power with merkel 's christian conservatives in a coalition government , demanded a preference for smaller cars that use less fuel . critics also said the rebate , expected to cost the government 1.4 billion euros , would be a free gift to consumers who had been planning to buy cars anyway . observers said reopening the issue might conceivably lead to aid that would be more similar to opel 's proposals . bmw to idle plant bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bmw will be stopping production at one plant during a prolonged winter break the government spokesman said in berlin the eib credit to the auto industry was likely to be decided by european union leaders at a summit next month .
he defended berlin 's stimulus package , saying it also included loans to smaller companies , which could be claimed by many auto industry suppliers . in another sign of the industry 's surplus inventory of unsold cars , premium maker bmw confirmed it would idle one of its factories for four weeks .
the site at regensburg would close from dec .
8 until jan .
7 , bmw said in munich .

12 . but the plan has changed after belgrade , which continues to fight kosovo 's slide to full-fledged independence , won concessions from the west . eulex , a european law-enforcing presence of 2,000 police , judicial and customs officials , was to take over from a un mission that governed kosovo since nato ousted serbian forces from there in 1999 . in february , backed by the west , pristina unilaterally declared independence from serbia , which continues to regard the province as its territory .
kosovo is vastly dominated by albanians , though part of its northern region has a serb majority . dividing eulex ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thaci wants eulex to stick to its original mission backed by its ally russia , serbia locked the un in kosovo as it was under the nine-year-old mandate and eventually swayed brussels into reshaping eulex . pristina , on monday , was offered a modified plan for a mission that would remain under un command - and there ultimately under belgrade 's influence - in the northern , serb section of kosovo .
eulex would be run by brussels in the rest of kosovo . kosovo albanian leaders rejected the plan , fearing it would only cement the already existing partition of the territory along ethnic lines . belgrade said it would endorse the plan if the mission remains under the un 's auspices and was declared neutral in regard to kosovo 's legal status . thaci 's position caused a delay of a un security council meeting on tuesday , at which secretary-general ban ki-moon was due to present the modified plan and formally pave the way for the eulex . disputed diplomacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a total of 52 countries have recognized kosovo ban urged the kosovo government tuesday to show " pragmatism and flexibility " by agreeing to the mission with a revamped framework , but thaci maintained that eulex operate in all of kosovo . " the international community understands ... that eulex deploys in the entire territory of kosovo , " he told reporters in pristina .
" in this regard , our door has always been open . " so far 52 countries , including united states and most eu nations , have recognized kosovo , but its full promotion in the un was blocked by russia , which has veto power in the security council . in a bid to discourage more states from recognizing kosovo , serbia has filed a petition to the international court of justice at the hague for an advisory opinion on whether kosovo 's declaration of independence was legal under international law . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

having gotten the nod from the polish-born architect , the liberal jewish congregation with some 250 members is calling for donations to help finance the building .
historic site sought the site has not yet been determined , but matthias strauss , a board member of the friends of beth shalom , said he hoped it would be built on westenrieder strasse , where munich 's first synagogue was built in 1850 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2006 , a synagogue opened in munich that caters to the orthodox libeskind is expected to present his design next spring in munich , strauss said .
the group is aiming to complete the building by 2018 .
beth shalom is a member of the world union for progressive judaism , the largest jewish religious organization in the world , representing about 1.5 million jews in nearly 40 countries .
strains of judaism liberal , or reform , jews differ from orthodox jews in many ways , including the key fact that liberal jews stress equality of the sexes .
in liberal services , women and men sit together and take equal part in the liturgy , while in orthodox synagogues , women sit in upstairs galleries or behind screens , and do not take an active role in the service .
in liberal judaism , women can also become rabbis and lead congregations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de women -pipe- 12.11.2008 un report : not enough progress made on women 's rights großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un has once again drawn attention to the situation of women the united nations population fund has said culturally sensitive approaches could help alleviate undue suffering among women around the globe .
but is culture itself , in many parts of the world , the real problem ? " a scandal " - that was german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul 's response to the un 's findings that women around the world still suffer disproportionally from poverty , lack of education , health problems and oppression .
the report , which was published on wednesday , november 12 , points out that three-fifths of the world 's poorest people are women .
women also account for the two-thirds of the world 's illiterate and 70 percent of all children without access to education .
the report also points out that sexual violence has become a part of almost all armed conflicts , and half-a-million women die , and 10-15 million more are permanently disabled , from preventable complications associated with childbirth and pregnancy .
but the un population fund 's findings are hardly a surprise .
the question is : what can be done to alleviate the plight of many of the world 's women ?
sensitivity training ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : female genital mutilation is a practice still common in some parts of the world the report recommended adapting programs aimed at helping women to local cultures .
" culturally sensitive programming is key to building this common ground , " the report concluded .
" it provides a practical and strategic response to the observation that cultural beliefs and perceptions are at the root of gender inequalities in many societies . "
the report cites examples of women being disadvantaged and oppressed in a number of countries in africa , the middle east , south america and asia .
but that raises this issue of whether local cultures , especially in societies were religion plays a relatively major role , may not themselves contribute to gender inequality .
" referring to culture , values and religion should not be allowed to serve -lsb- the ultimate function of -rsb- oppressing people , " wieczorek-zeul told the ap news agency .
united nations population fund director bettina maas also said that the report was in no way intended to condone cultural practices like female genital mutilation .
but it is questionable whether well-meaning words from organizations like the un can do anything to alleviate the suffering excoriated - and rightly so - by wednesday 's report . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

12 , by the " five wise men " - as the german council of economic experts is known colloquially - to be bleak .
and it lived up to its advance billing .
" the shock waves emanating from the financial crisis have fully hit the german economy , " wrote the experts at the beginning of the report .
" after a surprisingly good start in the first quarter of 2008 , the situation has become so gloomy that germany is on the edge of recession . "
germany experienced negative growth in the second quarter of 2008 , and if data to be released on thursday confirms that the economy shrank in the third quarter as well , germany will officially be in recession .
and the new year , the experts said , wo n't bring any immediate relief .
" gross domestic product may have increased by 1.7 percent in the ongoing year , but 2009 will bring stagnation in economic output , " the council concluded .
the council put the blame for the economic downturn squarely on financial markets inside and outside of germany .
although the property market was nowhere near as overheated as in the us or britain , for example , the experts saw no chance that the german economy could escape the negative pull of the global financial crisis .

" it would be wrong to keep the greatest possible number of banks alive at any cost , " the report recommended , adding that the swedish government 's response to sweden 's banking crisis in the 1990s could serve as a model .
nor did the experts have much good to say about neo-socialist calls for the state to permanently alter the system and become more involved in financial markets .
the goal , the report said , was to use restructuring to restore " an efficient and competitive " banking landscape in germany .
" that presupposes that the state backs off after a successful process of stabilization and restructuring , and concentrates on its core tasks , " the council concluded .

" there are good arguments for expanding net public investments next year and financing them with a higher deficit , " the report asserted .
" particularly suitable are already approved public projects in transportation infrastructure , which have been delayed due to lack of financing . "
the report also said that the european central bank should lower interest rates .
the experts did hold out some hope that falling oil prices might help boost the german economy in the latter stages of 2009 - but not enough to get the country growing again .

they recommend more deficit spending , but can that turn around an economy on the verge of recession ? people were expecting the report issued on wednesday , nov .
12 , by the " five wise men " - as the german council of economic experts is known colloquially - to be bleak .
and it lived up to its advance billing .
" the shock waves emanating from the financial crisis have fully hit the german economy , " wrote the experts at the beginning of the report .
" after a surprisingly good start in the first quarter of 2008 , the situation has become so gloomy that germany is on the edge of recession . "
germany experienced negative growth in the second quarter of 2008 , and if data to be released on thursday confirms that the economy shrank in the third quarter as well , germany will officially be in recession .
and the new year , the experts said , wo n't bring any immediate relief .
" gross domestic product may have increased by 1.7 percent in the ongoing year , but 2009 will bring stagnation in economic output , " the council concluded .
the council put the blame for the economic downturn squarely on financial markets inside and outside of germany .
although the property market was nowhere near as overheated as in the us or britain , for example , the experts saw no chance that the german economy could escape the negative pull of the global financial crisis .
where to next ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the numbers , say those who should know , are n't going to be good the report was generally positive about the government 's short-term attempts to stave off an acute financial disaster and encouraged berlin to focus on restructuring financial institutions .
but the experts also came out against across-the-board bailouts .
" it would be wrong to keep the greatest possible number of banks alive at any cost , " the report recommended , adding that the swedish government 's response to sweden 's banking crisis in the 1990s could serve as a model .
nor did the experts have much good to say about neo-socialist calls for the state to permanently alter the system and become more involved in financial markets .
the goal , the report said , was to use restructuring to restore " an efficient and competitive " banking landscape in germany .
" that presupposes that the state backs off after a successful process of stabilization and restructuring , and concentrates on its core tasks , " the council concluded .
run up some debt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany , say the five wise men , needs more projects like this on the issue of economic stimulus , the experts reversed the trend of recent years and said germany should no longer prioritize a balanced budget .
instead , the experts recommended , berlin should try to stimulate internal consumer demand and pump money into public-works projects .
" there are good arguments for expanding net public investments next year and financing them with a higher deficit , " the report asserted .
" particularly suitable are already approved public projects in transportation infrastructure , which have been delayed due to lack of financing . "
the report also said that the european central bank should lower interest rates .
the experts did hold out some hope that falling oil prices might help boost the german economy in the latter stages of 2009 - but not enough to get the country growing again .
on saturday , leaders from the world 's biggest economies convene in washington to discuss global solutions to the financial crisis and the economic problems it has created .

russia 's parliament said it will fast-track a bill to extend the term of the presidency , as early as this week .
the move may be a bid to return vladimir putin to power . approval of a kremlin bill to extend the presidential term from four to six years will be fast-tracked by the legislature and enacted by friday , russia 's parliamentary committee on constitutional legislation said wednesday , nov .
12 .
the legislation may be paving the way for prime minister vladimir putin to return to the presidency , some analysts said .
president dmitry medvedev announced he was seeking the constitutional amendment in his first state-of-the-nation address last week .
vote could be this week " we recommend that the necessary three readings of the draft law be discharged in one time , " lawmaker vladimir pligin , who heads the constitutional committee , was quoted by news agency interfax as saying .
he said the legislature could vote on the amendment as soon as friday , nov .
15 .
pligin 's comments came one day after the kremlin submitted the bill to the duma , russia 's lower house of parliament .
suspected power play for putin medvedev 's administration can easily muster the two-thirds majority in parliament needed to enact the change , after the dominant pro-kremlin party headed by his predecessor vladimir putin swept the polls in last year 's vote .
but legal experts say the term extensions would only apply to future presidents .

" it 's absolutely clear that prices for gas from the start of 2009 for european consumers will go down , " gazprom chief executive alexei miller told ria novosti news service said late tuesday , nov .

miller acknowledged that gas prices are at a record high , and analysts told afp news agency they have been expecting a drop in russian gas prices for a while now .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu depends on russia for about a quarter of its gas russian gas price movements shadow the price of oil , which is falling - albeit with a time lag .
" we will produce as much gas as consumers need .
gazprom 's extraction capacity is significantly higher than the amount it extracts , " miller was quoted as saying .
speaking alongside miller , the chief executive of german chemical company basf , juergen hambrecht , also predicted a reduction in gas prices for europe , but starting in the second quarter of 2009 .
putin : russia wants sovereignty the european union relies on russia for about a quarter of its gas supplies .
meanwhile , russian prime minister vladimir putin sought to ease fears over the possibility of russia joining an opec-style cartel of gas exporting countries .
in talks with his egyptian counterpart ahmed nazif , he said : " we support this idea .
but we know about apprehensions and even fears voiced by certain energy consumers , " news agency interfax reported .
" i wish to state once and for all : there are no grounds for such fears . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's promise : no gas cartel he said energy exporting countries should coordinate policy to ensure " uninterrupted " energy supplies to consumers , but added that russia would n't forgo its independence to sign a cartel agreement with other states .
" none of us is going to cede part of our sovereignty in making decisions , " putin noted .
the possibility of a gas cartel was previously discussed among russia , qatar and iran .
putin met with the egyptian prime minister while the latter was paying a four-day visit to moscow .
his comments came one day after he said the country had to act to bolster oil prices hit by the global economic crisis .
his comments suggested that russia was aiming to become a swing producer .
" as one of the major exporters and producers of oil and petroleum products , russia can not sit out from the formulation of global prices for this natural resource , " putin was quoted by local media as saying monday . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

even britain , traditionally somewhat of an outsider in europe , is talking togetherness .

but europe remains split of how to deal with the increasingly dire economic situation . as the world 's leading economic nations and the eu prepare to convene for the emergency economic summit in the american capital , european politicians are stressing their commitment to unity - at least in words .
even britain , traditionally somewhat of an outsider in europe , is talking togetherness .
" if we have fiscal stimulus in britain and it is not repeated in other countries , then it will have far less effect and far less benefit than if it were done in every other major economy in the world , " british prime minister gordon brown said on tuesday , nov .
11 .
those sentiments were seconded by statements coming out of brussels .
" if the eu , and in particular the euro area , is not coordinating the different actions , all the euro-area countries will lose , " said eu economics affairs head joaquin almunia .
but the very mention of the euro zone , of which britain is not a part , underscores the differing european economic attitudes that could make it difficult for the bloc to put up a unified front .
france and italy are , generally speaking , far more positively inclined toward state intervention in the economy than england or even germany .
thus , while some eu states may see the financial crisis as an occasion for governments to rein in out-of-control capitalism , others are more likely to view it as a problem to be overcome while preserving the basics of the current system .
to turn left , or not bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu could be heading left and the disagreements occur not only between nations but within the individual societies that make up the eu .
opinion is divided even in britain , usually considered to be on the free-market extreme of the eu spectrum .
british labour legislator john mcdonnell is one of those who hopes that the response to the financial crisis goes beyond emergency cash infusions .
" there are opportunities for the left to explain how the economic system works at present , how unfair it is and what the alternatives are , " mcdonnell told reuters news agency .
but others warn that the crisis could be used as an excuse for pursuing a neo-socialist agenda .
" some governments are actually quite keen to exploit the precedent that has been set to reestablish a more … interventionist industrial policy , or economic policy more generally , " simon tilford , chief economist at the london-based think tank centre for european reform , told reuters .
the outlook is gloomy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the numbers are n't looking good however much eu member states may disagree about solutions to the crisis , the latest economic news - especially in the bloc 's largest economy - is consistently bad .
on wednesday , the five leading economic institutes in germany are expected to announce that they do not expect the country 's economy to grow at all in 2009 .
industrial output was also down across the continent in september , with the drops ranging from 0.5 percent in france to 3.6 percent in germany .
the one somewhat bright spot was provided by germany 's center for european economic research , which announced a slight improvement in its poll of investor sentiment .
at a near record low last month , the mood has improved slightly as investors have observed the government taking action to respond to the crisis .
but many experts , including unicredit economist alexander koch , still believe an economic downturn is inevitable , if indeed not already here .
" there is no doubt about it , " koch told afp news agency .
" the german economy is sliding into depression . "

amidst the financial crisis , the european commission has put forward new rules to improve assessments of companies ' creditworthiness . the regulations officially proposed in brussels on wednesday , november 12 are the brainchild of european internal market commissioner charlie mccreevy and are designed , in his words , " to restore market confidence . "
credit rating agencies , or cras , vastly overestimated the health of financial institutions such as the now-defunct lehman brothers investment bank in the us , helping to precipitate the current financial crisis .
many agencies still gave lehman brothers a fairly positive aa rating just days before it went bankrupt .
" it would be unjust and insensitive to single out the rating agencies as the single cause for the financial turbulences , but they have played their part , " mccreevy said at a press conference .
the new regulations , if approved by eu member states and the eu parliament , would subject cras to greater government supervision and dictate how they operate .
" the general drift in the eu is to try to prevent future financial crises by tightening the regulatory screw , " said philip whyte , analyst at the centre for european reform .
the message internal market commissioner mccreevy would like to send is : there 's no more business as usual .
watching the watchdogs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccreevy hopes the proposed new rules will force cras to improve under the proposed new rules , cras would be banned from providing advisory services and from rating financial instruments without sufficient information to make qualified assessments .
they would be required to disclose their methods , publish annual transparency reports and conduct independent internal review of the quality of their ratings .
the reviewers would consist of three directors whose pay would not depend on the agency 's business performance .
american companies like moody 's and standard & poor 's would also be forced to register subsidiaries in the eu .
but some eu lawmakers are n't happy with the fact that monitoring and enforcement would be carried out at the national level .
" we should quickly establish eu-wide supervision , " markus ferber , a conservative mep from germany , told dpa news agency .

" while we are setting standards for the eu , we want these to become global standards and we will discuss them with our main international partners with that objective in mind , " mccreevy said .
those discussions will likely commence at the financial summit of the world 's leading twenty economies , which takes place this saturday in washington .
on the agenda is the role played by cras in the current global economic crisis - and how to correct the shortcomings .

having gotten the nod from the polish-born architect , the liberal jewish congregation with some 250 members is calling for donations to help finance the building .
historic site sought the site has not yet been determined , but matthias strauss , a board member of the friends of beth shalom , said he hoped it would be built on westenrieder strasse , where munich 's first synagogue was built in 1850 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2006 , a synagogue opened in munich that caters to the orthodox libeskind is expected to present his design next spring in munich , strauss said .
the group is aiming to complete the building by 2018 .
beth shalom is a member of the world union for progressive judaism , the largest jewish religious organization in the world , representing about 1.5 million jews in nearly 40 countries .
strains of judaism liberal , or reform , jews differ from orthodox jews in many ways , including the key fact that liberal jews stress equality of the sexes .
in liberal services , women and men sit together and take equal part in the liturgy , while in orthodox synagogues , women sit in upstairs galleries or behind screens , and do not take an active role in the service .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 12.11.2008 expert panel : no growth ahead as germany nears recession großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dealers are already giving deep discounts on cars , fearful that next year could see sales stagnate zero - that 's the amount of growth five leading economic institutions say germany can expect in 2009 .
they recommend more deficit spending , but can that turn around an economy on the verge of recession ? people were expecting the report issued on wednesday , nov .
12 , by the " five wise men " - as the german council of economic experts is known colloquially - to be bleak .
and it lived up to its advance billing .
" the shock waves emanating from the financial crisis have fully hit the german economy , " wrote the experts at the beginning of the report .
" after a surprisingly good start in the first quarter of 2008 , the situation has become so gloomy that germany is on the edge of recession . "
germany experienced negative growth in the second quarter of 2008 , and if data to be released on thursday confirms that the economy shrank in the third quarter as well , germany will officially be in recession .
and the new year , the experts said , wo n't bring any immediate relief .
" gross domestic product may have increased by 1.7 percent in the ongoing year , but 2009 will bring stagnation in economic output , " the council concluded .
the council put the blame for the economic downturn squarely on financial markets inside and outside of germany .
although the property market was nowhere near as overheated as in the us or britain , for example , the experts saw no chance that the german economy could escape the negative pull of the global financial crisis .
where to next ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the numbers , say those who should know , are n't going to be good the report was generally positive about the government 's short-term attempts to stave off an acute financial disaster and encouraged berlin to focus on restructuring financial institutions .
but the experts also came out against across-the-board bailouts .
" it would be wrong to keep the greatest possible number of banks alive at any cost , " the report recommended , adding that the swedish government 's response to sweden 's banking crisis in the 1990s could serve as a model .
nor did the experts have much good to say about neo-socialist calls for the state to permanently alter the system and become more involved in financial markets .
the goal , the report said , was to use restructuring to restore " an efficient and competitive " banking landscape in germany .
" that presupposes that the state backs off after a successful process of stabilization and restructuring , and concentrates on its core tasks , " the council concluded .
run up some debt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany , say the five wise men , needs more projects like this on the issue of economic stimulus , the experts reversed the trend of recent years and said germany should no longer prioritize a balanced budget .
instead , the experts recommended , berlin should try to stimulate internal consumer demand and pump money into public-works projects .
" there are good arguments for expanding net public investments next year and financing them with a higher deficit , " the report asserted .
" particularly suitable are already approved public projects in transportation infrastructure , which have been delayed due to lack of financing . "
the report also said that the european central bank should lower interest rates .
the experts did hold out some hope that falling oil prices might help boost the german economy in the latter stages of 2009 - but not enough to get the country growing again .
on saturday , leaders from the world 's biggest economies convene in washington to discuss global solutions to the financial crisis and the economic problems it has created .
but if the council of economic experts is right , germany is still going to be in for a long and bumpy ride in 2009 - roads or no roads . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

12 . but the plan has changed after belgrade , which continues to fight kosovo 's slide to full-fledged independence , won concessions from the west . eulex , a european law-enforcing presence of 2,000 police , judicial and customs officials , was to take over from a un mission that governed kosovo since nato ousted serbian forces from there in 1999 . in february , backed by the west , pristina unilaterally declared independence from serbia , which continues to regard the province as its territory .
kosovo is vastly dominated by albanians , though part of its northern region has a serb majority . dividing eulex ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thaci wants eulex to stick to its original mission backed by its ally russia , serbia locked the un in kosovo as it was under the nine-year-old mandate and eventually swayed brussels into reshaping eulex . pristina , on monday , was offered a modified plan for a mission that would remain under un command - and there ultimately under belgrade 's influence - in the northern , serb section of kosovo .
eulex would be run by brussels in the rest of kosovo . kosovo albanian leaders rejected the plan , fearing it would only cement the already existing partition of the territory along ethnic lines . belgrade said it would endorse the plan if the mission remains under the un 's auspices and was declared neutral in regard to kosovo 's legal status . thaci 's position caused a delay of a un security council meeting on tuesday , at which secretary-general ban ki-moon was due to present the modified plan and formally pave the way for the eulex . disputed diplomacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a total of 52 countries have recognized kosovo ban urged the kosovo government tuesday to show " pragmatism and flexibility " by agreeing to the mission with a revamped framework , but thaci maintained that eulex operate in all of kosovo . " the international community understands ... that eulex deploys in the entire territory of kosovo , " he told reporters in pristina .
" in this regard , our door has always been open . " so far 52 countries , including united states and most eu nations , have recognized kosovo , but its full promotion in the un was blocked by russia , which has veto power in the security council . in a bid to discourage more states from recognizing kosovo , serbia has filed a petition to the international court of justice at the hague for an advisory opinion on whether kosovo 's declaration of independence was legal under international law . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

12 . but the plan has changed after belgrade , which continues to fight kosovo 's slide to full-fledged independence , won concessions from the west . eulex , a european law-enforcing presence of 2,000 police , judicial and customs officials , was to take over from a un mission that governed kosovo since nato ousted serbian forces from there in 1999 . in february , backed by the west , pristina unilaterally declared independence from serbia , which continues to regard the province as its territory .
kosovo is vastly dominated by albanians , though part of its northern region has a serb majority . dividing eulex ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thaci wants eulex to stick to its original mission backed by its ally russia , serbia locked the un in kosovo as it was under the nine-year-old mandate and eventually swayed brussels into reshaping eulex . pristina , on monday , was offered a modified plan for a mission that would remain under un command - and there ultimately under belgrade 's influence - in the northern , serb section of kosovo .
eulex would be run by brussels in the rest of kosovo . kosovo albanian leaders rejected the plan , fearing it would only cement the already existing partition of the territory along ethnic lines . belgrade said it would endorse the plan if the mission remains under the un 's auspices and was declared neutral in regard to kosovo 's legal status . thaci 's position caused a delay of a un security council meeting on tuesday , at which secretary-general ban ki-moon was due to present the modified plan and formally pave the way for the eulex . disputed diplomacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a total of 52 countries have recognized kosovo ban urged the kosovo government tuesday to show " pragmatism and flexibility " by agreeing to the mission with a revamped framework , but thaci maintained that eulex operate in all of kosovo . " the international community understands ... that eulex deploys in the entire territory of kosovo , " he told reporters in pristina .
" in this regard , our door has always been open . " so far 52 countries , including united states and most eu nations , have recognized kosovo , but its full promotion in the un was blocked by russia , which has veto power in the security council . in a bid to discourage more states from recognizing kosovo , serbia has filed a petition to the international court of justice at the hague for an advisory opinion on whether kosovo 's declaration of independence was legal under international law . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russia 's parliament said it will fast-track a bill to extend the term of the presidency , as early as this week .
the move may be a bid to return vladimir putin to power . approval of a kremlin bill to extend the presidential term from four to six years will be fast-tracked by the legislature and enacted by friday , russia 's parliamentary committee on constitutional legislation said wednesday , nov .
12 .
the legislation may be paving the way for prime minister vladimir putin to return to the presidency , some analysts said .
president dmitry medvedev announced he was seeking the constitutional amendment in his first state-of-the-nation address last week .
vote could be this week " we recommend that the necessary three readings of the draft law be discharged in one time , " lawmaker vladimir pligin , who heads the constitutional committee , was quoted by news agency interfax as saying .
he said the legislature could vote on the amendment as soon as friday , nov .
15 .
pligin 's comments came one day after the kremlin submitted the bill to the duma , russia 's lower house of parliament .
suspected power play for putin medvedev 's administration can easily muster the two-thirds majority in parliament needed to enact the change , after the dominant pro-kremlin party headed by his predecessor vladimir putin swept the polls in last year 's vote .

but is culture itself , in many parts of the world , the real problem ? " a scandal " - that was german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul 's response to the un 's findings that women around the world still suffer disproportionally from poverty , lack of education , health problems and oppression .
the report , which was published on wednesday , november 12 , points out that three-fifths of the world 's poorest people are women .
women also account for the two-thirds of the world 's illiterate and 70 percent of all children without access to education .
the report also points out that sexual violence has become a part of almost all armed conflicts , and half-a-million women die , and 10-15 million more are permanently disabled , from preventable complications associated with childbirth and pregnancy .
but the un population fund 's findings are hardly a surprise .
the question is : what can be done to alleviate the plight of many of the world 's women ?
sensitivity training ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : female genital mutilation is a practice still common in some parts of the world the report recommended adapting programs aimed at helping women to local cultures .
" culturally sensitive programming is key to building this common ground , " the report concluded .
" it provides a practical and strategic response to the observation that cultural beliefs and perceptions are at the root of gender inequalities in many societies . "
the report cites examples of women being disadvantaged and oppressed in a number of countries in africa , the middle east , south america and asia .
but that raises this issue of whether local cultures , especially in societies were religion plays a relatively major role , may not themselves contribute to gender inequality .
" referring to culture , values and religion should not be allowed to serve -lsb- the ultimate function of -rsb- oppressing people , " wieczorek-zeul told the ap news agency .
united nations population fund director bettina maas also said that the report was in no way intended to condone cultural practices like female genital mutilation .
but it is questionable whether well-meaning words from organizations like the un can do anything to alleviate the suffering excoriated - and rightly so - by wednesday 's report . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a ceremony on wednesday was to be attended by some 20 officials , while the relatives would be invited at a later date .

" it 's absolutely clear that prices for gas from the start of 2009 for european consumers will go down , " gazprom chief executive alexei miller told ria novosti news service said late tuesday , nov .
11 .
miller acknowledged that gas prices are at a record high , and analysts told afp news agency they have been expecting a drop in russian gas prices for a while now .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu depends on russia for about a quarter of its gas russian gas price movements shadow the price of oil , which is falling - albeit with a time lag .
" we will produce as much gas as consumers need .
gazprom 's extraction capacity is significantly higher than the amount it extracts , " miller was quoted as saying .
speaking alongside miller , the chief executive of german chemical company basf , juergen hambrecht , also predicted a reduction in gas prices for europe , but starting in the second quarter of 2009 .
putin : russia wants sovereignty the european union relies on russia for about a quarter of its gas supplies .
meanwhile , russian prime minister vladimir putin sought to ease fears over the possibility of russia joining an opec-style cartel of gas exporting countries .
in talks with his egyptian counterpart ahmed nazif , he said : " we support this idea .
but we know about apprehensions and even fears voiced by certain energy consumers , " news agency interfax reported .
" i wish to state once and for all : there are no grounds for such fears . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's promise : no gas cartel he said energy exporting countries should coordinate policy to ensure " uninterrupted " energy supplies to consumers , but added that russia would n't forgo its independence to sign a cartel agreement with other states .
" none of us is going to cede part of our sovereignty in making decisions , " putin noted .
the possibility of a gas cartel was previously discussed among russia , qatar and iran .
putin met with the egyptian prime minister while the latter was paying a four-day visit to moscow .
his comments came one day after he said the country had to act to bolster oil prices hit by the global economic crisis .
his comments suggested that russia was aiming to become a swing producer .
" as one of the major exporters and producers of oil and petroleum products , russia can not sit out from the formulation of global prices for this natural resource , " putin was quoted by local media as saying monday . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but europe remains split of how to deal with the increasingly dire economic situation . as the world 's leading economic nations and the eu prepare to convene for the emergency economic summit in the american capital , european politicians are stressing their commitment to unity - at least in words .
even britain , traditionally somewhat of an outsider in europe , is talking togetherness .
" if we have fiscal stimulus in britain and it is not repeated in other countries , then it will have far less effect and far less benefit than if it were done in every other major economy in the world , " british prime minister gordon brown said on tuesday , nov .
11 .
those sentiments were seconded by statements coming out of brussels .
" if the eu , and in particular the euro area , is not coordinating the different actions , all the euro-area countries will lose , " said eu economics affairs head joaquin almunia .
but the very mention of the euro zone , of which britain is not a part , underscores the differing european economic attitudes that could make it difficult for the bloc to put up a unified front .
france and italy are , generally speaking , far more positively inclined toward state intervention in the economy than england or even germany .
thus , while some eu states may see the financial crisis as an occasion for governments to rein in out-of-control capitalism , others are more likely to view it as a problem to be overcome while preserving the basics of the current system .
to turn left , or not bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu could be heading left and the disagreements occur not only between nations but within the individual societies that make up the eu .
opinion is divided even in britain , usually considered to be on the free-market extreme of the eu spectrum .
british labour legislator john mcdonnell is one of those who hopes that the response to the financial crisis goes beyond emergency cash infusions .
" there are opportunities for the left to explain how the economic system works at present , how unfair it is and what the alternatives are , " mcdonnell told reuters news agency .
but others warn that the crisis could be used as an excuse for pursuing a neo-socialist agenda .
" some governments are actually quite keen to exploit the precedent that has been set to reestablish a more … interventionist industrial policy , or economic policy more generally , " simon tilford , chief economist at the london-based think tank centre for european reform , told reuters .
the outlook is gloomy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the numbers are n't looking good however much eu member states may disagree about solutions to the crisis , the latest economic news - especially in the bloc 's largest economy - is consistently bad .
on wednesday , the five leading economic institutes in germany are expected to announce that they do not expect the country 's economy to grow at all in 2009 .
industrial output was also down across the continent in september , with the drops ranging from 0.5 percent in france to 3.6 percent in germany .
the one somewhat bright spot was provided by germany 's center for european economic research , which announced a slight improvement in its poll of investor sentiment .
at a near record low last month , the mood has improved slightly as investors have observed the government taking action to respond to the crisis .
but many experts , including unicredit economist alexander koch , still believe an economic downturn is inevitable , if indeed not already here .
" there is no doubt about it , " koch told afp news agency .
" the german economy is sliding into depression . "
on thursday , the german government will publish its third-quarter growth figures .
if they turn out to be negative , germany will officially be in recession , which most economists define as two consecutive quarters of economic shrinkage . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but europe remains split of how to deal with the increasingly dire economic situation . as the world 's leading economic nations and the eu prepare to convene for the emergency economic summit in the american capital , european politicians are stressing their commitment to unity - at least in words .
even britain , traditionally somewhat of an outsider in europe , is talking togetherness .
" if we have fiscal stimulus in britain and it is not repeated in other countries , then it will have far less effect and far less benefit than if it were done in every other major economy in the world , " british prime minister gordon brown said on tuesday , nov .
11 .
those sentiments were seconded by statements coming out of brussels .
" if the eu , and in particular the euro area , is not coordinating the different actions , all the euro-area countries will lose , " said eu economics affairs head joaquin almunia .
but the very mention of the euro zone , of which britain is not a part , underscores the differing european economic attitudes that could make it difficult for the bloc to put up a unified front .
france and italy are , generally speaking , far more positively inclined toward state intervention in the economy than england or even germany .
thus , while some eu states may see the financial crisis as an occasion for governments to rein in out-of-control capitalism , others are more likely to view it as a problem to be overcome while preserving the basics of the current system .
to turn left , or not bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu could be heading left and the disagreements occur not only between nations but within the individual societies that make up the eu .
opinion is divided even in britain , usually considered to be on the free-market extreme of the eu spectrum .
british labour legislator john mcdonnell is one of those who hopes that the response to the financial crisis goes beyond emergency cash infusions .
" there are opportunities for the left to explain how the economic system works at present , how unfair it is and what the alternatives are , " mcdonnell told reuters news agency .
but others warn that the crisis could be used as an excuse for pursuing a neo-socialist agenda .
" some governments are actually quite keen to exploit the precedent that has been set to reestablish a more … interventionist industrial policy , or economic policy more generally , " simon tilford , chief economist at the london-based think tank centre for european reform , told reuters .
the outlook is gloomy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the numbers are n't looking good however much eu member states may disagree about solutions to the crisis , the latest economic news - especially in the bloc 's largest economy - is consistently bad .
on wednesday , the five leading economic institutes in germany are expected to announce that they do not expect the country 's economy to grow at all in 2009 .
industrial output was also down across the continent in september , with the drops ranging from 0.5 percent in france to 3.6 percent in germany .
the one somewhat bright spot was provided by germany 's center for european economic research , which announced a slight improvement in its poll of investor sentiment .
at a near record low last month , the mood has improved slightly as investors have observed the government taking action to respond to the crisis .
but many experts , including unicredit economist alexander koch , still believe an economic downturn is inevitable , if indeed not already here .
" there is no doubt about it , " koch told afp news agency .
" the german economy is sliding into depression . "
on thursday , the german government will publish its third-quarter growth figures .
if they turn out to be negative , germany will officially be in recession , which most economists define as two consecutive quarters of economic shrinkage . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but europe remains split of how to deal with the increasingly dire economic situation . as the world 's leading economic nations and the eu prepare to convene for the emergency economic summit in the american capital , european politicians are stressing their commitment to unity - at least in words .
even britain , traditionally somewhat of an outsider in europe , is talking togetherness .
" if we have fiscal stimulus in britain and it is not repeated in other countries , then it will have far less effect and far less benefit than if it were done in every other major economy in the world , " british prime minister gordon brown said on tuesday , nov .
11 .
those sentiments were seconded by statements coming out of brussels .
" if the eu , and in particular the euro area , is not coordinating the different actions , all the euro-area countries will lose , " said eu economics affairs head joaquin almunia .
but the very mention of the euro zone , of which britain is not a part , underscores the differing european economic attitudes that could make it difficult for the bloc to put up a unified front .
france and italy are , generally speaking , far more positively inclined toward state intervention in the economy than england or even germany .
thus , while some eu states may see the financial crisis as an occasion for governments to rein in out-of-control capitalism , others are more likely to view it as a problem to be overcome while preserving the basics of the current system .
to turn left , or not bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu could be heading left and the disagreements occur not only between nations but within the individual societies that make up the eu .
opinion is divided even in britain , usually considered to be on the free-market extreme of the eu spectrum .
british labour legislator john mcdonnell is one of those who hopes that the response to the financial crisis goes beyond emergency cash infusions .
" there are opportunities for the left to explain how the economic system works at present , how unfair it is and what the alternatives are , " mcdonnell told reuters news agency .
but others warn that the crisis could be used as an excuse for pursuing a neo-socialist agenda .
" some governments are actually quite keen to exploit the precedent that has been set to reestablish a more … interventionist industrial policy , or economic policy more generally , " simon tilford , chief economist at the london-based think tank centre for european reform , told reuters .
the outlook is gloomy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the numbers are n't looking good however much eu member states may disagree about solutions to the crisis , the latest economic news - especially in the bloc 's largest economy - is consistently bad .
on wednesday , the five leading economic institutes in germany are expected to announce that they do not expect the country 's economy to grow at all in 2009 .
industrial output was also down across the continent in september , with the drops ranging from 0.5 percent in france to 3.6 percent in germany .
the one somewhat bright spot was provided by germany 's center for european economic research , which announced a slight improvement in its poll of investor sentiment .
at a near record low last month , the mood has improved slightly as investors have observed the government taking action to respond to the crisis .
but many experts , including unicredit economist alexander koch , still believe an economic downturn is inevitable , if indeed not already here .
" there is no doubt about it , " koch told afp news agency .
" the german economy is sliding into depression . "
on thursday , the german government will publish its third-quarter growth figures .
if they turn out to be negative , germany will officially be in recession , which most economists define as two consecutive quarters of economic shrinkage . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

grimsson , who does not have formal powers , expressed his views at a recent luncheon for diplomats .
iceland had previously secured a tentative deal with the international monetary fund for a $ 2.1 billion loan , but the imf board has yet to approve it .
however , on wednesday , nov .
12 , it looked as if that deal were in danger of unraveling .

the us pulled out of kefalavik in 2006 .
the russian ambassador , who also was present at the luncheon , said moscow had no need for the base , the report said .

but europe remains split of how to deal with the increasingly dire economic situation . as the world 's leading economic nations and the eu prepare to convene for the emergency economic summit in the american capital , european politicians are stressing their commitment to unity - at least in words .
even britain , traditionally somewhat of an outsider in europe , is talking togetherness .
" if we have fiscal stimulus in britain and it is not repeated in other countries , then it will have far less effect and far less benefit than if it were done in every other major economy in the world , " british prime minister gordon brown said on tuesday , nov .
11 .
those sentiments were seconded by statements coming out of brussels .
" if the eu , and in particular the euro area , is not coordinating the different actions , all the euro-area countries will lose , " said eu economics affairs head joaquin almunia .
but the very mention of the euro zone , of which britain is not a part , underscores the differing european economic attitudes that could make it difficult for the bloc to put up a unified front .
france and italy are , generally speaking , far more positively inclined toward state intervention in the economy than england or even germany .
thus , while some eu states may see the financial crisis as an occasion for governments to rein in out-of-control capitalism , others are more likely to view it as a problem to be overcome while preserving the basics of the current system .
to turn left , or not bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu could be heading left and the disagreements occur not only between nations but within the individual societies that make up the eu .
opinion is divided even in britain , usually considered to be on the free-market extreme of the eu spectrum .
british labour legislator john mcdonnell is one of those who hopes that the response to the financial crisis goes beyond emergency cash infusions .
" there are opportunities for the left to explain how the economic system works at present , how unfair it is and what the alternatives are , " mcdonnell told reuters news agency .
but others warn that the crisis could be used as an excuse for pursuing a neo-socialist agenda .
" some governments are actually quite keen to exploit the precedent that has been set to reestablish a more … interventionist industrial policy , or economic policy more generally , " simon tilford , chief economist at the london-based think tank centre for european reform , told reuters .
the outlook is gloomy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the numbers are n't looking good however much eu member states may disagree about solutions to the crisis , the latest economic news - especially in the bloc 's largest economy - is consistently bad .
on wednesday , the five leading economic institutes in germany are expected to announce that they do not expect the country 's economy to grow at all in 2009 .
industrial output was also down across the continent in september , with the drops ranging from 0.5 percent in france to 3.6 percent in germany .
the one somewhat bright spot was provided by germany 's center for european economic research , which announced a slight improvement in its poll of investor sentiment .
at a near record low last month , the mood has improved slightly as investors have observed the government taking action to respond to the crisis .
but many experts , including unicredit economist alexander koch , still believe an economic downturn is inevitable , if indeed not already here .
" there is no doubt about it , " koch told afp news agency .
" the german economy is sliding into depression . "
on thursday , the german government will publish its third-quarter growth figures .
if they turn out to be negative , germany will officially be in recession , which most economists define as two consecutive quarters of economic shrinkage . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 12.11.2008 expert panel : no growth ahead as germany nears recession großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dealers are already giving deep discounts on cars , fearful that next year could see sales stagnate zero - that 's the amount of growth five leading economic institutions say germany can expect in 2009 .
they recommend more deficit spending , but can that turn around an economy on the verge of recession ? people were expecting the report issued on wednesday , nov .
12 , by the " five wise men " - as the german council of economic experts is known colloquially - to be bleak .
and it lived up to its advance billing .
" the shock waves emanating from the financial crisis have fully hit the german economy , " wrote the experts at the beginning of the report .
" after a surprisingly good start in the first quarter of 2008 , the situation has become so gloomy that germany is on the edge of recession . "
germany experienced negative growth in the second quarter of 2008 , and if data to be released on thursday confirms that the economy shrank in the third quarter as well , germany will officially be in recession .
and the new year , the experts said , wo n't bring any immediate relief .
" gross domestic product may have increased by 1.7 percent in the ongoing year , but 2009 will bring stagnation in economic output , " the council concluded .
the council put the blame for the economic downturn squarely on financial markets inside and outside of germany .
although the property market was nowhere near as overheated as in the us or britain , for example , the experts saw no chance that the german economy could escape the negative pull of the global financial crisis .
where to next ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the numbers , say those who should know , are n't going to be good the report was generally positive about the government 's short-term attempts to stave off an acute financial disaster and encouraged berlin to focus on restructuring financial institutions .
but the experts also came out against across-the-board bailouts .
" it would be wrong to keep the greatest possible number of banks alive at any cost , " the report recommended , adding that the swedish government 's response to sweden 's banking crisis in the 1990s could serve as a model .
nor did the experts have much good to say about neo-socialist calls for the state to permanently alter the system and become more involved in financial markets .
the goal , the report said , was to use restructuring to restore " an efficient and competitive " banking landscape in germany .
" that presupposes that the state backs off after a successful process of stabilization and restructuring , and concentrates on its core tasks , " the council concluded .
run up some debt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany , say the five wise men , needs more projects like this on the issue of economic stimulus , the experts reversed the trend of recent years and said germany should no longer prioritize a balanced budget .
instead , the experts recommended , berlin should try to stimulate internal consumer demand and pump money into public-works projects .
" there are good arguments for expanding net public investments next year and financing them with a higher deficit , " the report asserted .
" particularly suitable are already approved public projects in transportation infrastructure , which have been delayed due to lack of financing . "
the report also said that the european central bank should lower interest rates .
the experts did hold out some hope that falling oil prices might help boost the german economy in the latter stages of 2009 - but not enough to get the country growing again .
on saturday , leaders from the world 's biggest economies convene in washington to discuss global solutions to the financial crisis and the economic problems it has created .
but if the council of economic experts is right , germany is still going to be in for a long and bumpy ride in 2009 - roads or no roads . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they recommend more deficit spending , but can that turn around an economy on the verge of recession ? people were expecting the report issued on wednesday , nov .
12 , by the " five wise men " - as the german council of economic experts is known colloquially - to be bleak .
and it lived up to its advance billing .
" the shock waves emanating from the financial crisis have fully hit the german economy , " wrote the experts at the beginning of the report .
" after a surprisingly good start in the first quarter of 2008 , the situation has become so gloomy that germany is on the edge of recession . "
germany experienced negative growth in the second quarter of 2008 , and if data to be released on thursday confirms that the economy shrank in the third quarter as well , germany will officially be in recession .
and the new year , the experts said , wo n't bring any immediate relief .
" gross domestic product may have increased by 1.7 percent in the ongoing year , but 2009 will bring stagnation in economic output , " the council concluded .
the council put the blame for the economic downturn squarely on financial markets inside and outside of germany .
although the property market was nowhere near as overheated as in the us or britain , for example , the experts saw no chance that the german economy could escape the negative pull of the global financial crisis .
where to next ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the numbers , say those who should know , are n't going to be good the report was generally positive about the government 's short-term attempts to stave off an acute financial disaster and encouraged berlin to focus on restructuring financial institutions .
but the experts also came out against across-the-board bailouts .
" it would be wrong to keep the greatest possible number of banks alive at any cost , " the report recommended , adding that the swedish government 's response to sweden 's banking crisis in the 1990s could serve as a model .
nor did the experts have much good to say about neo-socialist calls for the state to permanently alter the system and become more involved in financial markets .
the goal , the report said , was to use restructuring to restore " an efficient and competitive " banking landscape in germany .
" that presupposes that the state backs off after a successful process of stabilization and restructuring , and concentrates on its core tasks , " the council concluded .
run up some debt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany , say the five wise men , needs more projects like this on the issue of economic stimulus , the experts reversed the trend of recent years and said germany should no longer prioritize a balanced budget .
instead , the experts recommended , berlin should try to stimulate internal consumer demand and pump money into public-works projects .
" there are good arguments for expanding net public investments next year and financing them with a higher deficit , " the report asserted .
" particularly suitable are already approved public projects in transportation infrastructure , which have been delayed due to lack of financing . "
the report also said that the european central bank should lower interest rates .
the experts did hold out some hope that falling oil prices might help boost the german economy in the latter stages of 2009 - but not enough to get the country growing again .
on saturday , leaders from the world 's biggest economies convene in washington to discuss global solutions to the financial crisis and the economic problems it has created .

a government plan to subsidize car sales also unraveled , suggesting that berlin had not yet reached a final decision on auto industry aid . with us-based gm teetering , the multinational 's german arm opel had earlier written to german chancellor angela merkel requesting she push harder for a 40 billion euro -lrb- $ 51.4 billion -rrb- loan from the european investment bank -lrb- eib -rrb- to carmakers . opel also requested loans to german buyers of new cars and a government buy-in of elderly cars to stimulate the flagging german car market . gm , the world 's largest carmaker , meanwhile appealed to its 55,000 workers in europe to skip pay increases .
a german labor leader , rainer einenkel , rejected that , saying opel workers wanted raises . after dropping 23 percent on monday , gm shares fell another 11 percent tuesday to $ 2.99 , a 65-year low .
deutsche bank analysts predicted the share prices would fall to zero . tax breaks for low-emissions cars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cleaner cars will be rewarded with tax breaks under the current german plan no automotive aid in addition to that adopted by merkel 's cabinet last week was planned , a government spokesman told the german dpa news agency . merkel 's coalition government agreed last week on an economic stimulus package that includes a suspension of vehicle tax for one year on new cars bought in germany , with a double rebate for low-emission cars . however , that plan came unstuck tuesday , nov .
12 , with the parliamentary caucus of the social democratic party objecting to its equal treatment of large and small cars .
social democrats , who share power with merkel 's christian conservatives in a coalition government , demanded a preference for smaller cars that use less fuel . critics also said the rebate , expected to cost the government 1.4 billion euros , would be a free gift to consumers who had been planning to buy cars anyway . observers said reopening the issue might conceivably lead to aid that would be more similar to opel 's proposals . bmw to idle plant bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bmw will be stopping production at one plant during a prolonged winter break the government spokesman said in berlin the eib credit to the auto industry was likely to be decided by european union leaders at a summit next month .
he defended berlin 's stimulus package , saying it also included loans to smaller companies , which could be claimed by many auto industry suppliers . in another sign of the industry 's surplus inventory of unsold cars , premium maker bmw confirmed it would idle one of its factories for four weeks .
the site at regensburg would close from dec .
8 until jan .
7 , bmw said in munich .
several other german carmakers , including daimler and volkswagen , have said they would temporarily shut down or extend holiday breaks at their plants . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

having gotten the nod from the polish-born architect , the liberal jewish congregation with some 250 members is calling for donations to help finance the building .
historic site sought the site has not yet been determined , but matthias strauss , a board member of the friends of beth shalom , said he hoped it would be built on westenrieder strasse , where munich 's first synagogue was built in 1850 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2006 , a synagogue opened in munich that caters to the orthodox libeskind is expected to present his design next spring in munich , strauss said .
the group is aiming to complete the building by 2018 .
beth shalom is a member of the world union for progressive judaism , the largest jewish religious organization in the world , representing about 1.5 million jews in nearly 40 countries .
strains of judaism liberal , or reform , jews differ from orthodox jews in many ways , including the key fact that liberal jews stress equality of the sexes .
in liberal services , women and men sit together and take equal part in the liturgy , while in orthodox synagogues , women sit in upstairs galleries or behind screens , and do not take an active role in the service .
in liberal judaism , women can also become rabbis and lead congregations .

but europe remains split of how to deal with the increasingly dire economic situation . as the world 's leading economic nations and the eu prepare to convene for the emergency economic summit in the american capital , european politicians are stressing their commitment to unity - at least in words .
even britain , traditionally somewhat of an outsider in europe , is talking togetherness .
" if we have fiscal stimulus in britain and it is not repeated in other countries , then it will have far less effect and far less benefit than if it were done in every other major economy in the world , " british prime minister gordon brown said on tuesday , nov .
11 .
those sentiments were seconded by statements coming out of brussels .
" if the eu , and in particular the euro area , is not coordinating the different actions , all the euro-area countries will lose , " said eu economics affairs head joaquin almunia .
but the very mention of the euro zone , of which britain is not a part , underscores the differing european economic attitudes that could make it difficult for the bloc to put up a unified front .
france and italy are , generally speaking , far more positively inclined toward state intervention in the economy than england or even germany .
thus , while some eu states may see the financial crisis as an occasion for governments to rein in out-of-control capitalism , others are more likely to view it as a problem to be overcome while preserving the basics of the current system .

british labour legislator john mcdonnell is one of those who hopes that the response to the financial crisis goes beyond emergency cash infusions .
" there are opportunities for the left to explain how the economic system works at present , how unfair it is and what the alternatives are , " mcdonnell told reuters news agency .
but others warn that the crisis could be used as an excuse for pursuing a neo-socialist agenda .
" some governments are actually quite keen to exploit the precedent that has been set to reestablish a more … interventionist industrial policy , or economic policy more generally , " simon tilford , chief economist at the london-based think tank centre for european reform , told reuters .
the outlook is gloomy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the numbers are n't looking good however much eu member states may disagree about solutions to the crisis , the latest economic news - especially in the bloc 's largest economy - is consistently bad .
on wednesday , the five leading economic institutes in germany are expected to announce that they do not expect the country 's economy to grow at all in 2009 .
industrial output was also down across the continent in september , with the drops ranging from 0.5 percent in france to 3.6 percent in germany .
the one somewhat bright spot was provided by germany 's center for european economic research , which announced a slight improvement in its poll of investor sentiment .
at a near record low last month , the mood has improved slightly as investors have observed the government taking action to respond to the crisis .
but many experts , including unicredit economist alexander koch , still believe an economic downturn is inevitable , if indeed not already here .

but europe remains split of how to deal with the increasingly dire economic situation . as the world 's leading economic nations and the eu prepare to convene for the emergency economic summit in the american capital , european politicians are stressing their commitment to unity - at least in words .
even britain , traditionally somewhat of an outsider in europe , is talking togetherness .
" if we have fiscal stimulus in britain and it is not repeated in other countries , then it will have far less effect and far less benefit than if it were done in every other major economy in the world , " british prime minister gordon brown said on tuesday , nov .
11 .
those sentiments were seconded by statements coming out of brussels .
" if the eu , and in particular the euro area , is not coordinating the different actions , all the euro-area countries will lose , " said eu economics affairs head joaquin almunia .
but the very mention of the euro zone , of which britain is not a part , underscores the differing european economic attitudes that could make it difficult for the bloc to put up a unified front .
france and italy are , generally speaking , far more positively inclined toward state intervention in the economy than england or even germany .
thus , while some eu states may see the financial crisis as an occasion for governments to rein in out-of-control capitalism , others are more likely to view it as a problem to be overcome while preserving the basics of the current system .
to turn left , or not bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu could be heading left and the disagreements occur not only between nations but within the individual societies that make up the eu .
opinion is divided even in britain , usually considered to be on the free-market extreme of the eu spectrum .
british labour legislator john mcdonnell is one of those who hopes that the response to the financial crisis goes beyond emergency cash infusions .
" there are opportunities for the left to explain how the economic system works at present , how unfair it is and what the alternatives are , " mcdonnell told reuters news agency .
but others warn that the crisis could be used as an excuse for pursuing a neo-socialist agenda .
" some governments are actually quite keen to exploit the precedent that has been set to reestablish a more … interventionist industrial policy , or economic policy more generally , " simon tilford , chief economist at the london-based think tank centre for european reform , told reuters .
the outlook is gloomy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the numbers are n't looking good however much eu member states may disagree about solutions to the crisis , the latest economic news - especially in the bloc 's largest economy - is consistently bad .
on wednesday , the five leading economic institutes in germany are expected to announce that they do not expect the country 's economy to grow at all in 2009 .
industrial output was also down across the continent in september , with the drops ranging from 0.5 percent in france to 3.6 percent in germany .
the one somewhat bright spot was provided by germany 's center for european economic research , which announced a slight improvement in its poll of investor sentiment .
at a near record low last month , the mood has improved slightly as investors have observed the government taking action to respond to the crisis .
but many experts , including unicredit economist alexander koch , still believe an economic downturn is inevitable , if indeed not already here .
" there is no doubt about it , " koch told afp news agency .
" the german economy is sliding into depression . "
on thursday , the german government will publish its third-quarter growth figures .

a government plan to subsidize car sales also unraveled , suggesting that berlin had not yet reached a final decision on auto industry aid . with us-based gm teetering , the multinational 's german arm opel had earlier written to german chancellor angela merkel requesting she push harder for a 40 billion euro -lrb- $ 51.4 billion -rrb- loan from the european investment bank -lrb- eib -rrb- to carmakers . opel also requested loans to german buyers of new cars and a government buy-in of elderly cars to stimulate the flagging german car market . gm , the world 's largest carmaker , meanwhile appealed to its 55,000 workers in europe to skip pay increases .
a german labor leader , rainer einenkel , rejected that , saying opel workers wanted raises . after dropping 23 percent on monday , gm shares fell another 11 percent tuesday to $ 2.99 , a 65-year low .

social democrats , who share power with merkel 's christian conservatives in a coalition government , demanded a preference for smaller cars that use less fuel . critics also said the rebate , expected to cost the government 1.4 billion euros , would be a free gift to consumers who had been planning to buy cars anyway . observers said reopening the issue might conceivably lead to aid that would be more similar to opel 's proposals . bmw to idle plant bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bmw will be stopping production at one plant during a prolonged winter break the government spokesman said in berlin the eib credit to the auto industry was likely to be decided by european union leaders at a summit next month .

grimsson , who does not have formal powers , expressed his views at a recent luncheon for diplomats .
iceland had previously secured a tentative deal with the international monetary fund for a $ 2.1 billion loan , but the imf board has yet to approve it .
however , on wednesday , nov .
12 , it looked as if that deal were in danger of unraveling .
on tuesday , some two weeks after it initially struck the loan agreement , the imf said it was waiting for a loan for the crisis-hit island to be " fully financed " before it could be submitted to the imf executive board .
offer for moscow the imf 's backpedaling now has put a $ 6 billion loan pact under threat .
iceland 's nordic neighbors and european countries have said they want imf approval in place before they support such a package .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaupthing , iceland 's biggest bank , was taken over by the government according to an account in norway 's klassekampen , the icelandic president 's search for new friends included his offering russia the use of the former us military base keflavik , a key nato installation during the cold war .
the us pulled out of kefalavik in 2006 .
the russian ambassador , who also was present at the luncheon , said moscow had no need for the base , the report said .
at the luncheon , grimsson praised neighbors norway and the faroe islands for offering assistance , but he was critical of britain , sweden and denmark .
ongoing problems britain and the netherlands have been in talks with iceland over how to cover the money of british and dutch savers with deposits in the collapsed icelandic internet bank icesave .
last month , britain froze icelandic bank assets in its territory because of a dispute over bank deposit guarantees .
eu chief jose manuel barroso has told iceland that planned eu loans to help it out of its financial crisis are conditional .
he said the country must resolve its disputes with eu countries over compensation for depositors that lost money in icelandic banks .
iceland 's once booming financial sector has crumbled under the weight of the worldwide credit crunch , forcing the government last month to take control of major banks as its currency has nosedived . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

grimsson , who does not have formal powers , expressed his views at a recent luncheon for diplomats .
iceland had previously secured a tentative deal with the international monetary fund for a $ 2.1 billion loan , but the imf board has yet to approve it .
however , on wednesday , nov .
12 , it looked as if that deal were in danger of unraveling .
on tuesday , some two weeks after it initially struck the loan agreement , the imf said it was waiting for a loan for the crisis-hit island to be " fully financed " before it could be submitted to the imf executive board .
offer for moscow the imf 's backpedaling now has put a $ 6 billion loan pact under threat .
iceland 's nordic neighbors and european countries have said they want imf approval in place before they support such a package .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaupthing , iceland 's biggest bank , was taken over by the government according to an account in norway 's klassekampen , the icelandic president 's search for new friends included his offering russia the use of the former us military base keflavik , a key nato installation during the cold war .
the us pulled out of kefalavik in 2006 .
the russian ambassador , who also was present at the luncheon , said moscow had no need for the base , the report said .
at the luncheon , grimsson praised neighbors norway and the faroe islands for offering assistance , but he was critical of britain , sweden and denmark .
ongoing problems britain and the netherlands have been in talks with iceland over how to cover the money of british and dutch savers with deposits in the collapsed icelandic internet bank icesave .
last month , britain froze icelandic bank assets in its territory because of a dispute over bank deposit guarantees .
eu chief jose manuel barroso has told iceland that planned eu loans to help it out of its financial crisis are conditional .
he said the country must resolve its disputes with eu countries over compensation for depositors that lost money in icelandic banks .
iceland 's once booming financial sector has crumbled under the weight of the worldwide credit crunch , forcing the government last month to take control of major banks as its currency has nosedived . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the us pulled out of kefalavik in 2006 .
the russian ambassador , who also was present at the luncheon , said moscow had no need for the base , the report said .
at the luncheon , grimsson praised neighbors norway and the faroe islands for offering assistance , but he was critical of britain , sweden and denmark .
ongoing problems britain and the netherlands have been in talks with iceland over how to cover the money of british and dutch savers with deposits in the collapsed icelandic internet bank icesave .
last month , britain froze icelandic bank assets in its territory because of a dispute over bank deposit guarantees .
eu chief jose manuel barroso has told iceland that planned eu loans to help it out of its financial crisis are conditional .
he said the country must resolve its disputes with eu countries over compensation for depositors that lost money in icelandic banks .

the final selection of the esa 's two crew members plus two others who will train as their back-ups will be announced in mid-december . " surprisingly , there is no competitive mood among the remaining candidates , " mars500 program manager jennifer ngo-anh told deutsche welle .
" they are just getting really excited and are highly motivated to participate . " tough medical tests the candidates were subjected to various medical tests at the central clinical hospital of the russian academy of sciences .
they underwent extensive examinations , as well as screenings by a neurologist , a dentist , a psychologist and an ophthalmologist . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the finalists will have to endure over three months of conditions that simulate life in a space shuttle " the tests were very invasive .

the initial 105-day study will be followed by a longer follow-up later in 2009 , in which another six-member crew will spend 520 days together . the distance between earth and mars varies between 55 million and more than 400 million kilometers -lrb- 250 million and 34 million miles -rrb- , which means that a round trip to the planet would take at least 18 months . esa and nasa have separately sketched dates around three decades from now for a historic manned flight to mars . dw staff -lrb- ew -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

12 , by the " five wise men " - as the german council of economic experts is known colloquially - to be bleak .
and it lived up to its advance billing .
" the shock waves emanating from the financial crisis have fully hit the german economy , " wrote the experts at the beginning of the report .
" after a surprisingly good start in the first quarter of 2008 , the situation has become so gloomy that germany is on the edge of recession . "
germany experienced negative growth in the second quarter of 2008 , and if data to be released on thursday confirms that the economy shrank in the third quarter as well , germany will officially be in recession .
and the new year , the experts said , wo n't bring any immediate relief .
" gross domestic product may have increased by 1.7 percent in the ongoing year , but 2009 will bring stagnation in economic output , " the council concluded .
the council put the blame for the economic downturn squarely on financial markets inside and outside of germany .

" it would be wrong to keep the greatest possible number of banks alive at any cost , " the report recommended , adding that the swedish government 's response to sweden 's banking crisis in the 1990s could serve as a model .
nor did the experts have much good to say about neo-socialist calls for the state to permanently alter the system and become more involved in financial markets .
the goal , the report said , was to use restructuring to restore " an efficient and competitive " banking landscape in germany .

" there are good arguments for expanding net public investments next year and financing them with a higher deficit , " the report asserted .
" particularly suitable are already approved public projects in transportation infrastructure , which have been delayed due to lack of financing . "
the report also said that the european central bank should lower interest rates .
the experts did hold out some hope that falling oil prices might help boost the german economy in the latter stages of 2009 - but not enough to get the country growing again .

the final selection of the esa 's two crew members plus two others who will train as their back-ups will be announced in mid-december . " surprisingly , there is no competitive mood among the remaining candidates , " mars500 program manager jennifer ngo-anh told deutsche welle .
" they are just getting really excited and are highly motivated to participate . " tough medical tests the candidates were subjected to various medical tests at the central clinical hospital of the russian academy of sciences .
they underwent extensive examinations , as well as screenings by a neurologist , a dentist , a psychologist and an ophthalmologist . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the finalists will have to endure over three months of conditions that simulate life in a space shuttle " the tests were very invasive .
they pushed the men to their limits , " said jennifer ngo-anh , adding that examinations such as the colonoscopy caused real discomfort . this testing was necessary to ensure that the final crew consists of healthy individuals who are able to cope with isolated and unusual living conditions . a new venture for esa this is the first time esa has embarked on an experiment of this kind .
the initial 105-day study will be followed by a longer follow-up later in 2009 , in which another six-member crew will spend 520 days together . the distance between earth and mars varies between 55 million and more than 400 million kilometers -lrb- 250 million and 34 million miles -rrb- , which means that a round trip to the planet would take at least 18 months . esa and nasa have separately sketched dates around three decades from now for a historic manned flight to mars . dw staff -lrb- ew -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

women also account for the two-thirds of the world 's illiterate and 70 percent of all children without access to education .

12 . but the plan has changed after belgrade , which continues to fight kosovo 's slide to full-fledged independence , won concessions from the west . eulex , a european law-enforcing presence of 2,000 police , judicial and customs officials , was to take over from a un mission that governed kosovo since nato ousted serbian forces from there in 1999 . in february , backed by the west , pristina unilaterally declared independence from serbia , which continues to regard the province as its territory .
kosovo is vastly dominated by albanians , though part of its northern region has a serb majority . dividing eulex ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thaci wants eulex to stick to its original mission backed by its ally russia , serbia locked the un in kosovo as it was under the nine-year-old mandate and eventually swayed brussels into reshaping eulex . pristina , on monday , was offered a modified plan for a mission that would remain under un command - and there ultimately under belgrade 's influence - in the northern , serb section of kosovo .
eulex would be run by brussels in the rest of kosovo . kosovo albanian leaders rejected the plan , fearing it would only cement the already existing partition of the territory along ethnic lines . belgrade said it would endorse the plan if the mission remains under the un 's auspices and was declared neutral in regard to kosovo 's legal status . thaci 's position caused a delay of a un security council meeting on tuesday , at which secretary-general ban ki-moon was due to present the modified plan and formally pave the way for the eulex . disputed diplomacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a total of 52 countries have recognized kosovo ban urged the kosovo government tuesday to show " pragmatism and flexibility " by agreeing to the mission with a revamped framework , but thaci maintained that eulex operate in all of kosovo .

but is culture itself , in many parts of the world , the real problem ? " a scandal " - that was german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul 's response to the un 's findings that women around the world still suffer disproportionally from poverty , lack of education , health problems and oppression .
the report , which was published on wednesday , november 12 , points out that three-fifths of the world 's poorest people are women .
women also account for the two-thirds of the world 's illiterate and 70 percent of all children without access to education .
the report also points out that sexual violence has become a part of almost all armed conflicts , and half-a-million women die , and 10-15 million more are permanently disabled , from preventable complications associated with childbirth and pregnancy .
but the un population fund 's findings are hardly a surprise .
the question is : what can be done to alleviate the plight of many of the world 's women ?
sensitivity training ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : female genital mutilation is a practice still common in some parts of the world the report recommended adapting programs aimed at helping women to local cultures .
" culturally sensitive programming is key to building this common ground , " the report concluded .
" it provides a practical and strategic response to the observation that cultural beliefs and perceptions are at the root of gender inequalities in many societies . "
the report cites examples of women being disadvantaged and oppressed in a number of countries in africa , the middle east , south america and asia .
but that raises this issue of whether local cultures , especially in societies were religion plays a relatively major role , may not themselves contribute to gender inequality .
" referring to culture , values and religion should not be allowed to serve -lsb- the ultimate function of -rsb- oppressing people , " wieczorek-zeul told the ap news agency .
united nations population fund director bettina maas also said that the report was in no way intended to condone cultural practices like female genital mutilation .
but it is questionable whether well-meaning words from organizations like the un can do anything to alleviate the suffering excoriated - and rightly so - by wednesday 's report . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the council put the blame for the economic downturn squarely on financial markets inside and outside of germany .
although the property market was nowhere near as overheated as in the us or britain , for example , the experts saw no chance that the german economy could escape the negative pull of the global financial crisis .
where to next ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the numbers , say those who should know , are n't going to be good the report was generally positive about the government 's short-term attempts to stave off an acute financial disaster and encouraged berlin to focus on restructuring financial institutions .
but the experts also came out against across-the-board bailouts .
" it would be wrong to keep the greatest possible number of banks alive at any cost , " the report recommended , adding that the swedish government 's response to sweden 's banking crisis in the 1990s could serve as a model .
nor did the experts have much good to say about neo-socialist calls for the state to permanently alter the system and become more involved in financial markets .
the goal , the report said , was to use restructuring to restore " an efficient and competitive " banking landscape in germany .
" that presupposes that the state backs off after a successful process of stabilization and restructuring , and concentrates on its core tasks , " the council concluded .
run up some debt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany , say the five wise men , needs more projects like this on the issue of economic stimulus , the experts reversed the trend of recent years and said germany should no longer prioritize a balanced budget .
instead , the experts recommended , berlin should try to stimulate internal consumer demand and pump money into public-works projects .
" there are good arguments for expanding net public investments next year and financing them with a higher deficit , " the report asserted .
" particularly suitable are already approved public projects in transportation infrastructure , which have been delayed due to lack of financing . "
the report also said that the european central bank should lower interest rates .
the experts did hold out some hope that falling oil prices might help boost the german economy in the latter stages of 2009 - but not enough to get the country growing again .
on saturday , leaders from the world 's biggest economies convene in washington to discuss global solutions to the financial crisis and the economic problems it has created .

but europe remains split of how to deal with the increasingly dire economic situation . as the world 's leading economic nations and the eu prepare to convene for the emergency economic summit in the american capital , european politicians are stressing their commitment to unity - at least in words .
even britain , traditionally somewhat of an outsider in europe , is talking togetherness .
" if we have fiscal stimulus in britain and it is not repeated in other countries , then it will have far less effect and far less benefit than if it were done in every other major economy in the world , " british prime minister gordon brown said on tuesday , nov .
11 .
those sentiments were seconded by statements coming out of brussels .
" if the eu , and in particular the euro area , is not coordinating the different actions , all the euro-area countries will lose , " said eu economics affairs head joaquin almunia .
but the very mention of the euro zone , of which britain is not a part , underscores the differing european economic attitudes that could make it difficult for the bloc to put up a unified front .
france and italy are , generally speaking , far more positively inclined toward state intervention in the economy than england or even germany .
thus , while some eu states may see the financial crisis as an occasion for governments to rein in out-of-control capitalism , others are more likely to view it as a problem to be overcome while preserving the basics of the current system .
to turn left , or not bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu could be heading left and the disagreements occur not only between nations but within the individual societies that make up the eu .
opinion is divided even in britain , usually considered to be on the free-market extreme of the eu spectrum .
british labour legislator john mcdonnell is one of those who hopes that the response to the financial crisis goes beyond emergency cash infusions .
" there are opportunities for the left to explain how the economic system works at present , how unfair it is and what the alternatives are , " mcdonnell told reuters news agency .
but others warn that the crisis could be used as an excuse for pursuing a neo-socialist agenda .
" some governments are actually quite keen to exploit the precedent that has been set to reestablish a more … interventionist industrial policy , or economic policy more generally , " simon tilford , chief economist at the london-based think tank centre for european reform , told reuters .
the outlook is gloomy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the numbers are n't looking good however much eu member states may disagree about solutions to the crisis , the latest economic news - especially in the bloc 's largest economy - is consistently bad .
on wednesday , the five leading economic institutes in germany are expected to announce that they do not expect the country 's economy to grow at all in 2009 .
industrial output was also down across the continent in september , with the drops ranging from 0.5 percent in france to 3.6 percent in germany .
the one somewhat bright spot was provided by germany 's center for european economic research , which announced a slight improvement in its poll of investor sentiment .
at a near record low last month , the mood has improved slightly as investors have observed the government taking action to respond to the crisis .
but many experts , including unicredit economist alexander koch , still believe an economic downturn is inevitable , if indeed not already here .
" there is no doubt about it , " koch told afp news agency .
" the german economy is sliding into depression . "
on thursday , the german government will publish its third-quarter growth figures .
if they turn out to be negative , germany will officially be in recession , which most economists define as two consecutive quarters of economic shrinkage . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

grimsson , who does not have formal powers , expressed his views at a recent luncheon for diplomats .
iceland had previously secured a tentative deal with the international monetary fund for a $ 2.1 billion loan , but the imf board has yet to approve it .
however , on wednesday , nov .
12 , it looked as if that deal were in danger of unraveling .
on tuesday , some two weeks after it initially struck the loan agreement , the imf said it was waiting for a loan for the crisis-hit island to be " fully financed " before it could be submitted to the imf executive board .
offer for moscow the imf 's backpedaling now has put a $ 6 billion loan pact under threat .
iceland 's nordic neighbors and european countries have said they want imf approval in place before they support such a package .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaupthing , iceland 's biggest bank , was taken over by the government according to an account in norway 's klassekampen , the icelandic president 's search for new friends included his offering russia the use of the former us military base keflavik , a key nato installation during the cold war .
the us pulled out of kefalavik in 2006 .
the russian ambassador , who also was present at the luncheon , said moscow had no need for the base , the report said .
at the luncheon , grimsson praised neighbors norway and the faroe islands for offering assistance , but he was critical of britain , sweden and denmark .
ongoing problems britain and the netherlands have been in talks with iceland over how to cover the money of british and dutch savers with deposits in the collapsed icelandic internet bank icesave .
last month , britain froze icelandic bank assets in its territory because of a dispute over bank deposit guarantees .
eu chief jose manuel barroso has told iceland that planned eu loans to help it out of its financial crisis are conditional .
he said the country must resolve its disputes with eu countries over compensation for depositors that lost money in icelandic banks .
iceland 's once booming financial sector has crumbled under the weight of the worldwide credit crunch , forcing the government last month to take control of major banks as its currency has nosedived . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

having gotten the nod from the polish-born architect , the liberal jewish congregation with some 250 members is calling for donations to help finance the building .
historic site sought the site has not yet been determined , but matthias strauss , a board member of the friends of beth shalom , said he hoped it would be built on westenrieder strasse , where munich 's first synagogue was built in 1850 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2006 , a synagogue opened in munich that caters to the orthodox libeskind is expected to present his design next spring in munich , strauss said .
the group is aiming to complete the building by 2018 .
beth shalom is a member of the world union for progressive judaism , the largest jewish religious organization in the world , representing about 1.5 million jews in nearly 40 countries .
strains of judaism liberal , or reform , jews differ from orthodox jews in many ways , including the key fact that liberal jews stress equality of the sexes .
in liberal services , women and men sit together and take equal part in the liturgy , while in orthodox synagogues , women sit in upstairs galleries or behind screens , and do not take an active role in the service .
in liberal judaism , women can also become rabbis and lead congregations .

russia 's parliament said it will fast-track a bill to extend the term of the presidency , as early as this week .
the move may be a bid to return vladimir putin to power . approval of a kremlin bill to extend the presidential term from four to six years will be fast-tracked by the legislature and enacted by friday , russia 's parliamentary committee on constitutional legislation said wednesday , nov .
12 .
the legislation may be paving the way for prime minister vladimir putin to return to the presidency , some analysts said .
president dmitry medvedev announced he was seeking the constitutional amendment in his first state-of-the-nation address last week .
vote could be this week " we recommend that the necessary three readings of the draft law be discharged in one time , " lawmaker vladimir pligin , who heads the constitutional committee , was quoted by news agency interfax as saying .
he said the legislature could vote on the amendment as soon as friday , nov .
15 .
pligin 's comments came one day after the kremlin submitted the bill to the duma , russia 's lower house of parliament .
suspected power play for putin medvedev 's administration can easily muster the two-thirds majority in parliament needed to enact the change , after the dominant pro-kremlin party headed by his predecessor vladimir putin swept the polls in last year 's vote .
but legal experts say the term extensions would only apply to future presidents .
russian analysts said medvedev was only paving the way for 12 more years of putin in the kremlin . dpa news service -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a government plan to subsidize car sales also unraveled , suggesting that berlin had not yet reached a final decision on auto industry aid . with us-based gm teetering , the multinational 's german arm opel had earlier written to german chancellor angela merkel requesting she push harder for a 40 billion euro -lrb- $ 51.4 billion -rrb- loan from the european investment bank -lrb- eib -rrb- to carmakers . opel also requested loans to german buyers of new cars and a government buy-in of elderly cars to stimulate the flagging german car market . gm , the world 's largest carmaker , meanwhile appealed to its 55,000 workers in europe to skip pay increases .
a german labor leader , rainer einenkel , rejected that , saying opel workers wanted raises . after dropping 23 percent on monday , gm shares fell another 11 percent tuesday to $ 2.99 , a 65-year low .
deutsche bank analysts predicted the share prices would fall to zero . tax breaks for low-emissions cars bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cleaner cars will be rewarded with tax breaks under the current german plan no automotive aid in addition to that adopted by merkel 's cabinet last week was planned , a government spokesman told the german dpa news agency . merkel 's coalition government agreed last week on an economic stimulus package that includes a suspension of vehicle tax for one year on new cars bought in germany , with a double rebate for low-emission cars . however , that plan came unstuck tuesday , nov .
12 , with the parliamentary caucus of the social democratic party objecting to its equal treatment of large and small cars .
social democrats , who share power with merkel 's christian conservatives in a coalition government , demanded a preference for smaller cars that use less fuel . critics also said the rebate , expected to cost the government 1.4 billion euros , would be a free gift to consumers who had been planning to buy cars anyway . observers said reopening the issue might conceivably lead to aid that would be more similar to opel 's proposals . bmw to idle plant bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bmw will be stopping production at one plant during a prolonged winter break the government spokesman said in berlin the eib credit to the auto industry was likely to be decided by european union leaders at a summit next month .
he defended berlin 's stimulus package , saying it also included loans to smaller companies , which could be claimed by many auto industry suppliers . in another sign of the industry 's surplus inventory of unsold cars , premium maker bmw confirmed it would idle one of its factories for four weeks .
the site at regensburg would close from dec .
8 until jan .
7 , bmw said in munich .
several other german carmakers , including daimler and volkswagen , have said they would temporarily shut down or extend holiday breaks at their plants . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they recommend more deficit spending , but can that turn around an economy on the verge of recession ? people were expecting the report issued on wednesday , nov .
12 , by the " five wise men " - as the german council of economic experts is known colloquially - to be bleak .
and it lived up to its advance billing .
" the shock waves emanating from the financial crisis have fully hit the german economy , " wrote the experts at the beginning of the report .
" after a surprisingly good start in the first quarter of 2008 , the situation has become so gloomy that germany is on the edge of recession . "
germany experienced negative growth in the second quarter of 2008 , and if data to be released on thursday confirms that the economy shrank in the third quarter as well , germany will officially be in recession .
and the new year , the experts said , wo n't bring any immediate relief .
" gross domestic product may have increased by 1.7 percent in the ongoing year , but 2009 will bring stagnation in economic output , " the council concluded .
the council put the blame for the economic downturn squarely on financial markets inside and outside of germany .
although the property market was nowhere near as overheated as in the us or britain , for example , the experts saw no chance that the german economy could escape the negative pull of the global financial crisis .

but the experts also came out against across-the-board bailouts .
" it would be wrong to keep the greatest possible number of banks alive at any cost , " the report recommended , adding that the swedish government 's response to sweden 's banking crisis in the 1990s could serve as a model .
nor did the experts have much good to say about neo-socialist calls for the state to permanently alter the system and become more involved in financial markets .
the goal , the report said , was to use restructuring to restore " an efficient and competitive " banking landscape in germany .

instead , the experts recommended , berlin should try to stimulate internal consumer demand and pump money into public-works projects .
" there are good arguments for expanding net public investments next year and financing them with a higher deficit , " the report asserted .
" particularly suitable are already approved public projects in transportation infrastructure , which have been delayed due to lack of financing . "
the report also said that the european central bank should lower interest rates .
the experts did hold out some hope that falling oil prices might help boost the german economy in the latter stages of 2009 - but not enough to get the country growing again .

they recommend more deficit spending , but can that turn around an economy on the verge of recession ? people were expecting the report issued on wednesday , nov .
12 , by the " five wise men " - as the german council of economic experts is known colloquially - to be bleak .
and it lived up to its advance billing .
" the shock waves emanating from the financial crisis have fully hit the german economy , " wrote the experts at the beginning of the report .
" after a surprisingly good start in the first quarter of 2008 , the situation has become so gloomy that germany is on the edge of recession . "
germany experienced negative growth in the second quarter of 2008 , and if data to be released on thursday confirms that the economy shrank in the third quarter as well , germany will officially be in recession .
and the new year , the experts said , wo n't bring any immediate relief .
" gross domestic product may have increased by 1.7 percent in the ongoing year , but 2009 will bring stagnation in economic output , " the council concluded .
the council put the blame for the economic downturn squarely on financial markets inside and outside of germany .
although the property market was nowhere near as overheated as in the us or britain , for example , the experts saw no chance that the german economy could escape the negative pull of the global financial crisis .
where to next ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the numbers , say those who should know , are n't going to be good the report was generally positive about the government 's short-term attempts to stave off an acute financial disaster and encouraged berlin to focus on restructuring financial institutions .
but the experts also came out against across-the-board bailouts .
" it would be wrong to keep the greatest possible number of banks alive at any cost , " the report recommended , adding that the swedish government 's response to sweden 's banking crisis in the 1990s could serve as a model .
nor did the experts have much good to say about neo-socialist calls for the state to permanently alter the system and become more involved in financial markets .
the goal , the report said , was to use restructuring to restore " an efficient and competitive " banking landscape in germany .
" that presupposes that the state backs off after a successful process of stabilization and restructuring , and concentrates on its core tasks , " the council concluded .
run up some debt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany , say the five wise men , needs more projects like this on the issue of economic stimulus , the experts reversed the trend of recent years and said germany should no longer prioritize a balanced budget .
instead , the experts recommended , berlin should try to stimulate internal consumer demand and pump money into public-works projects .
" there are good arguments for expanding net public investments next year and financing them with a higher deficit , " the report asserted .
" particularly suitable are already approved public projects in transportation infrastructure , which have been delayed due to lack of financing . "
the report also said that the european central bank should lower interest rates .
the experts did hold out some hope that falling oil prices might help boost the german economy in the latter stages of 2009 - but not enough to get the country growing again .
on saturday , leaders from the world 's biggest economies convene in washington to discuss global solutions to the financial crisis and the economic problems it has created .

a government plan to subsidize car sales also unraveled , suggesting that berlin had not yet reached a final decision on auto industry aid . with us-based gm teetering , the multinational 's german arm opel had earlier written to german chancellor angela merkel requesting she push harder for a 40 billion euro -lrb- $ 51.4 billion -rrb- loan from the european investment bank -lrb- eib -rrb- to carmakers . opel also requested loans to german buyers of new cars and a government buy-in of elderly cars to stimulate the flagging german car market . gm , the world 's largest carmaker , meanwhile appealed to its 55,000 workers in europe to skip pay increases .
a german labor leader , rainer einenkel , rejected that , saying opel workers wanted raises . after dropping 23 percent on monday , gm shares fell another 11 percent tuesday to $ 2.99 , a 65-year low .

social democrats , who share power with merkel 's christian conservatives in a coalition government , demanded a preference for smaller cars that use less fuel . critics also said the rebate , expected to cost the government 1.4 billion euros , would be a free gift to consumers who had been planning to buy cars anyway . observers said reopening the issue might conceivably lead to aid that would be more similar to opel 's proposals . bmw to idle plant bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bmw will be stopping production at one plant during a prolonged winter break the government spokesman said in berlin the eib credit to the auto industry was likely to be decided by european union leaders at a summit next month .
he defended berlin 's stimulus package , saying it also included loans to smaller companies , which could be claimed by many auto industry suppliers . in another sign of the industry 's surplus inventory of unsold cars , premium maker bmw confirmed it would idle one of its factories for four weeks .
the site at regensburg would close from dec .
8 until jan .
7 , bmw said in munich .
several other german carmakers , including daimler and volkswagen , have said they would temporarily shut down or extend holiday breaks at their plants . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

having gotten the nod from the polish-born architect , the liberal jewish congregation with some 250 members is calling for donations to help finance the building .
historic site sought the site has not yet been determined , but matthias strauss , a board member of the friends of beth shalom , said he hoped it would be built on westenrieder strasse , where munich 's first synagogue was built in 1850 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2006 , a synagogue opened in munich that caters to the orthodox libeskind is expected to present his design next spring in munich , strauss said .
the group is aiming to complete the building by 2018 .
beth shalom is a member of the world union for progressive judaism , the largest jewish religious organization in the world , representing about 1.5 million jews in nearly 40 countries .
strains of judaism liberal , or reform , jews differ from orthodox jews in many ways , including the key fact that liberal jews stress equality of the sexes .
in liberal services , women and men sit together and take equal part in the liturgy , while in orthodox synagogues , women sit in upstairs galleries or behind screens , and do not take an active role in the service .
in liberal judaism , women can also become rabbis and lead congregations .

but europe remains split of how to deal with the increasingly dire economic situation . as the world 's leading economic nations and the eu prepare to convene for the emergency economic summit in the american capital , european politicians are stressing their commitment to unity - at least in words .
even britain , traditionally somewhat of an outsider in europe , is talking togetherness .
" if we have fiscal stimulus in britain and it is not repeated in other countries , then it will have far less effect and far less benefit than if it were done in every other major economy in the world , " british prime minister gordon brown said on tuesday , nov .
11 .
those sentiments were seconded by statements coming out of brussels .
" if the eu , and in particular the euro area , is not coordinating the different actions , all the euro-area countries will lose , " said eu economics affairs head joaquin almunia .
but the very mention of the euro zone , of which britain is not a part , underscores the differing european economic attitudes that could make it difficult for the bloc to put up a unified front .
france and italy are , generally speaking , far more positively inclined toward state intervention in the economy than england or even germany .
thus , while some eu states may see the financial crisis as an occasion for governments to rein in out-of-control capitalism , others are more likely to view it as a problem to be overcome while preserving the basics of the current system .
to turn left , or not bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu could be heading left and the disagreements occur not only between nations but within the individual societies that make up the eu .
opinion is divided even in britain , usually considered to be on the free-market extreme of the eu spectrum .
british labour legislator john mcdonnell is one of those who hopes that the response to the financial crisis goes beyond emergency cash infusions .
" there are opportunities for the left to explain how the economic system works at present , how unfair it is and what the alternatives are , " mcdonnell told reuters news agency .
but others warn that the crisis could be used as an excuse for pursuing a neo-socialist agenda .
" some governments are actually quite keen to exploit the precedent that has been set to reestablish a more … interventionist industrial policy , or economic policy more generally , " simon tilford , chief economist at the london-based think tank centre for european reform , told reuters .
the outlook is gloomy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the numbers are n't looking good however much eu member states may disagree about solutions to the crisis , the latest economic news - especially in the bloc 's largest economy - is consistently bad .
on wednesday , the five leading economic institutes in germany are expected to announce that they do not expect the country 's economy to grow at all in 2009 .
industrial output was also down across the continent in september , with the drops ranging from 0.5 percent in france to 3.6 percent in germany .
the one somewhat bright spot was provided by germany 's center for european economic research , which announced a slight improvement in its poll of investor sentiment .
at a near record low last month , the mood has improved slightly as investors have observed the government taking action to respond to the crisis .
but many experts , including unicredit economist alexander koch , still believe an economic downturn is inevitable , if indeed not already here .
" there is no doubt about it , " koch told afp news agency .
" the german economy is sliding into depression . "
on thursday , the german government will publish its third-quarter growth figures .
if they turn out to be negative , germany will officially be in recession , which most economists define as two consecutive quarters of economic shrinkage . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 12.11.2008 eu aims to get tough on credit rating agencies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : credit agencies are getting poor marks for their evaluations so-called cras could be about to find life getting more difficult .
amidst the financial crisis , the european commission has put forward new rules to improve assessments of companies ' creditworthiness . the regulations officially proposed in brussels on wednesday , november 12 are the brainchild of european internal market commissioner charlie mccreevy and are designed , in his words , " to restore market confidence . "
credit rating agencies , or cras , vastly overestimated the health of financial institutions such as the now-defunct lehman brothers investment bank in the us , helping to precipitate the current financial crisis .
many agencies still gave lehman brothers a fairly positive aa rating just days before it went bankrupt .
" it would be unjust and insensitive to single out the rating agencies as the single cause for the financial turbulences , but they have played their part , " mccreevy said at a press conference .
the new regulations , if approved by eu member states and the eu parliament , would subject cras to greater government supervision and dictate how they operate .
" the general drift in the eu is to try to prevent future financial crises by tightening the regulatory screw , " said philip whyte , analyst at the centre for european reform .
the message internal market commissioner mccreevy would like to send is : there 's no more business as usual .
watching the watchdogs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccreevy hopes the proposed new rules will force cras to improve under the proposed new rules , cras would be banned from providing advisory services and from rating financial instruments without sufficient information to make qualified assessments .
they would be required to disclose their methods , publish annual transparency reports and conduct independent internal review of the quality of their ratings .
the reviewers would consist of three directors whose pay would not depend on the agency 's business performance .
american companies like moody 's and standard & poor 's would also be forced to register subsidiaries in the eu .
but some eu lawmakers are n't happy with the fact that monitoring and enforcement would be carried out at the national level .
" we should quickly establish eu-wide supervision , " markus ferber , a conservative mep from germany , told dpa news agency .
going global ?
bildunterschrift : cras gave lehman brothers the thumbs up - and the bank went bankrupt still mccreevy characterizes the proposed reforms as part of an international reform effort he would like to see .
" while we are setting standards for the eu , we want these to become global standards and we will discuss them with our main international partners with that objective in mind , " mccreevy said .
those discussions will likely commence at the financial summit of the world 's leading twenty economies , which takes place this saturday in washington .
on the agenda is the role played by cras in the current global economic crisis - and how to correct the shortcomings .
if the european commission gets its way , part of the solution will be regulations to ensure that organizations responsible for evaluating the world 's major financial institutions are themselves up to the job . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

credit rating agencies , or cras , vastly overestimated the health of financial institutions such as the now-defunct lehman brothers investment bank in the us , helping to precipitate the current financial crisis .
many agencies still gave lehman brothers a fairly positive aa rating just days before it went bankrupt .
" it would be unjust and insensitive to single out the rating agencies as the single cause for the financial turbulences , but they have played their part , " mccreevy said at a press conference .
the new regulations , if approved by eu member states and the eu parliament , would subject cras to greater government supervision and dictate how they operate .

grimsson , who does not have formal powers , expressed his views at a recent luncheon for diplomats .
iceland had previously secured a tentative deal with the international monetary fund for a $ 2.1 billion loan , but the imf board has yet to approve it .
however , on wednesday , nov .
12 , it looked as if that deal were in danger of unraveling .
on tuesday , some two weeks after it initially struck the loan agreement , the imf said it was waiting for a loan for the crisis-hit island to be " fully financed " before it could be submitted to the imf executive board .
offer for moscow the imf 's backpedaling now has put a $ 6 billion loan pact under threat .
iceland 's nordic neighbors and european countries have said they want imf approval in place before they support such a package .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaupthing , iceland 's biggest bank , was taken over by the government according to an account in norway 's klassekampen , the icelandic president 's search for new friends included his offering russia the use of the former us military base keflavik , a key nato installation during the cold war .
the us pulled out of kefalavik in 2006 .
the russian ambassador , who also was present at the luncheon , said moscow had no need for the base , the report said .
at the luncheon , grimsson praised neighbors norway and the faroe islands for offering assistance , but he was critical of britain , sweden and denmark .

russia 's parliament said it will fast-track a bill to extend the term of the presidency , as early as this week .
the move may be a bid to return vladimir putin to power . approval of a kremlin bill to extend the presidential term from four to six years will be fast-tracked by the legislature and enacted by friday , russia 's parliamentary committee on constitutional legislation said wednesday , nov .
12 .
the legislation may be paving the way for prime minister vladimir putin to return to the presidency , some analysts said .
president dmitry medvedev announced he was seeking the constitutional amendment in his first state-of-the-nation address last week .
vote could be this week " we recommend that the necessary three readings of the draft law be discharged in one time , " lawmaker vladimir pligin , who heads the constitutional committee , was quoted by news agency interfax as saying .
he said the legislature could vote on the amendment as soon as friday , nov .
15 .
pligin 's comments came one day after the kremlin submitted the bill to the duma , russia 's lower house of parliament .
suspected power play for putin medvedev 's administration can easily muster the two-thirds majority in parliament needed to enact the change , after the dominant pro-kremlin party headed by his predecessor vladimir putin swept the polls in last year 's vote .
but legal experts say the term extensions would only apply to future presidents .
russian analysts said medvedev was only paving the way for 12 more years of putin in the kremlin . dpa news service -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it 's absolutely clear that prices for gas from the start of 2009 for european consumers will go down , " gazprom chief executive alexei miller told ria novosti news service said late tuesday , nov .
11 .
miller acknowledged that gas prices are at a record high , and analysts told afp news agency they have been expecting a drop in russian gas prices for a while now .

speaking alongside miller , the chief executive of german chemical company basf , juergen hambrecht , also predicted a reduction in gas prices for europe , but starting in the second quarter of 2009 .
putin : russia wants sovereignty the european union relies on russia for about a quarter of its gas supplies .
meanwhile , russian prime minister vladimir putin sought to ease fears over the possibility of russia joining an opec-style cartel of gas exporting countries .
in talks with his egyptian counterpart ahmed nazif , he said : " we support this idea .
but we know about apprehensions and even fears voiced by certain energy consumers , " news agency interfax reported .
" i wish to state once and for all : there are no grounds for such fears . "

putin met with the egyptian prime minister while the latter was paying a four-day visit to moscow .
his comments came one day after he said the country had to act to bolster oil prices hit by the global economic crisis .
his comments suggested that russia was aiming to become a swing producer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 12.11.2008 expert panel : no growth ahead as germany nears recession großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dealers are already giving deep discounts on cars , fearful that next year could see sales stagnate zero - that 's the amount of growth five leading economic institutions say germany can expect in 2009 .
they recommend more deficit spending , but can that turn around an economy on the verge of recession ? people were expecting the report issued on wednesday , nov .
12 , by the " five wise men " - as the german council of economic experts is known colloquially - to be bleak .
and it lived up to its advance billing .
" the shock waves emanating from the financial crisis have fully hit the german economy , " wrote the experts at the beginning of the report .
" after a surprisingly good start in the first quarter of 2008 , the situation has become so gloomy that germany is on the edge of recession . "
germany experienced negative growth in the second quarter of 2008 , and if data to be released on thursday confirms that the economy shrank in the third quarter as well , germany will officially be in recession .
and the new year , the experts said , wo n't bring any immediate relief .
" gross domestic product may have increased by 1.7 percent in the ongoing year , but 2009 will bring stagnation in economic output , " the council concluded .
the council put the blame for the economic downturn squarely on financial markets inside and outside of germany .
although the property market was nowhere near as overheated as in the us or britain , for example , the experts saw no chance that the german economy could escape the negative pull of the global financial crisis .
where to next ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the numbers , say those who should know , are n't going to be good the report was generally positive about the government 's short-term attempts to stave off an acute financial disaster and encouraged berlin to focus on restructuring financial institutions .
but the experts also came out against across-the-board bailouts .
" it would be wrong to keep the greatest possible number of banks alive at any cost , " the report recommended , adding that the swedish government 's response to sweden 's banking crisis in the 1990s could serve as a model .
nor did the experts have much good to say about neo-socialist calls for the state to permanently alter the system and become more involved in financial markets .
the goal , the report said , was to use restructuring to restore " an efficient and competitive " banking landscape in germany .
" that presupposes that the state backs off after a successful process of stabilization and restructuring , and concentrates on its core tasks , " the council concluded .
run up some debt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany , say the five wise men , needs more projects like this on the issue of economic stimulus , the experts reversed the trend of recent years and said germany should no longer prioritize a balanced budget .
instead , the experts recommended , berlin should try to stimulate internal consumer demand and pump money into public-works projects .
" there are good arguments for expanding net public investments next year and financing them with a higher deficit , " the report asserted .
" particularly suitable are already approved public projects in transportation infrastructure , which have been delayed due to lack of financing . "
the report also said that the european central bank should lower interest rates .
the experts did hold out some hope that falling oil prices might help boost the german economy in the latter stages of 2009 - but not enough to get the country growing again .
on saturday , leaders from the world 's biggest economies convene in washington to discuss global solutions to the financial crisis and the economic problems it has created .
but if the council of economic experts is right , germany is still going to be in for a long and bumpy ride in 2009 - roads or no roads . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it 's absolutely clear that prices for gas from the start of 2009 for european consumers will go down , " gazprom chief executive alexei miller told ria novosti news service said late tuesday , nov .

miller acknowledged that gas prices are at a record high , and analysts told afp news agency they have been expecting a drop in russian gas prices for a while now .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu depends on russia for about a quarter of its gas russian gas price movements shadow the price of oil , which is falling - albeit with a time lag .
" we will produce as much gas as consumers need .
gazprom 's extraction capacity is significantly higher than the amount it extracts , " miller was quoted as saying .
speaking alongside miller , the chief executive of german chemical company basf , juergen hambrecht , also predicted a reduction in gas prices for europe , but starting in the second quarter of 2009 .
putin : russia wants sovereignty the european union relies on russia for about a quarter of its gas supplies .
meanwhile , russian prime minister vladimir putin sought to ease fears over the possibility of russia joining an opec-style cartel of gas exporting countries .
in talks with his egyptian counterpart ahmed nazif , he said : " we support this idea .
but we know about apprehensions and even fears voiced by certain energy consumers , " news agency interfax reported .
" i wish to state once and for all : there are no grounds for such fears . "

the possibility of a gas cartel was previously discussed among russia , qatar and iran .
putin met with the egyptian prime minister while the latter was paying a four-day visit to moscow .
his comments came one day after he said the country had to act to bolster oil prices hit by the global economic crisis .
his comments suggested that russia was aiming to become a swing producer .
" as one of the major exporters and producers of oil and petroleum products , russia can not sit out from the formulation of global prices for this natural resource , " putin was quoted by local media as saying monday . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

amidst the financial crisis , the european commission has put forward new rules to improve assessments of companies ' creditworthiness . the regulations officially proposed in brussels on wednesday , november 12 are the brainchild of european internal market commissioner charlie mccreevy and are designed , in his words , " to restore market confidence . "
credit rating agencies , or cras , vastly overestimated the health of financial institutions such as the now-defunct lehman brothers investment bank in the us , helping to precipitate the current financial crisis .
many agencies still gave lehman brothers a fairly positive aa rating just days before it went bankrupt .
" it would be unjust and insensitive to single out the rating agencies as the single cause for the financial turbulences , but they have played their part , " mccreevy said at a press conference .
the new regulations , if approved by eu member states and the eu parliament , would subject cras to greater government supervision and dictate how they operate .
" the general drift in the eu is to try to prevent future financial crises by tightening the regulatory screw , " said philip whyte , analyst at the centre for european reform .

the final selection of the esa 's two crew members plus two others who will train as their back-ups will be announced in mid-december . " surprisingly , there is no competitive mood among the remaining candidates , " mars500 program manager jennifer ngo-anh told deutsche welle .
" they are just getting really excited and are highly motivated to participate . " tough medical tests the candidates were subjected to various medical tests at the central clinical hospital of the russian academy of sciences .
they underwent extensive examinations , as well as screenings by a neurologist , a dentist , a psychologist and an ophthalmologist . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the finalists will have to endure over three months of conditions that simulate life in a space shuttle " the tests were very invasive .
they pushed the men to their limits , " said jennifer ngo-anh , adding that examinations such as the colonoscopy caused real discomfort . this testing was necessary to ensure that the final crew consists of healthy individuals who are able to cope with isolated and unusual living conditions . a new venture for esa this is the first time esa has embarked on an experiment of this kind .
the initial 105-day study will be followed by a longer follow-up later in 2009 , in which another six-member crew will spend 520 days together . the distance between earth and mars varies between 55 million and more than 400 million kilometers -lrb- 250 million and 34 million miles -rrb- , which means that a round trip to the planet would take at least 18 months . esa and nasa have separately sketched dates around three decades from now for a historic manned flight to mars . dw staff -lrb- ew -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 12.11.2008 expert panel : no growth ahead as germany nears recession großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dealers are already giving deep discounts on cars , fearful that next year could see sales stagnate zero - that 's the amount of growth five leading economic institutions say germany can expect in 2009 .
they recommend more deficit spending , but can that turn around an economy on the verge of recession ? people were expecting the report issued on wednesday , nov .
12 , by the " five wise men " - as the german council of economic experts is known colloquially - to be bleak .
and it lived up to its advance billing .
" the shock waves emanating from the financial crisis have fully hit the german economy , " wrote the experts at the beginning of the report .
" after a surprisingly good start in the first quarter of 2008 , the situation has become so gloomy that germany is on the edge of recession . "
germany experienced negative growth in the second quarter of 2008 , and if data to be released on thursday confirms that the economy shrank in the third quarter as well , germany will officially be in recession .
and the new year , the experts said , wo n't bring any immediate relief .
" gross domestic product may have increased by 1.7 percent in the ongoing year , but 2009 will bring stagnation in economic output , " the council concluded .
the council put the blame for the economic downturn squarely on financial markets inside and outside of germany .
although the property market was nowhere near as overheated as in the us or britain , for example , the experts saw no chance that the german economy could escape the negative pull of the global financial crisis .
where to next ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the numbers , say those who should know , are n't going to be good the report was generally positive about the government 's short-term attempts to stave off an acute financial disaster and encouraged berlin to focus on restructuring financial institutions .
but the experts also came out against across-the-board bailouts .
" it would be wrong to keep the greatest possible number of banks alive at any cost , " the report recommended , adding that the swedish government 's response to sweden 's banking crisis in the 1990s could serve as a model .
nor did the experts have much good to say about neo-socialist calls for the state to permanently alter the system and become more involved in financial markets .
the goal , the report said , was to use restructuring to restore " an efficient and competitive " banking landscape in germany .
" that presupposes that the state backs off after a successful process of stabilization and restructuring , and concentrates on its core tasks , " the council concluded .
run up some debt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany , say the five wise men , needs more projects like this on the issue of economic stimulus , the experts reversed the trend of recent years and said germany should no longer prioritize a balanced budget .
instead , the experts recommended , berlin should try to stimulate internal consumer demand and pump money into public-works projects .

but europe remains split of how to deal with the increasingly dire economic situation . as the world 's leading economic nations and the eu prepare to convene for the emergency economic summit in the american capital , european politicians are stressing their commitment to unity - at least in words .
even britain , traditionally somewhat of an outsider in europe , is talking togetherness .
" if we have fiscal stimulus in britain and it is not repeated in other countries , then it will have far less effect and far less benefit than if it were done in every other major economy in the world , " british prime minister gordon brown said on tuesday , nov .
11 .
those sentiments were seconded by statements coming out of brussels .
" if the eu , and in particular the euro area , is not coordinating the different actions , all the euro-area countries will lose , " said eu economics affairs head joaquin almunia .
but the very mention of the euro zone , of which britain is not a part , underscores the differing european economic attitudes that could make it difficult for the bloc to put up a unified front .
france and italy are , generally speaking , far more positively inclined toward state intervention in the economy than england or even germany .
thus , while some eu states may see the financial crisis as an occasion for governments to rein in out-of-control capitalism , others are more likely to view it as a problem to be overcome while preserving the basics of the current system .

opinion is divided even in britain , usually considered to be on the free-market extreme of the eu spectrum .
british labour legislator john mcdonnell is one of those who hopes that the response to the financial crisis goes beyond emergency cash infusions .
" there are opportunities for the left to explain how the economic system works at present , how unfair it is and what the alternatives are , " mcdonnell told reuters news agency .
but others warn that the crisis could be used as an excuse for pursuing a neo-socialist agenda .
" some governments are actually quite keen to exploit the precedent that has been set to reestablish a more … interventionist industrial policy , or economic policy more generally , " simon tilford , chief economist at the london-based think tank centre for european reform , told reuters .
the outlook is gloomy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the numbers are n't looking good however much eu member states may disagree about solutions to the crisis , the latest economic news - especially in the bloc 's largest economy - is consistently bad .
on wednesday , the five leading economic institutes in germany are expected to announce that they do not expect the country 's economy to grow at all in 2009 .
industrial output was also down across the continent in september , with the drops ranging from 0.5 percent in france to 3.6 percent in germany .
the one somewhat bright spot was provided by germany 's center for european economic research , which announced a slight improvement in its poll of investor sentiment .
at a near record low last month , the mood has improved slightly as investors have observed the government taking action to respond to the crisis .
but many experts , including unicredit economist alexander koch , still believe an economic downturn is inevitable , if indeed not already here .
" there is no doubt about it , " koch told afp news agency .
" the german economy is sliding into depression . "

but europe remains split of how to deal with the increasingly dire economic situation . as the world 's leading economic nations and the eu prepare to convene for the emergency economic summit in the american capital , european politicians are stressing their commitment to unity - at least in words .
even britain , traditionally somewhat of an outsider in europe , is talking togetherness .
" if we have fiscal stimulus in britain and it is not repeated in other countries , then it will have far less effect and far less benefit than if it were done in every other major economy in the world , " british prime minister gordon brown said on tuesday , nov .
11 .
those sentiments were seconded by statements coming out of brussels .
" if the eu , and in particular the euro area , is not coordinating the different actions , all the euro-area countries will lose , " said eu economics affairs head joaquin almunia .
but the very mention of the euro zone , of which britain is not a part , underscores the differing european economic attitudes that could make it difficult for the bloc to put up a unified front .
france and italy are , generally speaking , far more positively inclined toward state intervention in the economy than england or even germany .
thus , while some eu states may see the financial crisis as an occasion for governments to rein in out-of-control capitalism , others are more likely to view it as a problem to be overcome while preserving the basics of the current system .
to turn left , or not bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu could be heading left and the disagreements occur not only between nations but within the individual societies that make up the eu .
opinion is divided even in britain , usually considered to be on the free-market extreme of the eu spectrum .
british labour legislator john mcdonnell is one of those who hopes that the response to the financial crisis goes beyond emergency cash infusions .
" there are opportunities for the left to explain how the economic system works at present , how unfair it is and what the alternatives are , " mcdonnell told reuters news agency .
but others warn that the crisis could be used as an excuse for pursuing a neo-socialist agenda .
" some governments are actually quite keen to exploit the precedent that has been set to reestablish a more … interventionist industrial policy , or economic policy more generally , " simon tilford , chief economist at the london-based think tank centre for european reform , told reuters .
the outlook is gloomy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the numbers are n't looking good however much eu member states may disagree about solutions to the crisis , the latest economic news - especially in the bloc 's largest economy - is consistently bad .
on wednesday , the five leading economic institutes in germany are expected to announce that they do not expect the country 's economy to grow at all in 2009 .
industrial output was also down across the continent in september , with the drops ranging from 0.5 percent in france to 3.6 percent in germany .
the one somewhat bright spot was provided by germany 's center for european economic research , which announced a slight improvement in its poll of investor sentiment .
at a near record low last month , the mood has improved slightly as investors have observed the government taking action to respond to the crisis .
but many experts , including unicredit economist alexander koch , still believe an economic downturn is inevitable , if indeed not already here .
" there is no doubt about it , " koch told afp news agency .
" the german economy is sliding into depression . "

having gotten the nod from the polish-born architect , the liberal jewish congregation with some 250 members is calling for donations to help finance the building .
historic site sought the site has not yet been determined , but matthias strauss , a board member of the friends of beth shalom , said he hoped it would be built on westenrieder strasse , where munich 's first synagogue was built in 1850 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in 2006 , a synagogue opened in munich that caters to the orthodox libeskind is expected to present his design next spring in munich , strauss said .
the group is aiming to complete the building by 2018 .
beth shalom is a member of the world union for progressive judaism , the largest jewish religious organization in the world , representing about 1.5 million jews in nearly 40 countries .
strains of judaism liberal , or reform , jews differ from orthodox jews in many ways , including the key fact that liberal jews stress equality of the sexes .

they recommend more deficit spending , but can that turn around an economy on the verge of recession ? people were expecting the report issued on wednesday , nov .
12 , by the " five wise men " - as the german council of economic experts is known colloquially - to be bleak .
and it lived up to its advance billing .
" the shock waves emanating from the financial crisis have fully hit the german economy , " wrote the experts at the beginning of the report .
" after a surprisingly good start in the first quarter of 2008 , the situation has become so gloomy that germany is on the edge of recession . "
germany experienced negative growth in the second quarter of 2008 , and if data to be released on thursday confirms that the economy shrank in the third quarter as well , germany will officially be in recession .
and the new year , the experts said , wo n't bring any immediate relief .
" gross domestic product may have increased by 1.7 percent in the ongoing year , but 2009 will bring stagnation in economic output , " the council concluded .
the council put the blame for the economic downturn squarely on financial markets inside and outside of germany .
although the property market was nowhere near as overheated as in the us or britain , for example , the experts saw no chance that the german economy could escape the negative pull of the global financial crisis .
where to next ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the numbers , say those who should know , are n't going to be good the report was generally positive about the government 's short-term attempts to stave off an acute financial disaster and encouraged berlin to focus on restructuring financial institutions .
but the experts also came out against across-the-board bailouts .
" it would be wrong to keep the greatest possible number of banks alive at any cost , " the report recommended , adding that the swedish government 's response to sweden 's banking crisis in the 1990s could serve as a model .
nor did the experts have much good to say about neo-socialist calls for the state to permanently alter the system and become more involved in financial markets .
the goal , the report said , was to use restructuring to restore " an efficient and competitive " banking landscape in germany .
" that presupposes that the state backs off after a successful process of stabilization and restructuring , and concentrates on its core tasks , " the council concluded .
run up some debt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany , say the five wise men , needs more projects like this on the issue of economic stimulus , the experts reversed the trend of recent years and said germany should no longer prioritize a balanced budget .
instead , the experts recommended , berlin should try to stimulate internal consumer demand and pump money into public-works projects .
" there are good arguments for expanding net public investments next year and financing them with a higher deficit , " the report asserted .
" particularly suitable are already approved public projects in transportation infrastructure , which have been delayed due to lack of financing . "
the report also said that the european central bank should lower interest rates .
the experts did hold out some hope that falling oil prices might help boost the german economy in the latter stages of 2009 - but not enough to get the country growing again .
on saturday , leaders from the world 's biggest economies convene in washington to discuss global solutions to the financial crisis and the economic problems it has created .

they recommend more deficit spending , but can that turn around an economy on the verge of recession ? people were expecting the report issued on wednesday , nov .
12 , by the " five wise men " - as the german council of economic experts is known colloquially - to be bleak .
and it lived up to its advance billing .
" the shock waves emanating from the financial crisis have fully hit the german economy , " wrote the experts at the beginning of the report .
" after a surprisingly good start in the first quarter of 2008 , the situation has become so gloomy that germany is on the edge of recession . "
germany experienced negative growth in the second quarter of 2008 , and if data to be released on thursday confirms that the economy shrank in the third quarter as well , germany will officially be in recession .
and the new year , the experts said , wo n't bring any immediate relief .
" gross domestic product may have increased by 1.7 percent in the ongoing year , but 2009 will bring stagnation in economic output , " the council concluded .
the council put the blame for the economic downturn squarely on financial markets inside and outside of germany .
although the property market was nowhere near as overheated as in the us or britain , for example , the experts saw no chance that the german economy could escape the negative pull of the global financial crisis .
where to next ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the numbers , say those who should know , are n't going to be good the report was generally positive about the government 's short-term attempts to stave off an acute financial disaster and encouraged berlin to focus on restructuring financial institutions .
but the experts also came out against across-the-board bailouts .
" it would be wrong to keep the greatest possible number of banks alive at any cost , " the report recommended , adding that the swedish government 's response to sweden 's banking crisis in the 1990s could serve as a model .
nor did the experts have much good to say about neo-socialist calls for the state to permanently alter the system and become more involved in financial markets .
the goal , the report said , was to use restructuring to restore " an efficient and competitive " banking landscape in germany .
" that presupposes that the state backs off after a successful process of stabilization and restructuring , and concentrates on its core tasks , " the council concluded .
run up some debt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany , say the five wise men , needs more projects like this on the issue of economic stimulus , the experts reversed the trend of recent years and said germany should no longer prioritize a balanced budget .
instead , the experts recommended , berlin should try to stimulate internal consumer demand and pump money into public-works projects .
" there are good arguments for expanding net public investments next year and financing them with a higher deficit , " the report asserted .
" particularly suitable are already approved public projects in transportation infrastructure , which have been delayed due to lack of financing . "
the report also said that the european central bank should lower interest rates .
the experts did hold out some hope that falling oil prices might help boost the german economy in the latter stages of 2009 - but not enough to get the country growing again .
on saturday , leaders from the world 's biggest economies convene in washington to discuss global solutions to the financial crisis and the economic problems it has created .
but if the council of economic experts is right , germany is still going to be in for a long and bumpy ride in 2009 - roads or no roads . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they recommend more deficit spending , but can that turn around an economy on the verge of recession ? people were expecting the report issued on wednesday , nov .
12 , by the " five wise men " - as the german council of economic experts is known colloquially - to be bleak .
and it lived up to its advance billing .
" the shock waves emanating from the financial crisis have fully hit the german economy , " wrote the experts at the beginning of the report .
" after a surprisingly good start in the first quarter of 2008 , the situation has become so gloomy that germany is on the edge of recession . "
germany experienced negative growth in the second quarter of 2008 , and if data to be released on thursday confirms that the economy shrank in the third quarter as well , germany will officially be in recession .
and the new year , the experts said , wo n't bring any immediate relief .
" gross domestic product may have increased by 1.7 percent in the ongoing year , but 2009 will bring stagnation in economic output , " the council concluded .
the council put the blame for the economic downturn squarely on financial markets inside and outside of germany .
although the property market was nowhere near as overheated as in the us or britain , for example , the experts saw no chance that the german economy could escape the negative pull of the global financial crisis .

12 . but the plan has changed after belgrade , which continues to fight kosovo 's slide to full-fledged independence , won concessions from the west . eulex , a european law-enforcing presence of 2,000 police , judicial and customs officials , was to take over from a un mission that governed kosovo since nato ousted serbian forces from there in 1999 . in february , backed by the west , pristina unilaterally declared independence from serbia , which continues to regard the province as its territory .
kosovo is vastly dominated by albanians , though part of its northern region has a serb majority . dividing eulex ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thaci wants eulex to stick to its original mission backed by its ally russia , serbia locked the un in kosovo as it was under the nine-year-old mandate and eventually swayed brussels into reshaping eulex . pristina , on monday , was offered a modified plan for a mission that would remain under un command - and there ultimately under belgrade 's influence - in the northern , serb section of kosovo .
eulex would be run by brussels in the rest of kosovo . kosovo albanian leaders rejected the plan , fearing it would only cement the already existing partition of the territory along ethnic lines . belgrade said it would endorse the plan if the mission remains under the un 's auspices and was declared neutral in regard to kosovo 's legal status . thaci 's position caused a delay of a un security council meeting on tuesday , at which secretary-general ban ki-moon was due to present the modified plan and formally pave the way for the eulex . disputed diplomacy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a total of 52 countries have recognized kosovo ban urged the kosovo government tuesday to show " pragmatism and flexibility " by agreeing to the mission with a revamped framework , but thaci maintained that eulex operate in all of kosovo . " the international community understands ... that eulex deploys in the entire territory of kosovo , " he told reporters in pristina .
" in this regard , our door has always been open . " so far 52 countries , including united states and most eu nations , have recognized kosovo , but its full promotion in the un was blocked by russia , which has veto power in the security council . in a bid to discourage more states from recognizing kosovo , serbia has filed a petition to the international court of justice at the hague for an advisory opinion on whether kosovo 's declaration of independence was legal under international law . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

mr obama called mr singh early on wednesday amid speculation in the indian media that he had " ignored " india by not calling earlier .
mr singh congratulated mr obama on his victory and said it would inspire " oppressed people " all over the world .
mr obama told mr singh that he wished to make an " early visit to india " .
during the phone conversation , mr obama said that the us-india strategic relationship was " very important " , according to a statement issued by the indian prime minister 's office .
" the prime minister said that relations between india and the united states were very good but that we could not be satisfied with the status quo , " the statement added .
ties between the two countries have been on an upswing with the recent signing of the indo-us civil nuclear agreement by president bush after being approved by the us congress .
the deal ended india 's nuclear isolation and recognised the world 's largest democracy as the de facto sixth nuclear power .
analysts say the nuclear agreement will bring india and the united states even closer as the once estranged democracies become more engaged on common interests in asia and the world .

mr obama called mr singh early on wednesday amid speculation in the indian media that he had " ignored " india by not calling earlier .
mr singh congratulated mr obama on his victory and said it would inspire " oppressed people " all over the world .
mr obama told mr singh that he wished to make an " early visit to india " .
during the phone conversation , mr obama said that the us-india strategic relationship was " very important " , according to a statement issued by the indian prime minister 's office .
" the prime minister said that relations between india and the united states were very good but that we could not be satisfied with the status quo , " the statement added .
ties between the two countries have been on an upswing with the recent signing of the indo-us civil nuclear agreement by president bush after being approved by the us congress .
the deal ended india 's nuclear isolation and recognised the world 's largest democracy as the de facto sixth nuclear power .
analysts say the nuclear agreement will bring india and the united states even closer as the once estranged democracies become more engaged on common interests in asia and the world .

mr obama called mr singh early on wednesday amid speculation in the indian media that he had " ignored " india by not calling earlier .
mr singh congratulated mr obama on his victory and said it would inspire " oppressed people " all over the world .
mr obama told mr singh that he wished to make an " early visit to india " .
during the phone conversation , mr obama said that the us-india strategic relationship was " very important " , according to a statement issued by the indian prime minister 's office .
" the prime minister said that relations between india and the united states were very good but that we could not be satisfied with the status quo , " the statement added .
ties between the two countries have been on an upswing with the recent signing of the indo-us civil nuclear agreement by president bush after being approved by the us congress .
the deal ended india 's nuclear isolation and recognised the world 's largest democracy as the de facto sixth nuclear power .
analysts say the nuclear agreement will bring india and the united states even closer as the once estranged democracies become more engaged on common interests in asia and the world .

the assembly government says the agreement is the first of its kind in the uk .
the environment minister jane davidson am said : " today is another wales first in the battle against climate change . "
but the conservatives said the businesses " only represent a small part of the construction industry in wales " .
the charter is a joint initiative between the welsh assembly government , the sustainable development commission -lrb- sdc -rrb- and the design commission for wales .
carbon footprint organisations that have signed up to the agreement include building companies , colleges and trade bodies .
they will also promise to support an energy-efficient built environment , share examples and increase access to training .
ms davidson said the charter confirmed wales ' commitment to reduce its carbon footprint .
" the built environment is the largest contributor to greenhouse gases in wales .
the way in which we construct and use our homes and other buildings accounts for 40 % of our total carbon emissions .
" it is vital that all our new buildings are energy efficient and as green as possible .
the conservative 's environment spokesman , darren millar am , said the agreement showed the willingness of the private sector to work voluntarily to " tackle climate change " .
" however , we must recognise that these businesses and trade organisations only represent a small part of the construction industry in wales .
we have a huge problem because the housing stock in wales is much older richard jenkins , federation of master builders " i remain concerned that despite the manifesto commitments of the labour-plaid coalition , the promise to devolve building regulations to wales - the key tool in delivering real change in the construction industry - is yet to be fulfilled .
" as such the assembly government is still failing to deal with the massive challenge of retrofitting inefficient buildings across wales . "
the federation of master builders -lrb- fmb -rrb- represents around 600 builders in wales and is one of the trade bodies signing the charter .
its director in wales , richard jenkins , welcomed the agreement and said sustainable building would add " another arrow in the bow " for his members .
" global warming is not going to wait until the economy gets better .
" it 's about getting willing partners to make our building in wales more sustainable . "
" we have a huge problem because the housing stock in wales is much older .
this is a problem because they 're generally solid stone walls so there 's no wall insulation , there 's no floor insulation . "
he said people could help cut the carbon emissions of their homes by having thicker insulation installed .
the fmb is now looking to join forces with a housing association in an experimental project to show the benefits of sustainable building .
as part of the charter , the energy saving trust will lead a wales existing homes alliance to improve the energy efficiency of existing homes .

mr chen , an independence activist and staunch critic of china , was taken to jail after his detention was approved by a court overnight .
it came at the end of a dramatic 24 hours , during which police led a defiant mr chen away in handcuffs .
mr chen , who stepped down in may , denies all the graft charges and claims they are politically motivated .
he has been taken to tucheng prison in the suburbs of the capital , taipei .
he can now be held for up to four months , despite not yet having formally been charged .
police have reportedly tightened security around the jail amid threats from his supporters .
muscle tear the bbc 's cindy sui in taipei says the authorities want to avoid the type of demonstrations seen last week during a landmark visit by a high-ranking chinese communist official to taiwan .
mr chen and his supporters - who see closer ties to beijing as a threat to taiwan 's sovereignty - opposed that visit .
court proceedings had to be suspended on tuesday night , when mr chen said he needed hospital treatment after being pushed outside the court building .
he was returned to court for an overnight sitting after doctors found he had only a minor muscle tear .
mr chen is accused of money laundering and illegally using a special presidential fund .
but the outspoken nationalist accuses the new administration of persecuting him " as a sacrifice to appease china " .
mr chen is an ardent supporter of taiwanese independence , and a trenchant critic of president ma ying-jeou 's kuomintang -lrb- kmt -rrb- administration , which he accuses of pandering to china .
but china has termed accusations that his detention is a plot between beijing and president ma 's administration " pure fabrication " .
president ma has also denied intervening in the case .
opposition damaged ?
mr chen and his family have been mired in corruption allegations since 2006 , when his son-in-law was charged with insider trading on the stock market and then jailed for seven years .
the charges have damaged the reputation of the main opposition democratic progressive party -lrb- dpp -rrb- , observers say , which may now face a rough ride in next year 's local elections .
taiwan has been ruled separately since the end of the chinese civil war in 1949 .
the defeated kuomintang retreated to taiwan to create a self-governing entity .
but beijing sees the island as a breakaway province which should be reunified with the mainland , by force if necessary .

the lords eu committee said information was not being routinely passed to european police agency europol by national police forces .
a lack of trust and fear of leaks meant information was often shared using informal links instead , they said .
and it problems meant the uk was unable to put data on a european computer .
a number of national police forces are not happy that information they may give on a confidential basis will not leak out eu committee chairman lord jopling the report - europol : co-ordinating the fight against serious and organised crime - said the situation should be addressed as a " matter of urgency " .
" this will be vital in ensuring that information on organised crime in the uk and across europe is shared effectively between police forces , " it stated .
committee chairman lord jopling told bbc news a failure to share information meant good police work was being undone .
he said : " only five countries currently automatically load data on to the european information system and in the uk , for instance , they can not currently take part in it because the british it data systems are not compatible with europol 's .
" there is a good deal of lack of trust between the national police forces and europol because a number of national police forces are not happy that information they may give on a confidential basis will not leak out . "
europol was founded in 1992 to improve co-operation between the police forces of eu members on issues including terrorism , drug trafficking and serious fraud .
' weak links ' it is based in the hague in the netherlands and staffed by several officers from each of the eu member states .
but the peers ' committee found that rather than exchanging details of crimes centrally , officers in the hague tended to do it more informally face-to-face .
the peers want the agency 's remit to be widened to include crimes including serial murder and rape .
the report also criticised the the uk 's serious organised crime agency -lrb- soca -rrb- , which has been operating since 2006 , for weak links with police forces around the country .

the lords eu committee said information was not being routinely passed to european police agency europol by national police forces .
a lack of trust and fear of leaks meant information was often shared using informal links instead , they said .
and it problems meant the uk was unable to put data on a european computer .
a number of national police forces are not happy that information they may give on a confidential basis will not leak out eu committee chairman lord jopling the report - europol : co-ordinating the fight against serious and organised crime - said the situation should be addressed as a " matter of urgency " .
" this will be vital in ensuring that information on organised crime in the uk and across europe is shared effectively between police forces , " it stated .
committee chairman lord jopling told bbc news a failure to share information meant good police work was being undone .
he said : " only five countries currently automatically load data on to the european information system and in the uk , for instance , they can not currently take part in it because the british it data systems are not compatible with europol 's .
" there is a good deal of lack of trust between the national police forces and europol because a number of national police forces are not happy that information they may give on a confidential basis will not leak out . "
europol was founded in 1992 to improve co-operation between the police forces of eu members on issues including terrorism , drug trafficking and serious fraud .
' weak links ' it is based in the hague in the netherlands and staffed by several officers from each of the eu member states .
but the peers ' committee found that rather than exchanging details of crimes centrally , officers in the hague tended to do it more informally face-to-face .
the peers want the agency 's remit to be widened to include crimes including serial murder and rape .
the report also criticised the the uk 's serious organised crime agency -lrb- soca -rrb- , which has been operating since 2006 , for weak links with police forces around the country .

the lords eu committee said information was not being routinely passed to european police agency europol by national police forces .
a lack of trust and fear of leaks meant information was often shared using informal links instead , they said .
and it problems meant the uk was unable to put data on a european computer . "
a number of national police forces are not happy that information they may give on a confidential basis will not leak out " eu committee chairman lord jopling the report - europol : co-ordinating the fight against serious and organised crime - said the situation should be addressed as a " matter of urgency " .
" this will be vital in ensuring that information on organised crime in the uk and across europe is shared effectively between police forces , " it stated .
committee chairman lord jopling told bbc news a failure to share information meant good police work was being undone .
he said : " only five countries currently automatically load data on to the european information system and in the uk , for instance , they can not currently take part in it because the british it data systems are not compatible with europol 's .
" there is a good deal of lack of trust between the national police forces and europol because a number of national police forces are not happy that information they may give on a confidential basis will not leak out . "
europol was founded in 1992 to improve co-operation between the police forces of eu members on issues including terrorism , drug trafficking and serious fraud .
' weak links ' it is based in the hague in the netherlands and staffed by several officers from each of the eu member states .
but the peers ' committee found that rather than exchanging details of crimes centrally , officers in the hague tended to do it more informally face-to-face .
the peers want the agency 's remit to be widened to include crimes including serial murder and rape .
the report also criticised the the uk 's serious organised crime agency -lrb- soca -rrb- , which has been operating since 2006 , for weak links with police forces around the country .

super obama world has obama running round a world modelled on nintendo 's super mario world .
the game takes a satirical look at us politics , with obama collecting flags and dodging lipstick-wearing pit bulls , lobbyists and sarah palin .
the game is free to play online , and the developers plan to add further episodes throughout obama 's presidency .
as well as satirical characters , the game 's environment also features luxury stores neiman marcus and saks fifth avenue , in reference to the fact that the republican campaign reportedly spent more than $ 150,000 on vice presidential candidate sarah palin 's wardrobe .
as much as the obama campaign embraced technology , it can be said that technology embraced him .
obama supporters spawned viral videos such as " i 've got a crush on obama " and numerous fan sites .
though republican nominee john mccain 's camp established an online presence making use of new media , mccain was more often the subject of online parody ; millions viewed the animated " time for some campaignin " ' by digital entertainment studio jibjab although , to be fair , both candidates were parodied in equal measure .
this might go some way to explain why young voters , who themselves embrace the web and new media , favoured the democrats by more than two to one .

erick erickson , who is spearheading the project , said that once the republican party leadership contest was out of the way , the party needs to get behind the proposal and make the internet a top priority .
" the right really has a hard time embracing the internet like it should , " he said .
" the internet is a natural stick for people on the right - there are probably more right wingers than left online , but the trick is harnessing those people .
" on 15 january we 'll have a new leader .
once he - or she - is in place , we want to see a technology director appointed within the republican national committee -lsb- rnc -rsb- and we want them set loose .
and that means developing it outside the party , and the bunker mentality that can set in after a political defeat . "
patrick ruffini , the former director of the rnc 's ecampaign , echoed erickson 's views .
" this is a galvanising moment for the party .
whoever is the next chairman of the party - and the new party leaders - need to fix this problem straight away , " he said .
" for us , now , it 's a tool of opposition .

as well as satirical characters , the game 's environment also features luxury stores neiman marcus and saks fifth avenue , in reference to the fact that the republican campaign reportedly spent more than $ 150,000 on vice presidential candidate sarah palin 's wardrobe .
as much as the obama campaign embraced technology , it can be said that technology embraced him .
obama supporters spawned viral videos such as " i 've got a crush on obama " and numerous fan sites .
though republican nominee john mccain 's camp established an online presence making use of new media , mccain was more often the subject of online parody ; millions viewed the animated " time for some campaignin " ' by digital entertainment studio jibjab although , to be fair , both candidates were parodied in equal measure .
this might go some way to explain why young voters , who themselves embrace the web and new media , favoured the democrats by more than two to one .
time for change ?
however , there are moves within the republican party to broaden the way it campaigns .
whoever is the next chairman of the party needs to fix this problem straight away patrick ruffini former ecampaign director , rnc a group of young republicans has launched a website called rebuild the party to make better use of the internet , improve grassroots support and , according to the site , " start building the future of our party " .
erick erickson , who is spearheading the project , said that once the republican party leadership contest was out of the way , the party needs to get behind the proposal and make the internet a top priority .
" the right really has a hard time embracing the internet like it should , " he said .
" the internet is a natural stick for people on the right - there are probably more right wingers than left online , but the trick is harnessing those people .
" on 15 january we 'll have a new leader .
once he - or she - is in place , we want to see a technology director appointed within the republican national committee -lsb- rnc -rsb- and we want them set loose .
and that means developing it outside the party , and the bunker mentality that can set in after a political defeat . "
patrick ruffini , the former director of the rnc 's ecampaign , echoed erickson 's views .
" this is a galvanising moment for the party .
whoever is the next chairman of the party - and the new party leaders - need to fix this problem straight away , " he said .
" for us , now , it 's a tool of opposition .
you only have to look at what the conservatives did in the uk , with webcameron , to see what is possible , " he added .
a spokesperson for the conservative party told bbc news that a future video game featuring david cameron was unlikely , but could n't be ruled out .

advertisement a ceremony to remember quake victims only 12 children orphaned by the earthquake that struck china 's sichuan province six months ago have been formally adopted .
more than 600 children lost both parents in the magnitude-8.0 earthquake that left about 88,000 people dead or missing .
but only a handful of these have completed official adoption procedures .
six months after the devastating earthquake , people in sichuan are still trying to rebuild their lives .
quoting a senior official from sichuan , the beijing news said most of the orphans would be housed with relatives that were not killed in the quake .
the schools are the starting point because teachers need training to be able to deal with the children 's disturbed state francis markus red cross spokesman other children will be adopted by non-relatives or live in orphanages .
each child will receive 600 yuan -lrb- $ 88 ; £ 57 -rrb- a month from the government until they are formally adopted or reach 18 , the newspaper said .
finding permanent homes for the earthquake orphans is just one of many problems still unresolved in a region hit by china 's worst earthquake in 30 years .
building blocks rebuilding work will take years , partly because much of the affected area lay in the remote mountains of northern sichuan .
much of the quake zone remains a rubble site five million people were left homeless by the quake .
they will need new houses , as well as schools , health clinics and other basic services .
the government announced last week it will spend $ 146b over the next three years in the devastated area .
money will be used mostly for rebuilding work , including larger infrastructure projects , such as a railway from the provincial capital chengdu to the affected area .
but in at least one place there will be no rebuilding .
beichuan was so badly hit that the government is moving the entire town to a new location .
more than half the town 's 26,000 residents died in the earthquake and most of its buildings were completely destroyed .
the government has decided to leave the old town as it is and turn it into a national monument .
at the moment it is sealed off , surrounded by a tall , wire fence .
trauma it is not just physical rebuilding that requires work .
traumatised people , many of them children , are still receiving counselling .
one organisation involved in this work is the international federation of red cross and red crescent societies , which offers help in five schools .
" the schools are the starting point because teachers need training to be able to deal with the disturbed state of some of the children , " said organisation spokesman francis markus .
these children , and their parents , are still trying to come to terms with what happened six months ago .

advertisement a ceremony to remember quake victims only 12 children orphaned by the earthquake that struck china 's sichuan province six months ago have been formally adopted .
more than 600 children lost both parents in the magnitude-8.0 earthquake that left about 88,000 people dead or missing .
but only a handful of these have completed official adoption procedures .
six months after the devastating earthquake , people in sichuan are still trying to rebuild their lives .
quoting a senior official from sichuan , the beijing news said most of the orphans would be housed with relatives that were not killed in the quake .
the schools are the starting point because teachers need training to be able to deal with the children 's disturbed state francis markus red cross spokesman other children will be adopted by non-relatives or live in orphanages .
each child will receive 600 yuan -lrb- $ 88 ; £ 57 -rrb- a month from the government until they are formally adopted or reach 18 , the newspaper said .
finding permanent homes for the earthquake orphans is just one of many problems still unresolved in a region hit by china 's worst earthquake in 30 years .
building blocks rebuilding work will take years , partly because much of the affected area lay in the remote mountains of northern sichuan .
much of the quake zone remains a rubble site five million people were left homeless by the quake .
they will need new houses , as well as schools , health clinics and other basic services .
the government announced last week it will spend $ 146b over the next three years in the devastated area .
money will be used mostly for rebuilding work , including larger infrastructure projects , such as a railway from the provincial capital chengdu to the affected area .
but in at least one place there will be no rebuilding .
beichuan was so badly hit that the government is moving the entire town to a new location .
more than half the town 's 26,000 residents died in the earthquake and most of its buildings were completely destroyed .
the government has decided to leave the old town as it is and turn it into a national monument .
at the moment it is sealed off , surrounded by a tall , wire fence .
trauma it is not just physical rebuilding that requires work .
traumatised people , many of them children , are still receiving counselling .
one organisation involved in this work is the international federation of red cross and red crescent societies , which offers help in five schools .
" the schools are the starting point because teachers need training to be able to deal with the disturbed state of some of the children , " said organisation spokesman francis markus .
these children , and their parents , are still trying to come to terms with what happened six months ago .
