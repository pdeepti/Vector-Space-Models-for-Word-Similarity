merkel 's stance was echoed by germany 's health minister ulla schmidt .
" i reject this path categorically , " she said .
" the correct path is to offer assistance to those who are dying instead of helping those free from terminal illness to commit suicide . "
the debate was prompted by the revelation this week that a 79-year-old wurzburg woman chose to end her own life on saturday despite not having any life-threatening diseases or suffering great physical pain .
what added an extra angle to the story was that former hamburg justice senator roger kusch , a proponent for the right to die , advised her of the best way to do it .
" i was in her apartment at 11:00 am , " kusch explained at a press conference he called on monday to discuss the assisted suicide .
" at around 11:30 , she began to prepare three glasses - one with the sedative diazepam , one with a mixture of the anti-malaria drug chloroquine and one with a sweet syrup , because the other substances can cause nausea .
she drank the glass with the deadly chloroquine quickly .
her last words were ' auf wiedersehen . ' … then i left . "

he also showed the press conference clips from a nine-hour video he made documenting his relationship to the pensioner , identified only as bettina s. kusch made headlines earlier this year when he presented to the media a " suicide machine " patients could use to inject themselves with a deadly cocktail .
the case has prompted fresh calls in germany for stronger regulations and laws regarding assisted suicide .

however , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , the cdu 's coalition partner in government , have their own ideas .

colombian journalists have been invited to the scene of the rescue by defence minister santos , and i 'm sure that we 'll soon see images on screens everywhere .
the last pictures of ingrid betancourt were very depressing ; we heard from a fellow hostage that she was suffering from depression and various diseases , and she looked very thin . was the rescue expected ?
why did it happen now ? i think the rescue was expected .
as we know , in the last few weeks and months , farc suffered a series of blows and has been broken down into different factions which were n't able to move about within the country .
that 's a huge hindrance if you have a large number of hostages .
aside from the 15 hostages that have been freed , there are 42 other political hostages and several hundred more colombians being held by farc - that 's a significant burden for a guerrilla force that is in crisis .
it probably was n't possible for farc to move the hostages quickly or hide their tracks from the army .
i think that 's why the location of the hostages was known , and government agents were able to observe the hostages for a longer time . how long do you think it will take for the other hostages to be freed ? i think we can be fairly certain that the locations of many of the other hostages are known .
it 's a question of time before more will be freed , less so through military operations and more so due to traitors .
the blow delivered to farc by the release of these 15 hostages could cause many farc rebels to start thinking about whether they want to cooperate with the authorities .
there 's been a string of prominent desertions in recent weeks , and there 's been an erosion in farc 's ranks that could lead to more hostages being released . could the release of betancourt also be seen as an offer on the part of farc leader alfonso cano to the uribe government ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : betancourt , right , seen here with her mother , was farc 's trump card no .
if this were the case , farc would have handled it more intelligently , and not allowed the government any opportunity to present it as a rescue situation .
currently , we only have the government 's version of events , as well as the pictures and other evidence that point to it actually having been a rescue .
farc 's political head , alfonso cano , would have used his trump card - namely betancourt and the three american hostages - differently - at the start of peace talks for instance , so that he would have had something in his hand against the government .
now , farc has very little . is president 's uribe 's political strategy on farc paying off ? the last few months , but today especially , mark the biggest success uribe has had in achieving security in colombia .
his tough stance against the guerillas is paying off , as are the increasing incentives being offered to ex-rebels by the government .
it started with the disarmament of the paramilitaries in 2005 , but there have been increasing incentives for guerrillas to turn themselves in .
the military strategy is being coupled with a strategy for peace and post-conflict management in the regions that have been liberated .
it 's a big success for the uribe administration , and also explains his huge approval ratings of over 80 percent . do you think we are seeing the beginning of the end of farc and decades of internal conflict in colombia ? we 've entered a new era in terms of the conflict in colombia .
we no longer have the trio of typical actors , namely paramilitary , guerrilla and weak state .
rather , we have a state that is not just strong militarily , but that also enjoys popular support while , on the other side , we have illegal groups , or terrorists , as they 're now referred to .
then there are remnants of the old conflict , and among these is farc , or what remains of farc .
it could be that in the months or years to come , we 'll have a scenario where farc consists of just a few hundred fighters that are n't really relevant anymore , but that 's the optimistic variation .
the more cautious scenario is one where cano succeeds in reviving farc elements in colombian cities .
still , farc is n't the number one problem anymore and this latest blow causes one to wonder whether farc can still be referred to as a guerrilla force or rather just a criminal group .
but i think it 's premature to speak of an end to the conflict . claudia herrera pahl interviewed carsten wieland -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the negotiations have not ended - another round of talks was concluded - for the time being we are not at the finish line , " klich told poland 's private radio zet .
" we completed an important , a significant , round of talks two days ago but the finish line of talks is still ahead of us , " he said , adding that " july is a long month . "
daniel fried , the assistant secretary of state for european and eurasian affairs and a former ambassador to poland , told reporters that the last round of talks between the us and poland had made real progress but refused to confirm that an agreement had been reached .
the united states wants to base 10 interceptor missiles on the territory of the ex-communist nato member and a radar facility in the neighboring czech republic to ward off potential attacks by so-called " rogue " states , notably iran .
a deal under which the czech republic would house the missile shield 's radar base was concluded in april .
lithuania alternative seen as a bargaining chip bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech republic will host radar systems the proposed missile shield system has angered russia , which fears it may actually be one of the countries in the cross-hairs , while public opinion in poland and the czech republic is broadly opposed to the defensive system .
talks between poland and the united states over the missile shield began in may last year but after initial progress the negotiations have dragged over poland 's demands for substantial us aid to modernize its armed forces in return for its cooperation .
the impasse has allegedly led the us to consider poland 's northern neighbor lithuania but bogdan klich said such reports were simply pressure tactics during the negotiations with poland .
" in my opinion this was a pressure tactic used by the us on poland and it would not at all be so easy for the americans to locate the missile shield in lithuania ... because of stronger protests by russia against this location instead of poland , " klich said .
" the americans are endeavoring to maintain good relations with russia . "
senior officials in lithuania , like poland a member of the european union and nato , have flatly denied talks were underway with washington . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

colombian journalists have been invited to the scene of the rescue by defence minister santos , and i 'm sure that we 'll soon see images on screens everywhere .
the last pictures of ingrid betancourt were very depressing ; we heard from a fellow hostage that she was suffering from depression and various diseases , and she looked very thin . was the rescue expected ?
why did it happen now ? i think the rescue was expected .
as we know , in the last few weeks and months , farc suffered a series of blows and has been broken down into different factions which were n't able to move about within the country .
that 's a huge hindrance if you have a large number of hostages .
aside from the 15 hostages that have been freed , there are 42 other political hostages and several hundred more colombians being held by farc - that 's a significant burden for a guerrilla force that is in crisis .
it probably was n't possible for farc to move the hostages quickly or hide their tracks from the army .
i think that 's why the location of the hostages was known , and government agents were able to observe the hostages for a longer time . how long do you think it will take for the other hostages to be freed ? i think we can be fairly certain that the locations of many of the other hostages are known .
it 's a question of time before more will be freed , less so through military operations and more so due to traitors .
the blow delivered to farc by the release of these 15 hostages could cause many farc rebels to start thinking about whether they want to cooperate with the authorities .
there 's been a string of prominent desertions in recent weeks , and there 's been an erosion in farc 's ranks that could lead to more hostages being released . could the release of betancourt also be seen as an offer on the part of farc leader alfonso cano to the uribe government ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : betancourt , right , seen here with her mother , was farc 's trump card no .
if this were the case , farc would have handled it more intelligently , and not allowed the government any opportunity to present it as a rescue situation .
currently , we only have the government 's version of events , as well as the pictures and other evidence that point to it actually having been a rescue .
farc 's political head , alfonso cano , would have used his trump card - namely betancourt and the three american hostages - differently - at the start of peace talks for instance , so that he would have had something in his hand against the government .
now , farc has very little . is president 's uribe 's political strategy on farc paying off ? the last few months , but today especially , mark the biggest success uribe has had in achieving security in colombia .
his tough stance against the guerillas is paying off , as are the increasing incentives being offered to ex-rebels by the government .
it started with the disarmament of the paramilitaries in 2005 , but there have been increasing incentives for guerrillas to turn themselves in .
the military strategy is being coupled with a strategy for peace and post-conflict management in the regions that have been liberated .
it 's a big success for the uribe administration , and also explains his huge approval ratings of over 80 percent . do you think we are seeing the beginning of the end of farc and decades of internal conflict in colombia ? we 've entered a new era in terms of the conflict in colombia .
we no longer have the trio of typical actors , namely paramilitary , guerrilla and weak state .
rather , we have a state that is not just strong militarily , but that also enjoys popular support while , on the other side , we have illegal groups , or terrorists , as they 're now referred to .
then there are remnants of the old conflict , and among these is farc , or what remains of farc .
it could be that in the months or years to come , we 'll have a scenario where farc consists of just a few hundred fighters that are n't really relevant anymore , but that 's the optimistic variation .
the more cautious scenario is one where cano succeeds in reviving farc elements in colombian cities .
still , farc is n't the number one problem anymore and this latest blow causes one to wonder whether farc can still be referred to as a guerrilla force or rather just a criminal group .
but i think it 's premature to speak of an end to the conflict . claudia herrera pahl interviewed carsten wieland -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" none of the eight leading industrial nations have taken sufficient measures needed to be considered in line with the target to limit a worldwide increase in temperatures to 2 degrees centigrade , " niklas hoehne , author of the study said . at last year 's g8 summit in germany , leaders from the us , japan , germany , britain , france , italy , canada and russia reached agreement on considering a goal to halve global emissions by 2050 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year , g8 leaders made grand promises to cut emissions but the world 's top eight industrialized economies - which are responsible for an estimated 62 percent of carbon dioxide emissions - have failed to translate words into action , the study found .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 03.07.2008 oft-criticized us embassy prepares to open on july 4 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are sure to be more flags waving at the embassy party on july 4 china 's may have the better view , and finland 's the better architecture , but america 's is the biggest .
dw-world.de sent jefferson chase to check out the much-maligned new us embassy in berlin . for some reason , i found myself humming merle haggard 's " okie from muskogee " as i cycled up to the back entrance .
perhaps i was nervous .
after all i was bringing a camera and dictaphone into what was sure to be a high-security area .
two days ahead of the opening ceremony , workers were indeed already shifting security fences around the site near berlin 's brandenburg gate .
but the fencing , a local policewoman informed me , was largely being carted off from the fan mile of the euro 2008 soccer championship .
nor did the two american guards at the entrance seem particularly uptight , although they asked only be identified as " john " and " tom , " and said it was against regulations to photograph them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pre-world war ii embassy had more grandeur " i guess it 's to protect us from a ' terrorist ' coming up and killing us on the street , " said " tom , " making ironic air quotation marks and adding a humorous expletive to make it clear he did n't feel his job was particularly endangering his life .
" we 're looking forward to it , " added " john , " referring to the embassy 's official opening ceremony on friday , july 4th .
" everybody 's just going to have a big party . "
it was a surprisingly low-key atmosphere ahead of the public premiere of a building that has been the center of an unusual amount of squabbling .
back to the future the new building occupies the same spot on pariser platz , the square in front of the brandenburg gate , as the pre-world war ii us embassy to germany .
it is located in the formerly communist eastern part of the city , a stone 's throw from the site of ronald reagan 's famous " mr. gorbachev , tear down this wall " speech of 1987 .
thus , the new embassy can be seen as a symbol of america 's victories in both world war ii and the cold war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's a piece of the berlin wall in the embassy courtyard but the architects who designed it , from the california firm of moore ruble yudell , have drawn poor reviews , with many critics dismissing the structure as an example of outmoded 1980s postmodernism .
the city of berlin and the us state department also squabbled for years because us security requirements , put in place before and after 9/11 , forced the narrowing and diversion of streets to ensure that cars did not get to close to the building .
many berliners feared that the new embassy would create traffic jams , and a few even suggested that us diplomats should pack up and move out of the city center to avoid inconveniencing residents .
ironically , the building that was meant to embody the west 's triumph over communism ended up being caught in debates about how much security was needed vis-a-vis threats from those who do n't like america or its role in the world .
" we could have built an embassy out in the woods at half the cost and twice the security , " us ambassador to germany william r. timken told reporters in early 2008 , as the new embassy was nearing completion .
" we are here as a symbol of our desire to be a partner to germany . "
end of an eyesore bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists were already trying to get a peep at the building on wednesday , july 2 whatever the new building 's architectural shortcomings , its inauguration means that the fortifications surrounding its predecessor can be removed .
when reunified germany moved its capital from bonn to berlin in 1990 , the us was forced to use its former embassy to communist east germany , situated on a narrow side street near the brandenburg gate , as its formal diplomatic headquarters in germany .
the street had to be completely cordoned off with metal fencing and concrete pollards , yielding a spectacle reminiscent of checkpoint charlie at the height of the cold war - or belfast , northern ireland during the troubles .
as people geared up for the official launch of the new embassy , policemen in construction helmets were busy dismantling the fortifications around the old one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thankfully , the previous us embassy is history the street will be reopened to traffic , meaning that , if anything , the area around pariser platz may become a bit less congested .
expat opinion divided and what do the 12,500 us citizens who reside in the german capital think of their diplomats ' new home ?
being americans , they disagree .
" i think it 's misguided , embarrassing and ugly , " said todd cameron , an art gallery assistant who works not too far from pariser platz .
others feel that more sensitivity could have been shown toward residents ' concerns .
" i though it was a typical us thing to do , to just go ahead and build an embassy and make others move , " said brian landry , a cook at a local restaurant .
" they also would n't let me in when i tried to go have a look . "
but on the blogs , most americans seemed to think the new building was basically all right .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stands from the euro 2008 fan mile still had to be cleared " i think it looks fine , " wrote one user of a forum for american ex-pats in berlin .
" it also seems to be a design that wo n't look utterly ridiculous in 30 years , unlike some new construction . "
guests invited to the opening ceremonies on july 4th , including german chancellor angela merkel , will get a chance to inspect at closer range an embassy that once had some people up in arms , and now seems like little more than just another big building .
maybe they 'll even play some merle haggard . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de sent jefferson chase to check out the much-maligned new us embassy in berlin . for some reason , i found myself humming merle haggard 's " okie from muskogee " as i cycled up to the back entrance .
perhaps i was nervous .
after all i was bringing a camera and dictaphone into what was sure to be a high-security area .
two days ahead of the opening ceremony , workers were indeed already shifting security fences around the site near berlin 's brandenburg gate .
but the fencing , a local policewoman informed me , was largely being carted off from the fan mile of the euro 2008 soccer championship .
nor did the two american guards at the entrance seem particularly uptight , although they asked only be identified as " john " and " tom , " and said it was against regulations to photograph them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pre-world war ii embassy had more grandeur " i guess it 's to protect us from a ' terrorist ' coming up and killing us on the street , " said " tom , " making ironic air quotation marks and adding a humorous expletive to make it clear he did n't feel his job was particularly endangering his life .
" we 're looking forward to it , " added " john , " referring to the embassy 's official opening ceremony on friday , july 4th .
" everybody 's just going to have a big party . "
it was a surprisingly low-key atmosphere ahead of the public premiere of a building that has been the center of an unusual amount of squabbling .
back to the future the new building occupies the same spot on pariser platz , the square in front of the brandenburg gate , as the pre-world war ii us embassy to germany .
it is located in the formerly communist eastern part of the city , a stone 's throw from the site of ronald reagan 's famous " mr. gorbachev , tear down this wall " speech of 1987 .
thus , the new embassy can be seen as a symbol of america 's victories in both world war ii and the cold war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's a piece of the berlin wall in the embassy courtyard but the architects who designed it , from the california firm of moore ruble yudell , have drawn poor reviews , with many critics dismissing the structure as an example of outmoded 1980s postmodernism .
the city of berlin and the us state department also squabbled for years because us security requirements , put in place before and after 9/11 , forced the narrowing and diversion of streets to ensure that cars did not get to close to the building .
many berliners feared that the new embassy would create traffic jams , and a few even suggested that us diplomats should pack up and move out of the city center to avoid inconveniencing residents .
ironically , the building that was meant to embody the west 's triumph over communism ended up being caught in debates about how much security was needed vis-a-vis threats from those who do n't like america or its role in the world .
" we could have built an embassy out in the woods at half the cost and twice the security , " us ambassador to germany william r. timken told reporters in early 2008 , as the new embassy was nearing completion .
" we are here as a symbol of our desire to be a partner to germany . "
end of an eyesore bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists were already trying to get a peep at the building on wednesday , july 2 whatever the new building 's architectural shortcomings , its inauguration means that the fortifications surrounding its predecessor can be removed .
when reunified germany moved its capital from bonn to berlin in 1990 , the us was forced to use its former embassy to communist east germany , situated on a narrow side street near the brandenburg gate , as its formal diplomatic headquarters in germany .
the street had to be completely cordoned off with metal fencing and concrete pollards , yielding a spectacle reminiscent of checkpoint charlie at the height of the cold war - or belfast , northern ireland during the troubles .
as people geared up for the official launch of the new embassy , policemen in construction helmets were busy dismantling the fortifications around the old one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thankfully , the previous us embassy is history the street will be reopened to traffic , meaning that , if anything , the area around pariser platz may become a bit less congested .
expat opinion divided and what do the 12,500 us citizens who reside in the german capital think of their diplomats ' new home ?
being americans , they disagree .
" i think it 's misguided , embarrassing and ugly , " said todd cameron , an art gallery assistant who works not too far from pariser platz .
others feel that more sensitivity could have been shown toward residents ' concerns .
" i though it was a typical us thing to do , to just go ahead and build an embassy and make others move , " said brian landry , a cook at a local restaurant .
" they also would n't let me in when i tried to go have a look . "
but on the blogs , most americans seemed to think the new building was basically all right .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stands from the euro 2008 fan mile still had to be cleared " i think it looks fine , " wrote one user of a forum for american ex-pats in berlin .
" it also seems to be a design that wo n't look utterly ridiculous in 30 years , unlike some new construction . "
guests invited to the opening ceremonies on july 4th , including german chancellor angela merkel , will get a chance to inspect at closer range an embassy that once had some people up in arms , and now seems like little more than just another big building .

dw-world.de sent jefferson chase to check out the much-maligned new us embassy in berlin . for some reason , i found myself humming merle haggard 's " okie from muskogee " as i cycled up to the back entrance .
perhaps i was nervous .
after all i was bringing a camera and dictaphone into what was sure to be a high-security area .
two days ahead of the opening ceremony , workers were indeed already shifting security fences around the site near berlin 's brandenburg gate .
but the fencing , a local policewoman informed me , was largely being carted off from the fan mile of the euro 2008 soccer championship .
nor did the two american guards at the entrance seem particularly uptight , although they asked only be identified as " john " and " tom , " and said it was against regulations to photograph them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pre-world war ii embassy had more grandeur " i guess it 's to protect us from a ' terrorist ' coming up and killing us on the street , " said " tom , " making ironic air quotation marks and adding a humorous expletive to make it clear he did n't feel his job was particularly endangering his life .
" we 're looking forward to it , " added " john , " referring to the embassy 's official opening ceremony on friday , july 4th .
" everybody 's just going to have a big party . "
it was a surprisingly low-key atmosphere ahead of the public premiere of a building that has been the center of an unusual amount of squabbling .
back to the future the new building occupies the same spot on pariser platz , the square in front of the brandenburg gate , as the pre-world war ii us embassy to germany .
it is located in the formerly communist eastern part of the city , a stone 's throw from the site of ronald reagan 's famous " mr. gorbachev , tear down this wall " speech of 1987 .
thus , the new embassy can be seen as a symbol of america 's victories in both world war ii and the cold war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's a piece of the berlin wall in the embassy courtyard but the architects who designed it , from the california firm of moore ruble yudell , have drawn poor reviews , with many critics dismissing the structure as an example of outmoded 1980s postmodernism .
the city of berlin and the us state department also squabbled for years because us security requirements , put in place before and after 9/11 , forced the narrowing and diversion of streets to ensure that cars did not get to close to the building .
many berliners feared that the new embassy would create traffic jams , and a few even suggested that us diplomats should pack up and move out of the city center to avoid inconveniencing residents .
ironically , the building that was meant to embody the west 's triumph over communism ended up being caught in debates about how much security was needed vis-a-vis threats from those who do n't like america or its role in the world .
" we could have built an embassy out in the woods at half the cost and twice the security , " us ambassador to germany william r. timken told reporters in early 2008 , as the new embassy was nearing completion .
" we are here as a symbol of our desire to be a partner to germany . "

when reunified germany moved its capital from bonn to berlin in 1990 , the us was forced to use its former embassy to communist east germany , situated on a narrow side street near the brandenburg gate , as its formal diplomatic headquarters in germany .
the street had to be completely cordoned off with metal fencing and concrete pollards , yielding a spectacle reminiscent of checkpoint charlie at the height of the cold war - or belfast , northern ireland during the troubles .

we call on their captors to release all their hostages immediately and unconditionally , " she added . " nightmare has ended " betancourt had not been seen since a rebel " proof of life " video broadcast last year , in which she appeared thin and depressed in a jungle camp .
the us hostages , also shown in the video , described how she was slowly succumbing to hepatitis b and tropical skin diseases , and was kept chained to a tree after attempts to escape . betancourt 's family waged a campaign for her freedom , organizing events in both colombia and france , despite warnings from the colombian government that raising her profile in such a way only made her a more valuable hostage for the farc rebels . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel 's stance was echoed by germany 's health minister ulla schmidt .
" i reject this path categorically , " she said .
" the correct path is to offer assistance to those who are dying instead of helping those free from terminal illness to commit suicide . "
the debate was prompted by the revelation this week that a 79-year-old wurzburg woman chose to end her own life on saturday despite not having any life-threatening diseases or suffering great physical pain .
what added an extra angle to the story was that former hamburg justice senator roger kusch , a proponent for the right to die , advised her of the best way to do it .
" i was in her apartment at 11:00 am , " kusch explained at a press conference he called on monday to discuss the assisted suicide .
" at around 11:30 , she began to prepare three glasses - one with the sedative diazepam , one with a mixture of the anti-malaria drug chloroquine and one with a sweet syrup , because the other substances can cause nausea .

he also showed the press conference clips from a nine-hour video he made documenting his relationship to the pensioner , identified only as bettina s. kusch made headlines earlier this year when he presented to the media a " suicide machine " patients could use to inject themselves with a deadly cocktail .
the case has prompted fresh calls in germany for stronger regulations and laws regarding assisted suicide .

merkel 's stance was echoed by germany 's health minister ulla schmidt .
" i reject this path categorically , " she said .
" the correct path is to offer assistance to those who are dying instead of helping those free from terminal illness to commit suicide . "
the debate was prompted by the revelation this week that a 79-year-old wurzburg woman chose to end her own life on saturday despite not having any life-threatening diseases or suffering great physical pain .
what added an extra angle to the story was that former hamburg justice senator roger kusch , a proponent for the right to die , advised her of the best way to do it .
" i was in her apartment at 11:00 am , " kusch explained at a press conference he called on monday to discuss the assisted suicide .
" at around 11:30 , she began to prepare three glasses - one with the sedative diazepam , one with a mixture of the anti-malaria drug chloroquine and one with a sweet syrup , because the other substances can cause nausea .
she drank the glass with the deadly chloroquine quickly .

he also showed the press conference clips from a nine-hour video he made documenting his relationship to the pensioner , identified only as bettina s. kusch made headlines earlier this year when he presented to the media a " suicide machine " patients could use to inject themselves with a deadly cocktail .
the case has prompted fresh calls in germany for stronger regulations and laws regarding assisted suicide .
merkel 's conservatives in favor of prison sentences merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- party wants to introduce a bill in cdu controlled states that would make the involvement in an assisted suicide a new criminal offense which carries a prison term of up to three years for the commercial or otherwise organized offering of suicide assistance .
the cdu is expected to put the bill to the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , on friday .
however , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , the cdu 's coalition partner in government , have their own ideas .
the spd would like to pass a law requiring doctors to obey patients ' wishes as expressed in " living wills . "
the spd claims to have wide support for the idea from other political factions .
but the cdu argues that such a law would presuppose that patients completely understand all of the implications of a living will - an assumption that , given the complexity of medical care , the patient can not possibly make .

he 's already implemented a few cushy perks for the club , too . the new atmosphere , which includes buddha statues at the training center , was briefly disturbed by klinsmann 's demand to bar photographers early on at the press conference on wednesday , july 2 , because the flashes and noise bothered him .
the photographers left in protest but the incident was only the latest sign of a new era at the german top club which klinsmann named " among the top 10 in the world . "
" munich has the highest expectations , " he said .
" the fans want both titles in germany and to be in champions league until the end .
that is munich 's ambition and we want to meet it … .
we set the highest goals for ourselves . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann with his assistant coach martin vasquez munich won a third domestic league and cup double in four years in the past season but have not been as successful on the big stage - their last champions league final dating back to 2001 when they beat valencia on penalties .
allowing for inspiration a new training facility and rest area is the most visible sign of change in munich , in addition to his multi-cultural coaching staff and an eight-hour working day for players in the pre-season .
players are to lunch together and the facility allows munich to do away with training camps , with klinsmann saying it is better for players to enjoy their home and families after work instead of a sometimes boring hotel . " the players are to be inspired and motivated - by our staff , by kalle -lrb- chairman karl-heinz rummenigge -rrb- and uli -lrb- general manager uli hoeness -rrb- - to be given lots of ideas , " commented the new head coach .
rummenigge said , " we are all thrilled .
we have a perfect oasis for our players to bring their concentration 100 percent on football .
percentage is important in football . "
espresso and yoga bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann wants to provide his players with what they need luca toni was promised his daily espresso and franck ribery can do yoga if he wants to as every aspect is being looked after under klinsmann , who successfully introduced similar changes as germany coach from 2004 to 2006 .
" my philosophy is easy : to make every player better each day .
there will be a lot of individual work on and off the pitch .
we have unique foundations and want to bring them to the next level , " said klinsmann .
those include bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski , the national team heroes under klinsmann and again at euro 2008 , who rarely play in munich 's quality roster .
rummenigge declared them not for sale on wednesday .
chairman refutes podolski claim rummenigge poured cold water on wednesday 's reports in the german media that podolski was set to be sold to cologne for 15 million euros -lrb- $ 23.5 million -rrb- .
" there is no question of selling podolski to cologne .
i called my counterpart to tell him clearly .
it is a definite decision , " said rummenigge in a press conference in munich .
bayern 's chairman of the board said reports on both the sport-bild and sport1.de w eb sites were " a big joke . "
rummenigge also ruled out the possible transfer of germany 's player of 2007 mario gomez from vfb stuttgart to munich .
" since stuttgart informed us of his decision not to negotiate with us , there is nothing more to say on the subject and i do not believe they want to reactivate the negotiations , " insisted rummenigge .
" our squad is already well packed . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poldi and schweini are bayern and germany colleagues on the subject of podolski and schweinsteiger , klinsmann said he could also not guarantee them a place in the starting 11 , but heaped praise on the two youngsters who have won more than 50 caps each at the young age of 23 .
" there is a lot of potential for both .
they are just 23 and have experienced things many others have n't seen in their entire careers .
they have experienced extremes .

he 's already implemented a few cushy perks for the club , too . the new atmosphere , which includes buddha statues at the training center , was briefly disturbed by klinsmann 's demand to bar photographers early on at the press conference on wednesday , july 2 , because the flashes and noise bothered him .
the photographers left in protest but the incident was only the latest sign of a new era at the german top club which klinsmann named " among the top 10 in the world . "
" munich has the highest expectations , " he said .
" the fans want both titles in germany and to be in champions league until the end .
that is munich 's ambition and we want to meet it … .
we set the highest goals for ourselves . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann with his assistant coach martin vasquez munich won a third domestic league and cup double in four years in the past season but have not been as successful on the big stage - their last champions league final dating back to 2001 when they beat valencia on penalties .
allowing for inspiration a new training facility and rest area is the most visible sign of change in munich , in addition to his multi-cultural coaching staff and an eight-hour working day for players in the pre-season .
players are to lunch together and the facility allows munich to do away with training camps , with klinsmann saying it is better for players to enjoy their home and families after work instead of a sometimes boring hotel . " the players are to be inspired and motivated - by our staff , by kalle -lrb- chairman karl-heinz rummenigge -rrb- and uli -lrb- general manager uli hoeness -rrb- - to be given lots of ideas , " commented the new head coach .

we have unique foundations and want to bring them to the next level , " said klinsmann .
those include bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski , the national team heroes under klinsmann and again at euro 2008 , who rarely play in munich 's quality roster .

i called my counterpart to tell him clearly .
it is a definite decision , " said rummenigge in a press conference in munich .
bayern 's chairman of the board said reports on both the sport-bild and sport1.de w eb sites were " a big joke . "
rummenigge also ruled out the possible transfer of germany 's player of 2007 mario gomez from vfb stuttgart to munich .

" i find the mood is good , there 's no posturing , no-one 's playing games , but at the same time we are dealing with a question that 's tough , there are very tough things here , " borloo told reporters .
" to put things in perspective , the economies of 27 countries with a variety of backgrounds in energy and industry are being asked to make a somewhat radical shift using everyday budgets , " he said .
" at the moment , no other region in the world is attempting something on this scale . "
agreement lacking on co2 level details the eu is struggling to agree on the details of its plan to reduce the 27-nation bloc 's greenhouse-gas pollution by 20 percent by 2020 compared with the benchmark year 1990 .
they promised to deepen this to 30 percent if another industrialized power followed suit .
they also pledged to boost the share of renewables in the eu energy mix to 20 percent , including a 10-percent share for biofuels .
however , agreement on these broad goals has become a touchy and complex issue in light of the surge in oil and gas prices .

" the negotiations have not ended - another round of talks was concluded - for the time being we are not at the finish line , " klich told poland 's private radio zet .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 03.07.2008 ecb raises interest rates amid soaring inflation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the decision had been expected since euro zone inflation hit a record four percent in june the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- raised its main interest rate to 4.25 percent on thursday , its first increase in more than a year amid spiraling euro zone inflation and soaring oil prices . the ecb 's 21-member rate-setting council defied increasing political opposition to a tighter monetary policy in the 15-member euro zone by raising its benchmark refinancing rate by 25 basis points to 4.25 percent on thursday , july 3 . the decision had been widely expected since ecb president jean-claude trichet raised the possibility last month and euro zone inflation hit a record 4 percent year-on-year in june . while analysts had expected the rate increase , they are more divided as to whether it will represent a one-off attempt by the ecb to ward off inflationary pressure or set the stage for further increases . as a result , with the rate hike considered a done deal , the focus of financial markets will again be on trichet 's press briefing for indications as to the bank 's future plans . however , ahead of the ecb announcement , oil prices bounded ahead by more than 1 percent to breach the $ 145-a-barrel mark to hit a new all-time high with soaring food and energy prices having sparked a global pickup in inflation . " sending the wrong signal " this in turn has raised concerns that central banks around the world will be forced to raise borrowing costs just as international economic growth is losing momentum . senior ministers from germany , spain and france cautioned the european central bank against raising interest rates last weekend , warning it could stifle growth . german finance minister peer steinbrueck said week higher rates risked worsening a slowdown in growth .
" the ecb has to consider that they could possibly send the wrong signal with an interest rate increase because it could have a pro-cyclical impact at a point when the economy is slowing down , " he told german weekly der spiegel .
steinbrueck 's view was echoed by spanish prime minster jose luis rodriguez zapatero . " now , it has to have a certain flexibility , especially as european inflation comes essentially from the price of oil and food , not from an excess of internal demand , " zapatero said in an interview with daily el pais . the ecb rate hike and the growing global economic uncertainty also comes as part of the build-up to this month 's summit in japan of the group of eight leading industrial nations where the troubled state of the world economy could dominate proceedings . also on thursday sweden 's central bank , the riksbank , announced that it was joining the push to higher rates by lifting its benchmark repo rate by 25 basis points to 4.5 percent . this came in the wake of data showing annual inflation in sweden climbing to 4 percent in may to hit its highest rate in more than 14 years . adding to the growing worries about the economic risks posed by inflation , figures released on thursday showed consumer prices in switzerland jumping to a 15-year high of 2.9 percent in june , consequently increasing the pressure on the swiss national bank . inflation peaks in euro zone euro zone inflation also shot up to a 16-year high of 4 percent in june , preliminary data announced this week showed .
inflation in the currency bloc is now double the ecb 's target of " close to , but just below 2 percent . " trichet surprised markets last month by signalling that a rate hike could be in the pipeline , saying in his regular press briefing that the bank 's governing council was in a state of " heightened alertness " about the risks posed by inflation . in the meantime , ecb figures released last week pointed to a sustained rise in the amount of money in circulation in the euro zone with the so-called m3 money supply chalking up a 10.5-percent annual rate in may .
the ecb sees m3 as an indicator of future price trends . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" sending the wrong signal " this in turn has raised concerns that central banks around the world will be forced to raise borrowing costs just as international economic growth is losing momentum . senior ministers from germany , spain and france cautioned the european central bank against raising interest rates last weekend , warning it could stifle growth . german finance minister peer steinbrueck said week higher rates risked worsening a slowdown in growth .
" the ecb has to consider that they could possibly send the wrong signal with an interest rate increase because it could have a pro-cyclical impact at a point when the economy is slowing down , " he told german weekly der spiegel .
steinbrueck 's view was echoed by spanish prime minster jose luis rodriguez zapatero . " now , it has to have a certain flexibility , especially as european inflation comes essentially from the price of oil and food , not from an excess of internal demand , " zapatero said in an interview with daily el pais . the ecb rate hike and the growing global economic uncertainty also comes as part of the build-up to this month 's summit in japan of the group of eight leading industrial nations where the troubled state of the world economy could dominate proceedings . also on thursday sweden 's central bank , the riksbank , announced that it was joining the push to higher rates by lifting its benchmark repo rate by 25 basis points to 4.5 percent . this came in the wake of data showing annual inflation in sweden climbing to 4 percent in may to hit its highest rate in more than 14 years . adding to the growing worries about the economic risks posed by inflation , figures released on thursday showed consumer prices in switzerland jumping to a 15-year high of 2.9 percent in june , consequently increasing the pressure on the swiss national bank . inflation peaks in euro zone euro zone inflation also shot up to a 16-year high of 4 percent in june , preliminary data announced this week showed .
inflation in the currency bloc is now double the ecb 's target of " close to , but just below 2 percent . " trichet surprised markets last month by signalling that a rate hike could be in the pipeline , saying in his regular press briefing that the bank 's governing council was in a state of " heightened alertness " about the risks posed by inflation . in the meantime , ecb figures released last week pointed to a sustained rise in the amount of money in circulation in the euro zone with the so-called m3 money supply chalking up a 10.5-percent annual rate in may .
the ecb sees m3 as an indicator of future price trends . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

colombian journalists have been invited to the scene of the rescue by defence minister santos , and i 'm sure that we 'll soon see images on screens everywhere .
the last pictures of ingrid betancourt were very depressing ; we heard from a fellow hostage that she was suffering from depression and various diseases , and she looked very thin . was the rescue expected ?
why did it happen now ? i think the rescue was expected .
as we know , in the last few weeks and months , farc suffered a series of blows and has been broken down into different factions which were n't able to move about within the country .
that 's a huge hindrance if you have a large number of hostages .
aside from the 15 hostages that have been freed , there are 42 other political hostages and several hundred more colombians being held by farc - that 's a significant burden for a guerrilla force that is in crisis .
it probably was n't possible for farc to move the hostages quickly or hide their tracks from the army .
i think that 's why the location of the hostages was known , and government agents were able to observe the hostages for a longer time . how long do you think it will take for the other hostages to be freed ? i think we can be fairly certain that the locations of many of the other hostages are known .
it 's a question of time before more will be freed , less so through military operations and more so due to traitors .
the blow delivered to farc by the release of these 15 hostages could cause many farc rebels to start thinking about whether they want to cooperate with the authorities .
there 's been a string of prominent desertions in recent weeks , and there 's been an erosion in farc 's ranks that could lead to more hostages being released . could the release of betancourt also be seen as an offer on the part of farc leader alfonso cano to the uribe government ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : betancourt , right , seen here with her mother , was farc 's trump card no .
if this were the case , farc would have handled it more intelligently , and not allowed the government any opportunity to present it as a rescue situation .
currently , we only have the government 's version of events , as well as the pictures and other evidence that point to it actually having been a rescue .
farc 's political head , alfonso cano , would have used his trump card - namely betancourt and the three american hostages - differently - at the start of peace talks for instance , so that he would have had something in his hand against the government .
now , farc has very little . is president 's uribe 's political strategy on farc paying off ? the last few months , but today especially , mark the biggest success uribe has had in achieving security in colombia .
his tough stance against the guerillas is paying off , as are the increasing incentives being offered to ex-rebels by the government .
it started with the disarmament of the paramilitaries in 2005 , but there have been increasing incentives for guerrillas to turn themselves in .
the military strategy is being coupled with a strategy for peace and post-conflict management in the regions that have been liberated .
it 's a big success for the uribe administration , and also explains his huge approval ratings of over 80 percent . do you think we are seeing the beginning of the end of farc and decades of internal conflict in colombia ? we 've entered a new era in terms of the conflict in colombia .
we no longer have the trio of typical actors , namely paramilitary , guerrilla and weak state .
rather , we have a state that is not just strong militarily , but that also enjoys popular support while , on the other side , we have illegal groups , or terrorists , as they 're now referred to .
then there are remnants of the old conflict , and among these is farc , or what remains of farc .
it could be that in the months or years to come , we 'll have a scenario where farc consists of just a few hundred fighters that are n't really relevant anymore , but that 's the optimistic variation .
the more cautious scenario is one where cano succeeds in reviving farc elements in colombian cities .
still , farc is n't the number one problem anymore and this latest blow causes one to wonder whether farc can still be referred to as a guerrilla force or rather just a criminal group .

" the negotiations have not ended - another round of talks was concluded - for the time being we are not at the finish line , " klich told poland 's private radio zet .
" we completed an important , a significant , round of talks two days ago but the finish line of talks is still ahead of us , " he said , adding that " july is a long month . "
daniel fried , the assistant secretary of state for european and eurasian affairs and a former ambassador to poland , told reporters that the last round of talks between the us and poland had made real progress but refused to confirm that an agreement had been reached .
the united states wants to base 10 interceptor missiles on the territory of the ex-communist nato member and a radar facility in the neighboring czech republic to ward off potential attacks by so-called " rogue " states , notably iran .
a deal under which the czech republic would house the missile shield 's radar base was concluded in april .

talks between poland and the united states over the missile shield began in may last year but after initial progress the negotiations have dragged over poland 's demands for substantial us aid to modernize its armed forces in return for its cooperation .
the impasse has allegedly led the us to consider poland 's northern neighbor lithuania but bogdan klich said such reports were simply pressure tactics during the negotiations with poland .
" in my opinion this was a pressure tactic used by the us on poland and it would not at all be so easy for the americans to locate the missile shield in lithuania ... because of stronger protests by russia against this location instead of poland , " klich said .
" the americans are endeavoring to maintain good relations with russia . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 03.07.2008 merkel remains strongly opposed to assisted suicide großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actively assisting suicide is illegal in germany german chancellor angela merkel has spoken out in the strongest terms against euthanasia as the heated debate over a former hamburg government official 's involvement in the assisted suicide of a pensioner gathers pace . merkel , outlining her christian democrats ' party line on the topic , said that she was against " every form of assisted suicide " regardless of the circumstances .
merkel 's stance was echoed by germany 's health minister ulla schmidt .
" i reject this path categorically , " she said .
" the correct path is to offer assistance to those who are dying instead of helping those free from terminal illness to commit suicide . "
the debate was prompted by the revelation this week that a 79-year-old wurzburg woman chose to end her own life on saturday despite not having any life-threatening diseases or suffering great physical pain .
what added an extra angle to the story was that former hamburg justice senator roger kusch , a proponent for the right to die , advised her of the best way to do it .
" i was in her apartment at 11:00 am , " kusch explained at a press conference he called on monday to discuss the assisted suicide .
" at around 11:30 , she began to prepare three glasses - one with the sedative diazepam , one with a mixture of the anti-malaria drug chloroquine and one with a sweet syrup , because the other substances can cause nausea .
she drank the glass with the deadly chloroquine quickly .
her last words were ' auf wiedersehen . ' … then i left . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kusch educated the pensioner on the best way to die kusch then said that he vacated the apartment for three hours so as not to be present at the moment of death .
when he returned , he said , she was lying dead on her bed .
" i am for self-determination until the final breath , " he says .
he also showed the press conference clips from a nine-hour video he made documenting his relationship to the pensioner , identified only as bettina s. kusch made headlines earlier this year when he presented to the media a " suicide machine " patients could use to inject themselves with a deadly cocktail .
the case has prompted fresh calls in germany for stronger regulations and laws regarding assisted suicide .
merkel 's conservatives in favor of prison sentences merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- party wants to introduce a bill in cdu controlled states that would make the involvement in an assisted suicide a new criminal offense which carries a prison term of up to three years for the commercial or otherwise organized offering of suicide assistance .
the cdu is expected to put the bill to the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , on friday .
however , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , the cdu 's coalition partner in government , have their own ideas .
the spd would like to pass a law requiring doctors to obey patients ' wishes as expressed in " living wills . "
the spd claims to have wide support for the idea from other political factions .
but the cdu argues that such a law would presuppose that patients completely understand all of the implications of a living will - an assumption that , given the complexity of medical care , the patient can not possibly make .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss organization dignitas provides a way and place to die both the netherlands and belgium passed laws in 2002 which allow doctors to give terminally ill patients a deadly injection , provided they were in full possession of their faculties when they made the decision to die .
switzerland too allows such assistance .
officials in berlin have been wrangling for months over what form a law governing how binding so-called " living wills " should take .
such documents outline what medical treatment individuals want should they no longer be in a position to make decisions .
social democrats urge restraint in clamor for new laws the spd 's peter struck , the leader of the party 's faction in the bundestag , warned against making rash decisions in the heat of the debate , saying that few bills brought in immediately in the aftermath of such an event were detailed enough to be effective .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : advocates say euthanasia is a humane solution edzard schmidt-jortzig , the chairperson of the german ethical council , also warned about tightening restrictions and introducing criminal justice laws .
he said that there were some emergencies in which euthanasia was the only humane solution .
roger kusch was careful not to break any of the current laws through his involvement with the death of bettina s. while he educated the pensioner on how to kill herself , he did not administer the deadly dosage himself .
because suicide is not illegal in germany , advising someone on how best to do it is likewise not punishable .
it is currently illegal to actively assist in someone 's suicide in germany .
despite his kusch 's best efforts , public prosecutors have now opened an investigation into the suicide . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the negotiations have not ended - another round of talks was concluded - for the time being we are not at the finish line , " klich told poland 's private radio zet .
" we completed an important , a significant , round of talks two days ago but the finish line of talks is still ahead of us , " he said , adding that " july is a long month . "
daniel fried , the assistant secretary of state for european and eurasian affairs and a former ambassador to poland , told reporters that the last round of talks between the us and poland had made real progress but refused to confirm that an agreement had been reached .
the united states wants to base 10 interceptor missiles on the territory of the ex-communist nato member and a radar facility in the neighboring czech republic to ward off potential attacks by so-called " rogue " states , notably iran .
a deal under which the czech republic would house the missile shield 's radar base was concluded in april .
lithuania alternative seen as a bargaining chip bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech republic will host radar systems the proposed missile shield system has angered russia , which fears it may actually be one of the countries in the cross-hairs , while public opinion in poland and the czech republic is broadly opposed to the defensive system .
talks between poland and the united states over the missile shield began in may last year but after initial progress the negotiations have dragged over poland 's demands for substantial us aid to modernize its armed forces in return for its cooperation .
the impasse has allegedly led the us to consider poland 's northern neighbor lithuania but bogdan klich said such reports were simply pressure tactics during the negotiations with poland .

" none of the eight leading industrial nations have taken sufficient measures needed to be considered in line with the target to limit a worldwide increase in temperatures to 2 degrees centigrade , " niklas hoehne , author of the study said . at last year 's g8 summit in germany , leaders from the us , japan , germany , britain , france , italy , canada and russia reached agreement on considering a goal to halve global emissions by 2050 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year , g8 leaders made grand promises to cut emissions but the world 's top eight industrialized economies - which are responsible for an estimated 62 percent of carbon dioxide emissions - have failed to translate words into action , the study found . " the g-8 countries have a responsibility to be high achievers in the race against climate change .
they need to be role models trailblazing the way to steer the world towards a low carbon , clean energy economy , " allianz management board member joachim faber said . us given worst report card the scorecard examined the policies implemented by federal governments of g8 countries to reduce emissions and assessed emission trends since 1990 and progress against the country 's kyoto target .
it rated the countries ' individual performances on three specific policy areas - energy efficiency , renewable energy and the development of carbon trading markets . the study singled out the us , canada and russia for having made the least progress , saying they had " failed the test . "
among the three , the report was most scathing about the us which took last place in the ranking . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush has resisted binding international agreements to cut emissions " the united states scores the worst of all g8 countries , being the highest emitter with the highest per capita emissions and an increasing trend in total emissions , " it said . canada came in second from the bottom with the report saying it too showed a steadily increasing trend in total greenhouse gas emissions . while russia showed declining emissions in the early 1990s , the country 's record has worsened since 1999 with emissions on the rise and no notable policies to curb them , the scorecard said . " time is running out " at the top of the rankings table , britain leads the race slightly ahead of france and germany . while britain is projected to reach its kyoto target and has introduced innovative policies like the climate change bill , the report said it had done too little to increase use of renewable sources of energy and pointed out that the share of polluting coal was rising in the country 's energy mix . france , ranked second , was praised for its policies and international positions on climate change but it remained weak on achieving its goals in the near future , the study said . third place germany performs best on renewable energy and has recently approved legislation on energy efficiency and climate policies .
but so far it has failed to take a clear stance against coal-powered plants , according to the report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmental activists will be targetting the g8 summit in japan japan , ranked fifth , is increasing its emissions and is far from meeting its kyoto target .
while the country makes extensive use of offset projects in developing countries under the un-administered carbon market , it has no national mandatory measures such as emissions trading . “ time is running out , ” regine günther , head of climate change policy at the wwf in germany said .
" we have 10 to 15 years left in which the global emissions have to peak and decline .
the world is at a crossroads where decisive action now could translate into economic success . ” setting further goals the report also analyzed energy policies of the five emerging economies brazil , china , india , mexico and south africa but the countries are n't part of the ranking because their records ca n't be measured the same way as those of industrialized nations . the report urges g8 leaders meeting in japan next week to commit to a binding long-term target for emission reductions of 80 percent by 2050 , and as close as possible to 40 percent by 2020 . g8 environment ministers have already said they hope to reach agreement on a successor treaty to the kyoto protocol which expires in 2012 . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel 's stance was echoed by germany 's health minister ulla schmidt .
" i reject this path categorically , " she said .
" the correct path is to offer assistance to those who are dying instead of helping those free from terminal illness to commit suicide . "
the debate was prompted by the revelation this week that a 79-year-old wurzburg woman chose to end her own life on saturday despite not having any life-threatening diseases or suffering great physical pain .
what added an extra angle to the story was that former hamburg justice senator roger kusch , a proponent for the right to die , advised her of the best way to do it .
" i was in her apartment at 11:00 am , " kusch explained at a press conference he called on monday to discuss the assisted suicide .
" at around 11:30 , she began to prepare three glasses - one with the sedative diazepam , one with a mixture of the anti-malaria drug chloroquine and one with a sweet syrup , because the other substances can cause nausea .
she drank the glass with the deadly chloroquine quickly .
her last words were ' auf wiedersehen . ' … then i left . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kusch educated the pensioner on the best way to die kusch then said that he vacated the apartment for three hours so as not to be present at the moment of death .
when he returned , he said , she was lying dead on her bed .
" i am for self-determination until the final breath , " he says .
he also showed the press conference clips from a nine-hour video he made documenting his relationship to the pensioner , identified only as bettina s. kusch made headlines earlier this year when he presented to the media a " suicide machine " patients could use to inject themselves with a deadly cocktail .
the case has prompted fresh calls in germany for stronger regulations and laws regarding assisted suicide .

the cdu is expected to put the bill to the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , on friday .
however , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , the cdu 's coalition partner in government , have their own ideas .
the spd would like to pass a law requiring doctors to obey patients ' wishes as expressed in " living wills . "
the spd claims to have wide support for the idea from other political factions .
but the cdu argues that such a law would presuppose that patients completely understand all of the implications of a living will - an assumption that , given the complexity of medical care , the patient can not possibly make .

" none of the eight leading industrial nations have taken sufficient measures needed to be considered in line with the target to limit a worldwide increase in temperatures to 2 degrees centigrade , " niklas hoehne , author of the study said . at last year 's g8 summit in germany , leaders from the us , japan , germany , britain , france , italy , canada and russia reached agreement on considering a goal to halve global emissions by 2050 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year , g8 leaders made grand promises to cut emissions but the world 's top eight industrialized economies - which are responsible for an estimated 62 percent of carbon dioxide emissions - have failed to translate words into action , the study found . " the g-8 countries have a responsibility to be high achievers in the race against climate change .
they need to be role models trailblazing the way to steer the world towards a low carbon , clean energy economy , " allianz management board member joachim faber said . us given worst report card the scorecard examined the policies implemented by federal governments of g8 countries to reduce emissions and assessed emission trends since 1990 and progress against the country 's kyoto target .
it rated the countries ' individual performances on three specific policy areas - energy efficiency , renewable energy and the development of carbon trading markets . the study singled out the us , canada and russia for having made the least progress , saying they had " failed the test . "
among the three , the report was most scathing about the us which took last place in the ranking . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush has resisted binding international agreements to cut emissions " the united states scores the worst of all g8 countries , being the highest emitter with the highest per capita emissions and an increasing trend in total emissions , " it said . canada came in second from the bottom with the report saying it too showed a steadily increasing trend in total greenhouse gas emissions . while russia showed declining emissions in the early 1990s , the country 's record has worsened since 1999 with emissions on the rise and no notable policies to curb them , the scorecard said . " time is running out " at the top of the rankings table , britain leads the race slightly ahead of france and germany . while britain is projected to reach its kyoto target and has introduced innovative policies like the climate change bill , the report said it had done too little to increase use of renewable sources of energy and pointed out that the share of polluting coal was rising in the country 's energy mix . france , ranked second , was praised for its policies and international positions on climate change but it remained weak on achieving its goals in the near future , the study said . third place germany performs best on renewable energy and has recently approved legislation on energy efficiency and climate policies .
but so far it has failed to take a clear stance against coal-powered plants , according to the report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmental activists will be targetting the g8 summit in japan japan , ranked fifth , is increasing its emissions and is far from meeting its kyoto target .
while the country makes extensive use of offset projects in developing countries under the un-administered carbon market , it has no national mandatory measures such as emissions trading . “ time is running out , ” regine günther , head of climate change policy at the wwf in germany said .
" we have 10 to 15 years left in which the global emissions have to peak and decline .
the world is at a crossroads where decisive action now could translate into economic success . ” setting further goals the report also analyzed energy policies of the five emerging economies brazil , china , india , mexico and south africa but the countries are n't part of the ranking because their records ca n't be measured the same way as those of industrialized nations . the report urges g8 leaders meeting in japan next week to commit to a binding long-term target for emission reductions of 80 percent by 2050 , and as close as possible to 40 percent by 2020 . g8 environment ministers have already said they hope to reach agreement on a successor treaty to the kyoto protocol which expires in 2012 . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

colombian journalists have been invited to the scene of the rescue by defence minister santos , and i 'm sure that we 'll soon see images on screens everywhere .
the last pictures of ingrid betancourt were very depressing ; we heard from a fellow hostage that she was suffering from depression and various diseases , and she looked very thin . was the rescue expected ?
why did it happen now ? i think the rescue was expected .
as we know , in the last few weeks and months , farc suffered a series of blows and has been broken down into different factions which were n't able to move about within the country .
that 's a huge hindrance if you have a large number of hostages .
aside from the 15 hostages that have been freed , there are 42 other political hostages and several hundred more colombians being held by farc - that 's a significant burden for a guerrilla force that is in crisis .
it probably was n't possible for farc to move the hostages quickly or hide their tracks from the army .
i think that 's why the location of the hostages was known , and government agents were able to observe the hostages for a longer time . how long do you think it will take for the other hostages to be freed ? i think we can be fairly certain that the locations of many of the other hostages are known .
it 's a question of time before more will be freed , less so through military operations and more so due to traitors .
the blow delivered to farc by the release of these 15 hostages could cause many farc rebels to start thinking about whether they want to cooperate with the authorities .
there 's been a string of prominent desertions in recent weeks , and there 's been an erosion in farc 's ranks that could lead to more hostages being released . could the release of betancourt also be seen as an offer on the part of farc leader alfonso cano to the uribe government ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : betancourt , right , seen here with her mother , was farc 's trump card no .
if this were the case , farc would have handled it more intelligently , and not allowed the government any opportunity to present it as a rescue situation .
currently , we only have the government 's version of events , as well as the pictures and other evidence that point to it actually having been a rescue .
farc 's political head , alfonso cano , would have used his trump card - namely betancourt and the three american hostages - differently - at the start of peace talks for instance , so that he would have had something in his hand against the government .
now , farc has very little . is president 's uribe 's political strategy on farc paying off ? the last few months , but today especially , mark the biggest success uribe has had in achieving security in colombia .
his tough stance against the guerillas is paying off , as are the increasing incentives being offered to ex-rebels by the government .
it started with the disarmament of the paramilitaries in 2005 , but there have been increasing incentives for guerrillas to turn themselves in .
the military strategy is being coupled with a strategy for peace and post-conflict management in the regions that have been liberated .
it 's a big success for the uribe administration , and also explains his huge approval ratings of over 80 percent . do you think we are seeing the beginning of the end of farc and decades of internal conflict in colombia ? we 've entered a new era in terms of the conflict in colombia .
we no longer have the trio of typical actors , namely paramilitary , guerrilla and weak state .
rather , we have a state that is not just strong militarily , but that also enjoys popular support while , on the other side , we have illegal groups , or terrorists , as they 're now referred to .
then there are remnants of the old conflict , and among these is farc , or what remains of farc .
it could be that in the months or years to come , we 'll have a scenario where farc consists of just a few hundred fighters that are n't really relevant anymore , but that 's the optimistic variation .
the more cautious scenario is one where cano succeeds in reviving farc elements in colombian cities .
still , farc is n't the number one problem anymore and this latest blow causes one to wonder whether farc can still be referred to as a guerrilla force or rather just a criminal group .
but i think it 's premature to speak of an end to the conflict . claudia herrera pahl interviewed carsten wieland -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" munich has the highest expectations , " he said .
" the fans want both titles in germany and to be in champions league until the end .

dw-world.de sent jefferson chase to check out the much-maligned new us embassy in berlin . for some reason , i found myself humming merle haggard 's " okie from muskogee " as i cycled up to the back entrance .
perhaps i was nervous .
after all i was bringing a camera and dictaphone into what was sure to be a high-security area .
two days ahead of the opening ceremony , workers were indeed already shifting security fences around the site near berlin 's brandenburg gate .
but the fencing , a local policewoman informed me , was largely being carted off from the fan mile of the euro 2008 soccer championship .
nor did the two american guards at the entrance seem particularly uptight , although they asked only be identified as " john " and " tom , " and said it was against regulations to photograph them .

" we 're looking forward to it , " added " john , " referring to the embassy 's official opening ceremony on friday , july 4th .
" everybody 's just going to have a big party . "
it was a surprisingly low-key atmosphere ahead of the public premiere of a building that has been the center of an unusual amount of squabbling .

it is located in the formerly communist eastern part of the city , a stone 's throw from the site of ronald reagan 's famous " mr. gorbachev , tear down this wall " speech of 1987 .

many berliners feared that the new embassy would create traffic jams , and a few even suggested that us diplomats should pack up and move out of the city center to avoid inconveniencing residents .
ironically , the building that was meant to embody the west 's triumph over communism ended up being caught in debates about how much security was needed vis-a-vis threats from those who do n't like america or its role in the world .
" we could have built an embassy out in the woods at half the cost and twice the security , " us ambassador to germany william r. timken told reporters in early 2008 , as the new embassy was nearing completion .

" i find the mood is good , there 's no posturing , no-one 's playing games , but at the same time we are dealing with a question that 's tough , there are very tough things here , " borloo told reporters .
" to put things in perspective , the economies of 27 countries with a variety of backgrounds in energy and industry are being asked to make a somewhat radical shift using everyday budgets , " he said .
" at the moment , no other region in the world is attempting something on this scale . "
agreement lacking on co2 level details the eu is struggling to agree on the details of its plan to reduce the 27-nation bloc 's greenhouse-gas pollution by 20 percent by 2020 compared with the benchmark year 1990 .
they promised to deepen this to 30 percent if another industrialized power followed suit .
they also pledged to boost the share of renewables in the eu energy mix to 20 percent , including a 10-percent share for biofuels .
however , agreement on these broad goals has become a touchy and complex issue in light of the surge in oil and gas prices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to lead the fight against global emissions several countries dependent on coal , russian gas and soviet-era nuclear plants are pleading for get-outs or easier terms , and the role of biofuels has come under attack for its impact on global food prices .
other thorny areas include the future allocation of emissions quotas by industry under the eu 's carbon market and measures to curb pollution by the transport sector .
borloo hopes to wrap up the deal on the climate and energy package by year 's end , so that the eu is in a position to wield clout at the un talks in poznan , poland , in december that will shape a worldwide pact on tackling climate change beyond 2012 , when the current provisions of the kyoto protocol expire .
the meeting , taking place at the saint-cloud chateau on the western outskirts of paris , finishes friday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 03.07.2008 oft-criticized us embassy prepares to open on july 4 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are sure to be more flags waving at the embassy party on july 4 china 's may have the better view , and finland 's the better architecture , but america 's is the biggest .
dw-world.de sent jefferson chase to check out the much-maligned new us embassy in berlin . for some reason , i found myself humming merle haggard 's " okie from muskogee " as i cycled up to the back entrance .
perhaps i was nervous .
after all i was bringing a camera and dictaphone into what was sure to be a high-security area .
two days ahead of the opening ceremony , workers were indeed already shifting security fences around the site near berlin 's brandenburg gate .
but the fencing , a local policewoman informed me , was largely being carted off from the fan mile of the euro 2008 soccer championship .
nor did the two american guards at the entrance seem particularly uptight , although they asked only be identified as " john " and " tom , " and said it was against regulations to photograph them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pre-world war ii embassy had more grandeur " i guess it 's to protect us from a ' terrorist ' coming up and killing us on the street , " said " tom , " making ironic air quotation marks and adding a humorous expletive to make it clear he did n't feel his job was particularly endangering his life .
" we 're looking forward to it , " added " john , " referring to the embassy 's official opening ceremony on friday , july 4th .
" everybody 's just going to have a big party . "
it was a surprisingly low-key atmosphere ahead of the public premiere of a building that has been the center of an unusual amount of squabbling .
back to the future the new building occupies the same spot on pariser platz , the square in front of the brandenburg gate , as the pre-world war ii us embassy to germany .
it is located in the formerly communist eastern part of the city , a stone 's throw from the site of ronald reagan 's famous " mr. gorbachev , tear down this wall " speech of 1987 .
thus , the new embassy can be seen as a symbol of america 's victories in both world war ii and the cold war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's a piece of the berlin wall in the embassy courtyard but the architects who designed it , from the california firm of moore ruble yudell , have drawn poor reviews , with many critics dismissing the structure as an example of outmoded 1980s postmodernism .
the city of berlin and the us state department also squabbled for years because us security requirements , put in place before and after 9/11 , forced the narrowing and diversion of streets to ensure that cars did not get to close to the building .
many berliners feared that the new embassy would create traffic jams , and a few even suggested that us diplomats should pack up and move out of the city center to avoid inconveniencing residents .
ironically , the building that was meant to embody the west 's triumph over communism ended up being caught in debates about how much security was needed vis-a-vis threats from those who do n't like america or its role in the world .
" we could have built an embassy out in the woods at half the cost and twice the security , " us ambassador to germany william r. timken told reporters in early 2008 , as the new embassy was nearing completion .
" we are here as a symbol of our desire to be a partner to germany . "
end of an eyesore bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists were already trying to get a peep at the building on wednesday , july 2 whatever the new building 's architectural shortcomings , its inauguration means that the fortifications surrounding its predecessor can be removed .
when reunified germany moved its capital from bonn to berlin in 1990 , the us was forced to use its former embassy to communist east germany , situated on a narrow side street near the brandenburg gate , as its formal diplomatic headquarters in germany .
the street had to be completely cordoned off with metal fencing and concrete pollards , yielding a spectacle reminiscent of checkpoint charlie at the height of the cold war - or belfast , northern ireland during the troubles .
as people geared up for the official launch of the new embassy , policemen in construction helmets were busy dismantling the fortifications around the old one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thankfully , the previous us embassy is history the street will be reopened to traffic , meaning that , if anything , the area around pariser platz may become a bit less congested .
expat opinion divided and what do the 12,500 us citizens who reside in the german capital think of their diplomats ' new home ?
being americans , they disagree .
" i think it 's misguided , embarrassing and ugly , " said todd cameron , an art gallery assistant who works not too far from pariser platz .
others feel that more sensitivity could have been shown toward residents ' concerns .
" i though it was a typical us thing to do , to just go ahead and build an embassy and make others move , " said brian landry , a cook at a local restaurant .
" they also would n't let me in when i tried to go have a look . "
but on the blogs , most americans seemed to think the new building was basically all right .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stands from the euro 2008 fan mile still had to be cleared " i think it looks fine , " wrote one user of a forum for american ex-pats in berlin .
" it also seems to be a design that wo n't look utterly ridiculous in 30 years , unlike some new construction . "
guests invited to the opening ceremonies on july 4th , including german chancellor angela merkel , will get a chance to inspect at closer range an embassy that once had some people up in arms , and now seems like little more than just another big building .
maybe they 'll even play some merle haggard . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i find the mood is good , there 's no posturing , no-one 's playing games , but at the same time we are dealing with a question that 's tough , there are very tough things here , " borloo told reporters .

" sending the wrong signal " this in turn has raised concerns that central banks around the world will be forced to raise borrowing costs just as international economic growth is losing momentum . senior ministers from germany , spain and france cautioned the european central bank against raising interest rates last weekend , warning it could stifle growth . german finance minister peer steinbrueck said week higher rates risked worsening a slowdown in growth .
" the ecb has to consider that they could possibly send the wrong signal with an interest rate increase because it could have a pro-cyclical impact at a point when the economy is slowing down , " he told german weekly der spiegel .
steinbrueck 's view was echoed by spanish prime minster jose luis rodriguez zapatero . " now , it has to have a certain flexibility , especially as european inflation comes essentially from the price of oil and food , not from an excess of internal demand , " zapatero said in an interview with daily el pais . the ecb rate hike and the growing global economic uncertainty also comes as part of the build-up to this month 's summit in japan of the group of eight leading industrial nations where the troubled state of the world economy could dominate proceedings . also on thursday sweden 's central bank , the riksbank , announced that it was joining the push to higher rates by lifting its benchmark repo rate by 25 basis points to 4.5 percent . this came in the wake of data showing annual inflation in sweden climbing to 4 percent in may to hit its highest rate in more than 14 years . adding to the growing worries about the economic risks posed by inflation , figures released on thursday showed consumer prices in switzerland jumping to a 15-year high of 2.9 percent in june , consequently increasing the pressure on the swiss national bank . inflation peaks in euro zone euro zone inflation also shot up to a 16-year high of 4 percent in june , preliminary data announced this week showed .
inflation in the currency bloc is now double the ecb 's target of " close to , but just below 2 percent . " trichet surprised markets last month by signalling that a rate hike could be in the pipeline , saying in his regular press briefing that the bank 's governing council was in a state of " heightened alertness " about the risks posed by inflation . in the meantime , ecb figures released last week pointed to a sustained rise in the amount of money in circulation in the euro zone with the so-called m3 money supply chalking up a 10.5-percent annual rate in may .

colombian journalists have been invited to the scene of the rescue by defence minister santos , and i 'm sure that we 'll soon see images on screens everywhere .
the last pictures of ingrid betancourt were very depressing ; we heard from a fellow hostage that she was suffering from depression and various diseases , and she looked very thin . was the rescue expected ?
why did it happen now ? i think the rescue was expected .
as we know , in the last few weeks and months , farc suffered a series of blows and has been broken down into different factions which were n't able to move about within the country .
that 's a huge hindrance if you have a large number of hostages .
aside from the 15 hostages that have been freed , there are 42 other political hostages and several hundred more colombians being held by farc - that 's a significant burden for a guerrilla force that is in crisis .
it probably was n't possible for farc to move the hostages quickly or hide their tracks from the army .
i think that 's why the location of the hostages was known , and government agents were able to observe the hostages for a longer time . how long do you think it will take for the other hostages to be freed ? i think we can be fairly certain that the locations of many of the other hostages are known .
it 's a question of time before more will be freed , less so through military operations and more so due to traitors .
the blow delivered to farc by the release of these 15 hostages could cause many farc rebels to start thinking about whether they want to cooperate with the authorities .
there 's been a string of prominent desertions in recent weeks , and there 's been an erosion in farc 's ranks that could lead to more hostages being released . could the release of betancourt also be seen as an offer on the part of farc leader alfonso cano to the uribe government ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : betancourt , right , seen here with her mother , was farc 's trump card no .
if this were the case , farc would have handled it more intelligently , and not allowed the government any opportunity to present it as a rescue situation .
currently , we only have the government 's version of events , as well as the pictures and other evidence that point to it actually having been a rescue .
farc 's political head , alfonso cano , would have used his trump card - namely betancourt and the three american hostages - differently - at the start of peace talks for instance , so that he would have had something in his hand against the government .
now , farc has very little . is president 's uribe 's political strategy on farc paying off ? the last few months , but today especially , mark the biggest success uribe has had in achieving security in colombia .
his tough stance against the guerillas is paying off , as are the increasing incentives being offered to ex-rebels by the government .
it started with the disarmament of the paramilitaries in 2005 , but there have been increasing incentives for guerrillas to turn themselves in .
the military strategy is being coupled with a strategy for peace and post-conflict management in the regions that have been liberated .
it 's a big success for the uribe administration , and also explains his huge approval ratings of over 80 percent . do you think we are seeing the beginning of the end of farc and decades of internal conflict in colombia ? we 've entered a new era in terms of the conflict in colombia .
we no longer have the trio of typical actors , namely paramilitary , guerrilla and weak state .
rather , we have a state that is not just strong militarily , but that also enjoys popular support while , on the other side , we have illegal groups , or terrorists , as they 're now referred to .
then there are remnants of the old conflict , and among these is farc , or what remains of farc .
it could be that in the months or years to come , we 'll have a scenario where farc consists of just a few hundred fighters that are n't really relevant anymore , but that 's the optimistic variation .
the more cautious scenario is one where cano succeeds in reviving farc elements in colombian cities .
still , farc is n't the number one problem anymore and this latest blow causes one to wonder whether farc can still be referred to as a guerrilla force or rather just a criminal group .

" none of the eight leading industrial nations have taken sufficient measures needed to be considered in line with the target to limit a worldwide increase in temperatures to 2 degrees centigrade , " niklas hoehne , author of the study said . at last year 's g8 summit in germany , leaders from the us , japan , germany , britain , france , italy , canada and russia reached agreement on considering a goal to halve global emissions by 2050 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year , g8 leaders made grand promises to cut emissions but the world 's top eight industrialized economies - which are responsible for an estimated 62 percent of carbon dioxide emissions - have failed to translate words into action , the study found . " the g-8 countries have a responsibility to be high achievers in the race against climate change .
they need to be role models trailblazing the way to steer the world towards a low carbon , clean energy economy , " allianz management board member joachim faber said . us given worst report card the scorecard examined the policies implemented by federal governments of g8 countries to reduce emissions and assessed emission trends since 1990 and progress against the country 's kyoto target .
it rated the countries ' individual performances on three specific policy areas - energy efficiency , renewable energy and the development of carbon trading markets . the study singled out the us , canada and russia for having made the least progress , saying they had " failed the test . "
among the three , the report was most scathing about the us which took last place in the ranking . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush has resisted binding international agreements to cut emissions " the united states scores the worst of all g8 countries , being the highest emitter with the highest per capita emissions and an increasing trend in total emissions , " it said . canada came in second from the bottom with the report saying it too showed a steadily increasing trend in total greenhouse gas emissions . while russia showed declining emissions in the early 1990s , the country 's record has worsened since 1999 with emissions on the rise and no notable policies to curb them , the scorecard said . " time is running out " at the top of the rankings table , britain leads the race slightly ahead of france and germany . while britain is projected to reach its kyoto target and has introduced innovative policies like the climate change bill , the report said it had done too little to increase use of renewable sources of energy and pointed out that the share of polluting coal was rising in the country 's energy mix . france , ranked second , was praised for its policies and international positions on climate change but it remained weak on achieving its goals in the near future , the study said . third place germany performs best on renewable energy and has recently approved legislation on energy efficiency and climate policies .
but so far it has failed to take a clear stance against coal-powered plants , according to the report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmental activists will be targetting the g8 summit in japan japan , ranked fifth , is increasing its emissions and is far from meeting its kyoto target .
while the country makes extensive use of offset projects in developing countries under the un-administered carbon market , it has no national mandatory measures such as emissions trading . “ time is running out , ” regine günther , head of climate change policy at the wwf in germany said .
" we have 10 to 15 years left in which the global emissions have to peak and decline .
the world is at a crossroads where decisive action now could translate into economic success . ” setting further goals the report also analyzed energy policies of the five emerging economies brazil , china , india , mexico and south africa but the countries are n't part of the ranking because their records ca n't be measured the same way as those of industrialized nations . the report urges g8 leaders meeting in japan next week to commit to a binding long-term target for emission reductions of 80 percent by 2050 , and as close as possible to 40 percent by 2020 . g8 environment ministers have already said they hope to reach agreement on a successor treaty to the kyoto protocol which expires in 2012 . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

canada is chair of the current 21-country committee that also includes bahrain , brazil , cuba , china and the united states .

it is unclear whether the government change in stance on the listing will derail cambodia 's proposal . the temple is perched on a mountain range that defines the thai-cambodian border . dozens vie for heritage designation among other applicants are five countries seeking their first sites on the unesco list - saudi arabia , kyrgyzstan , papua new guinea , san marino and vanuatu . among eastern european countries , albania , croatia , czech republic , bulgaria , the russian federation and slovakia are applying for recognition of special sites , and hungary and slovakia have a joint application for designation of a network of fortifications where the danube and vah rivers converge in komarno . in the middle east , applicants include yemen for its socotra archipelago ; saudi arabia for archaeological site al-hijr ; iran for the armenian monastic ensembles in its azerbaijan province ; and israel for the triple-arch gate at dan and the bahai holy places in haifa and western galilee . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" sending the wrong signal " this in turn has raised concerns that central banks around the world will be forced to raise borrowing costs just as international economic growth is losing momentum . senior ministers from germany , spain and france cautioned the european central bank against raising interest rates last weekend , warning it could stifle growth . german finance minister peer steinbrueck said week higher rates risked worsening a slowdown in growth .
" the ecb has to consider that they could possibly send the wrong signal with an interest rate increase because it could have a pro-cyclical impact at a point when the economy is slowing down , " he told german weekly der spiegel .
steinbrueck 's view was echoed by spanish prime minster jose luis rodriguez zapatero . " now , it has to have a certain flexibility , especially as european inflation comes essentially from the price of oil and food , not from an excess of internal demand , " zapatero said in an interview with daily el pais . the ecb rate hike and the growing global economic uncertainty also comes as part of the build-up to this month 's summit in japan of the group of eight leading industrial nations where the troubled state of the world economy could dominate proceedings . also on thursday sweden 's central bank , the riksbank , announced that it was joining the push to higher rates by lifting its benchmark repo rate by 25 basis points to 4.5 percent . this came in the wake of data showing annual inflation in sweden climbing to 4 percent in may to hit its highest rate in more than 14 years . adding to the growing worries about the economic risks posed by inflation , figures released on thursday showed consumer prices in switzerland jumping to a 15-year high of 2.9 percent in june , consequently increasing the pressure on the swiss national bank . inflation peaks in euro zone euro zone inflation also shot up to a 16-year high of 4 percent in june , preliminary data announced this week showed .
inflation in the currency bloc is now double the ecb 's target of " close to , but just below 2 percent . " trichet surprised markets last month by signalling that a rate hike could be in the pipeline , saying in his regular press briefing that the bank 's governing council was in a state of " heightened alertness " about the risks posed by inflation . in the meantime , ecb figures released last week pointed to a sustained rise in the amount of money in circulation in the euro zone with the so-called m3 money supply chalking up a 10.5-percent annual rate in may .
the ecb sees m3 as an indicator of future price trends . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de sent jefferson chase to check out the much-maligned new us embassy in berlin . for some reason , i found myself humming merle haggard 's " okie from muskogee " as i cycled up to the back entrance .
perhaps i was nervous .
after all i was bringing a camera and dictaphone into what was sure to be a high-security area .
two days ahead of the opening ceremony , workers were indeed already shifting security fences around the site near berlin 's brandenburg gate .
but the fencing , a local policewoman informed me , was largely being carted off from the fan mile of the euro 2008 soccer championship .
nor did the two american guards at the entrance seem particularly uptight , although they asked only be identified as " john " and " tom , " and said it was against regulations to photograph them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pre-world war ii embassy had more grandeur " i guess it 's to protect us from a ' terrorist ' coming up and killing us on the street , " said " tom , " making ironic air quotation marks and adding a humorous expletive to make it clear he did n't feel his job was particularly endangering his life .
" we 're looking forward to it , " added " john , " referring to the embassy 's official opening ceremony on friday , july 4th .
" everybody 's just going to have a big party . "
it was a surprisingly low-key atmosphere ahead of the public premiere of a building that has been the center of an unusual amount of squabbling .
back to the future the new building occupies the same spot on pariser platz , the square in front of the brandenburg gate , as the pre-world war ii us embassy to germany .
it is located in the formerly communist eastern part of the city , a stone 's throw from the site of ronald reagan 's famous " mr. gorbachev , tear down this wall " speech of 1987 .
thus , the new embassy can be seen as a symbol of america 's victories in both world war ii and the cold war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's a piece of the berlin wall in the embassy courtyard but the architects who designed it , from the california firm of moore ruble yudell , have drawn poor reviews , with many critics dismissing the structure as an example of outmoded 1980s postmodernism .
the city of berlin and the us state department also squabbled for years because us security requirements , put in place before and after 9/11 , forced the narrowing and diversion of streets to ensure that cars did not get to close to the building .
many berliners feared that the new embassy would create traffic jams , and a few even suggested that us diplomats should pack up and move out of the city center to avoid inconveniencing residents .
ironically , the building that was meant to embody the west 's triumph over communism ended up being caught in debates about how much security was needed vis-a-vis threats from those who do n't like america or its role in the world .
" we could have built an embassy out in the woods at half the cost and twice the security , " us ambassador to germany william r. timken told reporters in early 2008 , as the new embassy was nearing completion .
" we are here as a symbol of our desire to be a partner to germany . "
end of an eyesore bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists were already trying to get a peep at the building on wednesday , july 2 whatever the new building 's architectural shortcomings , its inauguration means that the fortifications surrounding its predecessor can be removed .
when reunified germany moved its capital from bonn to berlin in 1990 , the us was forced to use its former embassy to communist east germany , situated on a narrow side street near the brandenburg gate , as its formal diplomatic headquarters in germany .
the street had to be completely cordoned off with metal fencing and concrete pollards , yielding a spectacle reminiscent of checkpoint charlie at the height of the cold war - or belfast , northern ireland during the troubles .
as people geared up for the official launch of the new embassy , policemen in construction helmets were busy dismantling the fortifications around the old one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thankfully , the previous us embassy is history the street will be reopened to traffic , meaning that , if anything , the area around pariser platz may become a bit less congested .
expat opinion divided and what do the 12,500 us citizens who reside in the german capital think of their diplomats ' new home ?
being americans , they disagree .
" i think it 's misguided , embarrassing and ugly , " said todd cameron , an art gallery assistant who works not too far from pariser platz .
others feel that more sensitivity could have been shown toward residents ' concerns .
" i though it was a typical us thing to do , to just go ahead and build an embassy and make others move , " said brian landry , a cook at a local restaurant .
" they also would n't let me in when i tried to go have a look . "
but on the blogs , most americans seemed to think the new building was basically all right .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stands from the euro 2008 fan mile still had to be cleared " i think it looks fine , " wrote one user of a forum for american ex-pats in berlin .
" it also seems to be a design that wo n't look utterly ridiculous in 30 years , unlike some new construction . "
guests invited to the opening ceremonies on july 4th , including german chancellor angela merkel , will get a chance to inspect at closer range an embassy that once had some people up in arms , and now seems like little more than just another big building .

" the negotiations have not ended - another round of talks was concluded - for the time being we are not at the finish line , " klich told poland 's private radio zet .
" we completed an important , a significant , round of talks two days ago but the finish line of talks is still ahead of us , " he said , adding that " july is a long month . "
daniel fried , the assistant secretary of state for european and eurasian affairs and a former ambassador to poland , told reporters that the last round of talks between the us and poland had made real progress but refused to confirm that an agreement had been reached .
the united states wants to base 10 interceptor missiles on the territory of the ex-communist nato member and a radar facility in the neighboring czech republic to ward off potential attacks by so-called " rogue " states , notably iran .

" the negotiations have not ended - another round of talks was concluded - for the time being we are not at the finish line , " klich told poland 's private radio zet .
" we completed an important , a significant , round of talks two days ago but the finish line of talks is still ahead of us , " he said , adding that " july is a long month . "
daniel fried , the assistant secretary of state for european and eurasian affairs and a former ambassador to poland , told reporters that the last round of talks between the us and poland had made real progress but refused to confirm that an agreement had been reached .
the united states wants to base 10 interceptor missiles on the territory of the ex-communist nato member and a radar facility in the neighboring czech republic to ward off potential attacks by so-called " rogue " states , notably iran .

talks between poland and the united states over the missile shield began in may last year but after initial progress the negotiations have dragged over poland 's demands for substantial us aid to modernize its armed forces in return for its cooperation .
the impasse has allegedly led the us to consider poland 's northern neighbor lithuania but bogdan klich said such reports were simply pressure tactics during the negotiations with poland .
" in my opinion this was a pressure tactic used by the us on poland and it would not at all be so easy for the americans to locate the missile shield in lithuania ... because of stronger protests by russia against this location instead of poland , " klich said .
" the americans are endeavoring to maintain good relations with russia . "

" sending the wrong signal " this in turn has raised concerns that central banks around the world will be forced to raise borrowing costs just as international economic growth is losing momentum . senior ministers from germany , spain and france cautioned the european central bank against raising interest rates last weekend , warning it could stifle growth . german finance minister peer steinbrueck said week higher rates risked worsening a slowdown in growth .
" the ecb has to consider that they could possibly send the wrong signal with an interest rate increase because it could have a pro-cyclical impact at a point when the economy is slowing down , " he told german weekly der spiegel .
steinbrueck 's view was echoed by spanish prime minster jose luis rodriguez zapatero . " now , it has to have a certain flexibility , especially as european inflation comes essentially from the price of oil and food , not from an excess of internal demand , " zapatero said in an interview with daily el pais . the ecb rate hike and the growing global economic uncertainty also comes as part of the build-up to this month 's summit in japan of the group of eight leading industrial nations where the troubled state of the world economy could dominate proceedings . also on thursday sweden 's central bank , the riksbank , announced that it was joining the push to higher rates by lifting its benchmark repo rate by 25 basis points to 4.5 percent . this came in the wake of data showing annual inflation in sweden climbing to 4 percent in may to hit its highest rate in more than 14 years . adding to the growing worries about the economic risks posed by inflation , figures released on thursday showed consumer prices in switzerland jumping to a 15-year high of 2.9 percent in june , consequently increasing the pressure on the swiss national bank . inflation peaks in euro zone euro zone inflation also shot up to a 16-year high of 4 percent in june , preliminary data announced this week showed .
inflation in the currency bloc is now double the ecb 's target of " close to , but just below 2 percent . " trichet surprised markets last month by signalling that a rate hike could be in the pipeline , saying in his regular press briefing that the bank 's governing council was in a state of " heightened alertness " about the risks posed by inflation . in the meantime , ecb figures released last week pointed to a sustained rise in the amount of money in circulation in the euro zone with the so-called m3 money supply chalking up a 10.5-percent annual rate in may .
the ecb sees m3 as an indicator of future price trends . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

colombian journalists have been invited to the scene of the rescue by defence minister santos , and i 'm sure that we 'll soon see images on screens everywhere .
the last pictures of ingrid betancourt were very depressing ; we heard from a fellow hostage that she was suffering from depression and various diseases , and she looked very thin . was the rescue expected ?
why did it happen now ? i think the rescue was expected .
as we know , in the last few weeks and months , farc suffered a series of blows and has been broken down into different factions which were n't able to move about within the country .
that 's a huge hindrance if you have a large number of hostages .
aside from the 15 hostages that have been freed , there are 42 other political hostages and several hundred more colombians being held by farc - that 's a significant burden for a guerrilla force that is in crisis .
it probably was n't possible for farc to move the hostages quickly or hide their tracks from the army .
i think that 's why the location of the hostages was known , and government agents were able to observe the hostages for a longer time . how long do you think it will take for the other hostages to be freed ? i think we can be fairly certain that the locations of many of the other hostages are known .
it 's a question of time before more will be freed , less so through military operations and more so due to traitors .
the blow delivered to farc by the release of these 15 hostages could cause many farc rebels to start thinking about whether they want to cooperate with the authorities .
there 's been a string of prominent desertions in recent weeks , and there 's been an erosion in farc 's ranks that could lead to more hostages being released . could the release of betancourt also be seen as an offer on the part of farc leader alfonso cano to the uribe government ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : betancourt , right , seen here with her mother , was farc 's trump card no .
if this were the case , farc would have handled it more intelligently , and not allowed the government any opportunity to present it as a rescue situation .
currently , we only have the government 's version of events , as well as the pictures and other evidence that point to it actually having been a rescue .
farc 's political head , alfonso cano , would have used his trump card - namely betancourt and the three american hostages - differently - at the start of peace talks for instance , so that he would have had something in his hand against the government .
now , farc has very little . is president 's uribe 's political strategy on farc paying off ? the last few months , but today especially , mark the biggest success uribe has had in achieving security in colombia .
his tough stance against the guerillas is paying off , as are the increasing incentives being offered to ex-rebels by the government .
it started with the disarmament of the paramilitaries in 2005 , but there have been increasing incentives for guerrillas to turn themselves in .
the military strategy is being coupled with a strategy for peace and post-conflict management in the regions that have been liberated .
it 's a big success for the uribe administration , and also explains his huge approval ratings of over 80 percent . do you think we are seeing the beginning of the end of farc and decades of internal conflict in colombia ? we 've entered a new era in terms of the conflict in colombia .
we no longer have the trio of typical actors , namely paramilitary , guerrilla and weak state .
rather , we have a state that is not just strong militarily , but that also enjoys popular support while , on the other side , we have illegal groups , or terrorists , as they 're now referred to .
then there are remnants of the old conflict , and among these is farc , or what remains of farc .
it could be that in the months or years to come , we 'll have a scenario where farc consists of just a few hundred fighters that are n't really relevant anymore , but that 's the optimistic variation .
the more cautious scenario is one where cano succeeds in reviving farc elements in colombian cities .
still , farc is n't the number one problem anymore and this latest blow causes one to wonder whether farc can still be referred to as a guerrilla force or rather just a criminal group .
but i think it 's premature to speak of an end to the conflict . claudia herrera pahl interviewed carsten wieland -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i find the mood is good , there 's no posturing , no-one 's playing games , but at the same time we are dealing with a question that 's tough , there are very tough things here , " borloo told reporters .

" the negotiations have not ended - another round of talks was concluded - for the time being we are not at the finish line , " klich told poland 's private radio zet .
" we completed an important , a significant , round of talks two days ago but the finish line of talks is still ahead of us , " he said , adding that " july is a long month . "
daniel fried , the assistant secretary of state for european and eurasian affairs and a former ambassador to poland , told reporters that the last round of talks between the us and poland had made real progress but refused to confirm that an agreement had been reached .
the united states wants to base 10 interceptor missiles on the territory of the ex-communist nato member and a radar facility in the neighboring czech republic to ward off potential attacks by so-called " rogue " states , notably iran .
a deal under which the czech republic would house the missile shield 's radar base was concluded in april .
lithuania alternative seen as a bargaining chip bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech republic will host radar systems the proposed missile shield system has angered russia , which fears it may actually be one of the countries in the cross-hairs , while public opinion in poland and the czech republic is broadly opposed to the defensive system .
talks between poland and the united states over the missile shield began in may last year but after initial progress the negotiations have dragged over poland 's demands for substantial us aid to modernize its armed forces in return for its cooperation .
the impasse has allegedly led the us to consider poland 's northern neighbor lithuania but bogdan klich said such reports were simply pressure tactics during the negotiations with poland .
" in my opinion this was a pressure tactic used by the us on poland and it would not at all be so easy for the americans to locate the missile shield in lithuania ... because of stronger protests by russia against this location instead of poland , " klich said .
" the americans are endeavoring to maintain good relations with russia . "
senior officials in lithuania , like poland a member of the european union and nato , have flatly denied talks were underway with washington . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 03.07.2008 merkel remains strongly opposed to assisted suicide großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actively assisting suicide is illegal in germany german chancellor angela merkel has spoken out in the strongest terms against euthanasia as the heated debate over a former hamburg government official 's involvement in the assisted suicide of a pensioner gathers pace . merkel , outlining her christian democrats ' party line on the topic , said that she was against " every form of assisted suicide " regardless of the circumstances .
merkel 's stance was echoed by germany 's health minister ulla schmidt .
" i reject this path categorically , " she said .
" the correct path is to offer assistance to those who are dying instead of helping those free from terminal illness to commit suicide . "
the debate was prompted by the revelation this week that a 79-year-old wurzburg woman chose to end her own life on saturday despite not having any life-threatening diseases or suffering great physical pain .
what added an extra angle to the story was that former hamburg justice senator roger kusch , a proponent for the right to die , advised her of the best way to do it .
" i was in her apartment at 11:00 am , " kusch explained at a press conference he called on monday to discuss the assisted suicide .
" at around 11:30 , she began to prepare three glasses - one with the sedative diazepam , one with a mixture of the anti-malaria drug chloroquine and one with a sweet syrup , because the other substances can cause nausea .
she drank the glass with the deadly chloroquine quickly .
her last words were ' auf wiedersehen . ' … then i left . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kusch educated the pensioner on the best way to die kusch then said that he vacated the apartment for three hours so as not to be present at the moment of death .
when he returned , he said , she was lying dead on her bed .
" i am for self-determination until the final breath , " he says .
he also showed the press conference clips from a nine-hour video he made documenting his relationship to the pensioner , identified only as bettina s. kusch made headlines earlier this year when he presented to the media a " suicide machine " patients could use to inject themselves with a deadly cocktail .
the case has prompted fresh calls in germany for stronger regulations and laws regarding assisted suicide .
merkel 's conservatives in favor of prison sentences merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- party wants to introduce a bill in cdu controlled states that would make the involvement in an assisted suicide a new criminal offense which carries a prison term of up to three years for the commercial or otherwise organized offering of suicide assistance .
the cdu is expected to put the bill to the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , on friday .
however , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , the cdu 's coalition partner in government , have their own ideas .
the spd would like to pass a law requiring doctors to obey patients ' wishes as expressed in " living wills . "
the spd claims to have wide support for the idea from other political factions .
but the cdu argues that such a law would presuppose that patients completely understand all of the implications of a living will - an assumption that , given the complexity of medical care , the patient can not possibly make .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss organization dignitas provides a way and place to die both the netherlands and belgium passed laws in 2002 which allow doctors to give terminally ill patients a deadly injection , provided they were in full possession of their faculties when they made the decision to die .
switzerland too allows such assistance .
officials in berlin have been wrangling for months over what form a law governing how binding so-called " living wills " should take .
such documents outline what medical treatment individuals want should they no longer be in a position to make decisions .
social democrats urge restraint in clamor for new laws the spd 's peter struck , the leader of the party 's faction in the bundestag , warned against making rash decisions in the heat of the debate , saying that few bills brought in immediately in the aftermath of such an event were detailed enough to be effective .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : advocates say euthanasia is a humane solution edzard schmidt-jortzig , the chairperson of the german ethical council , also warned about tightening restrictions and introducing criminal justice laws .
he said that there were some emergencies in which euthanasia was the only humane solution .
roger kusch was careful not to break any of the current laws through his involvement with the death of bettina s. while he educated the pensioner on how to kill herself , he did not administer the deadly dosage himself .
because suicide is not illegal in germany , advising someone on how best to do it is likewise not punishable .

merkel 's stance was echoed by germany 's health minister ulla schmidt .
" i reject this path categorically , " she said .
" the correct path is to offer assistance to those who are dying instead of helping those free from terminal illness to commit suicide . "
the debate was prompted by the revelation this week that a 79-year-old wurzburg woman chose to end her own life on saturday despite not having any life-threatening diseases or suffering great physical pain .
what added an extra angle to the story was that former hamburg justice senator roger kusch , a proponent for the right to die , advised her of the best way to do it .
" i was in her apartment at 11:00 am , " kusch explained at a press conference he called on monday to discuss the assisted suicide .
" at around 11:30 , she began to prepare three glasses - one with the sedative diazepam , one with a mixture of the anti-malaria drug chloroquine and one with a sweet syrup , because the other substances can cause nausea .
she drank the glass with the deadly chloroquine quickly .
her last words were ' auf wiedersehen . ' … then i left . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kusch educated the pensioner on the best way to die kusch then said that he vacated the apartment for three hours so as not to be present at the moment of death .
when he returned , he said , she was lying dead on her bed .
" i am for self-determination until the final breath , " he says .
he also showed the press conference clips from a nine-hour video he made documenting his relationship to the pensioner , identified only as bettina s. kusch made headlines earlier this year when he presented to the media a " suicide machine " patients could use to inject themselves with a deadly cocktail .
the case has prompted fresh calls in germany for stronger regulations and laws regarding assisted suicide .
merkel 's conservatives in favor of prison sentences merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- party wants to introduce a bill in cdu controlled states that would make the involvement in an assisted suicide a new criminal offense which carries a prison term of up to three years for the commercial or otherwise organized offering of suicide assistance .
the cdu is expected to put the bill to the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , on friday .
however , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , the cdu 's coalition partner in government , have their own ideas .
the spd would like to pass a law requiring doctors to obey patients ' wishes as expressed in " living wills . "
the spd claims to have wide support for the idea from other political factions .
but the cdu argues that such a law would presuppose that patients completely understand all of the implications of a living will - an assumption that , given the complexity of medical care , the patient can not possibly make .

" the negotiations have not ended - another round of talks was concluded - for the time being we are not at the finish line , " klich told poland 's private radio zet .
" we completed an important , a significant , round of talks two days ago but the finish line of talks is still ahead of us , " he said , adding that " july is a long month . "
daniel fried , the assistant secretary of state for european and eurasian affairs and a former ambassador to poland , told reporters that the last round of talks between the us and poland had made real progress but refused to confirm that an agreement had been reached .
the united states wants to base 10 interceptor missiles on the territory of the ex-communist nato member and a radar facility in the neighboring czech republic to ward off potential attacks by so-called " rogue " states , notably iran .
a deal under which the czech republic would house the missile shield 's radar base was concluded in april .
lithuania alternative seen as a bargaining chip bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech republic will host radar systems the proposed missile shield system has angered russia , which fears it may actually be one of the countries in the cross-hairs , while public opinion in poland and the czech republic is broadly opposed to the defensive system .

" i find the mood is good , there 's no posturing , no-one 's playing games , but at the same time we are dealing with a question that 's tough , there are very tough things here , " borloo told reporters .
" to put things in perspective , the economies of 27 countries with a variety of backgrounds in energy and industry are being asked to make a somewhat radical shift using everyday budgets , " he said .
" at the moment , no other region in the world is attempting something on this scale . "

they also pledged to boost the share of renewables in the eu energy mix to 20 percent , including a 10-percent share for biofuels .

other thorny areas include the future allocation of emissions quotas by industry under the eu 's carbon market and measures to curb pollution by the transport sector .
borloo hopes to wrap up the deal on the climate and energy package by year 's end , so that the eu is in a position to wield clout at the un talks in poznan , poland , in december that will shape a worldwide pact on tackling climate change beyond 2012 , when the current provisions of the kyoto protocol expire .

the photographers left in protest but the incident was only the latest sign of a new era at the german top club which klinsmann named " among the top 10 in the world . "
" munich has the highest expectations , " he said .
" the fans want both titles in germany and to be in champions league until the end .
that is munich 's ambition and we want to meet it … .
we set the highest goals for ourselves . "

players are to lunch together and the facility allows munich to do away with training camps , with klinsmann saying it is better for players to enjoy their home and families after work instead of a sometimes boring hotel . " the players are to be inspired and motivated - by our staff , by kalle -lrb- chairman karl-heinz rummenigge -rrb- and uli -lrb- general manager uli hoeness -rrb- - to be given lots of ideas , " commented the new head coach .

i called my counterpart to tell him clearly .
it is a definite decision , " said rummenigge in a press conference in munich .

rummenigge also ruled out the possible transfer of germany 's player of 2007 mario gomez from vfb stuttgart to munich .
" since stuttgart informed us of his decision not to negotiate with us , there is nothing more to say on the subject and i do not believe they want to reactivate the negotiations , " insisted rummenigge .

they have experienced extremes .
we must help them and make them more consistant , " he said .

" austria welcomed on the rescue but also called for further efforts to free other farc hostages . " ingrid betancourt 's six-year martyrdom has finally come to a happy ending , " foreign minister ursula plassnik said in a statement , praising the strength of the former colombian presidential candidate . " betancourt has become a symbol of fearlessness and courage in colombia 's internal conflict .
her liberation is an important signal that there can be a turnaround in this unparalleled suffering . " european union officials added their voices to the chorus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : betancourt hailed the rescue operation as " perfect " " i have just learned with relief and joy of the release of the hostages taken by -lrb- colombian guerrilla movement -rrb- farc ...
i congratulate all those who worked for their release , " european commission head jose manuel barroso said in a statement in the early hours of thursday . eu external affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said , " i am extremely relieved and very happy that ingrid betancourt 's six-year nightmare as well as the captivity of three us citizens and 11 colombian officials have finally come to an end . " at the same time our hearts go out to those who remain in captivity ...
we call on their captors to release all their hostages immediately and unconditionally , " she added . " nightmare has ended " betancourt had not been seen since a rebel " proof of life " video broadcast last year , in which she appeared thin and depressed in a jungle camp .
the us hostages , also shown in the video , described how she was slowly succumbing to hepatitis b and tropical skin diseases , and was kept chained to a tree after attempts to escape . betancourt 's family waged a campaign for her freedom , organizing events in both colombia and france , despite warnings from the colombian government that raising her profile in such a way only made her a more valuable hostage for the farc rebels . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 03.07.2008 merkel remains strongly opposed to assisted suicide großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actively assisting suicide is illegal in germany german chancellor angela merkel has spoken out in the strongest terms against euthanasia as the heated debate over a former hamburg government official 's involvement in the assisted suicide of a pensioner gathers pace . merkel , outlining her christian democrats ' party line on the topic , said that she was against " every form of assisted suicide " regardless of the circumstances .
merkel 's stance was echoed by germany 's health minister ulla schmidt .
" i reject this path categorically , " she said .
" the correct path is to offer assistance to those who are dying instead of helping those free from terminal illness to commit suicide . "
the debate was prompted by the revelation this week that a 79-year-old wurzburg woman chose to end her own life on saturday despite not having any life-threatening diseases or suffering great physical pain .
what added an extra angle to the story was that former hamburg justice senator roger kusch , a proponent for the right to die , advised her of the best way to do it .
" i was in her apartment at 11:00 am , " kusch explained at a press conference he called on monday to discuss the assisted suicide .
" at around 11:30 , she began to prepare three glasses - one with the sedative diazepam , one with a mixture of the anti-malaria drug chloroquine and one with a sweet syrup , because the other substances can cause nausea .
she drank the glass with the deadly chloroquine quickly .
her last words were ' auf wiedersehen . ' … then i left . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kusch educated the pensioner on the best way to die kusch then said that he vacated the apartment for three hours so as not to be present at the moment of death .
when he returned , he said , she was lying dead on her bed .
" i am for self-determination until the final breath , " he says .
he also showed the press conference clips from a nine-hour video he made documenting his relationship to the pensioner , identified only as bettina s. kusch made headlines earlier this year when he presented to the media a " suicide machine " patients could use to inject themselves with a deadly cocktail .
the case has prompted fresh calls in germany for stronger regulations and laws regarding assisted suicide .
merkel 's conservatives in favor of prison sentences merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- party wants to introduce a bill in cdu controlled states that would make the involvement in an assisted suicide a new criminal offense which carries a prison term of up to three years for the commercial or otherwise organized offering of suicide assistance .
the cdu is expected to put the bill to the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , on friday .
however , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , the cdu 's coalition partner in government , have their own ideas .
the spd would like to pass a law requiring doctors to obey patients ' wishes as expressed in " living wills . "
the spd claims to have wide support for the idea from other political factions .
but the cdu argues that such a law would presuppose that patients completely understand all of the implications of a living will - an assumption that , given the complexity of medical care , the patient can not possibly make .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss organization dignitas provides a way and place to die both the netherlands and belgium passed laws in 2002 which allow doctors to give terminally ill patients a deadly injection , provided they were in full possession of their faculties when they made the decision to die .
switzerland too allows such assistance .
officials in berlin have been wrangling for months over what form a law governing how binding so-called " living wills " should take .
such documents outline what medical treatment individuals want should they no longer be in a position to make decisions .
social democrats urge restraint in clamor for new laws the spd 's peter struck , the leader of the party 's faction in the bundestag , warned against making rash decisions in the heat of the debate , saying that few bills brought in immediately in the aftermath of such an event were detailed enough to be effective .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : advocates say euthanasia is a humane solution edzard schmidt-jortzig , the chairperson of the german ethical council , also warned about tightening restrictions and introducing criminal justice laws .
he said that there were some emergencies in which euthanasia was the only humane solution .
roger kusch was careful not to break any of the current laws through his involvement with the death of bettina s. while he educated the pensioner on how to kill herself , he did not administer the deadly dosage himself .
because suicide is not illegal in germany , advising someone on how best to do it is likewise not punishable .
it is currently illegal to actively assist in someone 's suicide in germany .
despite his kusch 's best efforts , public prosecutors have now opened an investigation into the suicide . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel 's stance was echoed by germany 's health minister ulla schmidt .
" i reject this path categorically , " she said .
" the correct path is to offer assistance to those who are dying instead of helping those free from terminal illness to commit suicide . "
the debate was prompted by the revelation this week that a 79-year-old wurzburg woman chose to end her own life on saturday despite not having any life-threatening diseases or suffering great physical pain .
what added an extra angle to the story was that former hamburg justice senator roger kusch , a proponent for the right to die , advised her of the best way to do it .
" i was in her apartment at 11:00 am , " kusch explained at a press conference he called on monday to discuss the assisted suicide .
" at around 11:30 , she began to prepare three glasses - one with the sedative diazepam , one with a mixture of the anti-malaria drug chloroquine and one with a sweet syrup , because the other substances can cause nausea .

he also showed the press conference clips from a nine-hour video he made documenting his relationship to the pensioner , identified only as bettina s. kusch made headlines earlier this year when he presented to the media a " suicide machine " patients could use to inject themselves with a deadly cocktail .
the case has prompted fresh calls in germany for stronger regulations and laws regarding assisted suicide .

dw-world.de sent jefferson chase to check out the much-maligned new us embassy in berlin . for some reason , i found myself humming merle haggard 's " okie from muskogee " as i cycled up to the back entrance .
perhaps i was nervous .
after all i was bringing a camera and dictaphone into what was sure to be a high-security area .
two days ahead of the opening ceremony , workers were indeed already shifting security fences around the site near berlin 's brandenburg gate .
but the fencing , a local policewoman informed me , was largely being carted off from the fan mile of the euro 2008 soccer championship .
nor did the two american guards at the entrance seem particularly uptight , although they asked only be identified as " john " and " tom , " and said it was against regulations to photograph them .

" we 're looking forward to it , " added " john , " referring to the embassy 's official opening ceremony on friday , july 4th .
" everybody 's just going to have a big party . "
it was a surprisingly low-key atmosphere ahead of the public premiere of a building that has been the center of an unusual amount of squabbling .
back to the future the new building occupies the same spot on pariser platz , the square in front of the brandenburg gate , as the pre-world war ii us embassy to germany .
it is located in the formerly communist eastern part of the city , a stone 's throw from the site of ronald reagan 's famous " mr. gorbachev , tear down this wall " speech of 1987 .

the city of berlin and the us state department also squabbled for years because us security requirements , put in place before and after 9/11 , forced the narrowing and diversion of streets to ensure that cars did not get to close to the building .
many berliners feared that the new embassy would create traffic jams , and a few even suggested that us diplomats should pack up and move out of the city center to avoid inconveniencing residents .
ironically , the building that was meant to embody the west 's triumph over communism ended up being caught in debates about how much security was needed vis-a-vis threats from those who do n't like america or its role in the world .
" we could have built an embassy out in the woods at half the cost and twice the security , " us ambassador to germany william r. timken told reporters in early 2008 , as the new embassy was nearing completion .

when reunified germany moved its capital from bonn to berlin in 1990 , the us was forced to use its former embassy to communist east germany , situated on a narrow side street near the brandenburg gate , as its formal diplomatic headquarters in germany .
the street had to be completely cordoned off with metal fencing and concrete pollards , yielding a spectacle reminiscent of checkpoint charlie at the height of the cold war - or belfast , northern ireland during the troubles .

dw-world.de sent jefferson chase to check out the much-maligned new us embassy in berlin . for some reason , i found myself humming merle haggard 's " okie from muskogee " as i cycled up to the back entrance .
perhaps i was nervous .
after all i was bringing a camera and dictaphone into what was sure to be a high-security area .
two days ahead of the opening ceremony , workers were indeed already shifting security fences around the site near berlin 's brandenburg gate .
but the fencing , a local policewoman informed me , was largely being carted off from the fan mile of the euro 2008 soccer championship .
nor did the two american guards at the entrance seem particularly uptight , although they asked only be identified as " john " and " tom , " and said it was against regulations to photograph them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pre-world war ii embassy had more grandeur " i guess it 's to protect us from a ' terrorist ' coming up and killing us on the street , " said " tom , " making ironic air quotation marks and adding a humorous expletive to make it clear he did n't feel his job was particularly endangering his life .
" we 're looking forward to it , " added " john , " referring to the embassy 's official opening ceremony on friday , july 4th .
" everybody 's just going to have a big party . "
it was a surprisingly low-key atmosphere ahead of the public premiere of a building that has been the center of an unusual amount of squabbling .
back to the future the new building occupies the same spot on pariser platz , the square in front of the brandenburg gate , as the pre-world war ii us embassy to germany .
it is located in the formerly communist eastern part of the city , a stone 's throw from the site of ronald reagan 's famous " mr. gorbachev , tear down this wall " speech of 1987 .
thus , the new embassy can be seen as a symbol of america 's victories in both world war ii and the cold war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's a piece of the berlin wall in the embassy courtyard but the architects who designed it , from the california firm of moore ruble yudell , have drawn poor reviews , with many critics dismissing the structure as an example of outmoded 1980s postmodernism .
the city of berlin and the us state department also squabbled for years because us security requirements , put in place before and after 9/11 , forced the narrowing and diversion of streets to ensure that cars did not get to close to the building .
many berliners feared that the new embassy would create traffic jams , and a few even suggested that us diplomats should pack up and move out of the city center to avoid inconveniencing residents .
ironically , the building that was meant to embody the west 's triumph over communism ended up being caught in debates about how much security was needed vis-a-vis threats from those who do n't like america or its role in the world .
" we could have built an embassy out in the woods at half the cost and twice the security , " us ambassador to germany william r. timken told reporters in early 2008 , as the new embassy was nearing completion .
" we are here as a symbol of our desire to be a partner to germany . "

when reunified germany moved its capital from bonn to berlin in 1990 , the us was forced to use its former embassy to communist east germany , situated on a narrow side street near the brandenburg gate , as its formal diplomatic headquarters in germany .
the street had to be completely cordoned off with metal fencing and concrete pollards , yielding a spectacle reminiscent of checkpoint charlie at the height of the cold war - or belfast , northern ireland during the troubles .
as people geared up for the official launch of the new embassy , policemen in construction helmets were busy dismantling the fortifications around the old one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thankfully , the previous us embassy is history the street will be reopened to traffic , meaning that , if anything , the area around pariser platz may become a bit less congested .

being americans , they disagree .
" i think it 's misguided , embarrassing and ugly , " said todd cameron , an art gallery assistant who works not too far from pariser platz .
others feel that more sensitivity could have been shown toward residents ' concerns .

among the three , the report was most scathing about the us which took last place in the ranking . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush has resisted binding international agreements to cut emissions " the united states scores the worst of all g8 countries , being the highest emitter with the highest per capita emissions and an increasing trend in total emissions , " it said . canada came in second from the bottom with the report saying it too showed a steadily increasing trend in total greenhouse gas emissions . while russia showed declining emissions in the early 1990s , the country 's record has worsened since 1999 with emissions on the rise and no notable policies to curb them , the scorecard said . " time is running out " at the top of the rankings table , britain leads the race slightly ahead of france and germany . while britain is projected to reach its kyoto target and has introduced innovative policies like the climate change bill , the report said it had done too little to increase use of renewable sources of energy and pointed out that the share of polluting coal was rising in the country 's energy mix . france , ranked second , was praised for its policies and international positions on climate change but it remained weak on achieving its goals in the near future , the study said . third place germany performs best on renewable energy and has recently approved legislation on energy efficiency and climate policies .
but so far it has failed to take a clear stance against coal-powered plants , according to the report . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmental activists will be targetting the g8 summit in japan japan , ranked fifth , is increasing its emissions and is far from meeting its kyoto target .
while the country makes extensive use of offset projects in developing countries under the un-administered carbon market , it has no national mandatory measures such as emissions trading . “ time is running out , ” regine günther , head of climate change policy at the wwf in germany said .
" we have 10 to 15 years left in which the global emissions have to peak and decline .
the world is at a crossroads where decisive action now could translate into economic success . ” setting further goals the report also analyzed energy policies of the five emerging economies brazil , china , india , mexico and south africa but the countries are n't part of the ranking because their records ca n't be measured the same way as those of industrialized nations . the report urges g8 leaders meeting in japan next week to commit to a binding long-term target for emission reductions of 80 percent by 2050 , and as close as possible to 40 percent by 2020 . g8 environment ministers have already said they hope to reach agreement on a successor treaty to the kyoto protocol which expires in 2012 . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" unprecedented operation betancourt 's captors were duped by a colombian military team posing as rebels of the revolutionary armed forces of colombia -lrb- farc -rrb- .
santos said the military intelligence agents infiltrated the guerrilla ranks and led the local commander in charge of the hostages , alias cesar , to believe they were going to take them by helicopter to alfonso cano , the guerrillas ' supreme leader . speaking to reporters , betancourt said the hostages did n't know their new captors were actually colombian soldiers in disguise .
it was only when the helicopter was in the air that " the chief of operations said , ' we are the national army and you are all free . '
and the helicopter almost fell because we started jumping .
we screamed , we cried , we hugged .
we could n't believe it , " betancourt said . betancourt thanks france bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy met with betancourt 's children lorenzo and melanie delloye in paris after the news of her release she said she will travel to france to meet president nicolas sarkozy now that she is free , as she credits her survival of the ordeal to efforts by the french to press for her release .
first she will be reunited with her family in colombia . her rescue is considered the most serious blow dealt to farc , who saw betancourt and three americans captured in 2003 as their most valuable bargaining chips . the americans - former defense department contract workers marc gonsalves , keith stansell and thomas howes - returned to the united states on wednesday evening . us president george w. bush praised the rescue operation in a phone call with colombian president alvare uribe , the white house said . in paris , president nicolas sarkozy expressed his gratitude that " a nightmare of more than six years has ended . "
sarkozy has sent his foreign minister , bernard kouchner , to colombia . sarkozy , who had made betancourt 's release a priority of his presidency when he office in may last year , added : " today there is immense joy .
all of france is happy about the rescue of ingrid betancourt . " european powers welcome hostage release bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe was united in celebrating the release germany welcomed the freeing of colombian politician ingrid betancourt and others by government forces , congratulating the government in bogota on the successful operation . " we share the joy and relief of the family and friends of ingrid betancourt , who has been freed after being held hostage for more than six years , " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said . he also welcomed the freeing of 14 other hostages , three of them us citizens . some of the hostages had been held by the farc guerrillas for longer than 10 years . steinmeier congratulated the colombian government and expressed the hope that hundreds of other farc hostages would soon be freed . britain welcomed the release of betancourt and the other hostages , praising bogota for its rescue operation and calling for other kidnap victims ' release . " the news that ingrid betancourt and 14 other captives are now safe comes as an enormous relief , " said foreign office minister kim howells , a day after the former presidential candidate 's release from six years of captivity .
" kidnapping is a despicable crime and the hostages had been held in inhumane conditions for many years . " austria welcomed on the rescue but also called for further efforts to free other farc hostages . " ingrid betancourt 's six-year martyrdom has finally come to a happy ending , " foreign minister ursula plassnik said in a statement , praising the strength of the former colombian presidential candidate . " betancourt has become a symbol of fearlessness and courage in colombia 's internal conflict .
her liberation is an important signal that there can be a turnaround in this unparalleled suffering . " european union officials added their voices to the chorus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : betancourt hailed the rescue operation as " perfect " " i have just learned with relief and joy of the release of the hostages taken by -lrb- colombian guerrilla movement -rrb- farc ...
i congratulate all those who worked for their release , " european commission head jose manuel barroso said in a statement in the early hours of thursday . eu external affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said , " i am extremely relieved and very happy that ingrid betancourt 's six-year nightmare as well as the captivity of three us citizens and 11 colombian officials have finally come to an end . " at the same time our hearts go out to those who remain in captivity ...
we call on their captors to release all their hostages immediately and unconditionally , " she added . " nightmare has ended " betancourt had not been seen since a rebel " proof of life " video broadcast last year , in which she appeared thin and depressed in a jungle camp .
the us hostages , also shown in the video , described how she was slowly succumbing to hepatitis b and tropical skin diseases , and was kept chained to a tree after attempts to escape . betancourt 's family waged a campaign for her freedom , organizing events in both colombia and france , despite warnings from the colombian government that raising her profile in such a way only made her a more valuable hostage for the farc rebels . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

colombian journalists have been invited to the scene of the rescue by defence minister santos , and i 'm sure that we 'll soon see images on screens everywhere .
the last pictures of ingrid betancourt were very depressing ; we heard from a fellow hostage that she was suffering from depression and various diseases , and she looked very thin . was the rescue expected ?
why did it happen now ? i think the rescue was expected .
as we know , in the last few weeks and months , farc suffered a series of blows and has been broken down into different factions which were n't able to move about within the country .
that 's a huge hindrance if you have a large number of hostages .
aside from the 15 hostages that have been freed , there are 42 other political hostages and several hundred more colombians being held by farc - that 's a significant burden for a guerrilla force that is in crisis .
it probably was n't possible for farc to move the hostages quickly or hide their tracks from the army .
i think that 's why the location of the hostages was known , and government agents were able to observe the hostages for a longer time . how long do you think it will take for the other hostages to be freed ? i think we can be fairly certain that the locations of many of the other hostages are known .
it 's a question of time before more will be freed , less so through military operations and more so due to traitors .
the blow delivered to farc by the release of these 15 hostages could cause many farc rebels to start thinking about whether they want to cooperate with the authorities .
there 's been a string of prominent desertions in recent weeks , and there 's been an erosion in farc 's ranks that could lead to more hostages being released . could the release of betancourt also be seen as an offer on the part of farc leader alfonso cano to the uribe government ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : betancourt , right , seen here with her mother , was farc 's trump card no .
if this were the case , farc would have handled it more intelligently , and not allowed the government any opportunity to present it as a rescue situation .
currently , we only have the government 's version of events , as well as the pictures and other evidence that point to it actually having been a rescue .
farc 's political head , alfonso cano , would have used his trump card - namely betancourt and the three american hostages - differently - at the start of peace talks for instance , so that he would have had something in his hand against the government .
now , farc has very little . is president 's uribe 's political strategy on farc paying off ? the last few months , but today especially , mark the biggest success uribe has had in achieving security in colombia .
his tough stance against the guerillas is paying off , as are the increasing incentives being offered to ex-rebels by the government .
it started with the disarmament of the paramilitaries in 2005 , but there have been increasing incentives for guerrillas to turn themselves in .
the military strategy is being coupled with a strategy for peace and post-conflict management in the regions that have been liberated .
it 's a big success for the uribe administration , and also explains his huge approval ratings of over 80 percent . do you think we are seeing the beginning of the end of farc and decades of internal conflict in colombia ? we 've entered a new era in terms of the conflict in colombia .
we no longer have the trio of typical actors , namely paramilitary , guerrilla and weak state .
rather , we have a state that is not just strong militarily , but that also enjoys popular support while , on the other side , we have illegal groups , or terrorists , as they 're now referred to .
then there are remnants of the old conflict , and among these is farc , or what remains of farc .
it could be that in the months or years to come , we 'll have a scenario where farc consists of just a few hundred fighters that are n't really relevant anymore , but that 's the optimistic variation .
the more cautious scenario is one where cano succeeds in reviving farc elements in colombian cities .
still , farc is n't the number one problem anymore and this latest blow causes one to wonder whether farc can still be referred to as a guerrilla force or rather just a criminal group .

i think that 's why the location of the hostages was known , and government agents were able to observe the hostages for a longer time . how long do you think it will take for the other hostages to be freed ? i think we can be fairly certain that the locations of many of the other hostages are known .
it 's a question of time before more will be freed , less so through military operations and more so due to traitors .
the blow delivered to farc by the release of these 15 hostages could cause many farc rebels to start thinking about whether they want to cooperate with the authorities .
there 's been a string of prominent desertions in recent weeks , and there 's been an erosion in farc 's ranks that could lead to more hostages being released . could the release of betancourt also be seen as an offer on the part of farc leader alfonso cano to the uribe government ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : betancourt , right , seen here with her mother , was farc 's trump card no .
if this were the case , farc would have handled it more intelligently , and not allowed the government any opportunity to present it as a rescue situation .
currently , we only have the government 's version of events , as well as the pictures and other evidence that point to it actually having been a rescue .
farc 's political head , alfonso cano , would have used his trump card - namely betancourt and the three american hostages - differently - at the start of peace talks for instance , so that he would have had something in his hand against the government .
now , farc has very little . is president 's uribe 's political strategy on farc paying off ? the last few months , but today especially , mark the biggest success uribe has had in achieving security in colombia .
his tough stance against the guerillas is paying off , as are the increasing incentives being offered to ex-rebels by the government .
it started with the disarmament of the paramilitaries in 2005 , but there have been increasing incentives for guerrillas to turn themselves in .
the military strategy is being coupled with a strategy for peace and post-conflict management in the regions that have been liberated .
it 's a big success for the uribe administration , and also explains his huge approval ratings of over 80 percent . do you think we are seeing the beginning of the end of farc and decades of internal conflict in colombia ? we 've entered a new era in terms of the conflict in colombia .
we no longer have the trio of typical actors , namely paramilitary , guerrilla and weak state .
rather , we have a state that is not just strong militarily , but that also enjoys popular support while , on the other side , we have illegal groups , or terrorists , as they 're now referred to .
then there are remnants of the old conflict , and among these is farc , or what remains of farc .
it could be that in the months or years to come , we 'll have a scenario where farc consists of just a few hundred fighters that are n't really relevant anymore , but that 's the optimistic variation .
the more cautious scenario is one where cano succeeds in reviving farc elements in colombian cities .
still , farc is n't the number one problem anymore and this latest blow causes one to wonder whether farc can still be referred to as a guerrilla force or rather just a criminal group .
but i think it 's premature to speak of an end to the conflict . claudia herrera pahl interviewed carsten wieland -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" sending the wrong signal " this in turn has raised concerns that central banks around the world will be forced to raise borrowing costs just as international economic growth is losing momentum . senior ministers from germany , spain and france cautioned the european central bank against raising interest rates last weekend , warning it could stifle growth . german finance minister peer steinbrueck said week higher rates risked worsening a slowdown in growth .

" now , it has to have a certain flexibility , especially as european inflation comes essentially from the price of oil and food , not from an excess of internal demand , " zapatero said in an interview with daily el pais . the ecb rate hike and the growing global economic uncertainty also comes as part of the build-up to this month 's summit in japan of the group of eight leading industrial nations where the troubled state of the world economy could dominate proceedings . also on thursday sweden 's central bank , the riksbank , announced that it was joining the push to higher rates by lifting its benchmark repo rate by 25 basis points to 4.5 percent . this came in the wake of data showing annual inflation in sweden climbing to 4 percent in may to hit its highest rate in more than 14 years . adding to the growing worries about the economic risks posed by inflation , figures released on thursday showed consumer prices in switzerland jumping to a 15-year high of 2.9 percent in june , consequently increasing the pressure on the swiss national bank . inflation peaks in euro zone euro zone inflation also shot up to a 16-year high of 4 percent in june , preliminary data announced this week showed .

" the ecb has to consider that they could possibly send the wrong signal with an interest rate increase because it could have a pro-cyclical impact at a point when the economy is slowing down , " he told german weekly der spiegel .
steinbrueck 's view was echoed by spanish prime minster jose luis rodriguez zapatero . " now , it has to have a certain flexibility , especially as european inflation comes essentially from the price of oil and food , not from an excess of internal demand , " zapatero said in an interview with daily el pais . the ecb rate hike and the growing global economic uncertainty also comes as part of the build-up to this month 's summit in japan of the group of eight leading industrial nations where the troubled state of the world economy could dominate proceedings . also on thursday sweden 's central bank , the riksbank , announced that it was joining the push to higher rates by lifting its benchmark repo rate by 25 basis points to 4.5 percent . this came in the wake of data showing annual inflation in sweden climbing to 4 percent in may to hit its highest rate in more than 14 years . adding to the growing worries about the economic risks posed by inflation , figures released on thursday showed consumer prices in switzerland jumping to a 15-year high of 2.9 percent in june , consequently increasing the pressure on the swiss national bank . inflation peaks in euro zone euro zone inflation also shot up to a 16-year high of 4 percent in june , preliminary data announced this week showed .

" the negotiations have not ended - another round of talks was concluded - for the time being we are not at the finish line , " klich told poland 's private radio zet .
" we completed an important , a significant , round of talks two days ago but the finish line of talks is still ahead of us , " he said , adding that " july is a long month . "
daniel fried , the assistant secretary of state for european and eurasian affairs and a former ambassador to poland , told reporters that the last round of talks between the us and poland had made real progress but refused to confirm that an agreement had been reached .
the united states wants to base 10 interceptor missiles on the territory of the ex-communist nato member and a radar facility in the neighboring czech republic to ward off potential attacks by so-called " rogue " states , notably iran .
a deal under which the czech republic would house the missile shield 's radar base was concluded in april .
lithuania alternative seen as a bargaining chip bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech republic will host radar systems the proposed missile shield system has angered russia , which fears it may actually be one of the countries in the cross-hairs , while public opinion in poland and the czech republic is broadly opposed to the defensive system .
talks between poland and the united states over the missile shield began in may last year but after initial progress the negotiations have dragged over poland 's demands for substantial us aid to modernize its armed forces in return for its cooperation .
the impasse has allegedly led the us to consider poland 's northern neighbor lithuania but bogdan klich said such reports were simply pressure tactics during the negotiations with poland .
" in my opinion this was a pressure tactic used by the us on poland and it would not at all be so easy for the americans to locate the missile shield in lithuania ... because of stronger protests by russia against this location instead of poland , " klich said .
" the americans are endeavoring to maintain good relations with russia . "
senior officials in lithuania , like poland a member of the european union and nato , have flatly denied talks were underway with washington . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

colombian journalists have been invited to the scene of the rescue by defence minister santos , and i 'm sure that we 'll soon see images on screens everywhere .
the last pictures of ingrid betancourt were very depressing ; we heard from a fellow hostage that she was suffering from depression and various diseases , and she looked very thin . was the rescue expected ?
why did it happen now ? i think the rescue was expected .
as we know , in the last few weeks and months , farc suffered a series of blows and has been broken down into different factions which were n't able to move about within the country .
that 's a huge hindrance if you have a large number of hostages .
aside from the 15 hostages that have been freed , there are 42 other political hostages and several hundred more colombians being held by farc - that 's a significant burden for a guerrilla force that is in crisis .
it probably was n't possible for farc to move the hostages quickly or hide their tracks from the army .
i think that 's why the location of the hostages was known , and government agents were able to observe the hostages for a longer time . how long do you think it will take for the other hostages to be freed ? i think we can be fairly certain that the locations of many of the other hostages are known .
it 's a question of time before more will be freed , less so through military operations and more so due to traitors .
the blow delivered to farc by the release of these 15 hostages could cause many farc rebels to start thinking about whether they want to cooperate with the authorities .
there 's been a string of prominent desertions in recent weeks , and there 's been an erosion in farc 's ranks that could lead to more hostages being released . could the release of betancourt also be seen as an offer on the part of farc leader alfonso cano to the uribe government ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : betancourt , right , seen here with her mother , was farc 's trump card no .
if this were the case , farc would have handled it more intelligently , and not allowed the government any opportunity to present it as a rescue situation .
currently , we only have the government 's version of events , as well as the pictures and other evidence that point to it actually having been a rescue .
farc 's political head , alfonso cano , would have used his trump card - namely betancourt and the three american hostages - differently - at the start of peace talks for instance , so that he would have had something in his hand against the government .
now , farc has very little . is president 's uribe 's political strategy on farc paying off ? the last few months , but today especially , mark the biggest success uribe has had in achieving security in colombia .
his tough stance against the guerillas is paying off , as are the increasing incentives being offered to ex-rebels by the government .
it started with the disarmament of the paramilitaries in 2005 , but there have been increasing incentives for guerrillas to turn themselves in .
the military strategy is being coupled with a strategy for peace and post-conflict management in the regions that have been liberated .
it 's a big success for the uribe administration , and also explains his huge approval ratings of over 80 percent . do you think we are seeing the beginning of the end of farc and decades of internal conflict in colombia ? we 've entered a new era in terms of the conflict in colombia .
we no longer have the trio of typical actors , namely paramilitary , guerrilla and weak state .
rather , we have a state that is not just strong militarily , but that also enjoys popular support while , on the other side , we have illegal groups , or terrorists , as they 're now referred to .
then there are remnants of the old conflict , and among these is farc , or what remains of farc .
it could be that in the months or years to come , we 'll have a scenario where farc consists of just a few hundred fighters that are n't really relevant anymore , but that 's the optimistic variation .
the more cautious scenario is one where cano succeeds in reviving farc elements in colombian cities .
still , farc is n't the number one problem anymore and this latest blow causes one to wonder whether farc can still be referred to as a guerrilla force or rather just a criminal group .
but i think it 's premature to speak of an end to the conflict . claudia herrera pahl interviewed carsten wieland -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the court ruled that the country had to enact a gender reassignment law , or pay 40,000 euros for the surgery to take place abroad .
a spokesperson from the country 's justice ministry said that the whole sum had transferred , as no law was adopted .
lithuania 's government drafted a law to allow gender reassignment surgery and presented it to parliament in 2003 , but the bill has not been passed .
lack of political will " there is a lack of political will to take action on the issue , and i do not know when there will be some , " elvyra baltutyte , lithuania 's representative at the european human rights court told reuters news agency .
international human rights organizations have criticized lithuania in the past for not respecting the rights of sexual minorities . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it was only when the helicopter was in the air that " the chief of operations said , ' we are the national army and you are all free . '

first she will be reunited with her family in colombia . her rescue is considered the most serious blow dealt to farc , who saw betancourt and three americans captured in 2003 as their most valuable bargaining chips . the americans - former defense department contract workers marc gonsalves , keith stansell and thomas howes - returned to the united states on wednesday evening . us president george w. bush praised the rescue operation in a phone call with colombian president alvare uribe , the white house said . in paris , president nicolas sarkozy expressed his gratitude that " a nightmare of more than six years has ended .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 03.07.2008 merkel remains strongly opposed to assisted suicide großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actively assisting suicide is illegal in germany german chancellor angela merkel has spoken out in the strongest terms against euthanasia as the heated debate over a former hamburg government official 's involvement in the assisted suicide of a pensioner gathers pace . merkel , outlining her christian democrats ' party line on the topic , said that she was against " every form of assisted suicide " regardless of the circumstances .
merkel 's stance was echoed by germany 's health minister ulla schmidt .
" i reject this path categorically , " she said .
" the correct path is to offer assistance to those who are dying instead of helping those free from terminal illness to commit suicide . "
the debate was prompted by the revelation this week that a 79-year-old wurzburg woman chose to end her own life on saturday despite not having any life-threatening diseases or suffering great physical pain .
what added an extra angle to the story was that former hamburg justice senator roger kusch , a proponent for the right to die , advised her of the best way to do it .
" i was in her apartment at 11:00 am , " kusch explained at a press conference he called on monday to discuss the assisted suicide .
" at around 11:30 , she began to prepare three glasses - one with the sedative diazepam , one with a mixture of the anti-malaria drug chloroquine and one with a sweet syrup , because the other substances can cause nausea .
she drank the glass with the deadly chloroquine quickly .
her last words were ' auf wiedersehen . ' … then i left . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kusch educated the pensioner on the best way to die kusch then said that he vacated the apartment for three hours so as not to be present at the moment of death .
when he returned , he said , she was lying dead on her bed .
" i am for self-determination until the final breath , " he says .
he also showed the press conference clips from a nine-hour video he made documenting his relationship to the pensioner , identified only as bettina s. kusch made headlines earlier this year when he presented to the media a " suicide machine " patients could use to inject themselves with a deadly cocktail .
the case has prompted fresh calls in germany for stronger regulations and laws regarding assisted suicide .
merkel 's conservatives in favor of prison sentences merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- party wants to introduce a bill in cdu controlled states that would make the involvement in an assisted suicide a new criminal offense which carries a prison term of up to three years for the commercial or otherwise organized offering of suicide assistance .
the cdu is expected to put the bill to the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , on friday .
however , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , the cdu 's coalition partner in government , have their own ideas .
the spd would like to pass a law requiring doctors to obey patients ' wishes as expressed in " living wills . "
the spd claims to have wide support for the idea from other political factions .
but the cdu argues that such a law would presuppose that patients completely understand all of the implications of a living will - an assumption that , given the complexity of medical care , the patient can not possibly make .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss organization dignitas provides a way and place to die both the netherlands and belgium passed laws in 2002 which allow doctors to give terminally ill patients a deadly injection , provided they were in full possession of their faculties when they made the decision to die .
switzerland too allows such assistance .
officials in berlin have been wrangling for months over what form a law governing how binding so-called " living wills " should take .
such documents outline what medical treatment individuals want should they no longer be in a position to make decisions .
social democrats urge restraint in clamor for new laws the spd 's peter struck , the leader of the party 's faction in the bundestag , warned against making rash decisions in the heat of the debate , saying that few bills brought in immediately in the aftermath of such an event were detailed enough to be effective .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : advocates say euthanasia is a humane solution edzard schmidt-jortzig , the chairperson of the german ethical council , also warned about tightening restrictions and introducing criminal justice laws .
he said that there were some emergencies in which euthanasia was the only humane solution .
roger kusch was careful not to break any of the current laws through his involvement with the death of bettina s. while he educated the pensioner on how to kill herself , he did not administer the deadly dosage himself .
because suicide is not illegal in germany , advising someone on how best to do it is likewise not punishable .
it is currently illegal to actively assist in someone 's suicide in germany .
despite his kusch 's best efforts , public prosecutors have now opened an investigation into the suicide . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 03.07.2008 merkel remains strongly opposed to assisted suicide großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actively assisting suicide is illegal in germany german chancellor angela merkel has spoken out in the strongest terms against euthanasia as the heated debate over a former hamburg government official 's involvement in the assisted suicide of a pensioner gathers pace . merkel , outlining her christian democrats ' party line on the topic , said that she was against " every form of assisted suicide " regardless of the circumstances .
merkel 's stance was echoed by germany 's health minister ulla schmidt .
" i reject this path categorically , " she said .
" the correct path is to offer assistance to those who are dying instead of helping those free from terminal illness to commit suicide . "
the debate was prompted by the revelation this week that a 79-year-old wurzburg woman chose to end her own life on saturday despite not having any life-threatening diseases or suffering great physical pain .
what added an extra angle to the story was that former hamburg justice senator roger kusch , a proponent for the right to die , advised her of the best way to do it .
" i was in her apartment at 11:00 am , " kusch explained at a press conference he called on monday to discuss the assisted suicide .
" at around 11:30 , she began to prepare three glasses - one with the sedative diazepam , one with a mixture of the anti-malaria drug chloroquine and one with a sweet syrup , because the other substances can cause nausea .
she drank the glass with the deadly chloroquine quickly .
her last words were ' auf wiedersehen . ' … then i left . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kusch educated the pensioner on the best way to die kusch then said that he vacated the apartment for three hours so as not to be present at the moment of death .
when he returned , he said , she was lying dead on her bed .
" i am for self-determination until the final breath , " he says .
he also showed the press conference clips from a nine-hour video he made documenting his relationship to the pensioner , identified only as bettina s. kusch made headlines earlier this year when he presented to the media a " suicide machine " patients could use to inject themselves with a deadly cocktail .
the case has prompted fresh calls in germany for stronger regulations and laws regarding assisted suicide .
merkel 's conservatives in favor of prison sentences merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- party wants to introduce a bill in cdu controlled states that would make the involvement in an assisted suicide a new criminal offense which carries a prison term of up to three years for the commercial or otherwise organized offering of suicide assistance .
the cdu is expected to put the bill to the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , on friday .
however , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , the cdu 's coalition partner in government , have their own ideas .
the spd would like to pass a law requiring doctors to obey patients ' wishes as expressed in " living wills . "
the spd claims to have wide support for the idea from other political factions .
but the cdu argues that such a law would presuppose that patients completely understand all of the implications of a living will - an assumption that , given the complexity of medical care , the patient can not possibly make .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss organization dignitas provides a way and place to die both the netherlands and belgium passed laws in 2002 which allow doctors to give terminally ill patients a deadly injection , provided they were in full possession of their faculties when they made the decision to die .
switzerland too allows such assistance .
officials in berlin have been wrangling for months over what form a law governing how binding so-called " living wills " should take .
such documents outline what medical treatment individuals want should they no longer be in a position to make decisions .
social democrats urge restraint in clamor for new laws the spd 's peter struck , the leader of the party 's faction in the bundestag , warned against making rash decisions in the heat of the debate , saying that few bills brought in immediately in the aftermath of such an event were detailed enough to be effective .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : advocates say euthanasia is a humane solution edzard schmidt-jortzig , the chairperson of the german ethical council , also warned about tightening restrictions and introducing criminal justice laws .
he said that there were some emergencies in which euthanasia was the only humane solution .
roger kusch was careful not to break any of the current laws through his involvement with the death of bettina s. while he educated the pensioner on how to kill herself , he did not administer the deadly dosage himself .
because suicide is not illegal in germany , advising someone on how best to do it is likewise not punishable .
it is currently illegal to actively assist in someone 's suicide in germany .
despite his kusch 's best efforts , public prosecutors have now opened an investigation into the suicide . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 03.07.2008 oft-criticized us embassy prepares to open on july 4 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are sure to be more flags waving at the embassy party on july 4 china 's may have the better view , and finland 's the better architecture , but america 's is the biggest .
dw-world.de sent jefferson chase to check out the much-maligned new us embassy in berlin . for some reason , i found myself humming merle haggard 's " okie from muskogee " as i cycled up to the back entrance .
perhaps i was nervous .
after all i was bringing a camera and dictaphone into what was sure to be a high-security area .
two days ahead of the opening ceremony , workers were indeed already shifting security fences around the site near berlin 's brandenburg gate .
but the fencing , a local policewoman informed me , was largely being carted off from the fan mile of the euro 2008 soccer championship .
nor did the two american guards at the entrance seem particularly uptight , although they asked only be identified as " john " and " tom , " and said it was against regulations to photograph them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pre-world war ii embassy had more grandeur " i guess it 's to protect us from a ' terrorist ' coming up and killing us on the street , " said " tom , " making ironic air quotation marks and adding a humorous expletive to make it clear he did n't feel his job was particularly endangering his life .
" we 're looking forward to it , " added " john , " referring to the embassy 's official opening ceremony on friday , july 4th .
" everybody 's just going to have a big party . "
it was a surprisingly low-key atmosphere ahead of the public premiere of a building that has been the center of an unusual amount of squabbling .
back to the future the new building occupies the same spot on pariser platz , the square in front of the brandenburg gate , as the pre-world war ii us embassy to germany .
it is located in the formerly communist eastern part of the city , a stone 's throw from the site of ronald reagan 's famous " mr. gorbachev , tear down this wall " speech of 1987 .
thus , the new embassy can be seen as a symbol of america 's victories in both world war ii and the cold war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's a piece of the berlin wall in the embassy courtyard but the architects who designed it , from the california firm of moore ruble yudell , have drawn poor reviews , with many critics dismissing the structure as an example of outmoded 1980s postmodernism .
the city of berlin and the us state department also squabbled for years because us security requirements , put in place before and after 9/11 , forced the narrowing and diversion of streets to ensure that cars did not get to close to the building .
many berliners feared that the new embassy would create traffic jams , and a few even suggested that us diplomats should pack up and move out of the city center to avoid inconveniencing residents .
ironically , the building that was meant to embody the west 's triumph over communism ended up being caught in debates about how much security was needed vis-a-vis threats from those who do n't like america or its role in the world .
" we could have built an embassy out in the woods at half the cost and twice the security , " us ambassador to germany william r. timken told reporters in early 2008 , as the new embassy was nearing completion .
" we are here as a symbol of our desire to be a partner to germany . "
end of an eyesore bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists were already trying to get a peep at the building on wednesday , july 2 whatever the new building 's architectural shortcomings , its inauguration means that the fortifications surrounding its predecessor can be removed .
when reunified germany moved its capital from bonn to berlin in 1990 , the us was forced to use its former embassy to communist east germany , situated on a narrow side street near the brandenburg gate , as its formal diplomatic headquarters in germany .
the street had to be completely cordoned off with metal fencing and concrete pollards , yielding a spectacle reminiscent of checkpoint charlie at the height of the cold war - or belfast , northern ireland during the troubles .
as people geared up for the official launch of the new embassy , policemen in construction helmets were busy dismantling the fortifications around the old one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thankfully , the previous us embassy is history the street will be reopened to traffic , meaning that , if anything , the area around pariser platz may become a bit less congested .
expat opinion divided and what do the 12,500 us citizens who reside in the german capital think of their diplomats ' new home ?
being americans , they disagree .
" i think it 's misguided , embarrassing and ugly , " said todd cameron , an art gallery assistant who works not too far from pariser platz .
others feel that more sensitivity could have been shown toward residents ' concerns .
" i though it was a typical us thing to do , to just go ahead and build an embassy and make others move , " said brian landry , a cook at a local restaurant .
" they also would n't let me in when i tried to go have a look . "
but on the blogs , most americans seemed to think the new building was basically all right .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stands from the euro 2008 fan mile still had to be cleared " i think it looks fine , " wrote one user of a forum for american ex-pats in berlin .
" it also seems to be a design that wo n't look utterly ridiculous in 30 years , unlike some new construction . "
guests invited to the opening ceremonies on july 4th , including german chancellor angela merkel , will get a chance to inspect at closer range an embassy that once had some people up in arms , and now seems like little more than just another big building .
maybe they 'll even play some merle haggard . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" sending the wrong signal " this in turn has raised concerns that central banks around the world will be forced to raise borrowing costs just as international economic growth is losing momentum . senior ministers from germany , spain and france cautioned the european central bank against raising interest rates last weekend , warning it could stifle growth . german finance minister peer steinbrueck said week higher rates risked worsening a slowdown in growth .
" the ecb has to consider that they could possibly send the wrong signal with an interest rate increase because it could have a pro-cyclical impact at a point when the economy is slowing down , " he told german weekly der spiegel .
steinbrueck 's view was echoed by spanish prime minster jose luis rodriguez zapatero . " now , it has to have a certain flexibility , especially as european inflation comes essentially from the price of oil and food , not from an excess of internal demand , " zapatero said in an interview with daily el pais . the ecb rate hike and the growing global economic uncertainty also comes as part of the build-up to this month 's summit in japan of the group of eight leading industrial nations where the troubled state of the world economy could dominate proceedings . also on thursday sweden 's central bank , the riksbank , announced that it was joining the push to higher rates by lifting its benchmark repo rate by 25 basis points to 4.5 percent . this came in the wake of data showing annual inflation in sweden climbing to 4 percent in may to hit its highest rate in more than 14 years . adding to the growing worries about the economic risks posed by inflation , figures released on thursday showed consumer prices in switzerland jumping to a 15-year high of 2.9 percent in june , consequently increasing the pressure on the swiss national bank . inflation peaks in euro zone euro zone inflation also shot up to a 16-year high of 4 percent in june , preliminary data announced this week showed .
inflation in the currency bloc is now double the ecb 's target of " close to , but just below 2 percent . " trichet surprised markets last month by signalling that a rate hike could be in the pipeline , saying in his regular press briefing that the bank 's governing council was in a state of " heightened alertness " about the risks posed by inflation . in the meantime , ecb figures released last week pointed to a sustained rise in the amount of money in circulation in the euro zone with the so-called m3 money supply chalking up a 10.5-percent annual rate in may .

colombian journalists have been invited to the scene of the rescue by defence minister santos , and i 'm sure that we 'll soon see images on screens everywhere .
the last pictures of ingrid betancourt were very depressing ; we heard from a fellow hostage that she was suffering from depression and various diseases , and she looked very thin . was the rescue expected ?
why did it happen now ? i think the rescue was expected .
as we know , in the last few weeks and months , farc suffered a series of blows and has been broken down into different factions which were n't able to move about within the country .
that 's a huge hindrance if you have a large number of hostages .
aside from the 15 hostages that have been freed , there are 42 other political hostages and several hundred more colombians being held by farc - that 's a significant burden for a guerrilla force that is in crisis .
it probably was n't possible for farc to move the hostages quickly or hide their tracks from the army .
i think that 's why the location of the hostages was known , and government agents were able to observe the hostages for a longer time . how long do you think it will take for the other hostages to be freed ? i think we can be fairly certain that the locations of many of the other hostages are known .
it 's a question of time before more will be freed , less so through military operations and more so due to traitors .
the blow delivered to farc by the release of these 15 hostages could cause many farc rebels to start thinking about whether they want to cooperate with the authorities .
there 's been a string of prominent desertions in recent weeks , and there 's been an erosion in farc 's ranks that could lead to more hostages being released . could the release of betancourt also be seen as an offer on the part of farc leader alfonso cano to the uribe government ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : betancourt , right , seen here with her mother , was farc 's trump card no .
if this were the case , farc would have handled it more intelligently , and not allowed the government any opportunity to present it as a rescue situation .
currently , we only have the government 's version of events , as well as the pictures and other evidence that point to it actually having been a rescue .
farc 's political head , alfonso cano , would have used his trump card - namely betancourt and the three american hostages - differently - at the start of peace talks for instance , so that he would have had something in his hand against the government .
now , farc has very little . is president 's uribe 's political strategy on farc paying off ? the last few months , but today especially , mark the biggest success uribe has had in achieving security in colombia .
his tough stance against the guerillas is paying off , as are the increasing incentives being offered to ex-rebels by the government .
it started with the disarmament of the paramilitaries in 2005 , but there have been increasing incentives for guerrillas to turn themselves in .
the military strategy is being coupled with a strategy for peace and post-conflict management in the regions that have been liberated .
it 's a big success for the uribe administration , and also explains his huge approval ratings of over 80 percent . do you think we are seeing the beginning of the end of farc and decades of internal conflict in colombia ? we 've entered a new era in terms of the conflict in colombia .
we no longer have the trio of typical actors , namely paramilitary , guerrilla and weak state .
rather , we have a state that is not just strong militarily , but that also enjoys popular support while , on the other side , we have illegal groups , or terrorists , as they 're now referred to .
then there are remnants of the old conflict , and among these is farc , or what remains of farc .
it could be that in the months or years to come , we 'll have a scenario where farc consists of just a few hundred fighters that are n't really relevant anymore , but that 's the optimistic variation .
the more cautious scenario is one where cano succeeds in reviving farc elements in colombian cities .
still , farc is n't the number one problem anymore and this latest blow causes one to wonder whether farc can still be referred to as a guerrilla force or rather just a criminal group .
but i think it 's premature to speak of an end to the conflict . claudia herrera pahl interviewed carsten wieland -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

colombian journalists have been invited to the scene of the rescue by defence minister santos , and i 'm sure that we 'll soon see images on screens everywhere .
the last pictures of ingrid betancourt were very depressing ; we heard from a fellow hostage that she was suffering from depression and various diseases , and she looked very thin . was the rescue expected ?
why did it happen now ? i think the rescue was expected .
as we know , in the last few weeks and months , farc suffered a series of blows and has been broken down into different factions which were n't able to move about within the country .
that 's a huge hindrance if you have a large number of hostages .
aside from the 15 hostages that have been freed , there are 42 other political hostages and several hundred more colombians being held by farc - that 's a significant burden for a guerrilla force that is in crisis .
it probably was n't possible for farc to move the hostages quickly or hide their tracks from the army .
i think that 's why the location of the hostages was known , and government agents were able to observe the hostages for a longer time . how long do you think it will take for the other hostages to be freed ? i think we can be fairly certain that the locations of many of the other hostages are known .
it 's a question of time before more will be freed , less so through military operations and more so due to traitors .
the blow delivered to farc by the release of these 15 hostages could cause many farc rebels to start thinking about whether they want to cooperate with the authorities .
there 's been a string of prominent desertions in recent weeks , and there 's been an erosion in farc 's ranks that could lead to more hostages being released . could the release of betancourt also be seen as an offer on the part of farc leader alfonso cano to the uribe government ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : betancourt , right , seen here with her mother , was farc 's trump card no .
if this were the case , farc would have handled it more intelligently , and not allowed the government any opportunity to present it as a rescue situation .
currently , we only have the government 's version of events , as well as the pictures and other evidence that point to it actually having been a rescue .
farc 's political head , alfonso cano , would have used his trump card - namely betancourt and the three american hostages - differently - at the start of peace talks for instance , so that he would have had something in his hand against the government .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 03.07.2008 oft-criticized us embassy prepares to open on july 4 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are sure to be more flags waving at the embassy party on july 4 china 's may have the better view , and finland 's the better architecture , but america 's is the biggest .
dw-world.de sent jefferson chase to check out the much-maligned new us embassy in berlin . for some reason , i found myself humming merle haggard 's " okie from muskogee " as i cycled up to the back entrance .
perhaps i was nervous .
after all i was bringing a camera and dictaphone into what was sure to be a high-security area .
two days ahead of the opening ceremony , workers were indeed already shifting security fences around the site near berlin 's brandenburg gate .
but the fencing , a local policewoman informed me , was largely being carted off from the fan mile of the euro 2008 soccer championship .
nor did the two american guards at the entrance seem particularly uptight , although they asked only be identified as " john " and " tom , " and said it was against regulations to photograph them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pre-world war ii embassy had more grandeur " i guess it 's to protect us from a ' terrorist ' coming up and killing us on the street , " said " tom , " making ironic air quotation marks and adding a humorous expletive to make it clear he did n't feel his job was particularly endangering his life .
" we 're looking forward to it , " added " john , " referring to the embassy 's official opening ceremony on friday , july 4th .
" everybody 's just going to have a big party . "
it was a surprisingly low-key atmosphere ahead of the public premiere of a building that has been the center of an unusual amount of squabbling .
back to the future the new building occupies the same spot on pariser platz , the square in front of the brandenburg gate , as the pre-world war ii us embassy to germany .
it is located in the formerly communist eastern part of the city , a stone 's throw from the site of ronald reagan 's famous " mr. gorbachev , tear down this wall " speech of 1987 .
thus , the new embassy can be seen as a symbol of america 's victories in both world war ii and the cold war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's a piece of the berlin wall in the embassy courtyard but the architects who designed it , from the california firm of moore ruble yudell , have drawn poor reviews , with many critics dismissing the structure as an example of outmoded 1980s postmodernism .
the city of berlin and the us state department also squabbled for years because us security requirements , put in place before and after 9/11 , forced the narrowing and diversion of streets to ensure that cars did not get to close to the building .
many berliners feared that the new embassy would create traffic jams , and a few even suggested that us diplomats should pack up and move out of the city center to avoid inconveniencing residents .
ironically , the building that was meant to embody the west 's triumph over communism ended up being caught in debates about how much security was needed vis-a-vis threats from those who do n't like america or its role in the world .
" we could have built an embassy out in the woods at half the cost and twice the security , " us ambassador to germany william r. timken told reporters in early 2008 , as the new embassy was nearing completion .
" we are here as a symbol of our desire to be a partner to germany . "
end of an eyesore bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists were already trying to get a peep at the building on wednesday , july 2 whatever the new building 's architectural shortcomings , its inauguration means that the fortifications surrounding its predecessor can be removed .
when reunified germany moved its capital from bonn to berlin in 1990 , the us was forced to use its former embassy to communist east germany , situated on a narrow side street near the brandenburg gate , as its formal diplomatic headquarters in germany .
the street had to be completely cordoned off with metal fencing and concrete pollards , yielding a spectacle reminiscent of checkpoint charlie at the height of the cold war - or belfast , northern ireland during the troubles .
as people geared up for the official launch of the new embassy , policemen in construction helmets were busy dismantling the fortifications around the old one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thankfully , the previous us embassy is history the street will be reopened to traffic , meaning that , if anything , the area around pariser platz may become a bit less congested .
expat opinion divided and what do the 12,500 us citizens who reside in the german capital think of their diplomats ' new home ?
being americans , they disagree .
" i think it 's misguided , embarrassing and ugly , " said todd cameron , an art gallery assistant who works not too far from pariser platz .
others feel that more sensitivity could have been shown toward residents ' concerns .
" i though it was a typical us thing to do , to just go ahead and build an embassy and make others move , " said brian landry , a cook at a local restaurant .
" they also would n't let me in when i tried to go have a look . "
but on the blogs , most americans seemed to think the new building was basically all right .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stands from the euro 2008 fan mile still had to be cleared " i think it looks fine , " wrote one user of a forum for american ex-pats in berlin .
" it also seems to be a design that wo n't look utterly ridiculous in 30 years , unlike some new construction . "
guests invited to the opening ceremonies on july 4th , including german chancellor angela merkel , will get a chance to inspect at closer range an embassy that once had some people up in arms , and now seems like little more than just another big building .
maybe they 'll even play some merle haggard . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de sent jefferson chase to check out the much-maligned new us embassy in berlin . for some reason , i found myself humming merle haggard 's " okie from muskogee " as i cycled up to the back entrance .
perhaps i was nervous .
after all i was bringing a camera and dictaphone into what was sure to be a high-security area .
two days ahead of the opening ceremony , workers were indeed already shifting security fences around the site near berlin 's brandenburg gate .
but the fencing , a local policewoman informed me , was largely being carted off from the fan mile of the euro 2008 soccer championship .
nor did the two american guards at the entrance seem particularly uptight , although they asked only be identified as " john " and " tom , " and said it was against regulations to photograph them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pre-world war ii embassy had more grandeur " i guess it 's to protect us from a ' terrorist ' coming up and killing us on the street , " said " tom , " making ironic air quotation marks and adding a humorous expletive to make it clear he did n't feel his job was particularly endangering his life .
" we 're looking forward to it , " added " john , " referring to the embassy 's official opening ceremony on friday , july 4th .
" everybody 's just going to have a big party . "
it was a surprisingly low-key atmosphere ahead of the public premiere of a building that has been the center of an unusual amount of squabbling .
back to the future the new building occupies the same spot on pariser platz , the square in front of the brandenburg gate , as the pre-world war ii us embassy to germany .
it is located in the formerly communist eastern part of the city , a stone 's throw from the site of ronald reagan 's famous " mr. gorbachev , tear down this wall " speech of 1987 .
thus , the new embassy can be seen as a symbol of america 's victories in both world war ii and the cold war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's a piece of the berlin wall in the embassy courtyard but the architects who designed it , from the california firm of moore ruble yudell , have drawn poor reviews , with many critics dismissing the structure as an example of outmoded 1980s postmodernism .
the city of berlin and the us state department also squabbled for years because us security requirements , put in place before and after 9/11 , forced the narrowing and diversion of streets to ensure that cars did not get to close to the building .
many berliners feared that the new embassy would create traffic jams , and a few even suggested that us diplomats should pack up and move out of the city center to avoid inconveniencing residents .
ironically , the building that was meant to embody the west 's triumph over communism ended up being caught in debates about how much security was needed vis-a-vis threats from those who do n't like america or its role in the world .
" we could have built an embassy out in the woods at half the cost and twice the security , " us ambassador to germany william r. timken told reporters in early 2008 , as the new embassy was nearing completion .
" we are here as a symbol of our desire to be a partner to germany . "
end of an eyesore bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists were already trying to get a peep at the building on wednesday , july 2 whatever the new building 's architectural shortcomings , its inauguration means that the fortifications surrounding its predecessor can be removed .
when reunified germany moved its capital from bonn to berlin in 1990 , the us was forced to use its former embassy to communist east germany , situated on a narrow side street near the brandenburg gate , as its formal diplomatic headquarters in germany .
the street had to be completely cordoned off with metal fencing and concrete pollards , yielding a spectacle reminiscent of checkpoint charlie at the height of the cold war - or belfast , northern ireland during the troubles .
as people geared up for the official launch of the new embassy , policemen in construction helmets were busy dismantling the fortifications around the old one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thankfully , the previous us embassy is history the street will be reopened to traffic , meaning that , if anything , the area around pariser platz may become a bit less congested .
expat opinion divided and what do the 12,500 us citizens who reside in the german capital think of their diplomats ' new home ?
being americans , they disagree .
" i think it 's misguided , embarrassing and ugly , " said todd cameron , an art gallery assistant who works not too far from pariser platz .
others feel that more sensitivity could have been shown toward residents ' concerns .
" i though it was a typical us thing to do , to just go ahead and build an embassy and make others move , " said brian landry , a cook at a local restaurant .
" they also would n't let me in when i tried to go have a look . "
but on the blogs , most americans seemed to think the new building was basically all right .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stands from the euro 2008 fan mile still had to be cleared " i think it looks fine , " wrote one user of a forum for american ex-pats in berlin .
" it also seems to be a design that wo n't look utterly ridiculous in 30 years , unlike some new construction . "
guests invited to the opening ceremonies on july 4th , including german chancellor angela merkel , will get a chance to inspect at closer range an embassy that once had some people up in arms , and now seems like little more than just another big building .
maybe they 'll even play some merle haggard . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel 's stance was echoed by germany 's health minister ulla schmidt .
" i reject this path categorically , " she said .
" the correct path is to offer assistance to those who are dying instead of helping those free from terminal illness to commit suicide . "
the debate was prompted by the revelation this week that a 79-year-old wurzburg woman chose to end her own life on saturday despite not having any life-threatening diseases or suffering great physical pain .
what added an extra angle to the story was that former hamburg justice senator roger kusch , a proponent for the right to die , advised her of the best way to do it .
" i was in her apartment at 11:00 am , " kusch explained at a press conference he called on monday to discuss the assisted suicide .
" at around 11:30 , she began to prepare three glasses - one with the sedative diazepam , one with a mixture of the anti-malaria drug chloroquine and one with a sweet syrup , because the other substances can cause nausea .
she drank the glass with the deadly chloroquine quickly .
her last words were ' auf wiedersehen . ' … then i left . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kusch educated the pensioner on the best way to die kusch then said that he vacated the apartment for three hours so as not to be present at the moment of death .
when he returned , he said , she was lying dead on her bed .
" i am for self-determination until the final breath , " he says .
he also showed the press conference clips from a nine-hour video he made documenting his relationship to the pensioner , identified only as bettina s. kusch made headlines earlier this year when he presented to the media a " suicide machine " patients could use to inject themselves with a deadly cocktail .
the case has prompted fresh calls in germany for stronger regulations and laws regarding assisted suicide .
merkel 's conservatives in favor of prison sentences merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- party wants to introduce a bill in cdu controlled states that would make the involvement in an assisted suicide a new criminal offense which carries a prison term of up to three years for the commercial or otherwise organized offering of suicide assistance .
the cdu is expected to put the bill to the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , on friday .
however , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , the cdu 's coalition partner in government , have their own ideas .
the spd would like to pass a law requiring doctors to obey patients ' wishes as expressed in " living wills . "
the spd claims to have wide support for the idea from other political factions .
but the cdu argues that such a law would presuppose that patients completely understand all of the implications of a living will - an assumption that , given the complexity of medical care , the patient can not possibly make .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swiss organization dignitas provides a way and place to die both the netherlands and belgium passed laws in 2002 which allow doctors to give terminally ill patients a deadly injection , provided they were in full possession of their faculties when they made the decision to die .
switzerland too allows such assistance .
officials in berlin have been wrangling for months over what form a law governing how binding so-called " living wills " should take .
such documents outline what medical treatment individuals want should they no longer be in a position to make decisions .
social democrats urge restraint in clamor for new laws the spd 's peter struck , the leader of the party 's faction in the bundestag , warned against making rash decisions in the heat of the debate , saying that few bills brought in immediately in the aftermath of such an event were detailed enough to be effective .

he 's already implemented a few cushy perks for the club , too . the new atmosphere , which includes buddha statues at the training center , was briefly disturbed by klinsmann 's demand to bar photographers early on at the press conference on wednesday , july 2 , because the flashes and noise bothered him .
the photographers left in protest but the incident was only the latest sign of a new era at the german top club which klinsmann named " among the top 10 in the world . "
" munich has the highest expectations , " he said .
" the fans want both titles in germany and to be in champions league until the end .
that is munich 's ambition and we want to meet it … .
we set the highest goals for ourselves . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann with his assistant coach martin vasquez munich won a third domestic league and cup double in four years in the past season but have not been as successful on the big stage - their last champions league final dating back to 2001 when they beat valencia on penalties .
allowing for inspiration a new training facility and rest area is the most visible sign of change in munich , in addition to his multi-cultural coaching staff and an eight-hour working day for players in the pre-season .
players are to lunch together and the facility allows munich to do away with training camps , with klinsmann saying it is better for players to enjoy their home and families after work instead of a sometimes boring hotel . " the players are to be inspired and motivated - by our staff , by kalle -lrb- chairman karl-heinz rummenigge -rrb- and uli -lrb- general manager uli hoeness -rrb- - to be given lots of ideas , " commented the new head coach .
rummenigge said , " we are all thrilled .
we have a perfect oasis for our players to bring their concentration 100 percent on football .
percentage is important in football . "

" my philosophy is easy : to make every player better each day .
there will be a lot of individual work on and off the pitch .
we have unique foundations and want to bring them to the next level , " said klinsmann .
those include bastian schweinsteiger and lukas podolski , the national team heroes under klinsmann and again at euro 2008 , who rarely play in munich 's quality roster .

chairman refutes podolski claim rummenigge poured cold water on wednesday 's reports in the german media that podolski was set to be sold to cologne for 15 million euros -lrb- $ 23.5 million -rrb- .
" there is no question of selling podolski to cologne .
i called my counterpart to tell him clearly .
it is a definite decision , " said rummenigge in a press conference in munich .
bayern 's chairman of the board said reports on both the sport-bild and sport1.de w eb sites were " a big joke . "
rummenigge also ruled out the possible transfer of germany 's player of 2007 mario gomez from vfb stuttgart to munich .
" since stuttgart informed us of his decision not to negotiate with us , there is nothing more to say on the subject and i do not believe they want to reactivate the negotiations , " insisted rummenigge .
" our squad is already well packed . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poldi and schweini are bayern and germany colleagues on the subject of podolski and schweinsteiger , klinsmann said he could also not guarantee them a place in the starting 11 , but heaped praise on the two youngsters who have won more than 50 caps each at the young age of 23 .
" there is a lot of potential for both .
they are just 23 and have experienced things many others have n't seen in their entire careers .
they have experienced extremes .
we must help them and make them more consistant , " he said .
kahn 's successor to be named klinsmann said that pre-season preparations are hampered by post-euro 2008 holidays with the full team not together until july 17 - four weeks ahead of the league season opener munich plays on august 15 against hamburg .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 03.07.2008 oft-criticized us embassy prepares to open on july 4 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are sure to be more flags waving at the embassy party on july 4 china 's may have the better view , and finland 's the better architecture , but america 's is the biggest .
dw-world.de sent jefferson chase to check out the much-maligned new us embassy in berlin . for some reason , i found myself humming merle haggard 's " okie from muskogee " as i cycled up to the back entrance .
perhaps i was nervous .
after all i was bringing a camera and dictaphone into what was sure to be a high-security area .
two days ahead of the opening ceremony , workers were indeed already shifting security fences around the site near berlin 's brandenburg gate .
but the fencing , a local policewoman informed me , was largely being carted off from the fan mile of the euro 2008 soccer championship .
nor did the two american guards at the entrance seem particularly uptight , although they asked only be identified as " john " and " tom , " and said it was against regulations to photograph them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pre-world war ii embassy had more grandeur " i guess it 's to protect us from a ' terrorist ' coming up and killing us on the street , " said " tom , " making ironic air quotation marks and adding a humorous expletive to make it clear he did n't feel his job was particularly endangering his life .
" we 're looking forward to it , " added " john , " referring to the embassy 's official opening ceremony on friday , july 4th .
" everybody 's just going to have a big party . "
it was a surprisingly low-key atmosphere ahead of the public premiere of a building that has been the center of an unusual amount of squabbling .
back to the future the new building occupies the same spot on pariser platz , the square in front of the brandenburg gate , as the pre-world war ii us embassy to germany .
it is located in the formerly communist eastern part of the city , a stone 's throw from the site of ronald reagan 's famous " mr. gorbachev , tear down this wall " speech of 1987 .
thus , the new embassy can be seen as a symbol of america 's victories in both world war ii and the cold war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's a piece of the berlin wall in the embassy courtyard but the architects who designed it , from the california firm of moore ruble yudell , have drawn poor reviews , with many critics dismissing the structure as an example of outmoded 1980s postmodernism .
the city of berlin and the us state department also squabbled for years because us security requirements , put in place before and after 9/11 , forced the narrowing and diversion of streets to ensure that cars did not get to close to the building .
many berliners feared that the new embassy would create traffic jams , and a few even suggested that us diplomats should pack up and move out of the city center to avoid inconveniencing residents .
ironically , the building that was meant to embody the west 's triumph over communism ended up being caught in debates about how much security was needed vis-a-vis threats from those who do n't like america or its role in the world .
" we could have built an embassy out in the woods at half the cost and twice the security , " us ambassador to germany william r. timken told reporters in early 2008 , as the new embassy was nearing completion .

when reunified germany moved its capital from bonn to berlin in 1990 , the us was forced to use its former embassy to communist east germany , situated on a narrow side street near the brandenburg gate , as its formal diplomatic headquarters in germany .
the street had to be completely cordoned off with metal fencing and concrete pollards , yielding a spectacle reminiscent of checkpoint charlie at the height of the cold war - or belfast , northern ireland during the troubles .

dw-world.de sent jefferson chase to check out the much-maligned new us embassy in berlin . for some reason , i found myself humming merle haggard 's " okie from muskogee " as i cycled up to the back entrance .
perhaps i was nervous .
after all i was bringing a camera and dictaphone into what was sure to be a high-security area .
two days ahead of the opening ceremony , workers were indeed already shifting security fences around the site near berlin 's brandenburg gate .
but the fencing , a local policewoman informed me , was largely being carted off from the fan mile of the euro 2008 soccer championship .
nor did the two american guards at the entrance seem particularly uptight , although they asked only be identified as " john " and " tom , " and said it was against regulations to photograph them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pre-world war ii embassy had more grandeur " i guess it 's to protect us from a ' terrorist ' coming up and killing us on the street , " said " tom , " making ironic air quotation marks and adding a humorous expletive to make it clear he did n't feel his job was particularly endangering his life .
" we 're looking forward to it , " added " john , " referring to the embassy 's official opening ceremony on friday , july 4th .
" everybody 's just going to have a big party . "
it was a surprisingly low-key atmosphere ahead of the public premiere of a building that has been the center of an unusual amount of squabbling .
back to the future the new building occupies the same spot on pariser platz , the square in front of the brandenburg gate , as the pre-world war ii us embassy to germany .
it is located in the formerly communist eastern part of the city , a stone 's throw from the site of ronald reagan 's famous " mr. gorbachev , tear down this wall " speech of 1987 .
thus , the new embassy can be seen as a symbol of america 's victories in both world war ii and the cold war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's a piece of the berlin wall in the embassy courtyard but the architects who designed it , from the california firm of moore ruble yudell , have drawn poor reviews , with many critics dismissing the structure as an example of outmoded 1980s postmodernism .
the city of berlin and the us state department also squabbled for years because us security requirements , put in place before and after 9/11 , forced the narrowing and diversion of streets to ensure that cars did not get to close to the building .
many berliners feared that the new embassy would create traffic jams , and a few even suggested that us diplomats should pack up and move out of the city center to avoid inconveniencing residents .
ironically , the building that was meant to embody the west 's triumph over communism ended up being caught in debates about how much security was needed vis-a-vis threats from those who do n't like america or its role in the world .
" we could have built an embassy out in the woods at half the cost and twice the security , " us ambassador to germany william r. timken told reporters in early 2008 , as the new embassy was nearing completion .
" we are here as a symbol of our desire to be a partner to germany . "

but the future of germany 's elbe river valley is still uncertain . panel president christina cameron of canada said on wednesday , july 2 , that the protection of extraordinary cultural accomplishments and natural phenomenon was an important contribution to sustaining communities and preserving quality of life . she was speaking in quebec , a world heritage site that is celebrating its 400th anniversary as the oldest european settlement in north america .
canada is chair of the current 21-country committee that also includes bahrain , brazil , cuba , china and the united states . " world heritage sites , which are protected and shared with others , can promote our understanding of the diversity of cultures and ecological systems , " she said . during the nine-day gathering , the un organization will consider applications for new designations in 41 countries , and discuss heritage sites that have lost their luster through negligence , lack of funds or natural disaster . committee to debate dresden the focus of debate as early as friday will be one of germany 's most historic and scenic areas of 18th and 19th century significance , the dresden elbe valley . german authorities had decided to build a bridge in the heart of the well-known landscape against the advice of unesco , which urged a tunnel .
warnings were issued about the site 's status in 2006 after the decision to build the bridge was taken . no site has ever been delisted from the program .
in all , 30 of 851 world heritage sites are considered endangered . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thailand has withdrawn support for cambodia 's preah vihear temple two countries claim historic temple cambodia is seeking designation for a millennial temple , preah vihear , dedicated to the hindu god shiva , but thailand is challenging the move .
a 1962 world court ruling awarded the temple to cambodia , but part of the land it sits on belongs to thailand , where some people argue for a two-county heritage listing of site . thailand tuesday formally withdrew its support for cambodia 's designation , in keeping with an administrative court order made over the weekend .
it is unclear whether the government change in stance on the listing will derail cambodia 's proposal . the temple is perched on a mountain range that defines the thai-cambodian border . dozens vie for heritage designation among other applicants are five countries seeking their first sites on the unesco list - saudi arabia , kyrgyzstan , papua new guinea , san marino and vanuatu . among eastern european countries , albania , croatia , czech republic , bulgaria , the russian federation and slovakia are applying for recognition of special sites , and hungary and slovakia have a joint application for designation of a network of fortifications where the danube and vah rivers converge in komarno . in the middle east , applicants include yemen for its socotra archipelago ; saudi arabia for archaeological site al-hijr ; iran for the armenian monastic ensembles in its azerbaijan province ; and israel for the triple-arch gate at dan and the bahai holy places in haifa and western galilee . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i find the mood is good , there 's no posturing , no-one 's playing games , but at the same time we are dealing with a question that 's tough , there are very tough things here , " borloo told reporters .
" to put things in perspective , the economies of 27 countries with a variety of backgrounds in energy and industry are being asked to make a somewhat radical shift using everyday budgets , " he said .

agreement lacking on co2 level details the eu is struggling to agree on the details of its plan to reduce the 27-nation bloc 's greenhouse-gas pollution by 20 percent by 2020 compared with the benchmark year 1990 .
they promised to deepen this to 30 percent if another industrialized power followed suit .
they also pledged to boost the share of renewables in the eu energy mix to 20 percent , including a 10-percent share for biofuels .
however , agreement on these broad goals has become a touchy and complex issue in light of the surge in oil and gas prices .

other thorny areas include the future allocation of emissions quotas by industry under the eu 's carbon market and measures to curb pollution by the transport sector .
borloo hopes to wrap up the deal on the climate and energy package by year 's end , so that the eu is in a position to wield clout at the un talks in poznan , poland , in december that will shape a worldwide pact on tackling climate change beyond 2012 , when the current provisions of the kyoto protocol expire .

" the negotiations have not ended - another round of talks was concluded - for the time being we are not at the finish line , " klich told poland 's private radio zet .
" we completed an important , a significant , round of talks two days ago but the finish line of talks is still ahead of us , " he said , adding that " july is a long month . "
daniel fried , the assistant secretary of state for european and eurasian affairs and a former ambassador to poland , told reporters that the last round of talks between the us and poland had made real progress but refused to confirm that an agreement had been reached .
the united states wants to base 10 interceptor missiles on the territory of the ex-communist nato member and a radar facility in the neighboring czech republic to ward off potential attacks by so-called " rogue " states , notably iran .
a deal under which the czech republic would house the missile shield 's radar base was concluded in april .
lithuania alternative seen as a bargaining chip bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the czech republic will host radar systems the proposed missile shield system has angered russia , which fears it may actually be one of the countries in the cross-hairs , while public opinion in poland and the czech republic is broadly opposed to the defensive system .
talks between poland and the united states over the missile shield began in may last year but after initial progress the negotiations have dragged over poland 's demands for substantial us aid to modernize its armed forces in return for its cooperation .
the impasse has allegedly led the us to consider poland 's northern neighbor lithuania but bogdan klich said such reports were simply pressure tactics during the negotiations with poland .
" in my opinion this was a pressure tactic used by the us on poland and it would not at all be so easy for the americans to locate the missile shield in lithuania ... because of stronger protests by russia against this location instead of poland , " klich said .
" the americans are endeavoring to maintain good relations with russia . "
senior officials in lithuania , like poland a member of the european union and nato , have flatly denied talks were underway with washington . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel 's stance was echoed by germany 's health minister ulla schmidt .
" i reject this path categorically , " she said .
" the correct path is to offer assistance to those who are dying instead of helping those free from terminal illness to commit suicide . "
the debate was prompted by the revelation this week that a 79-year-old wurzburg woman chose to end her own life on saturday despite not having any life-threatening diseases or suffering great physical pain .
what added an extra angle to the story was that former hamburg justice senator roger kusch , a proponent for the right to die , advised her of the best way to do it .
" i was in her apartment at 11:00 am , " kusch explained at a press conference he called on monday to discuss the assisted suicide .
" at around 11:30 , she began to prepare three glasses - one with the sedative diazepam , one with a mixture of the anti-malaria drug chloroquine and one with a sweet syrup , because the other substances can cause nausea .
she drank the glass with the deadly chloroquine quickly .
her last words were ' auf wiedersehen . ' … then i left . "

" i am for self-determination until the final breath , " he says .
he also showed the press conference clips from a nine-hour video he made documenting his relationship to the pensioner , identified only as bettina s. kusch made headlines earlier this year when he presented to the media a " suicide machine " patients could use to inject themselves with a deadly cocktail .
the case has prompted fresh calls in germany for stronger regulations and laws regarding assisted suicide .
merkel 's conservatives in favor of prison sentences merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- party wants to introduce a bill in cdu controlled states that would make the involvement in an assisted suicide a new criminal offense which carries a prison term of up to three years for the commercial or otherwise organized offering of suicide assistance .
the cdu is expected to put the bill to the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , on friday .
however , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , the cdu 's coalition partner in government , have their own ideas .
the spd would like to pass a law requiring doctors to obey patients ' wishes as expressed in " living wills . "
the spd claims to have wide support for the idea from other political factions .

merkel 's stance was echoed by germany 's health minister ulla schmidt .
" i reject this path categorically , " she said .
" the correct path is to offer assistance to those who are dying instead of helping those free from terminal illness to commit suicide . "
the debate was prompted by the revelation this week that a 79-year-old wurzburg woman chose to end her own life on saturday despite not having any life-threatening diseases or suffering great physical pain .
what added an extra angle to the story was that former hamburg justice senator roger kusch , a proponent for the right to die , advised her of the best way to do it .
" i was in her apartment at 11:00 am , " kusch explained at a press conference he called on monday to discuss the assisted suicide .
" at around 11:30 , she began to prepare three glasses - one with the sedative diazepam , one with a mixture of the anti-malaria drug chloroquine and one with a sweet syrup , because the other substances can cause nausea .
she drank the glass with the deadly chloroquine quickly .
her last words were ' auf wiedersehen . ' … then i left . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kusch educated the pensioner on the best way to die kusch then said that he vacated the apartment for three hours so as not to be present at the moment of death .
when he returned , he said , she was lying dead on her bed .
" i am for self-determination until the final breath , " he says .
he also showed the press conference clips from a nine-hour video he made documenting his relationship to the pensioner , identified only as bettina s. kusch made headlines earlier this year when he presented to the media a " suicide machine " patients could use to inject themselves with a deadly cocktail .
the case has prompted fresh calls in germany for stronger regulations and laws regarding assisted suicide .
merkel 's conservatives in favor of prison sentences merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- party wants to introduce a bill in cdu controlled states that would make the involvement in an assisted suicide a new criminal offense which carries a prison term of up to three years for the commercial or otherwise organized offering of suicide assistance .
the cdu is expected to put the bill to the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , on friday .
however , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , the cdu 's coalition partner in government , have their own ideas .
the spd would like to pass a law requiring doctors to obey patients ' wishes as expressed in " living wills . "
the spd claims to have wide support for the idea from other political factions .
but the cdu argues that such a law would presuppose that patients completely understand all of the implications of a living will - an assumption that , given the complexity of medical care , the patient can not possibly make .

" i find the mood is good , there 's no posturing , no-one 's playing games , but at the same time we are dealing with a question that 's tough , there are very tough things here , " borloo told reporters .
" to put things in perspective , the economies of 27 countries with a variety of backgrounds in energy and industry are being asked to make a somewhat radical shift using everyday budgets , " he said .
" at the moment , no other region in the world is attempting something on this scale . "
agreement lacking on co2 level details the eu is struggling to agree on the details of its plan to reduce the 27-nation bloc 's greenhouse-gas pollution by 20 percent by 2020 compared with the benchmark year 1990 .
they promised to deepen this to 30 percent if another industrialized power followed suit .
they also pledged to boost the share of renewables in the eu energy mix to 20 percent , including a 10-percent share for biofuels .
however , agreement on these broad goals has become a touchy and complex issue in light of the surge in oil and gas prices .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to lead the fight against global emissions several countries dependent on coal , russian gas and soviet-era nuclear plants are pleading for get-outs or easier terms , and the role of biofuels has come under attack for its impact on global food prices .
other thorny areas include the future allocation of emissions quotas by industry under the eu 's carbon market and measures to curb pollution by the transport sector .
borloo hopes to wrap up the deal on the climate and energy package by year 's end , so that the eu is in a position to wield clout at the un talks in poznan , poland , in december that will shape a worldwide pact on tackling climate change beyond 2012 , when the current provisions of the kyoto protocol expire .
the meeting , taking place at the saint-cloud chateau on the western outskirts of paris , finishes friday .
it will be followed by an informal meeting of eu energy ministers on friday and saturday . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the negotiations have not ended - another round of talks was concluded - for the time being we are not at the finish line , " klich told poland 's private radio zet .

daniel fried , the assistant secretary of state for european and eurasian affairs and a former ambassador to poland , told reporters that the last round of talks between the us and poland had made real progress but refused to confirm that an agreement had been reached .
the united states wants to base 10 interceptor missiles on the territory of the ex-communist nato member and a radar facility in the neighboring czech republic to ward off potential attacks by so-called " rogue " states , notably iran .

the impasse has allegedly led the us to consider poland 's northern neighbor lithuania but bogdan klich said such reports were simply pressure tactics during the negotiations with poland .
" in my opinion this was a pressure tactic used by the us on poland and it would not at all be so easy for the americans to locate the missile shield in lithuania ... because of stronger protests by russia against this location instead of poland , " klich said .

" the negotiations have not ended - another round of talks was concluded - for the time being we are not at the finish line , " klich told poland 's private radio zet .

steinbrueck 's view was echoed by spanish prime minster jose luis rodriguez zapatero . " now , it has to have a certain flexibility , especially as european inflation comes essentially from the price of oil and food , not from an excess of internal demand , " zapatero said in an interview with daily el pais . the ecb rate hike and the growing global economic uncertainty also comes as part of the build-up to this month 's summit in japan of the group of eight leading industrial nations where the troubled state of the world economy could dominate proceedings . also on thursday sweden 's central bank , the riksbank , announced that it was joining the push to higher rates by lifting its benchmark repo rate by 25 basis points to 4.5 percent . this came in the wake of data showing annual inflation in sweden climbing to 4 percent in may to hit its highest rate in more than 14 years . adding to the growing worries about the economic risks posed by inflation , figures released on thursday showed consumer prices in switzerland jumping to a 15-year high of 2.9 percent in june , consequently increasing the pressure on the swiss national bank . inflation peaks in euro zone euro zone inflation also shot up to a 16-year high of 4 percent in june , preliminary data announced this week showed .
inflation in the currency bloc is now double the ecb 's target of " close to , but just below 2 percent . " trichet surprised markets last month by signalling that a rate hike could be in the pipeline , saying in his regular press briefing that the bank 's governing council was in a state of " heightened alertness " about the risks posed by inflation . in the meantime , ecb figures released last week pointed to a sustained rise in the amount of money in circulation in the euro zone with the so-called m3 money supply chalking up a 10.5-percent annual rate in may .

colombian journalists have been invited to the scene of the rescue by defence minister santos , and i 'm sure that we 'll soon see images on screens everywhere .
the last pictures of ingrid betancourt were very depressing ; we heard from a fellow hostage that she was suffering from depression and various diseases , and she looked very thin . was the rescue expected ?
why did it happen now ? i think the rescue was expected .
as we know , in the last few weeks and months , farc suffered a series of blows and has been broken down into different factions which were n't able to move about within the country .
that 's a huge hindrance if you have a large number of hostages .
aside from the 15 hostages that have been freed , there are 42 other political hostages and several hundred more colombians being held by farc - that 's a significant burden for a guerrilla force that is in crisis .
it probably was n't possible for farc to move the hostages quickly or hide their tracks from the army .
i think that 's why the location of the hostages was known , and government agents were able to observe the hostages for a longer time . how long do you think it will take for the other hostages to be freed ? i think we can be fairly certain that the locations of many of the other hostages are known .
it 's a question of time before more will be freed , less so through military operations and more so due to traitors .
the blow delivered to farc by the release of these 15 hostages could cause many farc rebels to start thinking about whether they want to cooperate with the authorities .
there 's been a string of prominent desertions in recent weeks , and there 's been an erosion in farc 's ranks that could lead to more hostages being released . could the release of betancourt also be seen as an offer on the part of farc leader alfonso cano to the uribe government ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : betancourt , right , seen here with her mother , was farc 's trump card no .
if this were the case , farc would have handled it more intelligently , and not allowed the government any opportunity to present it as a rescue situation .
currently , we only have the government 's version of events , as well as the pictures and other evidence that point to it actually having been a rescue .
farc 's political head , alfonso cano , would have used his trump card - namely betancourt and the three american hostages - differently - at the start of peace talks for instance , so that he would have had something in his hand against the government .
now , farc has very little . is president 's uribe 's political strategy on farc paying off ? the last few months , but today especially , mark the biggest success uribe has had in achieving security in colombia .
his tough stance against the guerillas is paying off , as are the increasing incentives being offered to ex-rebels by the government .
it started with the disarmament of the paramilitaries in 2005 , but there have been increasing incentives for guerrillas to turn themselves in .
the military strategy is being coupled with a strategy for peace and post-conflict management in the regions that have been liberated .
it 's a big success for the uribe administration , and also explains his huge approval ratings of over 80 percent . do you think we are seeing the beginning of the end of farc and decades of internal conflict in colombia ? we 've entered a new era in terms of the conflict in colombia .
we no longer have the trio of typical actors , namely paramilitary , guerrilla and weak state .
rather , we have a state that is not just strong militarily , but that also enjoys popular support while , on the other side , we have illegal groups , or terrorists , as they 're now referred to .
then there are remnants of the old conflict , and among these is farc , or what remains of farc .
it could be that in the months or years to come , we 'll have a scenario where farc consists of just a few hundred fighters that are n't really relevant anymore , but that 's the optimistic variation .
the more cautious scenario is one where cano succeeds in reviving farc elements in colombian cities .
still , farc is n't the number one problem anymore and this latest blow causes one to wonder whether farc can still be referred to as a guerrilla force or rather just a criminal group .
but i think it 's premature to speak of an end to the conflict . claudia herrera pahl interviewed carsten wieland -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

colombian journalists have been invited to the scene of the rescue by defence minister santos , and i 'm sure that we 'll soon see images on screens everywhere .
the last pictures of ingrid betancourt were very depressing ; we heard from a fellow hostage that she was suffering from depression and various diseases , and she looked very thin . was the rescue expected ?
why did it happen now ? i think the rescue was expected .
as we know , in the last few weeks and months , farc suffered a series of blows and has been broken down into different factions which were n't able to move about within the country .
that 's a huge hindrance if you have a large number of hostages .
aside from the 15 hostages that have been freed , there are 42 other political hostages and several hundred more colombians being held by farc - that 's a significant burden for a guerrilla force that is in crisis .
it probably was n't possible for farc to move the hostages quickly or hide their tracks from the army .
i think that 's why the location of the hostages was known , and government agents were able to observe the hostages for a longer time . how long do you think it will take for the other hostages to be freed ? i think we can be fairly certain that the locations of many of the other hostages are known .
it 's a question of time before more will be freed , less so through military operations and more so due to traitors .
the blow delivered to farc by the release of these 15 hostages could cause many farc rebels to start thinking about whether they want to cooperate with the authorities .
there 's been a string of prominent desertions in recent weeks , and there 's been an erosion in farc 's ranks that could lead to more hostages being released . could the release of betancourt also be seen as an offer on the part of farc leader alfonso cano to the uribe government ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : betancourt , right , seen here with her mother , was farc 's trump card no .

dw-world.de sent jefferson chase to check out the much-maligned new us embassy in berlin . for some reason , i found myself humming merle haggard 's " okie from muskogee " as i cycled up to the back entrance .
perhaps i was nervous .
after all i was bringing a camera and dictaphone into what was sure to be a high-security area .
two days ahead of the opening ceremony , workers were indeed already shifting security fences around the site near berlin 's brandenburg gate .
but the fencing , a local policewoman informed me , was largely being carted off from the fan mile of the euro 2008 soccer championship .
nor did the two american guards at the entrance seem particularly uptight , although they asked only be identified as " john " and " tom , " and said it was against regulations to photograph them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pre-world war ii embassy had more grandeur " i guess it 's to protect us from a ' terrorist ' coming up and killing us on the street , " said " tom , " making ironic air quotation marks and adding a humorous expletive to make it clear he did n't feel his job was particularly endangering his life .
" we 're looking forward to it , " added " john , " referring to the embassy 's official opening ceremony on friday , july 4th .
" everybody 's just going to have a big party . "
it was a surprisingly low-key atmosphere ahead of the public premiere of a building that has been the center of an unusual amount of squabbling .
back to the future the new building occupies the same spot on pariser platz , the square in front of the brandenburg gate , as the pre-world war ii us embassy to germany .
it is located in the formerly communist eastern part of the city , a stone 's throw from the site of ronald reagan 's famous " mr. gorbachev , tear down this wall " speech of 1987 .
thus , the new embassy can be seen as a symbol of america 's victories in both world war ii and the cold war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's a piece of the berlin wall in the embassy courtyard but the architects who designed it , from the california firm of moore ruble yudell , have drawn poor reviews , with many critics dismissing the structure as an example of outmoded 1980s postmodernism .
the city of berlin and the us state department also squabbled for years because us security requirements , put in place before and after 9/11 , forced the narrowing and diversion of streets to ensure that cars did not get to close to the building .
many berliners feared that the new embassy would create traffic jams , and a few even suggested that us diplomats should pack up and move out of the city center to avoid inconveniencing residents .
ironically , the building that was meant to embody the west 's triumph over communism ended up being caught in debates about how much security was needed vis-a-vis threats from those who do n't like america or its role in the world .
" we could have built an embassy out in the woods at half the cost and twice the security , " us ambassador to germany william r. timken told reporters in early 2008 , as the new embassy was nearing completion .
" we are here as a symbol of our desire to be a partner to germany . "
end of an eyesore bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists were already trying to get a peep at the building on wednesday , july 2 whatever the new building 's architectural shortcomings , its inauguration means that the fortifications surrounding its predecessor can be removed .
when reunified germany moved its capital from bonn to berlin in 1990 , the us was forced to use its former embassy to communist east germany , situated on a narrow side street near the brandenburg gate , as its formal diplomatic headquarters in germany .
the street had to be completely cordoned off with metal fencing and concrete pollards , yielding a spectacle reminiscent of checkpoint charlie at the height of the cold war - or belfast , northern ireland during the troubles .
as people geared up for the official launch of the new embassy , policemen in construction helmets were busy dismantling the fortifications around the old one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thankfully , the previous us embassy is history the street will be reopened to traffic , meaning that , if anything , the area around pariser platz may become a bit less congested .
expat opinion divided and what do the 12,500 us citizens who reside in the german capital think of their diplomats ' new home ?
being americans , they disagree .
" i think it 's misguided , embarrassing and ugly , " said todd cameron , an art gallery assistant who works not too far from pariser platz .
others feel that more sensitivity could have been shown toward residents ' concerns .
" i though it was a typical us thing to do , to just go ahead and build an embassy and make others move , " said brian landry , a cook at a local restaurant .
" they also would n't let me in when i tried to go have a look . "
but on the blogs , most americans seemed to think the new building was basically all right .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stands from the euro 2008 fan mile still had to be cleared " i think it looks fine , " wrote one user of a forum for american ex-pats in berlin .
" it also seems to be a design that wo n't look utterly ridiculous in 30 years , unlike some new construction . "
guests invited to the opening ceremonies on july 4th , including german chancellor angela merkel , will get a chance to inspect at closer range an embassy that once had some people up in arms , and now seems like little more than just another big building .
maybe they 'll even play some merle haggard . jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de sent jefferson chase to check out the much-maligned new us embassy in berlin . for some reason , i found myself humming merle haggard 's " okie from muskogee " as i cycled up to the back entrance .
perhaps i was nervous .
after all i was bringing a camera and dictaphone into what was sure to be a high-security area .
two days ahead of the opening ceremony , workers were indeed already shifting security fences around the site near berlin 's brandenburg gate .
but the fencing , a local policewoman informed me , was largely being carted off from the fan mile of the euro 2008 soccer championship .
nor did the two american guards at the entrance seem particularly uptight , although they asked only be identified as " john " and " tom , " and said it was against regulations to photograph them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pre-world war ii embassy had more grandeur " i guess it 's to protect us from a ' terrorist ' coming up and killing us on the street , " said " tom , " making ironic air quotation marks and adding a humorous expletive to make it clear he did n't feel his job was particularly endangering his life .
" we 're looking forward to it , " added " john , " referring to the embassy 's official opening ceremony on friday , july 4th .
" everybody 's just going to have a big party . "
it was a surprisingly low-key atmosphere ahead of the public premiere of a building that has been the center of an unusual amount of squabbling .
back to the future the new building occupies the same spot on pariser platz , the square in front of the brandenburg gate , as the pre-world war ii us embassy to germany .
it is located in the formerly communist eastern part of the city , a stone 's throw from the site of ronald reagan 's famous " mr. gorbachev , tear down this wall " speech of 1987 .
thus , the new embassy can be seen as a symbol of america 's victories in both world war ii and the cold war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's a piece of the berlin wall in the embassy courtyard but the architects who designed it , from the california firm of moore ruble yudell , have drawn poor reviews , with many critics dismissing the structure as an example of outmoded 1980s postmodernism .
the city of berlin and the us state department also squabbled for years because us security requirements , put in place before and after 9/11 , forced the narrowing and diversion of streets to ensure that cars did not get to close to the building .
many berliners feared that the new embassy would create traffic jams , and a few even suggested that us diplomats should pack up and move out of the city center to avoid inconveniencing residents .
ironically , the building that was meant to embody the west 's triumph over communism ended up being caught in debates about how much security was needed vis-a-vis threats from those who do n't like america or its role in the world .
" we could have built an embassy out in the woods at half the cost and twice the security , " us ambassador to germany william r. timken told reporters in early 2008 , as the new embassy was nearing completion .
" we are here as a symbol of our desire to be a partner to germany . "
end of an eyesore bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists were already trying to get a peep at the building on wednesday , july 2 whatever the new building 's architectural shortcomings , its inauguration means that the fortifications surrounding its predecessor can be removed .
when reunified germany moved its capital from bonn to berlin in 1990 , the us was forced to use its former embassy to communist east germany , situated on a narrow side street near the brandenburg gate , as its formal diplomatic headquarters in germany .
the street had to be completely cordoned off with metal fencing and concrete pollards , yielding a spectacle reminiscent of checkpoint charlie at the height of the cold war - or belfast , northern ireland during the troubles .
as people geared up for the official launch of the new embassy , policemen in construction helmets were busy dismantling the fortifications around the old one .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thankfully , the previous us embassy is history the street will be reopened to traffic , meaning that , if anything , the area around pariser platz may become a bit less congested .
expat opinion divided and what do the 12,500 us citizens who reside in the german capital think of their diplomats ' new home ?
being americans , they disagree .
" i think it 's misguided , embarrassing and ugly , " said todd cameron , an art gallery assistant who works not too far from pariser platz .
others feel that more sensitivity could have been shown toward residents ' concerns .
" i though it was a typical us thing to do , to just go ahead and build an embassy and make others move , " said brian landry , a cook at a local restaurant .
" they also would n't let me in when i tried to go have a look . "
but on the blogs , most americans seemed to think the new building was basically all right .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stands from the euro 2008 fan mile still had to be cleared " i think it looks fine , " wrote one user of a forum for american ex-pats in berlin .
" it also seems to be a design that wo n't look utterly ridiculous in 30 years , unlike some new construction . "
guests invited to the opening ceremonies on july 4th , including german chancellor angela merkel , will get a chance to inspect at closer range an embassy that once had some people up in arms , and now seems like little more than just another big building .

the street had to be completely cordoned off with metal fencing and concrete pollards , yielding a spectacle reminiscent of checkpoint charlie at the height of the cold war - or belfast , northern ireland during the troubles .

dw-world.de sent jefferson chase to check out the much-maligned new us embassy in berlin . for some reason , i found myself humming merle haggard 's " okie from muskogee " as i cycled up to the back entrance .
perhaps i was nervous .
after all i was bringing a camera and dictaphone into what was sure to be a high-security area .
two days ahead of the opening ceremony , workers were indeed already shifting security fences around the site near berlin 's brandenburg gate .
but the fencing , a local policewoman informed me , was largely being carted off from the fan mile of the euro 2008 soccer championship .
nor did the two american guards at the entrance seem particularly uptight , although they asked only be identified as " john " and " tom , " and said it was against regulations to photograph them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pre-world war ii embassy had more grandeur " i guess it 's to protect us from a ' terrorist ' coming up and killing us on the street , " said " tom , " making ironic air quotation marks and adding a humorous expletive to make it clear he did n't feel his job was particularly endangering his life .
" we 're looking forward to it , " added " john , " referring to the embassy 's official opening ceremony on friday , july 4th .
" everybody 's just going to have a big party . "
it was a surprisingly low-key atmosphere ahead of the public premiere of a building that has been the center of an unusual amount of squabbling .
back to the future the new building occupies the same spot on pariser platz , the square in front of the brandenburg gate , as the pre-world war ii us embassy to germany .
it is located in the formerly communist eastern part of the city , a stone 's throw from the site of ronald reagan 's famous " mr. gorbachev , tear down this wall " speech of 1987 .
thus , the new embassy can be seen as a symbol of america 's victories in both world war ii and the cold war .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's a piece of the berlin wall in the embassy courtyard but the architects who designed it , from the california firm of moore ruble yudell , have drawn poor reviews , with many critics dismissing the structure as an example of outmoded 1980s postmodernism .
the city of berlin and the us state department also squabbled for years because us security requirements , put in place before and after 9/11 , forced the narrowing and diversion of streets to ensure that cars did not get to close to the building .
many berliners feared that the new embassy would create traffic jams , and a few even suggested that us diplomats should pack up and move out of the city center to avoid inconveniencing residents .
ironically , the building that was meant to embody the west 's triumph over communism ended up being caught in debates about how much security was needed vis-a-vis threats from those who do n't like america or its role in the world .
" we could have built an embassy out in the woods at half the cost and twice the security , " us ambassador to germany william r. timken told reporters in early 2008 , as the new embassy was nearing completion .
" we are here as a symbol of our desire to be a partner to germany . "

the house of commons public accounts committee has accused the pathfinder scheme of threatening the historical character of some local areas .
pathfinder was launched in 2002 to revive the housing market in depressed areas of england .
a government spokesman said it had made " a huge difference " to communities .
pathfinder was created because economic decline and lack of investment had left thousands of dilapidated homes almost impossible to sell or let - resulting in entire streets of empty properties .
more than £ 2bn has been invested , either renovating homes to attract new buyers or demolishing and rebuilding . "
it does not help where demolition plans threaten the distinctive historical character of neighbourhoods " edward leigh , house of commons public accounts committee pathfinder projects were set up in newcastle and gateshead ; hull and east yorkshire ; south yorkshire ; birmingham ; north staffordshire ; manchester ; merseyside ; oldham and rochdale ; and east lancashire .
the schemes refurbished 40,000 properties and demolished 10,000 , building 1,000 new homes , the report found .
but mp said where houses have been knocked down - sometimes against the wishes of local people - not enough have been rebuilt .
the committee also claims waiting lists for affordable accommodation in some areas have doubled .
committee chairman edward leigh said the programme had been " more successful at demolishing old homes than at building new ones " .
he added : " the department for communities and local government must work to foster confidence among local residents , especially where the programme has led to community stress .
" it does not help where demolition plans threaten the distinctive historical character of neighbourhoods .
" the desire of those who wish to continue living in their areas should not be disregarded .
ways need to be found of helping existing residents bridge the gap between the compensation they receive under a compulsory purchase order and the cost of another local property . "
' huge difference ' mr leigh added that , five years into the programme , it was " difficult to tell whether pathfinder interventions are having any more effect on local housing demand than the normal operation of the market " . "
it is completely wrong to suggest pathfinders have only succeeded in demolishing homes when four times as many houses have been refurbished " department for communities and local government the government insists the scheme has helped bring people back to previously run down areas and points to the number of homes that have been renovated - four times more than have been demolished .
a spokesman for the department for communities and local government said : " the pathfinders programme has made a huge difference transforming local communities in desperate need of regeneration .
" almost 50,000 homes have been refurbished , they have closed the gap in house prices , and people are now returning to live in these areas .

pathfinder was launched in 2002 to revive the housing market in depressed areas of england .
a government spokesman said it had made " a huge difference " to communities .
pathfinder was created because economic decline and lack of investment had left thousands of dilapidated homes almost impossible to sell or let - resulting in entire streets of empty properties .

the house of commons public accounts committee has accused the pathfinder scheme of threatening the historical character of some local areas .
pathfinder was launched in 2002 to revive the housing market in depressed areas of england .
a government spokesman said it had made " a huge difference " to communities .
pathfinder was created because economic decline and lack of investment had left thousands of dilapidated homes almost impossible to sell or let - resulting in entire streets of empty properties .
more than £ 2bn has been invested , either renovating homes to attract new buyers or demolishing and rebuilding .
it does not help where demolition plans threaten the distinctive historical character of neighbourhoods edward leigh , house of commons public accounts committee pathfinder projects were set up in newcastle and gateshead ; hull and east yorkshire ; south yorkshire ; birmingham ; north staffordshire ; manchester ; merseyside ; oldham and rochdale ; and east lancashire .
the schemes refurbished 40,000 properties and demolished 10,000 , building 1,000 new homes , the report found .
but mp said where houses have been knocked down - sometimes against the wishes of local people - not enough have been rebuilt .
the committee also claims waiting lists for affordable accommodation in some areas have doubled .
committee chairman edward leigh said the programme had been " more successful at demolishing old homes than at building new ones " .
he added : " the department for communities and local government must work to foster confidence among local residents , especially where the programme has led to community stress .

" the desire of those who wish to continue living in their areas should not be disregarded .
ways need to be found of helping existing residents bridge the gap between the compensation they receive under a compulsory purchase order and the cost of another local property . "
' huge difference ' mr leigh added that , five years into the programme , it was " difficult to tell whether pathfinder interventions are having any more effect on local housing demand than the normal operation of the market " .
it is completely wrong to suggest pathfinders have only succeeded in demolishing homes when four times as many houses have been refurbished department for communities and local government the government insists the scheme has helped bring people back to previously run down areas and points to the number of homes that have been renovated - four times more than have been demolished .
a spokesman for the department for communities and local government said : " the pathfinders programme has made a huge difference transforming local communities in desperate need of regeneration .
" almost 50,000 homes have been refurbished , they have closed the gap in house prices , and people are now returning to live in these areas .
" it is completely wrong to suggest pathfinders have only succeeded in demolishing homes when four times as many houses have been refurbished through this programme .

the initiative has dealt a mortal blow to the left-wing guerrillas ' plans to secure the release of hundreds of rebels in prison .
" thank you to the army , from my country of colombia , thank you for your impeccable operation , " said ingrid betancourt , the most famous of the hostages in guerrilla hands , as she landed in the capital bogota to be greeted by her mother and husband .
" the operation was perfect . "
not a shot was fired by the colombian security forces as they managed to free the most closely-protected hostages , guarded by the cream of farc rebels .

" i did not realise what was going on until ' cesar ' was tied up on the floor , naked and one of the men said : ' we are from the army and you are free , " ' said ms betancourt as she described the rescue mission .
farc have now lost , in one fell swoop , all the trump cards for their negotiations for a prisoner exchange and their principal diplomatic weapon to force the government into making concessions .
president alvaro uribe , who has always refused to grant the guerrillas their precondition for talks , a large demilitarised zone in the south-west of the country , now has no reason to cede anything .
farc in disarray the international pressure which he endured , principally from presidents nicolas sarkozy of france and hugo chavez of venezuela , is likely to melt away .
the rescue also vindicates his tough policy against the guerrillas who killed his father , and it will allow him to continue unhindered in his plans to defeat farc militarily and force them to the negotiating table .
this latest incident shows , yet again , that farc are in disarray , reeling after a series of blows .
in march this year one of their top commanders , " raul reyes " was killed when the colombian air force bombed a rebel camp within ecuador , sparking an international row that has still not been resolved .
a week later another leader , " ivan rios " , was murdered by one of his bodyguards , who collected the bounty offered by the government .
then the most serious of all , the death from a heart attack of farc 's 78-year-old founder and leader , " manuel marulanda " .

the nascent nhs had been recently established and gloria was sure it would provide an ideal setting for her to pick up valuable experience .
the war years had left a shortage of workers and she was confident that an immigrant worker like herself could expect a warm welcome .
so after a little prompting from her mother the 20-year-old would-be nurse set her sights on gloucester royal infirmary . "

" nearly all my teachers were from england and once in a geography lesson a teacher had mentioned gloucester and i liked the sound of that .
so i applied and was accepted . "
cold climate on a very cold day in march 1953 gloria arrived at the albert dock , london , after travelling in a ship bringing over caribbean workers like herself alongside returning uk soldiers .

her first impression was of the intense cold - so very different from jamaica .
" but i was so anxious to see the snow .
i was on night duty when it finally snowed , " she said .
gloria , now 76 , recalls she spent a while in london watching the preparations for the imminent coronation of elizabeth before setting off for gloucester .
" at that time my late uncle lived in london and i was naughty really because i thought i would like to see a little bit of london so i stopped off to see the preparations , " she said .
" then i went to contact the matron and i was told off by the matron . "
when gloria arrived at the hospital she found a very warm welcome and encountered no racism .

" i remember one occasion when i was the ward sister a relative said she would like to see the sister and when i said it was me i could tell she was a little put out .
" i thought the nhs was good , but i did not really know any different to be honest .

the intention had been for her to then go back to jamaica and nurse there , but she met her husband beresford and they had a child .
" i actually qualified in 1958 because i had to go back after my first baby and complete my training , " she said .
" my dear mother thought i would qualify and then return , but i met my husband and stayed .
i had intended to do that and go and work in jamaica . "
gloria loved the nhs so much that she stayed in it until she retired as a nurse manager in 1992 .
" things have changed so much in the nhs since i started , " she said .
" nowadays people are living longer and healthier lives it is more about preventing people becoming ill now , rather than just cures .
" treatments today are much better and hospital stays are so much shorter and there is so much day surgery .
" the nhs is improving all the time we have gone along a long road - but we still have a long way to go .
" i have so many happy memories of my time in the nhs and thinking about the anniversary has given me a chance to remember the wonderful people and times . "

advertisement gloria has happy memories of her nursing career in the nhs when jamaican gloria nasralla decided to become a nurse she wanted to train in the uk .
the nascent nhs had been recently established and gloria was sure it would provide an ideal setting for her to pick up valuable experience .
the war years had left a shortage of workers and she was confident that an immigrant worker like herself could expect a warm welcome .
so after a little prompting from her mother the 20-year-old would-be nurse set her sights on gloucester royal infirmary .
i had patients who invited me to their home for tea because they thought i might be homesick and to thank me for my care gloria nasralla " i had heard about the nhs and thought it was wonderful because in jamaica everything was so different .

i was on night duty when it finally snowed , " she said .
gloria , now 76 , recalls she spent a while in london watching the preparations for the imminent coronation of elizabeth before setting off for gloucester .
" at that time my late uncle lived in london and i was naughty really because i thought i would like to see a little bit of london so i stopped off to see the preparations , " she said .

the 41-year old will join actress and singer sharon d clarke and choral conductor suzi digby as a judge on the bbc one show , hosted by nick knowles and myleene klass .
it will be watson 's first high-profile tv job since he underwent surgery for a life-threatening brain tumour in october last year .
he talks to the bbc about losing his hair , his long road to recovery , and what it is like to be back in the limelight .
tell me about last choir standing .
it 's different from a lot of the other reality tv talent shows around .
there is an incredibly high standard of musicianship .
some of the choirs we have seen - especially the gospel choirs - have been outrageously good .
russell watson 's debut album entitled the voice was released in may 2001 in fact , so much so , that it has been difficult to whittle down the finalists because the standard has been so high and so consistent throughout .
it 's been very difficult for the judges .
with a lot of reality tv shows you get the car crash people turning up who you know are not going to get through , but there have n't been any acts like that .
a lot of these choirs are very , very good .
what kind of choirs can we expect to see ?
there 's gospel , a lot of community choirs , ladies choirs , welsh choirs , one who called themselves an inspirational choir , although i have to admit , they were n't very inspirational !
what do you look for in a choir ?
i am looking for character .
obviously i 'm looking for technical ability , but i also want to know that people are feeling the music and getting the sensibility of the music over .
with all due respect , most people can sing , but it 's getting the sensibility and the passion of the song over .
you can hear two separate choirs , both of a similar ability , singing the same song , but somehow one of them is doing something that makes you go ' wow ' - that 's what i 'm looking for .
we 've got the x factor , britain 's got talent , i 'd do anything , and now last choir standing .
is the public not fed up with all of these talent shows ?
millions of people tuned in to britain 's got talent , so clearly people are not sick of them .
i think inevitably there will be a saturation point , but at the moment people seem to be embracing them more and more .
what can the winning choir expect to get out of it ?
i would hope that the winning choir could potentially get a record deal out of it .
the show features a wide range of choirs from across the uk for me , the downside of these reality shows so far has been that the winners have not been able to maintain longevity within the industry .
i think that is very sad because it must be incredibly difficult when that person - who has achieved success , been in the spotlight , put on a pedestal , given a record deal on a platter - ca n't even get arrested 12 months later !
have your recent health problems influenced what kind of judge you are ?
please turn on javascript .
media requires javascript to play .
advertisement russell watson talks about how his illness affected his family i think my recent health scare has influenced what kind of person i am , never mind judge .
an experience like that - where you are on the cusp of death , or at least you believe you are - does that .
i was rushed in with four haemorrhage points , a tumour the size of a tennis ball , and a swelling in my head that affected my vision to the point of blindness .
all i could think about was my family and my friends and my children .
when you have been through an experience like that it affects your outlook and your perception of life .
i gave one of my first concerts since being sick in tokyo last month and i remember walking out onto stage and feeling apprehensive about it .
i was thinking " am i going to be ok ? "

the 41-year old will join actress and singer sharon d clarke and choral conductor suzi digby as a judge on the bbc one show , hosted by nick knowles and myleene klass .
it will be watson 's first high-profile tv job since he underwent surgery for a life-threatening brain tumour in october last year .
he talks to the bbc about losing his hair , his long road to recovery , and what it is like to be back in the limelight .
tell me about last choir standing .
it 's different from a lot of the other reality tv talent shows around .
there is an incredibly high standard of musicianship .
some of the choirs we have seen - especially the gospel choirs - have been outrageously good .
russell watson 's debut album entitled the voice was released in may 2001 in fact , so much so , that it has been difficult to whittle down the finalists because the standard has been so high and so consistent throughout .
it 's been very difficult for the judges .
with a lot of reality tv shows you get the car crash people turning up who you know are not going to get through , but there have n't been any acts like that .
a lot of these choirs are very , very good .
what kind of choirs can we expect to see ?
there 's gospel , a lot of community choirs , ladies choirs , welsh choirs , one who called themselves an inspirational choir , although i have to admit , they were n't very inspirational !
what do you look for in a choir ?
i am looking for character .
obviously i 'm looking for technical ability , but i also want to know that people are feeling the music and getting the sensibility of the music over .
with all due respect , most people can sing , but it 's getting the sensibility and the passion of the song over .
you can hear two separate choirs , both of a similar ability , singing the same song , but somehow one of them is doing something that makes you go ' wow ' - that 's what i 'm looking for .
we 've got the x factor , britain 's got talent , i 'd do anything , and now last choir standing .
is the public not fed up with all of these talent shows ?
millions of people tuned in to britain 's got talent , so clearly people are not sick of them .
i think inevitably there will be a saturation point , but at the moment people seem to be embracing them more and more .
what can the winning choir expect to get out of it ?
i would hope that the winning choir could potentially get a record deal out of it .
the show features a wide range of choirs from across the uk for me , the downside of these reality shows so far has been that the winners have not been able to maintain longevity within the industry .
i think that is very sad because it must be incredibly difficult when that person - who has achieved success , been in the spotlight , put on a pedestal , given a record deal on a platter - ca n't even get arrested 12 months later !
have your recent health problems influenced what kind of judge you are ?
please turn on javascript .
media requires javascript to play .
advertisement russell watson talks about how his illness affected his family i think my recent health scare has influenced what kind of person i am , never mind judge .
an experience like that - where you are on the cusp of death , or at least you believe you are - does that .
i was rushed in with four haemorrhage points , a tumour the size of a tennis ball , and a swelling in my head that affected my vision to the point of blindness .
all i could think about was my family and my friends and my children .
when you have been through an experience like that it affects your outlook and your perception of life .
i gave one of my first concerts since being sick in tokyo last month and i remember walking out onto stage and feeling apprehensive about it .

the 41-year old will join actress and singer sharon d clarke and choral conductor suzi digby as a judge on the bbc one show , hosted by nick knowles and myleene klass .
it will be watson 's first high-profile tv job since he underwent surgery for a life-threatening brain tumour in october last year .
he talks to the bbc about losing his hair , his long road to recovery , and what it is like to be back in the limelight .
tell me about last choir standing .
it 's different from a lot of the other reality tv talent shows around .
there is an incredibly high standard of musicianship .
some of the choirs we have seen - especially the gospel choirs - have been outrageously good .
russell watson 's debut album entitled the voice was released in may 2001 in fact , so much so , that it has been difficult to whittle down the finalists because the standard has been so high and so consistent throughout .
it 's been very difficult for the judges .
with a lot of reality tv shows you get the car crash people turning up who you know are not going to get through , but there have n't been any acts like that .
a lot of these choirs are very , very good .
what kind of choirs can we expect to see ?
there 's gospel , a lot of community choirs , ladies choirs , welsh choirs , one who called themselves an inspirational choir , although i have to admit , they were n't very inspirational !
what do you look for in a choir ?
i am looking for character .
obviously i 'm looking for technical ability , but i also want to know that people are feeling the music and getting the sensibility of the music over .
with all due respect , most people can sing , but it 's getting the sensibility and the passion of the song over .
you can hear two separate choirs , both of a similar ability , singing the same song , but somehow one of them is doing something that makes you go ' wow ' - that 's what i 'm looking for .
we 've got the x factor , britain 's got talent , i 'd do anything , and now last choir standing .
is the public not fed up with all of these talent shows ?
millions of people tuned in to britain 's got talent , so clearly people are not sick of them .
i think inevitably there will be a saturation point , but at the moment people seem to be embracing them more and more .
what can the winning choir expect to get out of it ?
i would hope that the winning choir could potentially get a record deal out of it .
the show features a wide range of choirs from across the uk for me , the downside of these reality shows so far has been that the winners have not been able to maintain longevity within the industry .
i think that is very sad because it must be incredibly difficult when that person - who has achieved success , been in the spotlight , put on a pedestal , given a record deal on a platter - ca n't even get arrested 12 months later !
have your recent health problems influenced what kind of judge you are ?
please turn on javascript .
media requires javascript to play .
advertisement russell watson talks about how his illness affected his family i think my recent health scare has influenced what kind of person i am , never mind judge .
an experience like that - where you are on the cusp of death , or at least you believe you are - does that .
i was rushed in with four haemorrhage points , a tumour the size of a tennis ball , and a swelling in my head that affected my vision to the point of blindness .
all i could think about was my family and my friends and my children .
when you have been through an experience like that it affects your outlook and your perception of life .
i gave one of my first concerts since being sick in tokyo last month and i remember walking out onto stage and feeling apprehensive about it .
i was thinking " am i going to be ok ? "
then something flipped and i just thought " you know , i could have been dead eight months ago , lets just out and have a good time " .
and i did .
does this mean we 're not going to see the classical music world 's answer to simon cowell ?
no !
i think there is a way of letting people down and i do n't think you have to be too heavy-handed or too harsh about it .
it 's been a battle , but i set myself goals in life and i meet each battle head on .
so far so good .
russell watson if there is anyone i do n't think is particularly good then i will point out their good elements , bad elements and tell them that unfortunately they 're not good enough to compete .
but i do n't like the " get out you 're the worst thing i 've ever heard " route .
so more of a mr reasonable than a mr nasty ?
what about the other judges ?
suzi is a tough nut , but again not in an unpleasant way .
it 's more informed criticism .
she is at the top of her game and knows music inside out .
when she gives criticism you can see people really taking it on board .
what was it like coming back from your illness and into such a high-profile role ?
it was a morale boost , actually .
i felt like i needed to get out of the house and effectively move away from the sick bed .
the three judges join nick knowles and myleene klass on the bbc one show i 've been training hard to get fit because i was very ill during the radiotherapy .
i was on steroids and i lost my hair and put a load of weight on .
the first thing i wanted to do was lose two stone , which i did through a lot of hard work , and wait for my hair to grow back because i looked like friar tuck for a while !
it 's not a great look but it amused my kids .
it 's been a battle , but i set myself goals in life and i meet each battle head on .
so far so good .
the programme is called last choir standing .
if you and co-host nick knowles has a fight , who would be the last one standing ?
well i 've boxed since i was eight or nine , it 's one of my favourite past-times , and while i 'm not sure about nick , i 'm pretty handy in the old boxing ring .
let 's just say i can look after myself , -lrb- adopts a hammy northern accent -rrb- i 'm a salford lad , i 've had to , love .
last choir standing starts on bbc one on saturday at 1945 bst .
russell watson was talking to bbc news entertainment reporter caroline briggs .

the wardens say the changes involve job losses , pay cuts and working unsocial hours .
the council says reorganisation was needed after funding cuts .
around 60 council wardens will start work on thursday afternoon at 1400 bst but will walk out four hours later , halfway through their shift .
they will repeat the action on friday and saturday .
knowsley borough council said that staff were on grant-funded temporary contracts which ended in march , but they were able to identify funding to create permanent contracts .
the council says the action is " unecessary and disappointing " .
the role of neighbourhood wardens was designed to reduce crime and anti-social behaviour and make communities safer .

in the last six decades , there has been a revolution in the type and range of treatments available .
immunisations immunisation means some diseases which used to kill many hundreds of people a year have now been virtually wiped out in the uk .
back in the early days of the nhs there were regular polio epidemics - 8000 or so cases a year .
a vaccination programme was introduced in 1956 , and cases immediately began to fall .
the last case of polio infection in the uk was in 1984 .
vaccination programmes have also helped minimise the risk of potentially fatal illnesses like tuberculosis , whooping cough and diphtheria .
and measles has gone from being a huge problem to a rare condition .
there were up to 800,000 measles cases a year in the late 1940s and early 1950s .
vaccination began in 1968 , and the last confirmed death was in 2006 , though the number of measles cases has risen slightly since the controversy over the mmr vaccine .
fertility there have been huge advances in fertility treatment .
in 1948 , a couple who could n't have children had very few options .
in 2005 , more than 11,000 babies were born as a result of ivf treatment .
the first test tube baby , louise brown , was born in 1978 .
the development of ivf technology suddenly gave hope to thousands of despairing infertile couples .
doctors went on to develop even more refined techniques like embryo freezing .
judy boothroyd was one of the first mothers to have a baby from a frozen embryo .
" we were very lucky ivf was available to us at that time , " she said .
" by the time emily was born i was nearly 39 .
i felt that time was running out .
had i been ten years older , it would n't have been possible . "
since then , ivf has been refined even further .
today , more than one in four women under the age of 35 who undergo ivf go on to have healthy babies .
transplants the nhs has witnessed a surgical revolution in the last six decades .
in its early years , the notion of transplanting an organ from one person 's body to another seemed like science fiction .
but in 1960 the first kidney in the uk was transplanted - and in 1968 came the nation 's first heart transplant , carried out at the national heart hospital in london .
transplants are now revolutionising the life of thousands of people each year - in the last 12 months , over 3,000 people had an organ transplant .
professor peter morris , from the royal college of surgeons , has worked as a transplant surgeon since the early days of the technology .
" it has been quite extraordinary , " he said .
" before kidney transplants , patients either survived on dialysis or died .
" it was one of the modern miracles of the 20th century , without question . "
and the revolution is continuing - in 2005 came the first partial face transplant , carried out by doctors in france .
now the royal free hospital in london has been licensed to carry out the first face transplant here .
surgery surgery in general is very different today from the early days of the nhs .
then , most operations were done by general surgeons - there were far fewer specialists .
the risks were much higher .
patients were anaesthetised with heavy doses of opiates , which left them with unpleasant side effects , and they were kept in hospital for a couple of weeks or more , even for the most simple procedure .
today , keyhole surgery , which became widespread in the 1990s , means recovery times are far shorter .
day surgery is also increasingly common - cataract surgery , for example , is finished in a matter of minutes , with patients able to walk out of the theatre and go straight home .
hip transplants , developed in 1972 , are now routinely available , and help put thousands of elderly people back on their feet every year .
and plastic surgery has gone from being a treatment for accident and burns victims developed during the second world war , to being a commonplace cosmetic procedure .
these are just some of the increasingly sophisticated treatments which have been developed in the last few years .
they have transformed people 's lives , but also pose a growing dilemma for nhs .
how can they all be paid for , and who should receive them ?

in the last six decades , there has been a revolution in the type and range of treatments available .
immunisations immunisation means some diseases which used to kill many hundreds of people a year have now been virtually wiped out in the uk .
jonas salk pioneered development of a polio vaccine back in the early days of the nhs there were regular polio epidemics - 8000 or so cases a year .
a vaccination programme was introduced in 1956 , and cases immediately began to fall .
the last case of polio infection in the uk was in 1984 .
vaccination programmes have also helped minimise the risk of potentially fatal illnesses like tuberculosis , whooping cough and diphtheria .
and measles has gone from being a huge problem to a rare condition .
there were up to 800,000 measles cases a year in the late 1940s and early 1950s .
vaccination began in 1968 , and the last confirmed death was in 2006 , though the number of measles cases has risen slightly since the controversy over the mmr vaccine .
fertility there have been huge advances in fertility treatment .
in 1948 , a couple who could n't have children had very few options .
in 2005 , more than 11,000 babies were born as a result of ivf treatment .
the first test tube baby , louise brown , was born in 1978 .
the development of ivf technology suddenly gave hope to thousands of despairing infertile couples .
doctors went on to develop even more refined techniques like embryo freezing .
judy boothroyd was one of the first mothers to have a baby from a frozen embryo .
" we were very lucky ivf was available to us at that time , " she said .
" by the time emily was born i was nearly 39 .
i felt that time was running out .
had i been ten years older , it would n't have been possible . "
since then , ivf has been refined even further .
today , more than one in four women under the age of 35 who undergo ivf go on to have healthy babies .
transplants the nhs has witnessed a surgical revolution in the last six decades .
in its early years , the notion of transplanting an organ from one person 's body to another seemed like science fiction .
but in 1960 the first kidney in the uk was transplanted - and in 1968 came the nation 's first heart transplant , carried out at the national heart hospital in london .
transplants are now revolutionising the life of thousands of people each year - in the last 12 months , over 3,000 people had an organ transplant .
professor peter morris , from the royal college of surgeons , has worked as a transplant surgeon since the early days of the technology .
" it has been quite extraordinary , " he said .
" before kidney transplants , patients either survived on dialysis or died .
" it was one of the modern miracles of the 20th century , without question . "
and the revolution is continuing - in 2005 came the first partial face transplant , carried out by doctors in france .
now the royal free hospital in london has been licensed to carry out the first face transplant here .
surgery surgery in general is very different today from the early days of the nhs .
then , most operations were done by general surgeons - there were far fewer specialists .
the risks were much higher .
patients were anaesthetised with heavy doses of opiates , which left them with unpleasant side effects , and they were kept in hospital for a couple of weeks or more , even for the most simple procedure .
today , keyhole surgery , which became widespread in the 1990s , means recovery times are far shorter .
day surgery is also increasingly common - cataract surgery , for example , is finished in a matter of minutes , with patients able to walk out of the theatre and go straight home .

advertisement army recruits knee-deep in the algae swamp by quentin sommerville bbc news , qingdao young recruits from the people 's liberation army threw off their shoes and stood knee-deep in the thick green algae that has overwhelmed the qingdao coastline .
some had shovels , others used pitchforks , but mostly they worked with their hands to tear up great lumps of the heavy , sodden weed .
more than 10,000 of the recruits have been deployed .
young soldiers have been mobilised to help with the clean-up " we 're working nine-hour days .
i 've been here six days , and still more and more of it keeps coming , " said one of the soldiers .
with every wave more of the algae comes ashore .
earth-moving equipment has arrived and long mechanical conveyor belts ; perhaps they will speed up the progress .
on one of the beaches is holidaymaker wang weizhong .
the sludge ruined his holiday , and his anticipation of the olympic games .
" we are really disappointed , " he said .
" we had no idea something like this would happen here . "
" we came for the pretty scenery , to get a taste of the preparations and excitement of the olympics , " he said .
locals say the algae has never been so thick here - agricultural and industrial pollution are thought to be responsible .
but china , embarrassed by the most vivid proof yet of its environmental problems , says the algae is a natural occurrence , and blames the sea for being too salty , the sun for being too hot .
at a news conference earlier in the day one official suggested that algae could be good for you .
" the japanese eat it , " she said .
avoiding algae it is something that most of the olympic competitors have never experienced before .
joe glanfield and his team-mate nick rogers are facing the algae for the first time .
sailors nick rogers and joe glanfield have been training in the algae they are competing for great britain and won a silver at the last olympics .
" it does make a difference , " said joe .
" it 's my job to look out for patches of algae to avoid , so we do n't get it stuck on the boat , which would slow us down . "
alongside is their coach , hamish wilcox .
he has been sailing these waters for three years .
he is in little doubt about the cause of the outbreak .
" there 's no denying that there 's a lot of sewage flowing out into the bay here , " he said .
" some days it 's disgusting , most of it is pretty raw , but there 's quite a lot of current here so it does get swept away . "
but he thinks the mess will be cleared in time for the games .
" you ca n't really beat nature , but if the situation that caused all of this switches off , and they clear up the mess that 's already here , then the likelihood is that they 'll be ok . "
deadline around him are many hundreds of small wooden fishing boats .
but they are not looking for fish - their holds are filled with piles of green algae .
they take it ashore and from there it is taken to landfill .
the government is erecting booms and netting out at sea , to stop the algae coming ashore , but it has no answers yet for stopping the weed growing in the first place .
as the banners along the roads proclaim , the army has a two-week deadline to get rid of the slime .
the pressure is on : the olympics begin in just over a month .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- ' bankruptcy ' fear hits gm shares bbc news / business graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- business contents : your money -pipe- economy companies 08:49 gmt , thursday , 3 july 2008 09:49 uk ' bankruptcy ' fear hits gm shares general motors share price general motors shares have fallen to their lowest level in more than 53 years amid concerns about the carmaker 's future .
investment bank merrill lynch warned that gm needs to raise funds and that bankruptcy was " not impossible " .
gm has suffered from falling sales as us consumers have cut back on spending and record fuel costs have seen them switch to smaller , more efficient cars .
gm 's shares hit a low of $ 9.96 , before closing down 15 % at $ 9.98 on wednesday .
the share price touched its lowest level since september 1954 , when the stock hit $ 9.92 during trading .
gm shares have fallen 60 % so far this year and merril lynch predicted that the shares could fall even further .
" we believe there is potential downside in the stock below $ 7 and that bankruptcy is not impossible if the market continues to deteriorate and significant incremental capital is not raised , " said analyst john murphy .
merrill 's had previously predicted a value of $ 28 for gm 's shares .
sales fall another analyst , david healy from burnham securities was less pessimistic about gm 's prospects .
" my own opinion is that they 're unlikely to file -lsb- for bankruptcy -rsb- , " mr healy said .
" but the conditions in the auto industry are so tough for everybody right now , especially for gm , and that 's why people see this as plausible . "
general motors suffered a big fall in us sales in june , down 18.5 % compared with the same month in 2007 .
the figures , however , were still better-than-expected and its sales fall was less than rival toyota , which reported sales that were 21.4 % lower .
all of the major carmakers in the us have experienced a shift in consumer demand from sports utility vehicles -lrb- suvs -rrb- and light trucks to smaller , more fuel efficient vehicles as petrol costs have spiralled .

investment bank merrill lynch warned that gm needs to raise funds and that bankruptcy was " not impossible " .
gm has suffered from falling sales as us consumers have cut back on spending and record fuel costs have seen them switch to smaller , more efficient cars .
gm 's shares hit a low of $ 9.96 , before closing down 15 % at $ 9.98 on wednesday .
the share price touched its lowest level since september 1954 , when the stock hit $ 9.92 during trading .
gm shares have fallen 60 % so far this year and merril lynch predicted that the shares could fall even further .
" we believe there is potential downside in the stock below $ 7 and that bankruptcy is not impossible if the market continues to deteriorate and significant incremental capital is not raised , " said analyst john murphy .
merrill 's had previously predicted a value of $ 28 for gm 's shares .
sales fall another analyst , david healy from burnham securities was less pessimistic about gm 's prospects .
" my own opinion is that they 're unlikely to file -lsb- for bankruptcy -rsb- , " mr healy said .
" but the conditions in the auto industry are so tough for everybody right now , especially for gm , and that 's why people see this as plausible . "
general motors suffered a big fall in us sales in june , down 18.5 % compared with the same month in 2007 .
the figures , however , were still better-than-expected and its sales fall was less than rival toyota , which reported sales that were 21.4 % lower .
all of the major carmakers in the us have experienced a shift in consumer demand from sports utility vehicles -lrb- suvs -rrb- and light trucks to smaller , more fuel efficient vehicles as petrol costs have spiralled .
