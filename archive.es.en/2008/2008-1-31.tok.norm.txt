it 's comfortable , there is food and drink at hand and no noisy crowds pushing you around .
and yet , a killer could be stalking you . soccer can be a dangerous business for committed fans .
in the stadiums themselves , supporters face a number of medical risks including serious bladder episodes brought on by too many half-time beers , temporary bouts of tourette 's syndrome and , in the case of england fans , actual death through boredom .
no one who follows a team with passion should take their allegiance lightly .
it can seriously damage your health . those who have ever watched their team 's chances of success end in the lottery of a penalty shoot-out will already know this .
but if anyone was in doubt about the potential danger of staking your happiness on the fortune of 11 men running around on a soccer field , a group of german scientists have done the typically teutonic thing and proved it should be avoided . taking german fans who followed their team through the 2006 world cup as their case study group , the men in lab coats from munich 's ludwig-maximilians university have discovered that the risk of a heart attack or other cardiovascular problem in male fans increased three-fold on days when the german team was in action . it was n't just irrational and emotionally charged fans on the edge of their stadium seats who were suffering .
victims also included over-stressed fans watching the game in the comfort of their own homes .
and they were n't all men , either : female fans also recorded a rise in emergencies , with the amount of heart incidents in women rising by 82 percent during the tournament . the researchers came to their conclusions after reviewing 4,279 medical reports from the seven days the german team played in the 2006 world cup , the 24 days when matches involved teams from other countries , and 242 other days in 2003 , 2005 and 2006 . paying the penalty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's super-fit players handled the shoot-out well the research showed that cardiac emergencies usually occurred within two hours of the start of a match , which would explain why the largest number of attacks occurred during the june 30 quarter-final in which germany defeated argentina in a dramatic penalty shoot-out .
after 90 minutes of regular time and an additional 30 minutes of extra-time , german fans found themselves entering the danger zone and 64 of them suffered heart attacks as a result . the next game , germany 's semi-final loss to italy which went into extra-time , produced almost as many heart attacks . " apparently , of prime importance for triggering a stress-induced event is not the outcome of a game - a win or a loss - but rather the intense strain and excitement experienced during the viewing of a dramatic match , such as one with a penalty shoot-out , " the research report , published in the new england journal of medicine , stated . hosts ' march raises pulses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just remember to breathe watching jürgen klinsmann 's team throughout the world cup on home soil was a potential killer for german fans as six of the seven games in which the team participated were associated with an increase in the number of cardiac emergencies . the only game which produced no spike in heart-related problems was the third-place match in which germany defeated portugal 3-1 .
presumably , with the main prize out of contention , more of the pressure was off and fans could relax their heart valves . while the excitement of germany 's march to the semi-finals was a contributing factor to the increase in heart episodes , others were cited by the report .

literally " sessions " or " sittings , " the more traditional ones are gala events ; the smaller , more alternatives ones resemble comedy or variety shows composed of skits with performers making liberal use of song and dance to mock politicians , each other and themselves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bit of samba spices up karneval for american singer and actress victoria riccio , who came to germany nearly 20 years ago , the introduction to a sitzung was a shocker . " when i first came here , i went to one of these events and did n't understand a word , but at one point , the people on stage took off all their clothes and jumped around naked , " she said .

i loved it right away .
for me it was like halloween and the best party you 've ever been to , all wrapped into one . " immigrants take the stage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the immigrantenstadl kicked off three years ago still , despite the lure of scantily-clad hedonists and the beer that flows abundantly , karneval and its sitzungen can make non-germans feel like outsiders due to all the inside jokes about local politics and heavy use of the local dialect . so riccio , along with emcee hektor haarkötter and a host of others , started their own show called the " immigrantenstadl . "
it 's a gala put on for and by immigrants - which in cologne can also mean anyone born outside the city limits . " a bunch of us met with other artists and musicians in a pub in the southern part of the city and talked for hours , making all sorts of plans for a show , " he said .

" cologne 's large immigrant population there are jazzy numbers in which the performers sing lines like " we 've come to stay , we 're not leaving " - referring to the one in five people living in cologne who has an immigrant background , in an urban population of around 1 million . yet , by being semi-outsiders , performers are able to point out the quirky characteristics among germans - and even themselves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what would cologne do without all its greek immigrants , even if they are philosophers ?
during one immigrantenstadl skit , a turkish-german actor explains that in turkey , when someone wants to steal something , the thief waits until a person leaves his house , sneaks in and grabs the item .
in germany , he quips , a person will go to a home , ring the bell , say " hello , " take the television and leave a receipt for the item on the table . another number shows a romanian actress who tries to discern the future of karneval in her crystal ball . good-humored mockery it 's poking fun at cultural differences in a good-humored , tongue-in-cheek way that makes the show so appealing , said julien , a frenchman who 's lived in cologne for three years .
he claimed that , contrary to the stereotype , germans are able to mock themselves . " there are some very funny pieces in this show and i like the mixture of jokes about germans and immigrants in germany and how they all live here together , " he said .
" there are a lot of taboos surrounding the subject .
in this show , there are no taboos .
it 's great ! " while the typical cologne sitzung is performed in the local kölsch dialect , which immigrants and germans from outside the city alike have difficulty understanding , the singers and actors in the " immigrantenstadl " dole out their mockery of world events in a kaleidoscope of languages , including german , english , turkish , romanian , greek and czech . creating the mood with a beer - or three bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world players like president bush and condi rice are not left unscathed in one funky , hip-hop sketch , a singer in a cowboy hat masquerading as us president george w. bush complains about his work overload in the white house and iraq .

on tv and in print , she 's advised countless people about matters most intimate .
we talked to her on the eve of a historical anniversary . published 60 years ago , the first kinsey report , titled " sexual behavior in the human male , " shocked the general public for discussing subjects that had previously been taboo and for openly challenging conventional sexual beliefs of the day .
though kinsey 's methods have repeatedly been questioned by opponents , the report remains one of the largest studies ever conducted on human sexual behavior . dw-world.de : the kinsey report launched the sexual revolution when it was published on jan .
31 , 1948 .

how important was it to your career ? erika berger : well , i was much too young to read it when it came out , but of course i have it on my shelf at home just like everyone today who 's interested in sexuality .
there are things in it , where you say , " yes , that 's exactly right . "
there 's no reason not to do things that are a bit out of the ordinary and that may be incomprehensible to other people .
and above all we should talk about sexuality .
we should n't try to conceal things , and we should leave people with other sexual preferences and drives in peace . it took several years for the kinsey report to be translated into german .

sex is the way i experience it and do it - together with my partner .
the concepts of normal and abnormal sex mean nothing to me .
i think it 's impertinent for someone today to say " what gays do , is n't normal . "

on tv and in print , she 's advised countless people about matters most intimate .
we talked to her on the eve of a historical anniversary . published 60 years ago , the first kinsey report , titled " sexual behavior in the human male , " shocked the general public for discussing subjects that had previously been taboo and for openly challenging conventional sexual beliefs of the day .
though kinsey 's methods have repeatedly been questioned by opponents , the report remains one of the largest studies ever conducted on human sexual behavior . dw-world.de : the kinsey report launched the sexual revolution when it was published on jan .
31 , 1948 .
now it 's celebrating its 60th anniversary .
how important was it to your career ? erika berger : well , i was much too young to read it when it came out , but of course i have it on my shelf at home just like everyone today who 's interested in sexuality .
there are things in it , where you say , " yes , that 's exactly right . "
there 's no reason not to do things that are a bit out of the ordinary and that may be incomprehensible to other people .
and above all we should talk about sexuality .
we should n't try to conceal things , and we should leave people with other sexual preferences and drives in peace . it took several years for the kinsey report to be translated into german .
was germany backwards in this regard ? as i began dealing with sexuality in front of the camera , it was a wasteland .
there was director oswalt kolle who made a number of sex-education films in the 1960s .
he was an educational pioneer , and i think it was only then that we in germany realized that sex was something completely normal .
in that respect i think germany did lag behind america a bit . the results of the kinsey report suggested that sexual practices traditionally dismissed as perverse were far more widespread than people thought .
is there such a thing as " normal sex ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika berger currently hosts the call-in advice show " night talk " you 'd have to ask yourself the question : what is normal sex for a given individual ?
and you could just as well ask : what is good or bad sex for that individual ?
sex is the way i experience it and do it - together with my partner .
the concepts of normal and abnormal sex mean nothing to me .
i think it 's impertinent for someone today to say " what gays do , is n't normal . "
who are they to say what 's normal ?
i myself determine what 's normal for me . the internet has opened up whole new possibilities for tracking people 's sex preferences .
what effect has that had on sexual research ? i think the web is unbelievably important for sex research .
first of all , it allows you to look things up things instantly .
and it 's very transparent .
i no longer have to go somewhere and buy a book that i hardly dare to ask for because the title is so racy .
instead i just log on to the web , click and i 've got everything i need .
and it 's interesting that you can measure people 's clicks and see whether they are interested in the missionary position , same-sex love or unusual sexual practices .
are they interested in sex toys or masturbation tips ?
that 's very interesting . then public sexual morality often differs drastically from people 's actual online sexual behavior ? absolutely .
you can read about things , click on them and inform yourself .
you can even talk about and discuss them .
but when people are confronted with their own desires , they sometimes lack the courage .
some do n't want to overburden their partners ; others simply do n't know where to begin .
to take a somewhat crass example : if i said , " how about some role playing or bondage tonight ? " or " i 'm into sadomasochism , " i would n't know how my partner would react .
and then it 's too late .
that 's why , in practice , sex is often so boring . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berger says the internet offers positive and negative forms of anonymity is it not ironic that the possibilities opened up by the anonymity of the internet often get in the way of sexual communication ? yes , it 's suffered from that .
today i can choose a partner via the internet - i can virtually " invite " someone into my living room and talk to him via the computer screen .
but , please , what good is that ?
it 's totally one-dimensional .
it 's the same as if i look at pictures of naked women or men or sex practices on the screen .
what good does it do me ? that sounds as if there 's still a need for sexual education in the internet age , a need to bring people together to talk about sex . i think the attempt to bring people together is great .
but it does n't always work .
let 's say i decide i want a man .
so i go to some web page and look for a guy i 'd like to chat with .
then you start talking , and of course your conversations revolve around horizontal kinds of fun .
but i still want to see the guy some time !
i love chatting , and i 'm very involved with the internet .
but i still think that you have to talk face-to-face at some point .
i miss that .
it 's a kind of anonymity that i do n't like very much . you 're 67 , and your last book dealt with growing older and specifically with menopause .
that 's very topical because the average age is increasing in germany and many other western countries .
will it have an effect on our sex lives ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as people get older , they start to question the value of getting horizontal it creates a very important question : is sex in old age a taboo or not ?
personally i 'd plead for treating it as something normal .
who says that you should n't have sex at the age of 60 , 70 or 80 ?
there 's no age limit for sex - or love , which i always stress is connected with sex .
if a person is healthy , he can still have a very fulfilling sexual life .
but one thing i found out from talking to people for my last book was that as they get older , sex becomes less important .
it 's only their second or third most important concern - the top one is tenderness .
is there someone there who loves me and whom i can love back ?
it 's a matter of trust , above all , and sexuality develops from it . so there will be more attention paid to older people 's sexuality ? of course , because people are getting older , and - thank god - they 're no longer stupid enough to try and conceal the fact that they 're no longer doing the dirty deed . -lrb- laughs -rrb- look at it this way - everyone , no matter how old , has a baby inside that needs to be cuddled .
when you enter puberty , it 's great .
and when you 're in the prime of life , you 've lost most of your inhibitions .
but if you 're a woman entering menopause , you have so many inhibitions .
you do n't dare take off your clothes .
you 're afraid that sex will hurt .
you have so many things that can take away your desire for sexuality .
you say , " oh , i 'm old . "
but you 're not old .
you 're just entering a new phase of life .
that 's great .
why are you laughing ? no reason - you just made ageing sound pleasant .
one last - frivolous - question : you recorded a song in the 1990s called " sex is fun . "
when was the last time you listened to it ? -lrb- laughs . -rrb-
oh god , i know exactly when it was .
six months ago .
i was sitting around with some colleagues , chatting interactively , and they said , " hey , we 've found something really funny .
it 's your cd . "
we listened to it and laughed ourselves under the table .
what do think about that ?
pretty funny , huh ? i do n't have any problem with that .
i have no problem with getting older , or with saying that sex is fun , or with anything i 've every done in my professional or personal life .
i think it 's great .

but one thing i found out from talking to people for my last book was that as they get older , sex becomes less important .
it 's only their second or third most important concern - the top one is tenderness .
is there someone there who loves me and whom i can love back ?
it 's a matter of trust , above all , and sexuality develops from it . so there will be more attention paid to older people 's sexuality ? of course , because people are getting older , and - thank god - they 're no longer stupid enough to try and conceal the fact that they 're no longer doing the dirty deed . -lrb- laughs -rrb- look at it this way - everyone , no matter how old , has a baby inside that needs to be cuddled .
when you enter puberty , it 's great .
and when you 're in the prime of life , you 've lost most of your inhibitions .
but if you 're a woman entering menopause , you have so many inhibitions .
you do n't dare take off your clothes .
you 're afraid that sex will hurt .
you have so many things that can take away your desire for sexuality .
you say , " oh , i 'm old . "
but you 're not old .
you 're just entering a new phase of life .
that 's great .
why are you laughing ? no reason - you just made ageing sound pleasant .
one last - frivolous - question : you recorded a song in the 1990s called " sex is fun . "
when was the last time you listened to it ? -lrb- laughs . -rrb-
oh god , i know exactly when it was .
six months ago .
i was sitting around with some colleagues , chatting interactively , and they said , " hey , we 've found something really funny .
it 's your cd . "
we listened to it and laughed ourselves under the table .
what do think about that ?
pretty funny , huh ? i do n't have any problem with that .
i have no problem with getting older , or with saying that sex is fun , or with anything i 've every done in my professional or personal life .
i think it 's great .
it 's part of life . i would n't have minded making a record - especially not with that title . -lrb- laughs -rrb- too late .

china , turkey and the us were also reprimanded by the group . in a report released on thursday , jan .
31 , human rights watch chastised europe and the us for tolerating unjust elections this past year in places including russia , jordan and nigeria . " by allowing autocrats to pose as democrats without demanding they uphold the civil and political rights that make democracy meaningful , the united states , the european union and other influential democracies risk undermining human rights worldwide , " the new york-based rights group said in its annual report . fair elections are not the only essential component to democracy , said hrw , adding that a free press , freedom of assembly and free speech are also crucial . the european union 's stance on russia received special condemnation from the human right 's group , which said the 27-member bloc put political ties with an important energy supplier ahead of a responsibility to address moscow 's human rights ' record . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu should have taken a much harder line with russia , the ngo said " human rights did not figure prominently in the broader eu-russia agenda , " the report said .
" although the german eu presidency raised human rights issues at the may eu-russia summit ... this stance was compromised by subsequent statements made by the portuguese presidency equating the raising of human rights issues with inappropriate ' lecturing . " ' bad news for eu hopeful turkey was taken to task in the report for violating free speech .
the country has begun accession talks with the european union , but human rights remain a key issue in the discussion . " the criminalization of speech remains a key obstacle to the protection of human rights in turkey , contributing to an atmosphere of intolerance that assumed violent proportions in 2007 , " the report said . hrw recalled the ethnic armenian journalist hrant dink , who was shot dead in istanbul in january last year after labeling as genocide the world war i massacres of armenians in the ottoman empire . pre-olympic slip bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has n't kept its promise to improve human rights before the olympics in the global spotlight ahead of the 2008 olympic games , host country china has promised to improve the human rights situation within its borders .
instead , preparations have only led to more violations , said hrw , including evictions of residents for olympic construction , abysmal work conditions and tighter restrictions on government critics . " official efforts to rid beijing of undesirables ahead of the olympics have accelerated the eviction of petitioners - citizens from the countryside who come to the capital seeking redress for grievances ranging from illegal land seizures to official corruption , " said the report . hrw director kenneth roth on thursday urged the world to put pressure on china to ameliorate the situation before the games . " the olympics are a historic opportunity for the chinese government to show the world that it can make human rights a reality for its 1.4 billion citizens , " said roth . the anti-terror campaign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us was accused of holding prisoners without trial at guantanamo bay not only the us , but also france , pakistan and great britain were criticized by hrw for breaching human rights in the name of the " war on terror . "
the american prison in cuba came under fire , in particular . " there is no evidence of progress concerning the treatment of so-called enemy combatants , including those held at guantanamo bay , or the use of secret detention facilities " in foreign countries , the report said . hrw estimated that 275 people are still imprisoned at the guantanamo bay camp and that another 39 are currently being held by in secret us detention facilities . in all , more than 75 countries were admonished in the report for their human rights situation .
among the countries with the most atrocities were chad , the democratic republic of congo , somalia , ethiopia , sri lanka , iraq , and the sudanese region of darfur . burma , china , cuba , eritrea , libya , iran , north korea , saudi arabia and vietnam were named as being closed societies or under severe repression . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's comfortable , there is food and drink at hand and no noisy crowds pushing you around .
and yet , a killer could be stalking you . soccer can be a dangerous business for committed fans .
in the stadiums themselves , supporters face a number of medical risks including serious bladder episodes brought on by too many half-time beers , temporary bouts of tourette 's syndrome and , in the case of england fans , actual death through boredom .
no one who follows a team with passion should take their allegiance lightly .
it can seriously damage your health . those who have ever watched their team 's chances of success end in the lottery of a penalty shoot-out will already know this .
but if anyone was in doubt about the potential danger of staking your happiness on the fortune of 11 men running around on a soccer field , a group of german scientists have done the typically teutonic thing and proved it should be avoided . taking german fans who followed their team through the 2006 world cup as their case study group , the men in lab coats from munich 's ludwig-maximilians university have discovered that the risk of a heart attack or other cardiovascular problem in male fans increased three-fold on days when the german team was in action . it was n't just irrational and emotionally charged fans on the edge of their stadium seats who were suffering .
victims also included over-stressed fans watching the game in the comfort of their own homes .
and they were n't all men , either : female fans also recorded a rise in emergencies , with the amount of heart incidents in women rising by 82 percent during the tournament . the researchers came to their conclusions after reviewing 4,279 medical reports from the seven days the german team played in the 2006 world cup , the 24 days when matches involved teams from other countries , and 242 other days in 2003 , 2005 and 2006 . paying the penalty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's super-fit players handled the shoot-out well the research showed that cardiac emergencies usually occurred within two hours of the start of a match , which would explain why the largest number of attacks occurred during the june 30 quarter-final in which germany defeated argentina in a dramatic penalty shoot-out .
after 90 minutes of regular time and an additional 30 minutes of extra-time , german fans found themselves entering the danger zone and 64 of them suffered heart attacks as a result . the next game , germany 's semi-final loss to italy which went into extra-time , produced almost as many heart attacks . " apparently , of prime importance for triggering a stress-induced event is not the outcome of a game - a win or a loss - but rather the intense strain and excitement experienced during the viewing of a dramatic match , such as one with a penalty shoot-out , " the research report , published in the new england journal of medicine , stated . hosts ' march raises pulses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just remember to breathe watching jürgen klinsmann 's team throughout the world cup on home soil was a potential killer for german fans as six of the seven games in which the team participated were associated with an increase in the number of cardiac emergencies . the only game which produced no spike in heart-related problems was the third-place match in which germany defeated portugal 3-1 .
presumably , with the main prize out of contention , more of the pressure was off and fans could relax their heart valves . while the excitement of germany 's march to the semi-finals was a contributing factor to the increase in heart episodes , others were cited by the report .
fans might have been subject to risk factors such as lack of sleep , overeating , consumption of junk food , alcohol and smoking during the world cup , which would not have helped to keep them in tip-top physical condition for the rigors of supporting germany . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but they have n't been particularly successful . they could potentially be kingmakers and help andrea ypsilanti , the chairwoman of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in the western german state of hesse , get a majority after a closely contested election in which incumbent roland koch 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- won the vote by a wafer-thin margin . but the left party remains an unwanted child in the german political landscape .
though the far-left party is now represented in two state parliaments in western germany , ypsilanti has vowed she will not form a government with them .
and all established parties in germany - whether on the left or right of center - shun the group . left party seen as communist relic for many western germans , the left party is still a relic of former communist east germany , according to tim spier , a political scientist at the institute for party law and research at the university of düsseldorf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prominent faces of germany 's left party - gregor gysi , left , and petra pau forged from the debris of the east german ruling party after reunification in 1990 and known then as the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the left party reached its present incarnation last year when it was joined by a stream of trade unionists , discontented westerners and social democratic party members unhappy with former chancellor gerhard schröder 's package of far-reaching social security and labor market reforms . the origins of the western side of the party as a splinter movement within the social democratic family have left deep wounds .
while the spd and the left party rule together in the city-state of berlin and have at times cooperated in eastern german states , the social democrats refuse to consider a so-called " red-red " coalition in a western state , let alone at the federal level . " it has to be said that in germany , a part of the left still continues in the tradition of the pds and the additional problem is that we have a remnant of the sed -lsb- the former east german ruling party -rsb- there , " said spier .
" west germans have a problem accepting that . " far-left parties in europe enjoy support the situation is distinctly different in other parts of europe where parties left of social democracy are often part of the mainstream political establishment .
in france , sweden and italy , for instance , such parties have been part of national governments . " in the 1970s there was a long period where many traditional communist parties were much more successful than other parties - for instance in france , " spier said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outside russia , communist parties also enjoyed support in europe far-left parties in western europe may have emerged from different ideological traditions and have heterogeneous historical roots . " but they can still be considered as part of a larger family of parties , " said spier . a large chunk of these far-left parties were former communist parties who reinvented themselves after the end of the cold war .
others broke away from the communists much earlier , formed maoist splinter groups to an extent , and finally evolved into moderate left-wing groups . the most successful far-left party in europe is the socialist party in the netherlands . " they took 16.6 percent of the vote in the last parliamentary election , " spier said . far-left parties are also well-established in scandinavia , where they enjoy considerable support among voters - around 10 percent .
for instance , denmark 's socialist people 's party , norway 's socialist left party , sweden 's left party and finland 's left alliance are all far-left parties but represent a more ecological and social stance . far-left parties in italy and france too enjoy popular support .
" though these parties present a significantly moderate face , their rhetoric and their names betray their communist legacy , " said spier . reform-friendly social democrats helped rise of far-left in germany , there was no serious force left of the social democrats and the green party for a long time .
the communist party of germany -lrb- kpd -rrb- was relatively strong during the weimar republic between 1919 and 1933 but was later banned in the 1950s .
the newly formed german communist party -lrb- dkp -rrb- did n't manage to overcome its status as a splinter group .
it was only with reunification in 1990 and the transformation of the sed into the pds , that a political force left of the social democrats take shape .
the party needed until 2005 to become a nation-wide political forced to be reckoned with . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair and schröder 's reform-friendly social democracy has fueled the rise of the far-left the rise of far-left parties in europe has largely been thanks to the social democrats , in particular what tony blair referred to as " new labour " and gerhard schröder the " new center . "
the move away from traditional , labor-friendly politics has indeed fueled the march of the far-left . " the social democrats who remained traditional , as in the case of france , managed to marginalize far-left parties , " said spier . on the other hand , those who turned particularly reform-friendly , such as the social democrats in germany , the netherlands and denmark , have lost large chunks of their traditional voter base to the far-left . " a real dilemma " the far-left in some parts of europe has also made it as far as into national governments - in france , sweden , italy and presently in norway .
but such coalitions have rarely been especially successful . in 1998 , the social democratic party in sweden entered a coalition with the left party and the greens .
one result was that support for the far-left quickly eroded . " we do n't regret being part of the coalition , we could certainly air some of our views , " said gudrun utas of sweden 's left party .
" but we did n't have positive experiences . " after four years of being part of the government , her far-left party has managed to attract just 5 percent of the vote - a far cry from their historic high of 12.8 percent in 1998 . " it 's a real dilemma , " said spier .
" at first , the far-left in sweden profited from the social democrats ' move to the center .
but once they took on governing responsibilities , the far-left lost its halo - as well as votes . "
at the same time , the social democrats won the majority it needed to govern thanks to the far-left . the swedish example may hold lessons for andrea ypsilanti .

he sees the company as becoming one of europe 's top three providers within the decade . rene obermann , 44 , became ceo of deutsche telekom in november 2006 .
prior to that , he served as ceo of t-mobile international , a subsidiary of deutsche telekom . dw-radio : the federal network agency , germany 's telecommunications authority , is celebrating its 10th anniversary this year .
is that a reason for you to celebrate ? rene obermann : in the past 12 months , we 've done much better in this field of regulated competition and increased our market share .
i think that regulation is there where the market is intensely competitive , which is the case with us .
we have price cuts of 90 percent in some areas and a lot of competitors .
regulation is , then , a part of general competition law .
for me , the regulation authority is , for the most part , an example of successful politics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom , based in bonn , has only partially been privatized you 've said deutsche telekom has an 80 percent market share when it comes to standard telephone customers -lsb- which the authorities view as being too high -rsb- .
when will the regulation authority leave you alone in this area and let you do your work ? it 's a bit speculative , but even when the anti-trust commission and the regulation authority believe that we no longer have a monopolistic position - which will take time , i think - we will still forego telephone connections .
there 's no way around it .
the important thing is that we continue to grow with broad-band and mobile connections and with innovative value-added services . you 're not the only ones in europe in this situation .
other former monopolies like france telecom have similar problems .
how do you see yourself in comparison to the other european telecommunications companies ? stronger and stronger .
we 've worked on our competitiveness and taken a serious look at our cost structures .
we 've made progress in innovation , for example with internet-based television and with mobile internet .
we 're well positioned .
our marketing department is the strongest in germany and our service is getting better and better .
deutsche telekom is developing in the right direction . where do you see deutsche telekom in 10 years ? as one of the leading international providers of services for networked living and working - i 'd say among the top three .
that would be something to aim for in the next 10 years . interview : henrik böhme -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

china , turkey and the us were also reprimanded by the group . in a report released on thursday , jan .
31 , human rights watch chastised europe and the us for tolerating unjust elections this past year in places including russia , jordan and nigeria . " by allowing autocrats to pose as democrats without demanding they uphold the civil and political rights that make democracy meaningful , the united states , the european union and other influential democracies risk undermining human rights worldwide , " the new york-based rights group said in its annual report . fair elections are not the only essential component to democracy , said hrw , adding that a free press , freedom of assembly and free speech are also crucial . the european union 's stance on russia received special condemnation from the human right 's group , which said the 27-member bloc put political ties with an important energy supplier ahead of a responsibility to address moscow 's human rights ' record . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu should have taken a much harder line with russia , the ngo said " human rights did not figure prominently in the broader eu-russia agenda , " the report said .
" although the german eu presidency raised human rights issues at the may eu-russia summit ... this stance was compromised by subsequent statements made by the portuguese presidency equating the raising of human rights issues with inappropriate ' lecturing . " ' bad news for eu hopeful turkey was taken to task in the report for violating free speech .
the country has begun accession talks with the european union , but human rights remain a key issue in the discussion . " the criminalization of speech remains a key obstacle to the protection of human rights in turkey , contributing to an atmosphere of intolerance that assumed violent proportions in 2007 , " the report said . hrw recalled the ethnic armenian journalist hrant dink , who was shot dead in istanbul in january last year after labeling as genocide the world war i massacres of armenians in the ottoman empire . pre-olympic slip bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has n't kept its promise to improve human rights before the olympics in the global spotlight ahead of the 2008 olympic games , host country china has promised to improve the human rights situation within its borders .
instead , preparations have only led to more violations , said hrw , including evictions of residents for olympic construction , abysmal work conditions and tighter restrictions on government critics . " official efforts to rid beijing of undesirables ahead of the olympics have accelerated the eviction of petitioners - citizens from the countryside who come to the capital seeking redress for grievances ranging from illegal land seizures to official corruption , " said the report . hrw director kenneth roth on thursday urged the world to put pressure on china to ameliorate the situation before the games . " the olympics are a historic opportunity for the chinese government to show the world that it can make human rights a reality for its 1.4 billion citizens , " said roth . the anti-terror campaign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us was accused of holding prisoners without trial at guantanamo bay not only the us , but also france , pakistan and great britain were criticized by hrw for breaching human rights in the name of the " war on terror . "
the american prison in cuba came under fire , in particular . " there is no evidence of progress concerning the treatment of so-called enemy combatants , including those held at guantanamo bay , or the use of secret detention facilities " in foreign countries , the report said . hrw estimated that 275 people are still imprisoned at the guantanamo bay camp and that another 39 are currently being held by in secret us detention facilities . in all , more than 75 countries were admonished in the report for their human rights situation .
among the countries with the most atrocities were chad , the democratic republic of congo , somalia , ethiopia , sri lanka , iraq , and the sudanese region of darfur . burma , china , cuba , eritrea , libya , iran , north korea , saudi arabia and vietnam were named as being closed societies or under severe repression . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but they have n't been particularly successful . they could potentially be kingmakers and help andrea ypsilanti , the chairwoman of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in the western german state of hesse , get a majority after a closely contested election in which incumbent roland koch 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- won the vote by a wafer-thin margin . but the left party remains an unwanted child in the german political landscape .
though the far-left party is now represented in two state parliaments in western germany , ypsilanti has vowed she will not form a government with them .
and all established parties in germany - whether on the left or right of center - shun the group . left party seen as communist relic for many western germans , the left party is still a relic of former communist east germany , according to tim spier , a political scientist at the institute for party law and research at the university of düsseldorf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prominent faces of germany 's left party - gregor gysi , left , and petra pau forged from the debris of the east german ruling party after reunification in 1990 and known then as the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the left party reached its present incarnation last year when it was joined by a stream of trade unionists , discontented westerners and social democratic party members unhappy with former chancellor gerhard schröder 's package of far-reaching social security and labor market reforms . the origins of the western side of the party as a splinter movement within the social democratic family have left deep wounds .
while the spd and the left party rule together in the city-state of berlin and have at times cooperated in eastern german states , the social democrats refuse to consider a so-called " red-red " coalition in a western state , let alone at the federal level . " it has to be said that in germany , a part of the left still continues in the tradition of the pds and the additional problem is that we have a remnant of the sed -lsb- the former east german ruling party -rsb- there , " said spier .
" west germans have a problem accepting that . " far-left parties in europe enjoy support the situation is distinctly different in other parts of europe where parties left of social democracy are often part of the mainstream political establishment .
in france , sweden and italy , for instance , such parties have been part of national governments . " in the 1970s there was a long period where many traditional communist parties were much more successful than other parties - for instance in france , " spier said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outside russia , communist parties also enjoyed support in europe far-left parties in western europe may have emerged from different ideological traditions and have heterogeneous historical roots . " but they can still be considered as part of a larger family of parties , " said spier . a large chunk of these far-left parties were former communist parties who reinvented themselves after the end of the cold war .
others broke away from the communists much earlier , formed maoist splinter groups to an extent , and finally evolved into moderate left-wing groups . the most successful far-left party in europe is the socialist party in the netherlands . " they took 16.6 percent of the vote in the last parliamentary election , " spier said . far-left parties are also well-established in scandinavia , where they enjoy considerable support among voters - around 10 percent .
for instance , denmark 's socialist people 's party , norway 's socialist left party , sweden 's left party and finland 's left alliance are all far-left parties but represent a more ecological and social stance . far-left parties in italy and france too enjoy popular support .
" though these parties present a significantly moderate face , their rhetoric and their names betray their communist legacy , " said spier . reform-friendly social democrats helped rise of far-left in germany , there was no serious force left of the social democrats and the green party for a long time .
the communist party of germany -lrb- kpd -rrb- was relatively strong during the weimar republic between 1919 and 1933 but was later banned in the 1950s .
the newly formed german communist party -lrb- dkp -rrb- did n't manage to overcome its status as a splinter group .
it was only with reunification in 1990 and the transformation of the sed into the pds , that a political force left of the social democrats take shape .
the party needed until 2005 to become a nation-wide political forced to be reckoned with . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair and schröder 's reform-friendly social democracy has fueled the rise of the far-left the rise of far-left parties in europe has largely been thanks to the social democrats , in particular what tony blair referred to as " new labour " and gerhard schröder the " new center . "
the move away from traditional , labor-friendly politics has indeed fueled the march of the far-left . " the social democrats who remained traditional , as in the case of france , managed to marginalize far-left parties , " said spier . on the other hand , those who turned particularly reform-friendly , such as the social democrats in germany , the netherlands and denmark , have lost large chunks of their traditional voter base to the far-left . " a real dilemma " the far-left in some parts of europe has also made it as far as into national governments - in france , sweden , italy and presently in norway .
but such coalitions have rarely been especially successful . in 1998 , the social democratic party in sweden entered a coalition with the left party and the greens .
one result was that support for the far-left quickly eroded . " we do n't regret being part of the coalition , we could certainly air some of our views , " said gudrun utas of sweden 's left party .
" but we did n't have positive experiences . " after four years of being part of the government , her far-left party has managed to attract just 5 percent of the vote - a far cry from their historic high of 12.8 percent in 1998 . " it 's a real dilemma , " said spier .
" at first , the far-left in sweden profited from the social democrats ' move to the center .
but once they took on governing responsibilities , the far-left lost its halo - as well as votes . "
at the same time , the social democrats won the majority it needed to govern thanks to the far-left . the swedish example may hold lessons for andrea ypsilanti .

china , turkey and the us were also reprimanded by the group . in a report released on thursday , jan .
31 , human rights watch chastised europe and the us for tolerating unjust elections this past year in places including russia , jordan and nigeria . " by allowing autocrats to pose as democrats without demanding they uphold the civil and political rights that make democracy meaningful , the united states , the european union and other influential democracies risk undermining human rights worldwide , " the new york-based rights group said in its annual report . fair elections are not the only essential component to democracy , said hrw , adding that a free press , freedom of assembly and free speech are also crucial . the european union 's stance on russia received special condemnation from the human right 's group , which said the 27-member bloc put political ties with an important energy supplier ahead of a responsibility to address moscow 's human rights ' record . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu should have taken a much harder line with russia , the ngo said " human rights did not figure prominently in the broader eu-russia agenda , " the report said .

" ' bad news for eu hopeful turkey was taken to task in the report for violating free speech .
the country has begun accession talks with the european union , but human rights remain a key issue in the discussion . " the criminalization of speech remains a key obstacle to the protection of human rights in turkey , contributing to an atmosphere of intolerance that assumed violent proportions in 2007 , " the report said . hrw recalled the ethnic armenian journalist hrant dink , who was shot dead in istanbul in january last year after labeling as genocide the world war i massacres of armenians in the ottoman empire . pre-olympic slip bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has n't kept its promise to improve human rights before the olympics in the global spotlight ahead of the 2008 olympic games , host country china has promised to improve the human rights situation within its borders .
instead , preparations have only led to more violations , said hrw , including evictions of residents for olympic construction , abysmal work conditions and tighter restrictions on government critics . " official efforts to rid beijing of undesirables ahead of the olympics have accelerated the eviction of petitioners - citizens from the countryside who come to the capital seeking redress for grievances ranging from illegal land seizures to official corruption , " said the report . hrw director kenneth roth on thursday urged the world to put pressure on china to ameliorate the situation before the games . " the olympics are a historic opportunity for the chinese government to show the world that it can make human rights a reality for its 1.4 billion citizens , " said roth . the anti-terror campaign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us was accused of holding prisoners without trial at guantanamo bay not only the us , but also france , pakistan and great britain were criticized by hrw for breaching human rights in the name of the " war on terror . "
the american prison in cuba came under fire , in particular . " there is no evidence of progress concerning the treatment of so-called enemy combatants , including those held at guantanamo bay , or the use of secret detention facilities " in foreign countries , the report said . hrw estimated that 275 people are still imprisoned at the guantanamo bay camp and that another 39 are currently being held by in secret us detention facilities . in all , more than 75 countries were admonished in the report for their human rights situation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 31.01.2008 shunned in germany , far-left gets support elsewhere in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : die linke - germany 's left party - has steadily increased its voter base while the left party in germany is cold-shouldered by all established political groupings , other european nations ' far-left parties are often part of ruling coalitions .
but they have n't been particularly successful . they could potentially be kingmakers and help andrea ypsilanti , the chairwoman of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in the western german state of hesse , get a majority after a closely contested election in which incumbent roland koch 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- won the vote by a wafer-thin margin . but the left party remains an unwanted child in the german political landscape .
though the far-left party is now represented in two state parliaments in western germany , ypsilanti has vowed she will not form a government with them .
and all established parties in germany - whether on the left or right of center - shun the group . left party seen as communist relic for many western germans , the left party is still a relic of former communist east germany , according to tim spier , a political scientist at the institute for party law and research at the university of düsseldorf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prominent faces of germany 's left party - gregor gysi , left , and petra pau forged from the debris of the east german ruling party after reunification in 1990 and known then as the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the left party reached its present incarnation last year when it was joined by a stream of trade unionists , discontented westerners and social democratic party members unhappy with former chancellor gerhard schröder 's package of far-reaching social security and labor market reforms . the origins of the western side of the party as a splinter movement within the social democratic family have left deep wounds .
while the spd and the left party rule together in the city-state of berlin and have at times cooperated in eastern german states , the social democrats refuse to consider a so-called " red-red " coalition in a western state , let alone at the federal level . " it has to be said that in germany , a part of the left still continues in the tradition of the pds and the additional problem is that we have a remnant of the sed -lsb- the former east german ruling party -rsb- there , " said spier .
" west germans have a problem accepting that . " far-left parties in europe enjoy support the situation is distinctly different in other parts of europe where parties left of social democracy are often part of the mainstream political establishment .
in france , sweden and italy , for instance , such parties have been part of national governments . " in the 1970s there was a long period where many traditional communist parties were much more successful than other parties - for instance in france , " spier said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outside russia , communist parties also enjoyed support in europe far-left parties in western europe may have emerged from different ideological traditions and have heterogeneous historical roots . " but they can still be considered as part of a larger family of parties , " said spier . a large chunk of these far-left parties were former communist parties who reinvented themselves after the end of the cold war .
others broke away from the communists much earlier , formed maoist splinter groups to an extent , and finally evolved into moderate left-wing groups . the most successful far-left party in europe is the socialist party in the netherlands . " they took 16.6 percent of the vote in the last parliamentary election , " spier said . far-left parties are also well-established in scandinavia , where they enjoy considerable support among voters - around 10 percent .
for instance , denmark 's socialist people 's party , norway 's socialist left party , sweden 's left party and finland 's left alliance are all far-left parties but represent a more ecological and social stance . far-left parties in italy and france too enjoy popular support .
" though these parties present a significantly moderate face , their rhetoric and their names betray their communist legacy , " said spier . reform-friendly social democrats helped rise of far-left in germany , there was no serious force left of the social democrats and the green party for a long time .
the communist party of germany -lrb- kpd -rrb- was relatively strong during the weimar republic between 1919 and 1933 but was later banned in the 1950s .
the newly formed german communist party -lrb- dkp -rrb- did n't manage to overcome its status as a splinter group .
it was only with reunification in 1990 and the transformation of the sed into the pds , that a political force left of the social democrats take shape .
the party needed until 2005 to become a nation-wide political forced to be reckoned with . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair and schröder 's reform-friendly social democracy has fueled the rise of the far-left the rise of far-left parties in europe has largely been thanks to the social democrats , in particular what tony blair referred to as " new labour " and gerhard schröder the " new center . "
the move away from traditional , labor-friendly politics has indeed fueled the march of the far-left . " the social democrats who remained traditional , as in the case of france , managed to marginalize far-left parties , " said spier . on the other hand , those who turned particularly reform-friendly , such as the social democrats in germany , the netherlands and denmark , have lost large chunks of their traditional voter base to the far-left . " a real dilemma " the far-left in some parts of europe has also made it as far as into national governments - in france , sweden , italy and presently in norway .
but such coalitions have rarely been especially successful . in 1998 , the social democratic party in sweden entered a coalition with the left party and the greens .
one result was that support for the far-left quickly eroded . " we do n't regret being part of the coalition , we could certainly air some of our views , " said gudrun utas of sweden 's left party .
" but we did n't have positive experiences . " after four years of being part of the government , her far-left party has managed to attract just 5 percent of the vote - a far cry from their historic high of 12.8 percent in 1998 . " it 's a real dilemma , " said spier .
" at first , the far-left in sweden profited from the social democrats ' move to the center .
but once they took on governing responsibilities , the far-left lost its halo - as well as votes . "
at the same time , the social democrats won the majority it needed to govern thanks to the far-left . the swedish example may hold lessons for andrea ypsilanti .
depending on the outcome of coalition talks among hesse 's parties , she may yet change her mind and get the left party on board after all in order to gain that magic majority . sejla didic -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

china , turkey and the us were also reprimanded by the group . in a report released on thursday , jan .
31 , human rights watch chastised europe and the us for tolerating unjust elections this past year in places including russia , jordan and nigeria . " by allowing autocrats to pose as democrats without demanding they uphold the civil and political rights that make democracy meaningful , the united states , the european union and other influential democracies risk undermining human rights worldwide , " the new york-based rights group said in its annual report . fair elections are not the only essential component to democracy , said hrw , adding that a free press , freedom of assembly and free speech are also crucial . the european union 's stance on russia received special condemnation from the human right 's group , which said the 27-member bloc put political ties with an important energy supplier ahead of a responsibility to address moscow 's human rights ' record . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu should have taken a much harder line with russia , the ngo said " human rights did not figure prominently in the broader eu-russia agenda , " the report said .
" although the german eu presidency raised human rights issues at the may eu-russia summit ... this stance was compromised by subsequent statements made by the portuguese presidency equating the raising of human rights issues with inappropriate ' lecturing . " ' bad news for eu hopeful turkey was taken to task in the report for violating free speech .
the country has begun accession talks with the european union , but human rights remain a key issue in the discussion . " the criminalization of speech remains a key obstacle to the protection of human rights in turkey , contributing to an atmosphere of intolerance that assumed violent proportions in 2007 , " the report said . hrw recalled the ethnic armenian journalist hrant dink , who was shot dead in istanbul in january last year after labeling as genocide the world war i massacres of armenians in the ottoman empire . pre-olympic slip bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has n't kept its promise to improve human rights before the olympics in the global spotlight ahead of the 2008 olympic games , host country china has promised to improve the human rights situation within its borders .
instead , preparations have only led to more violations , said hrw , including evictions of residents for olympic construction , abysmal work conditions and tighter restrictions on government critics . " official efforts to rid beijing of undesirables ahead of the olympics have accelerated the eviction of petitioners - citizens from the countryside who come to the capital seeking redress for grievances ranging from illegal land seizures to official corruption , " said the report . hrw director kenneth roth on thursday urged the world to put pressure on china to ameliorate the situation before the games . " the olympics are a historic opportunity for the chinese government to show the world that it can make human rights a reality for its 1.4 billion citizens , " said roth . the anti-terror campaign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us was accused of holding prisoners without trial at guantanamo bay not only the us , but also france , pakistan and great britain were criticized by hrw for breaching human rights in the name of the " war on terror . "
the american prison in cuba came under fire , in particular . " there is no evidence of progress concerning the treatment of so-called enemy combatants , including those held at guantanamo bay , or the use of secret detention facilities " in foreign countries , the report said . hrw estimated that 275 people are still imprisoned at the guantanamo bay camp and that another 39 are currently being held by in secret us detention facilities . in all , more than 75 countries were admonished in the report for their human rights situation .
among the countries with the most atrocities were chad , the democratic republic of congo , somalia , ethiopia , sri lanka , iraq , and the sudanese region of darfur . burma , china , cuba , eritrea , libya , iran , north korea , saudi arabia and vietnam were named as being closed societies or under severe repression . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 31.01.2008 german authorities slam " the god delusion " for kids großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the animals reach the conclusion that god would not be at home with any of the religions the german family ministry is pushing to have a book it says slurs judaism , christianity and islam labeled dangerous for children .
the book 's publisher says kids have a right to enlightenment . the german family ministry is pushing for the children 's book " how do i get to god , asked the small piglet , " by written by michael schmidt-salomon and illustrated by helge nyncke , to be included on a list of literature considered dangerous for young people . " the three large religions of the world , christianity , islam and judaism , are slurred in the book , " the ministry wrote in a december memo .
" the distinctive characteristics of each religion are made ridiculous . " the search for god bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the god delusion " for kids ?
the book tells the story of a piglet and a hedgehog , who discover a poster attached to their house that says : " if you do not know god , you are missing something ! " this frightens them because they had never suspected at all that anything was missing in their lives .
thus they set out to look for " god . "
along the way they encounter a rabbi , a bishop and a mufti who are portrayed as insane , violent and continually at each other 's throats . the rabbi is drawn in the same way as the caricatures from the propaganda of 1930 's germany ; corkscrew curls , fanatical lights in his eyes , a set of predator 's flashing teeth and hands like claws .
he reacts to the animals by flying into a rage , yelling at them that god had set out to destroy all life on earth at the time of noah and chases them away . the mufti fares little better .
while he greets both animals at first as a quiet man and invites them into his mosque , he soon changes into a ranting fanatic .
he assembles a baying islamic mob and holds the animals up in a clenched fist while condemning them to everlasting damnation through bared teeth and an unruly-looking beard . the insinuation here is that all visitors to mosques are extremists and every imam who appears reasonable is , in truth , nevertheless , a preacher of hate . animals reject religion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the three religious leaders are shown as being violent , insane and intolerant the bishop , a pale fat man with a clearly insinuated predilection for child abuse , makes up the unholy trinity which eventually convinces piglet and hedgehog , after they have survived the long search in the maze of religions , that nothing of any importance has been missing from their lives . " i think that god does n't even exist , " the hedgehog says at the end of the book .
" and if he does , than he definitely does n't live in -lsb- a synagogue , cathedral or mosque -rsb- . " published in october 2007 , the 20-page book 's publisher , alibri , said it was aware it was risking a political battle when it published the book . " it 's clear to me that putting a critique of religion in children 's bedrooms is a hot political topic , " alibri head gunnar schedel said . children 's " right to enlightenment " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bishop comes with obvious connotations calling the ministry 's accusations an " attack on freedom of expression , " the publisher said the book answers the question of whether a nonreligious child is missing part of life " from the perspective of secular humanism . " schedel added that the book is intended for nonreligious parents looking to provide their children with a critical view of religion . " all three religions are treated equally in the book , " he said .
" no one is negatively singled out . " author schmidt-salomon said the book was " desperately needed considering the enormous mass of religious children 's stories . "
he added that he the book offers children and their parents the opportunity to read about agnostic beliefs if they choose . " children also have a right to enlightenment , " he wrote on a web site set up dedicated to the book .
" they should not be left defenseless to the scientifically untenable and ethically problematic stories of religion . " the german department responsible for reviewing children 's literature is scheduled to discuss whether the book presents a danger to children 's upbringing in a march meeting . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's comfortable , there is food and drink at hand and no noisy crowds pushing you around .
and yet , a killer could be stalking you . soccer can be a dangerous business for committed fans .
in the stadiums themselves , supporters face a number of medical risks including serious bladder episodes brought on by too many half-time beers , temporary bouts of tourette 's syndrome and , in the case of england fans , actual death through boredom .
no one who follows a team with passion should take their allegiance lightly .
it can seriously damage your health . those who have ever watched their team 's chances of success end in the lottery of a penalty shoot-out will already know this .
but if anyone was in doubt about the potential danger of staking your happiness on the fortune of 11 men running around on a soccer field , a group of german scientists have done the typically teutonic thing and proved it should be avoided . taking german fans who followed their team through the 2006 world cup as their case study group , the men in lab coats from munich 's ludwig-maximilians university have discovered that the risk of a heart attack or other cardiovascular problem in male fans increased three-fold on days when the german team was in action . it was n't just irrational and emotionally charged fans on the edge of their stadium seats who were suffering .
victims also included over-stressed fans watching the game in the comfort of their own homes .
and they were n't all men , either : female fans also recorded a rise in emergencies , with the amount of heart incidents in women rising by 82 percent during the tournament . the researchers came to their conclusions after reviewing 4,279 medical reports from the seven days the german team played in the 2006 world cup , the 24 days when matches involved teams from other countries , and 242 other days in 2003 , 2005 and 2006 . paying the penalty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's super-fit players handled the shoot-out well the research showed that cardiac emergencies usually occurred within two hours of the start of a match , which would explain why the largest number of attacks occurred during the june 30 quarter-final in which germany defeated argentina in a dramatic penalty shoot-out .
after 90 minutes of regular time and an additional 30 minutes of extra-time , german fans found themselves entering the danger zone and 64 of them suffered heart attacks as a result . the next game , germany 's semi-final loss to italy which went into extra-time , produced almost as many heart attacks . " apparently , of prime importance for triggering a stress-induced event is not the outcome of a game - a win or a loss - but rather the intense strain and excitement experienced during the viewing of a dramatic match , such as one with a penalty shoot-out , " the research report , published in the new england journal of medicine , stated . hosts ' march raises pulses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just remember to breathe watching jürgen klinsmann 's team throughout the world cup on home soil was a potential killer for german fans as six of the seven games in which the team participated were associated with an increase in the number of cardiac emergencies . the only game which produced no spike in heart-related problems was the third-place match in which germany defeated portugal 3-1 .
presumably , with the main prize out of contention , more of the pressure was off and fans could relax their heart valves . while the excitement of germany 's march to the semi-finals was a contributing factor to the increase in heart episodes , others were cited by the report .
fans might have been subject to risk factors such as lack of sleep , overeating , consumption of junk food , alcohol and smoking during the world cup , which would not have helped to keep them in tip-top physical condition for the rigors of supporting germany . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 31.01.2008 shunned in germany , far-left gets support elsewhere in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : die linke - germany 's left party - has steadily increased its voter base while the left party in germany is cold-shouldered by all established political groupings , other european nations ' far-left parties are often part of ruling coalitions .
but they have n't been particularly successful . they could potentially be kingmakers and help andrea ypsilanti , the chairwoman of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in the western german state of hesse , get a majority after a closely contested election in which incumbent roland koch 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- won the vote by a wafer-thin margin . but the left party remains an unwanted child in the german political landscape .
though the far-left party is now represented in two state parliaments in western germany , ypsilanti has vowed she will not form a government with them .
and all established parties in germany - whether on the left or right of center - shun the group . left party seen as communist relic for many western germans , the left party is still a relic of former communist east germany , according to tim spier , a political scientist at the institute for party law and research at the university of düsseldorf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prominent faces of germany 's left party - gregor gysi , left , and petra pau forged from the debris of the east german ruling party after reunification in 1990 and known then as the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the left party reached its present incarnation last year when it was joined by a stream of trade unionists , discontented westerners and social democratic party members unhappy with former chancellor gerhard schröder 's package of far-reaching social security and labor market reforms . the origins of the western side of the party as a splinter movement within the social democratic family have left deep wounds .
while the spd and the left party rule together in the city-state of berlin and have at times cooperated in eastern german states , the social democrats refuse to consider a so-called " red-red " coalition in a western state , let alone at the federal level . " it has to be said that in germany , a part of the left still continues in the tradition of the pds and the additional problem is that we have a remnant of the sed -lsb- the former east german ruling party -rsb- there , " said spier .
" west germans have a problem accepting that . " far-left parties in europe enjoy support the situation is distinctly different in other parts of europe where parties left of social democracy are often part of the mainstream political establishment .
in france , sweden and italy , for instance , such parties have been part of national governments . " in the 1970s there was a long period where many traditional communist parties were much more successful than other parties - for instance in france , " spier said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outside russia , communist parties also enjoyed support in europe far-left parties in western europe may have emerged from different ideological traditions and have heterogeneous historical roots . " but they can still be considered as part of a larger family of parties , " said spier . a large chunk of these far-left parties were former communist parties who reinvented themselves after the end of the cold war .
others broke away from the communists much earlier , formed maoist splinter groups to an extent , and finally evolved into moderate left-wing groups . the most successful far-left party in europe is the socialist party in the netherlands . " they took 16.6 percent of the vote in the last parliamentary election , " spier said . far-left parties are also well-established in scandinavia , where they enjoy considerable support among voters - around 10 percent .
for instance , denmark 's socialist people 's party , norway 's socialist left party , sweden 's left party and finland 's left alliance are all far-left parties but represent a more ecological and social stance . far-left parties in italy and france too enjoy popular support .
" though these parties present a significantly moderate face , their rhetoric and their names betray their communist legacy , " said spier . reform-friendly social democrats helped rise of far-left in germany , there was no serious force left of the social democrats and the green party for a long time .
the communist party of germany -lrb- kpd -rrb- was relatively strong during the weimar republic between 1919 and 1933 but was later banned in the 1950s .
the newly formed german communist party -lrb- dkp -rrb- did n't manage to overcome its status as a splinter group .
it was only with reunification in 1990 and the transformation of the sed into the pds , that a political force left of the social democrats take shape .
the party needed until 2005 to become a nation-wide political forced to be reckoned with . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair and schröder 's reform-friendly social democracy has fueled the rise of the far-left the rise of far-left parties in europe has largely been thanks to the social democrats , in particular what tony blair referred to as " new labour " and gerhard schröder the " new center . "
the move away from traditional , labor-friendly politics has indeed fueled the march of the far-left . " the social democrats who remained traditional , as in the case of france , managed to marginalize far-left parties , " said spier . on the other hand , those who turned particularly reform-friendly , such as the social democrats in germany , the netherlands and denmark , have lost large chunks of their traditional voter base to the far-left . " a real dilemma " the far-left in some parts of europe has also made it as far as into national governments - in france , sweden , italy and presently in norway .
but such coalitions have rarely been especially successful . in 1998 , the social democratic party in sweden entered a coalition with the left party and the greens .
one result was that support for the far-left quickly eroded . " we do n't regret being part of the coalition , we could certainly air some of our views , " said gudrun utas of sweden 's left party .
" but we did n't have positive experiences . " after four years of being part of the government , her far-left party has managed to attract just 5 percent of the vote - a far cry from their historic high of 12.8 percent in 1998 . " it 's a real dilemma , " said spier .
" at first , the far-left in sweden profited from the social democrats ' move to the center .
but once they took on governing responsibilities , the far-left lost its halo - as well as votes . "
at the same time , the social democrats won the majority it needed to govern thanks to the far-left . the swedish example may hold lessons for andrea ypsilanti .
depending on the outcome of coalition talks among hesse 's parties , she may yet change her mind and get the left party on board after all in order to gain that magic majority . sejla didic -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the book 's publisher says kids have a right to enlightenment . the german family ministry is pushing for the children 's book " how do i get to god , asked the small piglet , " by written by michael schmidt-salomon and illustrated by helge nyncke , to be included on a list of literature considered dangerous for young people . " the three large religions of the world , christianity , islam and judaism , are slurred in the book , " the ministry wrote in a december memo .
" the distinctive characteristics of each religion are made ridiculous . " the search for god bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the god delusion " for kids ?
the book tells the story of a piglet and a hedgehog , who discover a poster attached to their house that says : " if you do not know god , you are missing something ! " this frightens them because they had never suspected at all that anything was missing in their lives .
thus they set out to look for " god . "
along the way they encounter a rabbi , a bishop and a mufti who are portrayed as insane , violent and continually at each other 's throats . the rabbi is drawn in the same way as the caricatures from the propaganda of 1930 's germany ; corkscrew curls , fanatical lights in his eyes , a set of predator 's flashing teeth and hands like claws .
he reacts to the animals by flying into a rage , yelling at them that god had set out to destroy all life on earth at the time of noah and chases them away . the mufti fares little better .
while he greets both animals at first as a quiet man and invites them into his mosque , he soon changes into a ranting fanatic .
he assembles a baying islamic mob and holds the animals up in a clenched fist while condemning them to everlasting damnation through bared teeth and an unruly-looking beard . the insinuation here is that all visitors to mosques are extremists and every imam who appears reasonable is , in truth , nevertheless , a preacher of hate . animals reject religion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the three religious leaders are shown as being violent , insane and intolerant the bishop , a pale fat man with a clearly insinuated predilection for child abuse , makes up the unholy trinity which eventually convinces piglet and hedgehog , after they have survived the long search in the maze of religions , that nothing of any importance has been missing from their lives . " i think that god does n't even exist , " the hedgehog says at the end of the book .
" and if he does , than he definitely does n't live in -lsb- a synagogue , cathedral or mosque -rsb- . " published in october 2007 , the 20-page book 's publisher , alibri , said it was aware it was risking a political battle when it published the book . " it 's clear to me that putting a critique of religion in children 's bedrooms is a hot political topic , " alibri head gunnar schedel said . children 's " right to enlightenment " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bishop comes with obvious connotations calling the ministry 's accusations an " attack on freedom of expression , " the publisher said the book answers the question of whether a nonreligious child is missing part of life " from the perspective of secular humanism . " schedel added that the book is intended for nonreligious parents looking to provide their children with a critical view of religion . " all three religions are treated equally in the book , " he said .
" no one is negatively singled out . " author schmidt-salomon said the book was " desperately needed considering the enormous mass of religious children 's stories . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 31.01.2008 shunned in germany , far-left gets support elsewhere in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : die linke - germany 's left party - has steadily increased its voter base while the left party in germany is cold-shouldered by all established political groupings , other european nations ' far-left parties are often part of ruling coalitions .
but they have n't been particularly successful . they could potentially be kingmakers and help andrea ypsilanti , the chairwoman of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in the western german state of hesse , get a majority after a closely contested election in which incumbent roland koch 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- won the vote by a wafer-thin margin . but the left party remains an unwanted child in the german political landscape .
though the far-left party is now represented in two state parliaments in western germany , ypsilanti has vowed she will not form a government with them .
and all established parties in germany - whether on the left or right of center - shun the group . left party seen as communist relic for many western germans , the left party is still a relic of former communist east germany , according to tim spier , a political scientist at the institute for party law and research at the university of düsseldorf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prominent faces of germany 's left party - gregor gysi , left , and petra pau forged from the debris of the east german ruling party after reunification in 1990 and known then as the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the left party reached its present incarnation last year when it was joined by a stream of trade unionists , discontented westerners and social democratic party members unhappy with former chancellor gerhard schröder 's package of far-reaching social security and labor market reforms . the origins of the western side of the party as a splinter movement within the social democratic family have left deep wounds .
while the spd and the left party rule together in the city-state of berlin and have at times cooperated in eastern german states , the social democrats refuse to consider a so-called " red-red " coalition in a western state , let alone at the federal level . " it has to be said that in germany , a part of the left still continues in the tradition of the pds and the additional problem is that we have a remnant of the sed -lsb- the former east german ruling party -rsb- there , " said spier .
" west germans have a problem accepting that . " far-left parties in europe enjoy support the situation is distinctly different in other parts of europe where parties left of social democracy are often part of the mainstream political establishment .
in france , sweden and italy , for instance , such parties have been part of national governments . " in the 1970s there was a long period where many traditional communist parties were much more successful than other parties - for instance in france , " spier said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outside russia , communist parties also enjoyed support in europe far-left parties in western europe may have emerged from different ideological traditions and have heterogeneous historical roots . " but they can still be considered as part of a larger family of parties , " said spier . a large chunk of these far-left parties were former communist parties who reinvented themselves after the end of the cold war .
others broke away from the communists much earlier , formed maoist splinter groups to an extent , and finally evolved into moderate left-wing groups . the most successful far-left party in europe is the socialist party in the netherlands . " they took 16.6 percent of the vote in the last parliamentary election , " spier said . far-left parties are also well-established in scandinavia , where they enjoy considerable support among voters - around 10 percent .
for instance , denmark 's socialist people 's party , norway 's socialist left party , sweden 's left party and finland 's left alliance are all far-left parties but represent a more ecological and social stance . far-left parties in italy and france too enjoy popular support .
" though these parties present a significantly moderate face , their rhetoric and their names betray their communist legacy , " said spier . reform-friendly social democrats helped rise of far-left in germany , there was no serious force left of the social democrats and the green party for a long time .
the communist party of germany -lrb- kpd -rrb- was relatively strong during the weimar republic between 1919 and 1933 but was later banned in the 1950s .
the newly formed german communist party -lrb- dkp -rrb- did n't manage to overcome its status as a splinter group .
it was only with reunification in 1990 and the transformation of the sed into the pds , that a political force left of the social democrats take shape .
the party needed until 2005 to become a nation-wide political forced to be reckoned with . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair and schröder 's reform-friendly social democracy has fueled the rise of the far-left the rise of far-left parties in europe has largely been thanks to the social democrats , in particular what tony blair referred to as " new labour " and gerhard schröder the " new center . "
the move away from traditional , labor-friendly politics has indeed fueled the march of the far-left . " the social democrats who remained traditional , as in the case of france , managed to marginalize far-left parties , " said spier . on the other hand , those who turned particularly reform-friendly , such as the social democrats in germany , the netherlands and denmark , have lost large chunks of their traditional voter base to the far-left . " a real dilemma " the far-left in some parts of europe has also made it as far as into national governments - in france , sweden , italy and presently in norway .
but such coalitions have rarely been especially successful . in 1998 , the social democratic party in sweden entered a coalition with the left party and the greens .
one result was that support for the far-left quickly eroded . " we do n't regret being part of the coalition , we could certainly air some of our views , " said gudrun utas of sweden 's left party .
" but we did n't have positive experiences . " after four years of being part of the government , her far-left party has managed to attract just 5 percent of the vote - a far cry from their historic high of 12.8 percent in 1998 . " it 's a real dilemma , " said spier .
" at first , the far-left in sweden profited from the social democrats ' move to the center .
but once they took on governing responsibilities , the far-left lost its halo - as well as votes . "
at the same time , the social democrats won the majority it needed to govern thanks to the far-left . the swedish example may hold lessons for andrea ypsilanti .
depending on the outcome of coalition talks among hesse 's parties , she may yet change her mind and get the left party on board after all in order to gain that magic majority . sejla didic -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but if anyone was in doubt about the potential danger of staking your happiness on the fortune of 11 men running around on a soccer field , a group of german scientists have done the typically teutonic thing and proved it should be avoided . taking german fans who followed their team through the 2006 world cup as their case study group , the men in lab coats from munich 's ludwig-maximilians university have discovered that the risk of a heart attack or other cardiovascular problem in male fans increased three-fold on days when the german team was in action . it was n't just irrational and emotionally charged fans on the edge of their stadium seats who were suffering .
victims also included over-stressed fans watching the game in the comfort of their own homes .
and they were n't all men , either : female fans also recorded a rise in emergencies , with the amount of heart incidents in women rising by 82 percent during the tournament . the researchers came to their conclusions after reviewing 4,279 medical reports from the seven days the german team played in the 2006 world cup , the 24 days when matches involved teams from other countries , and 242 other days in 2003 , 2005 and 2006 . paying the penalty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's super-fit players handled the shoot-out well the research showed that cardiac emergencies usually occurred within two hours of the start of a match , which would explain why the largest number of attacks occurred during the june 30 quarter-final in which germany defeated argentina in a dramatic penalty shoot-out .
after 90 minutes of regular time and an additional 30 minutes of extra-time , german fans found themselves entering the danger zone and 64 of them suffered heart attacks as a result . the next game , germany 's semi-final loss to italy which went into extra-time , produced almost as many heart attacks . " apparently , of prime importance for triggering a stress-induced event is not the outcome of a game - a win or a loss - but rather the intense strain and excitement experienced during the viewing of a dramatic match , such as one with a penalty shoot-out , " the research report , published in the new england journal of medicine , stated . hosts ' march raises pulses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just remember to breathe watching jürgen klinsmann 's team throughout the world cup on home soil was a potential killer for german fans as six of the seven games in which the team participated were associated with an increase in the number of cardiac emergencies . the only game which produced no spike in heart-related problems was the third-place match in which germany defeated portugal 3-1 .

it 's comfortable , there is food and drink at hand and no noisy crowds pushing you around .
and yet , a killer could be stalking you . soccer can be a dangerous business for committed fans .
in the stadiums themselves , supporters face a number of medical risks including serious bladder episodes brought on by too many half-time beers , temporary bouts of tourette 's syndrome and , in the case of england fans , actual death through boredom .
no one who follows a team with passion should take their allegiance lightly .
it can seriously damage your health . those who have ever watched their team 's chances of success end in the lottery of a penalty shoot-out will already know this .
but if anyone was in doubt about the potential danger of staking your happiness on the fortune of 11 men running around on a soccer field , a group of german scientists have done the typically teutonic thing and proved it should be avoided . taking german fans who followed their team through the 2006 world cup as their case study group , the men in lab coats from munich 's ludwig-maximilians university have discovered that the risk of a heart attack or other cardiovascular problem in male fans increased three-fold on days when the german team was in action . it was n't just irrational and emotionally charged fans on the edge of their stadium seats who were suffering .
victims also included over-stressed fans watching the game in the comfort of their own homes .
and they were n't all men , either : female fans also recorded a rise in emergencies , with the amount of heart incidents in women rising by 82 percent during the tournament . the researchers came to their conclusions after reviewing 4,279 medical reports from the seven days the german team played in the 2006 world cup , the 24 days when matches involved teams from other countries , and 242 other days in 2003 , 2005 and 2006 . paying the penalty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's super-fit players handled the shoot-out well the research showed that cardiac emergencies usually occurred within two hours of the start of a match , which would explain why the largest number of attacks occurred during the june 30 quarter-final in which germany defeated argentina in a dramatic penalty shoot-out .
after 90 minutes of regular time and an additional 30 minutes of extra-time , german fans found themselves entering the danger zone and 64 of them suffered heart attacks as a result . the next game , germany 's semi-final loss to italy which went into extra-time , produced almost as many heart attacks . " apparently , of prime importance for triggering a stress-induced event is not the outcome of a game - a win or a loss - but rather the intense strain and excitement experienced during the viewing of a dramatic match , such as one with a penalty shoot-out , " the research report , published in the new england journal of medicine , stated . hosts ' march raises pulses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just remember to breathe watching jürgen klinsmann 's team throughout the world cup on home soil was a potential killer for german fans as six of the seven games in which the team participated were associated with an increase in the number of cardiac emergencies . the only game which produced no spike in heart-related problems was the third-place match in which germany defeated portugal 3-1 .
presumably , with the main prize out of contention , more of the pressure was off and fans could relax their heart valves . while the excitement of germany 's march to the semi-finals was a contributing factor to the increase in heart episodes , others were cited by the report .
fans might have been subject to risk factors such as lack of sleep , overeating , consumption of junk food , alcohol and smoking during the world cup , which would not have helped to keep them in tip-top physical condition for the rigors of supporting germany . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

china , turkey and the us were also reprimanded by the group . in a report released on thursday , jan .
31 , human rights watch chastised europe and the us for tolerating unjust elections this past year in places including russia , jordan and nigeria . " by allowing autocrats to pose as democrats without demanding they uphold the civil and political rights that make democracy meaningful , the united states , the european union and other influential democracies risk undermining human rights worldwide , " the new york-based rights group said in its annual report . fair elections are not the only essential component to democracy , said hrw , adding that a free press , freedom of assembly and free speech are also crucial . the european union 's stance on russia received special condemnation from the human right 's group , which said the 27-member bloc put political ties with an important energy supplier ahead of a responsibility to address moscow 's human rights ' record . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu should have taken a much harder line with russia , the ngo said " human rights did not figure prominently in the broader eu-russia agenda , " the report said .
" although the german eu presidency raised human rights issues at the may eu-russia summit ... this stance was compromised by subsequent statements made by the portuguese presidency equating the raising of human rights issues with inappropriate ' lecturing . " ' bad news for eu hopeful turkey was taken to task in the report for violating free speech .
the country has begun accession talks with the european union , but human rights remain a key issue in the discussion . " the criminalization of speech remains a key obstacle to the protection of human rights in turkey , contributing to an atmosphere of intolerance that assumed violent proportions in 2007 , " the report said . hrw recalled the ethnic armenian journalist hrant dink , who was shot dead in istanbul in january last year after labeling as genocide the world war i massacres of armenians in the ottoman empire . pre-olympic slip bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has n't kept its promise to improve human rights before the olympics in the global spotlight ahead of the 2008 olympic games , host country china has promised to improve the human rights situation within its borders .
instead , preparations have only led to more violations , said hrw , including evictions of residents for olympic construction , abysmal work conditions and tighter restrictions on government critics . " official efforts to rid beijing of undesirables ahead of the olympics have accelerated the eviction of petitioners - citizens from the countryside who come to the capital seeking redress for grievances ranging from illegal land seizures to official corruption , " said the report . hrw director kenneth roth on thursday urged the world to put pressure on china to ameliorate the situation before the games . " the olympics are a historic opportunity for the chinese government to show the world that it can make human rights a reality for its 1.4 billion citizens , " said roth . the anti-terror campaign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us was accused of holding prisoners without trial at guantanamo bay not only the us , but also france , pakistan and great britain were criticized by hrw for breaching human rights in the name of the " war on terror . "
the american prison in cuba came under fire , in particular . " there is no evidence of progress concerning the treatment of so-called enemy combatants , including those held at guantanamo bay , or the use of secret detention facilities " in foreign countries , the report said . hrw estimated that 275 people are still imprisoned at the guantanamo bay camp and that another 39 are currently being held by in secret us detention facilities . in all , more than 75 countries were admonished in the report for their human rights situation .
among the countries with the most atrocities were chad , the democratic republic of congo , somalia , ethiopia , sri lanka , iraq , and the sudanese region of darfur . burma , china , cuba , eritrea , libya , iran , north korea , saudi arabia and vietnam were named as being closed societies or under severe repression . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's comfortable , there is food and drink at hand and no noisy crowds pushing you around .
and yet , a killer could be stalking you . soccer can be a dangerous business for committed fans .
in the stadiums themselves , supporters face a number of medical risks including serious bladder episodes brought on by too many half-time beers , temporary bouts of tourette 's syndrome and , in the case of england fans , actual death through boredom .
no one who follows a team with passion should take their allegiance lightly .
it can seriously damage your health . those who have ever watched their team 's chances of success end in the lottery of a penalty shoot-out will already know this .
but if anyone was in doubt about the potential danger of staking your happiness on the fortune of 11 men running around on a soccer field , a group of german scientists have done the typically teutonic thing and proved it should be avoided . taking german fans who followed their team through the 2006 world cup as their case study group , the men in lab coats from munich 's ludwig-maximilians university have discovered that the risk of a heart attack or other cardiovascular problem in male fans increased three-fold on days when the german team was in action . it was n't just irrational and emotionally charged fans on the edge of their stadium seats who were suffering .
victims also included over-stressed fans watching the game in the comfort of their own homes .
and they were n't all men , either : female fans also recorded a rise in emergencies , with the amount of heart incidents in women rising by 82 percent during the tournament . the researchers came to their conclusions after reviewing 4,279 medical reports from the seven days the german team played in the 2006 world cup , the 24 days when matches involved teams from other countries , and 242 other days in 2003 , 2005 and 2006 . paying the penalty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's super-fit players handled the shoot-out well the research showed that cardiac emergencies usually occurred within two hours of the start of a match , which would explain why the largest number of attacks occurred during the june 30 quarter-final in which germany defeated argentina in a dramatic penalty shoot-out .
after 90 minutes of regular time and an additional 30 minutes of extra-time , german fans found themselves entering the danger zone and 64 of them suffered heart attacks as a result . the next game , germany 's semi-final loss to italy which went into extra-time , produced almost as many heart attacks . " apparently , of prime importance for triggering a stress-induced event is not the outcome of a game - a win or a loss - but rather the intense strain and excitement experienced during the viewing of a dramatic match , such as one with a penalty shoot-out , " the research report , published in the new england journal of medicine , stated . hosts ' march raises pulses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just remember to breathe watching jürgen klinsmann 's team throughout the world cup on home soil was a potential killer for german fans as six of the seven games in which the team participated were associated with an increase in the number of cardiac emergencies . the only game which produced no spike in heart-related problems was the third-place match in which germany defeated portugal 3-1 .
presumably , with the main prize out of contention , more of the pressure was off and fans could relax their heart valves . while the excitement of germany 's march to the semi-finals was a contributing factor to the increase in heart episodes , others were cited by the report .
fans might have been subject to risk factors such as lack of sleep , overeating , consumption of junk food , alcohol and smoking during the world cup , which would not have helped to keep them in tip-top physical condition for the rigors of supporting germany . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he sees the company as becoming one of europe 's top three providers within the decade . rene obermann , 44 , became ceo of deutsche telekom in november 2006 .
prior to that , he served as ceo of t-mobile international , a subsidiary of deutsche telekom . dw-radio : the federal network agency , germany 's telecommunications authority , is celebrating its 10th anniversary this year .
is that a reason for you to celebrate ? rene obermann : in the past 12 months , we 've done much better in this field of regulated competition and increased our market share .
i think that regulation is there where the market is intensely competitive , which is the case with us .
we have price cuts of 90 percent in some areas and a lot of competitors .
regulation is , then , a part of general competition law .
for me , the regulation authority is , for the most part , an example of successful politics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom , based in bonn , has only partially been privatized you 've said deutsche telekom has an 80 percent market share when it comes to standard telephone customers -lsb- which the authorities view as being too high -rsb- .
when will the regulation authority leave you alone in this area and let you do your work ? it 's a bit speculative , but even when the anti-trust commission and the regulation authority believe that we no longer have a monopolistic position - which will take time , i think - we will still forego telephone connections .
there 's no way around it .
the important thing is that we continue to grow with broad-band and mobile connections and with innovative value-added services . you 're not the only ones in europe in this situation .
other former monopolies like france telecom have similar problems .
how do you see yourself in comparison to the other european telecommunications companies ? stronger and stronger .
we 've worked on our competitiveness and taken a serious look at our cost structures .
we 've made progress in innovation , for example with internet-based television and with mobile internet .
we 're well positioned .
our marketing department is the strongest in germany and our service is getting better and better .
deutsche telekom is developing in the right direction . where do you see deutsche telekom in 10 years ? as one of the leading international providers of services for networked living and working - i 'd say among the top three .
that would be something to aim for in the next 10 years . interview : henrik böhme -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 31.01.2008 shunned in germany , far-left gets support elsewhere in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : die linke - germany 's left party - has steadily increased its voter base while the left party in germany is cold-shouldered by all established political groupings , other european nations ' far-left parties are often part of ruling coalitions .
but they have n't been particularly successful . they could potentially be kingmakers and help andrea ypsilanti , the chairwoman of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in the western german state of hesse , get a majority after a closely contested election in which incumbent roland koch 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- won the vote by a wafer-thin margin . but the left party remains an unwanted child in the german political landscape .
though the far-left party is now represented in two state parliaments in western germany , ypsilanti has vowed she will not form a government with them .
and all established parties in germany - whether on the left or right of center - shun the group . left party seen as communist relic for many western germans , the left party is still a relic of former communist east germany , according to tim spier , a political scientist at the institute for party law and research at the university of düsseldorf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prominent faces of germany 's left party - gregor gysi , left , and petra pau forged from the debris of the east german ruling party after reunification in 1990 and known then as the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the left party reached its present incarnation last year when it was joined by a stream of trade unionists , discontented westerners and social democratic party members unhappy with former chancellor gerhard schröder 's package of far-reaching social security and labor market reforms . the origins of the western side of the party as a splinter movement within the social democratic family have left deep wounds .
while the spd and the left party rule together in the city-state of berlin and have at times cooperated in eastern german states , the social democrats refuse to consider a so-called " red-red " coalition in a western state , let alone at the federal level . " it has to be said that in germany , a part of the left still continues in the tradition of the pds and the additional problem is that we have a remnant of the sed -lsb- the former east german ruling party -rsb- there , " said spier .
" west germans have a problem accepting that . " far-left parties in europe enjoy support the situation is distinctly different in other parts of europe where parties left of social democracy are often part of the mainstream political establishment .
in france , sweden and italy , for instance , such parties have been part of national governments . " in the 1970s there was a long period where many traditional communist parties were much more successful than other parties - for instance in france , " spier said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outside russia , communist parties also enjoyed support in europe far-left parties in western europe may have emerged from different ideological traditions and have heterogeneous historical roots . " but they can still be considered as part of a larger family of parties , " said spier . a large chunk of these far-left parties were former communist parties who reinvented themselves after the end of the cold war .
others broke away from the communists much earlier , formed maoist splinter groups to an extent , and finally evolved into moderate left-wing groups . the most successful far-left party in europe is the socialist party in the netherlands . " they took 16.6 percent of the vote in the last parliamentary election , " spier said . far-left parties are also well-established in scandinavia , where they enjoy considerable support among voters - around 10 percent .
for instance , denmark 's socialist people 's party , norway 's socialist left party , sweden 's left party and finland 's left alliance are all far-left parties but represent a more ecological and social stance . far-left parties in italy and france too enjoy popular support .
" though these parties present a significantly moderate face , their rhetoric and their names betray their communist legacy , " said spier . reform-friendly social democrats helped rise of far-left in germany , there was no serious force left of the social democrats and the green party for a long time .
the communist party of germany -lrb- kpd -rrb- was relatively strong during the weimar republic between 1919 and 1933 but was later banned in the 1950s .
the newly formed german communist party -lrb- dkp -rrb- did n't manage to overcome its status as a splinter group .
it was only with reunification in 1990 and the transformation of the sed into the pds , that a political force left of the social democrats take shape .
the party needed until 2005 to become a nation-wide political forced to be reckoned with . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair and schröder 's reform-friendly social democracy has fueled the rise of the far-left the rise of far-left parties in europe has largely been thanks to the social democrats , in particular what tony blair referred to as " new labour " and gerhard schröder the " new center . "
the move away from traditional , labor-friendly politics has indeed fueled the march of the far-left . " the social democrats who remained traditional , as in the case of france , managed to marginalize far-left parties , " said spier . on the other hand , those who turned particularly reform-friendly , such as the social democrats in germany , the netherlands and denmark , have lost large chunks of their traditional voter base to the far-left . " a real dilemma " the far-left in some parts of europe has also made it as far as into national governments - in france , sweden , italy and presently in norway .
but such coalitions have rarely been especially successful . in 1998 , the social democratic party in sweden entered a coalition with the left party and the greens .
one result was that support for the far-left quickly eroded . " we do n't regret being part of the coalition , we could certainly air some of our views , " said gudrun utas of sweden 's left party .
" but we did n't have positive experiences . " after four years of being part of the government , her far-left party has managed to attract just 5 percent of the vote - a far cry from their historic high of 12.8 percent in 1998 . " it 's a real dilemma , " said spier .
" at first , the far-left in sweden profited from the social democrats ' move to the center .
but once they took on governing responsibilities , the far-left lost its halo - as well as votes . "
at the same time , the social democrats won the majority it needed to govern thanks to the far-left . the swedish example may hold lessons for andrea ypsilanti .
depending on the outcome of coalition talks among hesse 's parties , she may yet change her mind and get the left party on board after all in order to gain that magic majority . sejla didic -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but they have n't been particularly successful . they could potentially be kingmakers and help andrea ypsilanti , the chairwoman of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in the western german state of hesse , get a majority after a closely contested election in which incumbent roland koch 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- won the vote by a wafer-thin margin . but the left party remains an unwanted child in the german political landscape .
though the far-left party is now represented in two state parliaments in western germany , ypsilanti has vowed she will not form a government with them .
and all established parties in germany - whether on the left or right of center - shun the group . left party seen as communist relic for many western germans , the left party is still a relic of former communist east germany , according to tim spier , a political scientist at the institute for party law and research at the university of düsseldorf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prominent faces of germany 's left party - gregor gysi , left , and petra pau forged from the debris of the east german ruling party after reunification in 1990 and known then as the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the left party reached its present incarnation last year when it was joined by a stream of trade unionists , discontented westerners and social democratic party members unhappy with former chancellor gerhard schröder 's package of far-reaching social security and labor market reforms . the origins of the western side of the party as a splinter movement within the social democratic family have left deep wounds .
while the spd and the left party rule together in the city-state of berlin and have at times cooperated in eastern german states , the social democrats refuse to consider a so-called " red-red " coalition in a western state , let alone at the federal level . " it has to be said that in germany , a part of the left still continues in the tradition of the pds and the additional problem is that we have a remnant of the sed -lsb- the former east german ruling party -rsb- there , " said spier .
" west germans have a problem accepting that . " far-left parties in europe enjoy support the situation is distinctly different in other parts of europe where parties left of social democracy are often part of the mainstream political establishment .
in france , sweden and italy , for instance , such parties have been part of national governments . " in the 1970s there was a long period where many traditional communist parties were much more successful than other parties - for instance in france , " spier said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outside russia , communist parties also enjoyed support in europe far-left parties in western europe may have emerged from different ideological traditions and have heterogeneous historical roots . " but they can still be considered as part of a larger family of parties , " said spier . a large chunk of these far-left parties were former communist parties who reinvented themselves after the end of the cold war .
others broke away from the communists much earlier , formed maoist splinter groups to an extent , and finally evolved into moderate left-wing groups . the most successful far-left party in europe is the socialist party in the netherlands . " they took 16.6 percent of the vote in the last parliamentary election , " spier said . far-left parties are also well-established in scandinavia , where they enjoy considerable support among voters - around 10 percent .
for instance , denmark 's socialist people 's party , norway 's socialist left party , sweden 's left party and finland 's left alliance are all far-left parties but represent a more ecological and social stance . far-left parties in italy and france too enjoy popular support .
" though these parties present a significantly moderate face , their rhetoric and their names betray their communist legacy , " said spier . reform-friendly social democrats helped rise of far-left in germany , there was no serious force left of the social democrats and the green party for a long time .
the communist party of germany -lrb- kpd -rrb- was relatively strong during the weimar republic between 1919 and 1933 but was later banned in the 1950s .
the newly formed german communist party -lrb- dkp -rrb- did n't manage to overcome its status as a splinter group .
it was only with reunification in 1990 and the transformation of the sed into the pds , that a political force left of the social democrats take shape .
the party needed until 2005 to become a nation-wide political forced to be reckoned with . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair and schröder 's reform-friendly social democracy has fueled the rise of the far-left the rise of far-left parties in europe has largely been thanks to the social democrats , in particular what tony blair referred to as " new labour " and gerhard schröder the " new center . "
the move away from traditional , labor-friendly politics has indeed fueled the march of the far-left . " the social democrats who remained traditional , as in the case of france , managed to marginalize far-left parties , " said spier . on the other hand , those who turned particularly reform-friendly , such as the social democrats in germany , the netherlands and denmark , have lost large chunks of their traditional voter base to the far-left . " a real dilemma " the far-left in some parts of europe has also made it as far as into national governments - in france , sweden , italy and presently in norway .
but such coalitions have rarely been especially successful . in 1998 , the social democratic party in sweden entered a coalition with the left party and the greens .
one result was that support for the far-left quickly eroded . " we do n't regret being part of the coalition , we could certainly air some of our views , " said gudrun utas of sweden 's left party .
" but we did n't have positive experiences . " after four years of being part of the government , her far-left party has managed to attract just 5 percent of the vote - a far cry from their historic high of 12.8 percent in 1998 . " it 's a real dilemma , " said spier .
" at first , the far-left in sweden profited from the social democrats ' move to the center .
but once they took on governing responsibilities , the far-left lost its halo - as well as votes . "
at the same time , the social democrats won the majority it needed to govern thanks to the far-left . the swedish example may hold lessons for andrea ypsilanti .
depending on the outcome of coalition talks among hesse 's parties , she may yet change her mind and get the left party on board after all in order to gain that magic majority . sejla didic -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's comfortable , there is food and drink at hand and no noisy crowds pushing you around .
and yet , a killer could be stalking you . soccer can be a dangerous business for committed fans .
in the stadiums themselves , supporters face a number of medical risks including serious bladder episodes brought on by too many half-time beers , temporary bouts of tourette 's syndrome and , in the case of england fans , actual death through boredom .
no one who follows a team with passion should take their allegiance lightly .
it can seriously damage your health . those who have ever watched their team 's chances of success end in the lottery of a penalty shoot-out will already know this .
but if anyone was in doubt about the potential danger of staking your happiness on the fortune of 11 men running around on a soccer field , a group of german scientists have done the typically teutonic thing and proved it should be avoided . taking german fans who followed their team through the 2006 world cup as their case study group , the men in lab coats from munich 's ludwig-maximilians university have discovered that the risk of a heart attack or other cardiovascular problem in male fans increased three-fold on days when the german team was in action . it was n't just irrational and emotionally charged fans on the edge of their stadium seats who were suffering .
victims also included over-stressed fans watching the game in the comfort of their own homes .
and they were n't all men , either : female fans also recorded a rise in emergencies , with the amount of heart incidents in women rising by 82 percent during the tournament . the researchers came to their conclusions after reviewing 4,279 medical reports from the seven days the german team played in the 2006 world cup , the 24 days when matches involved teams from other countries , and 242 other days in 2003 , 2005 and 2006 . paying the penalty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's super-fit players handled the shoot-out well the research showed that cardiac emergencies usually occurred within two hours of the start of a match , which would explain why the largest number of attacks occurred during the june 30 quarter-final in which germany defeated argentina in a dramatic penalty shoot-out .
after 90 minutes of regular time and an additional 30 minutes of extra-time , german fans found themselves entering the danger zone and 64 of them suffered heart attacks as a result . the next game , germany 's semi-final loss to italy which went into extra-time , produced almost as many heart attacks . " apparently , of prime importance for triggering a stress-induced event is not the outcome of a game - a win or a loss - but rather the intense strain and excitement experienced during the viewing of a dramatic match , such as one with a penalty shoot-out , " the research report , published in the new england journal of medicine , stated . hosts ' march raises pulses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just remember to breathe watching jürgen klinsmann 's team throughout the world cup on home soil was a potential killer for german fans as six of the seven games in which the team participated were associated with an increase in the number of cardiac emergencies . the only game which produced no spike in heart-related problems was the third-place match in which germany defeated portugal 3-1 .
presumably , with the main prize out of contention , more of the pressure was off and fans could relax their heart valves . while the excitement of germany 's march to the semi-finals was a contributing factor to the increase in heart episodes , others were cited by the report .
fans might have been subject to risk factors such as lack of sleep , overeating , consumption of junk food , alcohol and smoking during the world cup , which would not have helped to keep them in tip-top physical condition for the rigors of supporting germany . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 31.01.2008 german authorities slam " the god delusion " for kids großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the animals reach the conclusion that god would not be at home with any of the religions the german family ministry is pushing to have a book it says slurs judaism , christianity and islam labeled dangerous for children .
the book 's publisher says kids have a right to enlightenment . the german family ministry is pushing for the children 's book " how do i get to god , asked the small piglet , " by written by michael schmidt-salomon and illustrated by helge nyncke , to be included on a list of literature considered dangerous for young people . " the three large religions of the world , christianity , islam and judaism , are slurred in the book , " the ministry wrote in a december memo .
" the distinctive characteristics of each religion are made ridiculous . " the search for god bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the god delusion " for kids ?
the book tells the story of a piglet and a hedgehog , who discover a poster attached to their house that says : " if you do not know god , you are missing something ! " this frightens them because they had never suspected at all that anything was missing in their lives .
thus they set out to look for " god . "
along the way they encounter a rabbi , a bishop and a mufti who are portrayed as insane , violent and continually at each other 's throats . the rabbi is drawn in the same way as the caricatures from the propaganda of 1930 's germany ; corkscrew curls , fanatical lights in his eyes , a set of predator 's flashing teeth and hands like claws .
he reacts to the animals by flying into a rage , yelling at them that god had set out to destroy all life on earth at the time of noah and chases them away . the mufti fares little better .
while he greets both animals at first as a quiet man and invites them into his mosque , he soon changes into a ranting fanatic .
he assembles a baying islamic mob and holds the animals up in a clenched fist while condemning them to everlasting damnation through bared teeth and an unruly-looking beard . the insinuation here is that all visitors to mosques are extremists and every imam who appears reasonable is , in truth , nevertheless , a preacher of hate . animals reject religion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the three religious leaders are shown as being violent , insane and intolerant the bishop , a pale fat man with a clearly insinuated predilection for child abuse , makes up the unholy trinity which eventually convinces piglet and hedgehog , after they have survived the long search in the maze of religions , that nothing of any importance has been missing from their lives . " i think that god does n't even exist , " the hedgehog says at the end of the book .
" and if he does , than he definitely does n't live in -lsb- a synagogue , cathedral or mosque -rsb- . " published in october 2007 , the 20-page book 's publisher , alibri , said it was aware it was risking a political battle when it published the book . " it 's clear to me that putting a critique of religion in children 's bedrooms is a hot political topic , " alibri head gunnar schedel said . children 's " right to enlightenment " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bishop comes with obvious connotations calling the ministry 's accusations an " attack on freedom of expression , " the publisher said the book answers the question of whether a nonreligious child is missing part of life " from the perspective of secular humanism . " schedel added that the book is intended for nonreligious parents looking to provide their children with a critical view of religion . " all three religions are treated equally in the book , " he said .
" no one is negatively singled out . " author schmidt-salomon said the book was " desperately needed considering the enormous mass of religious children 's stories . "
he added that he the book offers children and their parents the opportunity to read about agnostic beliefs if they choose . " children also have a right to enlightenment , " he wrote on a web site set up dedicated to the book .
" they should not be left defenseless to the scientifically untenable and ethically problematic stories of religion . " the german department responsible for reviewing children 's literature is scheduled to discuss whether the book presents a danger to children 's upbringing in a march meeting . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

china , turkey and the us were also reprimanded by the group . in a report released on thursday , jan .
31 , human rights watch chastised europe and the us for tolerating unjust elections this past year in places including russia , jordan and nigeria . " by allowing autocrats to pose as democrats without demanding they uphold the civil and political rights that make democracy meaningful , the united states , the european union and other influential democracies risk undermining human rights worldwide , " the new york-based rights group said in its annual report . fair elections are not the only essential component to democracy , said hrw , adding that a free press , freedom of assembly and free speech are also crucial . the european union 's stance on russia received special condemnation from the human right 's group , which said the 27-member bloc put political ties with an important energy supplier ahead of a responsibility to address moscow 's human rights ' record . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu should have taken a much harder line with russia , the ngo said " human rights did not figure prominently in the broader eu-russia agenda , " the report said .
" although the german eu presidency raised human rights issues at the may eu-russia summit ... this stance was compromised by subsequent statements made by the portuguese presidency equating the raising of human rights issues with inappropriate ' lecturing . " ' bad news for eu hopeful turkey was taken to task in the report for violating free speech .
the country has begun accession talks with the european union , but human rights remain a key issue in the discussion . " the criminalization of speech remains a key obstacle to the protection of human rights in turkey , contributing to an atmosphere of intolerance that assumed violent proportions in 2007 , " the report said . hrw recalled the ethnic armenian journalist hrant dink , who was shot dead in istanbul in january last year after labeling as genocide the world war i massacres of armenians in the ottoman empire . pre-olympic slip bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has n't kept its promise to improve human rights before the olympics in the global spotlight ahead of the 2008 olympic games , host country china has promised to improve the human rights situation within its borders .
instead , preparations have only led to more violations , said hrw , including evictions of residents for olympic construction , abysmal work conditions and tighter restrictions on government critics . " official efforts to rid beijing of undesirables ahead of the olympics have accelerated the eviction of petitioners - citizens from the countryside who come to the capital seeking redress for grievances ranging from illegal land seizures to official corruption , " said the report . hrw director kenneth roth on thursday urged the world to put pressure on china to ameliorate the situation before the games . " the olympics are a historic opportunity for the chinese government to show the world that it can make human rights a reality for its 1.4 billion citizens , " said roth . the anti-terror campaign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us was accused of holding prisoners without trial at guantanamo bay not only the us , but also france , pakistan and great britain were criticized by hrw for breaching human rights in the name of the " war on terror . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 31.01.2008 internet , ageing ca n't take fun out of sex , german expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red-light districts or not , germany is n't particularly open about sex since the late 1980s , erika berger has been one of germany 's leading sex experts .
on tv and in print , she 's advised countless people about matters most intimate .
we talked to her on the eve of a historical anniversary . published 60 years ago , the first kinsey report , titled " sexual behavior in the human male , " shocked the general public for discussing subjects that had previously been taboo and for openly challenging conventional sexual beliefs of the day .
though kinsey 's methods have repeatedly been questioned by opponents , the report remains one of the largest studies ever conducted on human sexual behavior . dw-world.de : the kinsey report launched the sexual revolution when it was published on jan .
31 , 1948 .
now it 's celebrating its 60th anniversary .
how important was it to your career ? erika berger : well , i was much too young to read it when it came out , but of course i have it on my shelf at home just like everyone today who 's interested in sexuality .
there are things in it , where you say , " yes , that 's exactly right . "
there 's no reason not to do things that are a bit out of the ordinary and that may be incomprehensible to other people .
and above all we should talk about sexuality .
we should n't try to conceal things , and we should leave people with other sexual preferences and drives in peace . it took several years for the kinsey report to be translated into german .
was germany backwards in this regard ? as i began dealing with sexuality in front of the camera , it was a wasteland .
there was director oswalt kolle who made a number of sex-education films in the 1960s .
he was an educational pioneer , and i think it was only then that we in germany realized that sex was something completely normal .
in that respect i think germany did lag behind america a bit . the results of the kinsey report suggested that sexual practices traditionally dismissed as perverse were far more widespread than people thought .
is there such a thing as " normal sex ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika berger currently hosts the call-in advice show " night talk " you 'd have to ask yourself the question : what is normal sex for a given individual ?
and you could just as well ask : what is good or bad sex for that individual ?
sex is the way i experience it and do it - together with my partner .
the concepts of normal and abnormal sex mean nothing to me .
i think it 's impertinent for someone today to say " what gays do , is n't normal . "
who are they to say what 's normal ?
i myself determine what 's normal for me . the internet has opened up whole new possibilities for tracking people 's sex preferences .
what effect has that had on sexual research ? i think the web is unbelievably important for sex research .
first of all , it allows you to look things up things instantly .
and it 's very transparent .
i no longer have to go somewhere and buy a book that i hardly dare to ask for because the title is so racy .
instead i just log on to the web , click and i 've got everything i need .
and it 's interesting that you can measure people 's clicks and see whether they are interested in the missionary position , same-sex love or unusual sexual practices .
are they interested in sex toys or masturbation tips ?
that 's very interesting . then public sexual morality often differs drastically from people 's actual online sexual behavior ? absolutely .
you can read about things , click on them and inform yourself .
you can even talk about and discuss them .
but when people are confronted with their own desires , they sometimes lack the courage .
some do n't want to overburden their partners ; others simply do n't know where to begin .
to take a somewhat crass example : if i said , " how about some role playing or bondage tonight ? " or " i 'm into sadomasochism , " i would n't know how my partner would react .
and then it 's too late .
that 's why , in practice , sex is often so boring . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berger says the internet offers positive and negative forms of anonymity is it not ironic that the possibilities opened up by the anonymity of the internet often get in the way of sexual communication ? yes , it 's suffered from that .
today i can choose a partner via the internet - i can virtually " invite " someone into my living room and talk to him via the computer screen .
but , please , what good is that ?
it 's totally one-dimensional .
it 's the same as if i look at pictures of naked women or men or sex practices on the screen .
what good does it do me ? that sounds as if there 's still a need for sexual education in the internet age , a need to bring people together to talk about sex . i think the attempt to bring people together is great .
but it does n't always work .
let 's say i decide i want a man .
so i go to some web page and look for a guy i 'd like to chat with .
then you start talking , and of course your conversations revolve around horizontal kinds of fun .
but i still want to see the guy some time !
i love chatting , and i 'm very involved with the internet .
but i still think that you have to talk face-to-face at some point .
i miss that .
it 's a kind of anonymity that i do n't like very much . you 're 67 , and your last book dealt with growing older and specifically with menopause .
that 's very topical because the average age is increasing in germany and many other western countries .
will it have an effect on our sex lives ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as people get older , they start to question the value of getting horizontal it creates a very important question : is sex in old age a taboo or not ?
personally i 'd plead for treating it as something normal .
who says that you should n't have sex at the age of 60 , 70 or 80 ?
there 's no age limit for sex - or love , which i always stress is connected with sex .
if a person is healthy , he can still have a very fulfilling sexual life .
but one thing i found out from talking to people for my last book was that as they get older , sex becomes less important .
it 's only their second or third most important concern - the top one is tenderness .
is there someone there who loves me and whom i can love back ?
it 's a matter of trust , above all , and sexuality develops from it . so there will be more attention paid to older people 's sexuality ? of course , because people are getting older , and - thank god - they 're no longer stupid enough to try and conceal the fact that they 're no longer doing the dirty deed . -lrb- laughs -rrb- look at it this way - everyone , no matter how old , has a baby inside that needs to be cuddled .
when you enter puberty , it 's great .
and when you 're in the prime of life , you 've lost most of your inhibitions .
but if you 're a woman entering menopause , you have so many inhibitions .
you do n't dare take off your clothes .
you 're afraid that sex will hurt .
you have so many things that can take away your desire for sexuality .
you say , " oh , i 'm old . "
but you 're not old .
you 're just entering a new phase of life .
that 's great .
why are you laughing ? no reason - you just made ageing sound pleasant .
one last - frivolous - question : you recorded a song in the 1990s called " sex is fun . "
when was the last time you listened to it ? -lrb- laughs . -rrb-
oh god , i know exactly when it was .
six months ago .
i was sitting around with some colleagues , chatting interactively , and they said , " hey , we 've found something really funny .
it 's your cd . "
we listened to it and laughed ourselves under the table .
what do think about that ?
pretty funny , huh ? i do n't have any problem with that .
i have no problem with getting older , or with saying that sex is fun , or with anything i 've every done in my professional or personal life .
i think it 's great .
it 's part of life . i would n't have minded making a record - especially not with that title . -lrb- laughs -rrb- too late .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 31.01.2008 internet , ageing ca n't take fun out of sex , german expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red-light districts or not , germany is n't particularly open about sex since the late 1980s , erika berger has been one of germany 's leading sex experts .
on tv and in print , she 's advised countless people about matters most intimate .
we talked to her on the eve of a historical anniversary . published 60 years ago , the first kinsey report , titled " sexual behavior in the human male , " shocked the general public for discussing subjects that had previously been taboo and for openly challenging conventional sexual beliefs of the day .
though kinsey 's methods have repeatedly been questioned by opponents , the report remains one of the largest studies ever conducted on human sexual behavior . dw-world.de : the kinsey report launched the sexual revolution when it was published on jan .
31 , 1948 .
now it 's celebrating its 60th anniversary .
how important was it to your career ? erika berger : well , i was much too young to read it when it came out , but of course i have it on my shelf at home just like everyone today who 's interested in sexuality .
there are things in it , where you say , " yes , that 's exactly right . "
there 's no reason not to do things that are a bit out of the ordinary and that may be incomprehensible to other people .
and above all we should talk about sexuality .
we should n't try to conceal things , and we should leave people with other sexual preferences and drives in peace . it took several years for the kinsey report to be translated into german .
was germany backwards in this regard ? as i began dealing with sexuality in front of the camera , it was a wasteland .
there was director oswalt kolle who made a number of sex-education films in the 1960s .
he was an educational pioneer , and i think it was only then that we in germany realized that sex was something completely normal .
in that respect i think germany did lag behind america a bit . the results of the kinsey report suggested that sexual practices traditionally dismissed as perverse were far more widespread than people thought .
is there such a thing as " normal sex ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika berger currently hosts the call-in advice show " night talk " you 'd have to ask yourself the question : what is normal sex for a given individual ?
and you could just as well ask : what is good or bad sex for that individual ?
sex is the way i experience it and do it - together with my partner .
the concepts of normal and abnormal sex mean nothing to me .
i think it 's impertinent for someone today to say " what gays do , is n't normal . "
who are they to say what 's normal ?
i myself determine what 's normal for me . the internet has opened up whole new possibilities for tracking people 's sex preferences .
what effect has that had on sexual research ? i think the web is unbelievably important for sex research .
first of all , it allows you to look things up things instantly .
and it 's very transparent .
i no longer have to go somewhere and buy a book that i hardly dare to ask for because the title is so racy .
instead i just log on to the web , click and i 've got everything i need .
and it 's interesting that you can measure people 's clicks and see whether they are interested in the missionary position , same-sex love or unusual sexual practices .
are they interested in sex toys or masturbation tips ?
that 's very interesting . then public sexual morality often differs drastically from people 's actual online sexual behavior ? absolutely .
you can read about things , click on them and inform yourself .
you can even talk about and discuss them .
but when people are confronted with their own desires , they sometimes lack the courage .
some do n't want to overburden their partners ; others simply do n't know where to begin .
to take a somewhat crass example : if i said , " how about some role playing or bondage tonight ? " or " i 'm into sadomasochism , " i would n't know how my partner would react .
and then it 's too late .
that 's why , in practice , sex is often so boring . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berger says the internet offers positive and negative forms of anonymity is it not ironic that the possibilities opened up by the anonymity of the internet often get in the way of sexual communication ? yes , it 's suffered from that .
today i can choose a partner via the internet - i can virtually " invite " someone into my living room and talk to him via the computer screen .
but , please , what good is that ?
it 's totally one-dimensional .
it 's the same as if i look at pictures of naked women or men or sex practices on the screen .
what good does it do me ? that sounds as if there 's still a need for sexual education in the internet age , a need to bring people together to talk about sex . i think the attempt to bring people together is great .
but it does n't always work .
let 's say i decide i want a man .
so i go to some web page and look for a guy i 'd like to chat with .
then you start talking , and of course your conversations revolve around horizontal kinds of fun .
but i still want to see the guy some time !
i love chatting , and i 'm very involved with the internet .
but i still think that you have to talk face-to-face at some point .
i miss that .
it 's a kind of anonymity that i do n't like very much . you 're 67 , and your last book dealt with growing older and specifically with menopause .
that 's very topical because the average age is increasing in germany and many other western countries .
will it have an effect on our sex lives ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as people get older , they start to question the value of getting horizontal it creates a very important question : is sex in old age a taboo or not ?
personally i 'd plead for treating it as something normal .
who says that you should n't have sex at the age of 60 , 70 or 80 ?
there 's no age limit for sex - or love , which i always stress is connected with sex .
if a person is healthy , he can still have a very fulfilling sexual life .
but one thing i found out from talking to people for my last book was that as they get older , sex becomes less important .
it 's only their second or third most important concern - the top one is tenderness .
is there someone there who loves me and whom i can love back ?
it 's a matter of trust , above all , and sexuality develops from it . so there will be more attention paid to older people 's sexuality ? of course , because people are getting older , and - thank god - they 're no longer stupid enough to try and conceal the fact that they 're no longer doing the dirty deed . -lrb- laughs -rrb- look at it this way - everyone , no matter how old , has a baby inside that needs to be cuddled .
when you enter puberty , it 's great .
and when you 're in the prime of life , you 've lost most of your inhibitions .
but if you 're a woman entering menopause , you have so many inhibitions .
you do n't dare take off your clothes .
you 're afraid that sex will hurt .
you have so many things that can take away your desire for sexuality .
you say , " oh , i 'm old . "
but you 're not old .
you 're just entering a new phase of life .
that 's great .
why are you laughing ? no reason - you just made ageing sound pleasant .
one last - frivolous - question : you recorded a song in the 1990s called " sex is fun . "
when was the last time you listened to it ? -lrb- laughs . -rrb-
oh god , i know exactly when it was .
six months ago .
i was sitting around with some colleagues , chatting interactively , and they said , " hey , we 've found something really funny .
it 's your cd . "
we listened to it and laughed ourselves under the table .
what do think about that ?
pretty funny , huh ? i do n't have any problem with that .
i have no problem with getting older , or with saying that sex is fun , or with anything i 've every done in my professional or personal life .
i think it 's great .
it 's part of life . i would n't have minded making a record - especially not with that title . -lrb- laughs -rrb- too late .

31 , top off months of gala soirees that are often incomprehensible to the city 's non-natives .
but one party re-examines the traditional fetes . cologne during carnival can be terrifying for the uninitiated .
they are faced with drunken , costume-clad karneval enthusiasts singing - and staggering - their way down the streets and partaking in the sort of debauchery they 'll never admit to once the celebrations have come to a close . part of the festival traditions are the sitzungen .
literally " sessions " or " sittings , " the more traditional ones are gala events ; the smaller , more alternatives ones resemble comedy or variety shows composed of skits with performers making liberal use of song and dance to mock politicians , each other and themselves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bit of samba spices up karneval for american singer and actress victoria riccio , who came to germany nearly 20 years ago , the introduction to a sitzung was a shocker . " when i first came here , i went to one of these events and did n't understand a word , but at one point , the people on stage took off all their clothes and jumped around naked , " she said .
" i thought ' oh my god , where have i landed ? '
i loved it right away .
for me it was like halloween and the best party you 've ever been to , all wrapped into one . " immigrants take the stage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the immigrantenstadl kicked off three years ago still , despite the lure of scantily-clad hedonists and the beer that flows abundantly , karneval and its sitzungen can make non-germans feel like outsiders due to all the inside jokes about local politics and heavy use of the local dialect . so riccio , along with emcee hektor haarkötter and a host of others , started their own show called the " immigrantenstadl . "
it 's a gala put on for and by immigrants - which in cologne can also mean anyone born outside the city limits . " a bunch of us met with other artists and musicians in a pub in the southern part of the city and talked for hours , making all sorts of plans for a show , " he said .
" after a while , someone asked ' who at this table was actually born in cologne ? '
and then we realized that no one was originally from cologne . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mocking the tricky ö , ü,ä vowels of german is easier than mastering them rather than put on a typical cologne sitzung performed by foreigners , haarkötter said the " immigrantenstadl , " which started three years ago , aims to incorporate aspects of foreign cultures for an international audience . " cologne 's karneval can be a very traditional thing with a lot of very old styles and ways of having a party , " he said .
" we try to innovate by integrating special forms and customs from other countries and other cultures .
we yodel , we wear bavarian and japanese clothes , and we do brazilian samba and turkish folklore skits . " cologne 's large immigrant population there are jazzy numbers in which the performers sing lines like " we 've come to stay , we 're not leaving " - referring to the one in five people living in cologne who has an immigrant background , in an urban population of around 1 million . yet , by being semi-outsiders , performers are able to point out the quirky characteristics among germans - and even themselves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what would cologne do without all its greek immigrants , even if they are philosophers ?
during one immigrantenstadl skit , a turkish-german actor explains that in turkey , when someone wants to steal something , the thief waits until a person leaves his house , sneaks in and grabs the item .
in germany , he quips , a person will go to a home , ring the bell , say " hello , " take the television and leave a receipt for the item on the table . another number shows a romanian actress who tries to discern the future of karneval in her crystal ball . good-humored mockery it 's poking fun at cultural differences in a good-humored , tongue-in-cheek way that makes the show so appealing , said julien , a frenchman who 's lived in cologne for three years .
he claimed that , contrary to the stereotype , germans are able to mock themselves . " there are some very funny pieces in this show and i like the mixture of jokes about germans and immigrants in germany and how they all live here together , " he said .
" there are a lot of taboos surrounding the subject .
in this show , there are no taboos .
it 's great ! " while the typical cologne sitzung is performed in the local kölsch dialect , which immigrants and germans from outside the city alike have difficulty understanding , the singers and actors in the " immigrantenstadl " dole out their mockery of world events in a kaleidoscope of languages , including german , english , turkish , romanian , greek and czech . creating the mood with a beer - or three bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world players like president bush and condi rice are not left unscathed in one funky , hip-hop sketch , a singer in a cowboy hat masquerading as us president george w. bush complains about his work overload in the white house and iraq .
splashing around in a plastic baby pool , he takes comfort in his cozy relationship with secretary of state condoleezza rice . it could be the turkish hip-hop , the greek melodies , the brazilian sambas or the deliberate on-stage mayhem that make the " immigrantenstadl 's " sold-out shows so attractive to both foreigners and locals .
or it could be the chance to take part in a traditional party tilted just far enough off kilter to suit non-traditionalists . " put on a really wacky costume , get yourself in a good mood - although sometimes , if you go to the right place , people can kind of get you into the right mood , " said american riccio , advising newcomers on how to enjoy karneval .
" and of course , i hate to say it , but one or two or three or four kölsch beers do n't hurt either . " louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 31.01.2008 internet , ageing ca n't take fun out of sex , german expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red-light districts or not , germany is n't particularly open about sex since the late 1980s , erika berger has been one of germany 's leading sex experts .
on tv and in print , she 's advised countless people about matters most intimate .
we talked to her on the eve of a historical anniversary . published 60 years ago , the first kinsey report , titled " sexual behavior in the human male , " shocked the general public for discussing subjects that had previously been taboo and for openly challenging conventional sexual beliefs of the day .
though kinsey 's methods have repeatedly been questioned by opponents , the report remains one of the largest studies ever conducted on human sexual behavior . dw-world.de : the kinsey report launched the sexual revolution when it was published on jan .
31 , 1948 .
now it 's celebrating its 60th anniversary .
how important was it to your career ? erika berger : well , i was much too young to read it when it came out , but of course i have it on my shelf at home just like everyone today who 's interested in sexuality .
there are things in it , where you say , " yes , that 's exactly right . "
there 's no reason not to do things that are a bit out of the ordinary and that may be incomprehensible to other people .
and above all we should talk about sexuality .
we should n't try to conceal things , and we should leave people with other sexual preferences and drives in peace . it took several years for the kinsey report to be translated into german .
was germany backwards in this regard ? as i began dealing with sexuality in front of the camera , it was a wasteland .
there was director oswalt kolle who made a number of sex-education films in the 1960s .
he was an educational pioneer , and i think it was only then that we in germany realized that sex was something completely normal .
in that respect i think germany did lag behind america a bit . the results of the kinsey report suggested that sexual practices traditionally dismissed as perverse were far more widespread than people thought .
is there such a thing as " normal sex ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika berger currently hosts the call-in advice show " night talk " you 'd have to ask yourself the question : what is normal sex for a given individual ?
and you could just as well ask : what is good or bad sex for that individual ?
sex is the way i experience it and do it - together with my partner .
the concepts of normal and abnormal sex mean nothing to me .
i think it 's impertinent for someone today to say " what gays do , is n't normal . "
who are they to say what 's normal ?
i myself determine what 's normal for me . the internet has opened up whole new possibilities for tracking people 's sex preferences .
what effect has that had on sexual research ? i think the web is unbelievably important for sex research .
first of all , it allows you to look things up things instantly .
and it 's very transparent .
i no longer have to go somewhere and buy a book that i hardly dare to ask for because the title is so racy .
instead i just log on to the web , click and i 've got everything i need .
and it 's interesting that you can measure people 's clicks and see whether they are interested in the missionary position , same-sex love or unusual sexual practices .
are they interested in sex toys or masturbation tips ?
that 's very interesting . then public sexual morality often differs drastically from people 's actual online sexual behavior ? absolutely .
you can read about things , click on them and inform yourself .
you can even talk about and discuss them .
but when people are confronted with their own desires , they sometimes lack the courage .
some do n't want to overburden their partners ; others simply do n't know where to begin .
to take a somewhat crass example : if i said , " how about some role playing or bondage tonight ? " or " i 'm into sadomasochism , " i would n't know how my partner would react .
and then it 's too late .
that 's why , in practice , sex is often so boring . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berger says the internet offers positive and negative forms of anonymity is it not ironic that the possibilities opened up by the anonymity of the internet often get in the way of sexual communication ? yes , it 's suffered from that .
today i can choose a partner via the internet - i can virtually " invite " someone into my living room and talk to him via the computer screen .
but , please , what good is that ?
it 's totally one-dimensional .
it 's the same as if i look at pictures of naked women or men or sex practices on the screen .
what good does it do me ? that sounds as if there 's still a need for sexual education in the internet age , a need to bring people together to talk about sex . i think the attempt to bring people together is great .
but it does n't always work .
let 's say i decide i want a man .
so i go to some web page and look for a guy i 'd like to chat with .
then you start talking , and of course your conversations revolve around horizontal kinds of fun .
but i still want to see the guy some time !
i love chatting , and i 'm very involved with the internet .
but i still think that you have to talk face-to-face at some point .
i miss that .
it 's a kind of anonymity that i do n't like very much . you 're 67 , and your last book dealt with growing older and specifically with menopause .
that 's very topical because the average age is increasing in germany and many other western countries .
will it have an effect on our sex lives ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as people get older , they start to question the value of getting horizontal it creates a very important question : is sex in old age a taboo or not ?
personally i 'd plead for treating it as something normal .
who says that you should n't have sex at the age of 60 , 70 or 80 ?
there 's no age limit for sex - or love , which i always stress is connected with sex .
if a person is healthy , he can still have a very fulfilling sexual life .
but one thing i found out from talking to people for my last book was that as they get older , sex becomes less important .
it 's only their second or third most important concern - the top one is tenderness .
is there someone there who loves me and whom i can love back ?
it 's a matter of trust , above all , and sexuality develops from it . so there will be more attention paid to older people 's sexuality ? of course , because people are getting older , and - thank god - they 're no longer stupid enough to try and conceal the fact that they 're no longer doing the dirty deed . -lrb- laughs -rrb- look at it this way - everyone , no matter how old , has a baby inside that needs to be cuddled .
when you enter puberty , it 's great .
and when you 're in the prime of life , you 've lost most of your inhibitions .
but if you 're a woman entering menopause , you have so many inhibitions .
you do n't dare take off your clothes .
you 're afraid that sex will hurt .
you have so many things that can take away your desire for sexuality .
you say , " oh , i 'm old . "
but you 're not old .
you 're just entering a new phase of life .
that 's great .
why are you laughing ? no reason - you just made ageing sound pleasant .
one last - frivolous - question : you recorded a song in the 1990s called " sex is fun . "
when was the last time you listened to it ? -lrb- laughs . -rrb-
oh god , i know exactly when it was .
six months ago .
i was sitting around with some colleagues , chatting interactively , and they said , " hey , we 've found something really funny .
it 's your cd . "
we listened to it and laughed ourselves under the table .
what do think about that ?
pretty funny , huh ? i do n't have any problem with that .
i have no problem with getting older , or with saying that sex is fun , or with anything i 've every done in my professional or personal life .

he reacts to the animals by flying into a rage , yelling at them that god had set out to destroy all life on earth at the time of noah and chases them away . the mufti fares little better .
while he greets both animals at first as a quiet man and invites them into his mosque , he soon changes into a ranting fanatic .
he assembles a baying islamic mob and holds the animals up in a clenched fist while condemning them to everlasting damnation through bared teeth and an unruly-looking beard . the insinuation here is that all visitors to mosques are extremists and every imam who appears reasonable is , in truth , nevertheless , a preacher of hate . animals reject religion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the three religious leaders are shown as being violent , insane and intolerant the bishop , a pale fat man with a clearly insinuated predilection for child abuse , makes up the unholy trinity which eventually convinces piglet and hedgehog , after they have survived the long search in the maze of religions , that nothing of any importance has been missing from their lives .

he sees the company as becoming one of europe 's top three providers within the decade . rene obermann , 44 , became ceo of deutsche telekom in november 2006 .
prior to that , he served as ceo of t-mobile international , a subsidiary of deutsche telekom . dw-radio : the federal network agency , germany 's telecommunications authority , is celebrating its 10th anniversary this year .
is that a reason for you to celebrate ? rene obermann : in the past 12 months , we 've done much better in this field of regulated competition and increased our market share .
i think that regulation is there where the market is intensely competitive , which is the case with us .
we have price cuts of 90 percent in some areas and a lot of competitors .
regulation is , then , a part of general competition law .
for me , the regulation authority is , for the most part , an example of successful politics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom , based in bonn , has only partially been privatized you 've said deutsche telekom has an 80 percent market share when it comes to standard telephone customers -lsb- which the authorities view as being too high -rsb- .
when will the regulation authority leave you alone in this area and let you do your work ? it 's a bit speculative , but even when the anti-trust commission and the regulation authority believe that we no longer have a monopolistic position - which will take time , i think - we will still forego telephone connections .
there 's no way around it .
the important thing is that we continue to grow with broad-band and mobile connections and with innovative value-added services . you 're not the only ones in europe in this situation .
other former monopolies like france telecom have similar problems .
how do you see yourself in comparison to the other european telecommunications companies ? stronger and stronger .
we 've worked on our competitiveness and taken a serious look at our cost structures .
we 've made progress in innovation , for example with internet-based television and with mobile internet .
we 're well positioned .
our marketing department is the strongest in germany and our service is getting better and better .
deutsche telekom is developing in the right direction . where do you see deutsche telekom in 10 years ? as one of the leading international providers of services for networked living and working - i 'd say among the top three .

is that a reason for you to celebrate ? rene obermann : in the past 12 months , we 've done much better in this field of regulated competition and increased our market share .
i think that regulation is there where the market is intensely competitive , which is the case with us .

but if anyone was in doubt about the potential danger of staking your happiness on the fortune of 11 men running around on a soccer field , a group of german scientists have done the typically teutonic thing and proved it should be avoided . taking german fans who followed their team through the 2006 world cup as their case study group , the men in lab coats from munich 's ludwig-maximilians university have discovered that the risk of a heart attack or other cardiovascular problem in male fans increased three-fold on days when the german team was in action . it was n't just irrational and emotionally charged fans on the edge of their stadium seats who were suffering .

" by allowing autocrats to pose as democrats without demanding they uphold the civil and political rights that make democracy meaningful , the united states , the european union and other influential democracies risk undermining human rights worldwide , " the new york-based rights group said in its annual report . fair elections are not the only essential component to democracy , said hrw , adding that a free press , freedom of assembly and free speech are also crucial . the european union 's stance on russia received special condemnation from the human right 's group , which said the 27-member bloc put political ties with an important energy supplier ahead of a responsibility to address moscow 's human rights ' record . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu should have taken a much harder line with russia , the ngo said " human rights did not figure prominently in the broader eu-russia agenda , " the report said .
" although the german eu presidency raised human rights issues at the may eu-russia summit ... this stance was compromised by subsequent statements made by the portuguese presidency equating the raising of human rights issues with inappropriate ' lecturing . " ' bad news for eu hopeful turkey was taken to task in the report for violating free speech .
the country has begun accession talks with the european union , but human rights remain a key issue in the discussion . " the criminalization of speech remains a key obstacle to the protection of human rights in turkey , contributing to an atmosphere of intolerance that assumed violent proportions in 2007 , " the report said . hrw recalled the ethnic armenian journalist hrant dink , who was shot dead in istanbul in january last year after labeling as genocide the world war i massacres of armenians in the ottoman empire . pre-olympic slip bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has n't kept its promise to improve human rights before the olympics in the global spotlight ahead of the 2008 olympic games , host country china has promised to improve the human rights situation within its borders .
instead , preparations have only led to more violations , said hrw , including evictions of residents for olympic construction , abysmal work conditions and tighter restrictions on government critics . " official efforts to rid beijing of undesirables ahead of the olympics have accelerated the eviction of petitioners - citizens from the countryside who come to the capital seeking redress for grievances ranging from illegal land seizures to official corruption , " said the report . hrw director kenneth roth on thursday urged the world to put pressure on china to ameliorate the situation before the games . " the olympics are a historic opportunity for the chinese government to show the world that it can make human rights a reality for its 1.4 billion citizens , " said roth . the anti-terror campaign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us was accused of holding prisoners without trial at guantanamo bay not only the us , but also france , pakistan and great britain were criticized by hrw for breaching human rights in the name of the " war on terror . "
the american prison in cuba came under fire , in particular . " there is no evidence of progress concerning the treatment of so-called enemy combatants , including those held at guantanamo bay , or the use of secret detention facilities " in foreign countries , the report said . hrw estimated that 275 people are still imprisoned at the guantanamo bay camp and that another 39 are currently being held by in secret us detention facilities . in all , more than 75 countries were admonished in the report for their human rights situation .
among the countries with the most atrocities were chad , the democratic republic of congo , somalia , ethiopia , sri lanka , iraq , and the sudanese region of darfur . burma , china , cuba , eritrea , libya , iran , north korea , saudi arabia and vietnam were named as being closed societies or under severe repression . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's comfortable , there is food and drink at hand and no noisy crowds pushing you around .
and yet , a killer could be stalking you . soccer can be a dangerous business for committed fans .
in the stadiums themselves , supporters face a number of medical risks including serious bladder episodes brought on by too many half-time beers , temporary bouts of tourette 's syndrome and , in the case of england fans , actual death through boredom .
no one who follows a team with passion should take their allegiance lightly .
it can seriously damage your health . those who have ever watched their team 's chances of success end in the lottery of a penalty shoot-out will already know this .
but if anyone was in doubt about the potential danger of staking your happiness on the fortune of 11 men running around on a soccer field , a group of german scientists have done the typically teutonic thing and proved it should be avoided . taking german fans who followed their team through the 2006 world cup as their case study group , the men in lab coats from munich 's ludwig-maximilians university have discovered that the risk of a heart attack or other cardiovascular problem in male fans increased three-fold on days when the german team was in action . it was n't just irrational and emotionally charged fans on the edge of their stadium seats who were suffering .
victims also included over-stressed fans watching the game in the comfort of their own homes .
and they were n't all men , either : female fans also recorded a rise in emergencies , with the amount of heart incidents in women rising by 82 percent during the tournament . the researchers came to their conclusions after reviewing 4,279 medical reports from the seven days the german team played in the 2006 world cup , the 24 days when matches involved teams from other countries , and 242 other days in 2003 , 2005 and 2006 . paying the penalty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's super-fit players handled the shoot-out well the research showed that cardiac emergencies usually occurred within two hours of the start of a match , which would explain why the largest number of attacks occurred during the june 30 quarter-final in which germany defeated argentina in a dramatic penalty shoot-out .
after 90 minutes of regular time and an additional 30 minutes of extra-time , german fans found themselves entering the danger zone and 64 of them suffered heart attacks as a result . the next game , germany 's semi-final loss to italy which went into extra-time , produced almost as many heart attacks . " apparently , of prime importance for triggering a stress-induced event is not the outcome of a game - a win or a loss - but rather the intense strain and excitement experienced during the viewing of a dramatic match , such as one with a penalty shoot-out , " the research report , published in the new england journal of medicine , stated . hosts ' march raises pulses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just remember to breathe watching jürgen klinsmann 's team throughout the world cup on home soil was a potential killer for german fans as six of the seven games in which the team participated were associated with an increase in the number of cardiac emergencies . the only game which produced no spike in heart-related problems was the third-place match in which germany defeated portugal 3-1 .
presumably , with the main prize out of contention , more of the pressure was off and fans could relax their heart valves . while the excitement of germany 's march to the semi-finals was a contributing factor to the increase in heart episodes , others were cited by the report .
fans might have been subject to risk factors such as lack of sleep , overeating , consumption of junk food , alcohol and smoking during the world cup , which would not have helped to keep them in tip-top physical condition for the rigors of supporting germany . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the book 's publisher says kids have a right to enlightenment . the german family ministry is pushing for the children 's book " how do i get to god , asked the small piglet , " by written by michael schmidt-salomon and illustrated by helge nyncke , to be included on a list of literature considered dangerous for young people .

" the distinctive characteristics of each religion are made ridiculous . " the search for god bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the god delusion " for kids ?
the book tells the story of a piglet and a hedgehog , who discover a poster attached to their house that says : " if you do not know god , you are missing something ! " this frightens them because they had never suspected at all that anything was missing in their lives .
thus they set out to look for " god . "
along the way they encounter a rabbi , a bishop and a mufti who are portrayed as insane , violent and continually at each other 's throats . the rabbi is drawn in the same way as the caricatures from the propaganda of 1930 's germany ; corkscrew curls , fanatical lights in his eyes , a set of predator 's flashing teeth and hands like claws .
he reacts to the animals by flying into a rage , yelling at them that god had set out to destroy all life on earth at the time of noah and chases them away . the mufti fares little better .
while he greets both animals at first as a quiet man and invites them into his mosque , he soon changes into a ranting fanatic .
he assembles a baying islamic mob and holds the animals up in a clenched fist while condemning them to everlasting damnation through bared teeth and an unruly-looking beard . the insinuation here is that all visitors to mosques are extremists and every imam who appears reasonable is , in truth , nevertheless , a preacher of hate . animals reject religion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the three religious leaders are shown as being violent , insane and intolerant the bishop , a pale fat man with a clearly insinuated predilection for child abuse , makes up the unholy trinity which eventually convinces piglet and hedgehog , after they have survived the long search in the maze of religions , that nothing of any importance has been missing from their lives .

on tv and in print , she 's advised countless people about matters most intimate .
we talked to her on the eve of a historical anniversary . published 60 years ago , the first kinsey report , titled " sexual behavior in the human male , " shocked the general public for discussing subjects that had previously been taboo and for openly challenging conventional sexual beliefs of the day .
though kinsey 's methods have repeatedly been questioned by opponents , the report remains one of the largest studies ever conducted on human sexual behavior . dw-world.de : the kinsey report launched the sexual revolution when it was published on jan .
31 , 1948 .
now it 's celebrating its 60th anniversary .
how important was it to your career ? erika berger : well , i was much too young to read it when it came out , but of course i have it on my shelf at home just like everyone today who 's interested in sexuality .
there are things in it , where you say , " yes , that 's exactly right . "
there 's no reason not to do things that are a bit out of the ordinary and that may be incomprehensible to other people .
and above all we should talk about sexuality .
we should n't try to conceal things , and we should leave people with other sexual preferences and drives in peace . it took several years for the kinsey report to be translated into german .

on tv and in print , she 's advised countless people about matters most intimate .
we talked to her on the eve of a historical anniversary . published 60 years ago , the first kinsey report , titled " sexual behavior in the human male , " shocked the general public for discussing subjects that had previously been taboo and for openly challenging conventional sexual beliefs of the day .
though kinsey 's methods have repeatedly been questioned by opponents , the report remains one of the largest studies ever conducted on human sexual behavior . dw-world.de : the kinsey report launched the sexual revolution when it was published on jan .
31 , 1948 .
now it 's celebrating its 60th anniversary .
how important was it to your career ? erika berger : well , i was much too young to read it when it came out , but of course i have it on my shelf at home just like everyone today who 's interested in sexuality .
there are things in it , where you say , " yes , that 's exactly right . "
there 's no reason not to do things that are a bit out of the ordinary and that may be incomprehensible to other people .
and above all we should talk about sexuality .
we should n't try to conceal things , and we should leave people with other sexual preferences and drives in peace . it took several years for the kinsey report to be translated into german .
was germany backwards in this regard ? as i began dealing with sexuality in front of the camera , it was a wasteland .
there was director oswalt kolle who made a number of sex-education films in the 1960s .
he was an educational pioneer , and i think it was only then that we in germany realized that sex was something completely normal .
in that respect i think germany did lag behind america a bit . the results of the kinsey report suggested that sexual practices traditionally dismissed as perverse were far more widespread than people thought .
is there such a thing as " normal sex ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika berger currently hosts the call-in advice show " night talk " you 'd have to ask yourself the question : what is normal sex for a given individual ?
and you could just as well ask : what is good or bad sex for that individual ?
sex is the way i experience it and do it - together with my partner .
the concepts of normal and abnormal sex mean nothing to me .
i think it 's impertinent for someone today to say " what gays do , is n't normal . "
who are they to say what 's normal ?
i myself determine what 's normal for me . the internet has opened up whole new possibilities for tracking people 's sex preferences .
what effect has that had on sexual research ? i think the web is unbelievably important for sex research .
first of all , it allows you to look things up things instantly .
and it 's very transparent .
i no longer have to go somewhere and buy a book that i hardly dare to ask for because the title is so racy .
instead i just log on to the web , click and i 've got everything i need .
and it 's interesting that you can measure people 's clicks and see whether they are interested in the missionary position , same-sex love or unusual sexual practices .
are they interested in sex toys or masturbation tips ?
that 's very interesting . then public sexual morality often differs drastically from people 's actual online sexual behavior ? absolutely .
you can read about things , click on them and inform yourself .
you can even talk about and discuss them .
but when people are confronted with their own desires , they sometimes lack the courage .
some do n't want to overburden their partners ; others simply do n't know where to begin .
to take a somewhat crass example : if i said , " how about some role playing or bondage tonight ? " or " i 'm into sadomasochism , " i would n't know how my partner would react .
and then it 's too late .
that 's why , in practice , sex is often so boring . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berger says the internet offers positive and negative forms of anonymity is it not ironic that the possibilities opened up by the anonymity of the internet often get in the way of sexual communication ? yes , it 's suffered from that .
today i can choose a partner via the internet - i can virtually " invite " someone into my living room and talk to him via the computer screen .
but , please , what good is that ?
it 's totally one-dimensional .
it 's the same as if i look at pictures of naked women or men or sex practices on the screen .
what good does it do me ? that sounds as if there 's still a need for sexual education in the internet age , a need to bring people together to talk about sex . i think the attempt to bring people together is great .
but it does n't always work .
let 's say i decide i want a man .
so i go to some web page and look for a guy i 'd like to chat with .
then you start talking , and of course your conversations revolve around horizontal kinds of fun .
but i still want to see the guy some time !
i love chatting , and i 'm very involved with the internet .
but i still think that you have to talk face-to-face at some point .
i miss that .
it 's a kind of anonymity that i do n't like very much . you 're 67 , and your last book dealt with growing older and specifically with menopause .
that 's very topical because the average age is increasing in germany and many other western countries .
will it have an effect on our sex lives ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as people get older , they start to question the value of getting horizontal it creates a very important question : is sex in old age a taboo or not ?
personally i 'd plead for treating it as something normal .
who says that you should n't have sex at the age of 60 , 70 or 80 ?
there 's no age limit for sex - or love , which i always stress is connected with sex .
if a person is healthy , he can still have a very fulfilling sexual life .
but one thing i found out from talking to people for my last book was that as they get older , sex becomes less important .
it 's only their second or third most important concern - the top one is tenderness .
is there someone there who loves me and whom i can love back ?
it 's a matter of trust , above all , and sexuality develops from it . so there will be more attention paid to older people 's sexuality ? of course , because people are getting older , and - thank god - they 're no longer stupid enough to try and conceal the fact that they 're no longer doing the dirty deed . -lrb- laughs -rrb- look at it this way - everyone , no matter how old , has a baby inside that needs to be cuddled .
when you enter puberty , it 's great .
and when you 're in the prime of life , you 've lost most of your inhibitions .
but if you 're a woman entering menopause , you have so many inhibitions .
you do n't dare take off your clothes .
you 're afraid that sex will hurt .
you have so many things that can take away your desire for sexuality .
you say , " oh , i 'm old . "
but you 're not old .
you 're just entering a new phase of life .
that 's great .
why are you laughing ? no reason - you just made ageing sound pleasant .
one last - frivolous - question : you recorded a song in the 1990s called " sex is fun . "
when was the last time you listened to it ? -lrb- laughs . -rrb-
oh god , i know exactly when it was .
six months ago .
i was sitting around with some colleagues , chatting interactively , and they said , " hey , we 've found something really funny .
it 's your cd . "
we listened to it and laughed ourselves under the table .
what do think about that ?
pretty funny , huh ? i do n't have any problem with that .
i have no problem with getting older , or with saying that sex is fun , or with anything i 've every done in my professional or personal life .
i think it 's great .
it 's part of life . i would n't have minded making a record - especially not with that title . -lrb- laughs -rrb- too late .

31 , top off months of gala soirees that are often incomprehensible to the city 's non-natives .
but one party re-examines the traditional fetes . cologne during carnival can be terrifying for the uninitiated .
they are faced with drunken , costume-clad karneval enthusiasts singing - and staggering - their way down the streets and partaking in the sort of debauchery they 'll never admit to once the celebrations have come to a close . part of the festival traditions are the sitzungen .
literally " sessions " or " sittings , " the more traditional ones are gala events ; the smaller , more alternatives ones resemble comedy or variety shows composed of skits with performers making liberal use of song and dance to mock politicians , each other and themselves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bit of samba spices up karneval for american singer and actress victoria riccio , who came to germany nearly 20 years ago , the introduction to a sitzung was a shocker . " when i first came here , i went to one of these events and did n't understand a word , but at one point , the people on stage took off all their clothes and jumped around naked , " she said .
" i thought ' oh my god , where have i landed ? '
i loved it right away .
for me it was like halloween and the best party you 've ever been to , all wrapped into one . " immigrants take the stage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the immigrantenstadl kicked off three years ago still , despite the lure of scantily-clad hedonists and the beer that flows abundantly , karneval and its sitzungen can make non-germans feel like outsiders due to all the inside jokes about local politics and heavy use of the local dialect . so riccio , along with emcee hektor haarkötter and a host of others , started their own show called the " immigrantenstadl . "
it 's a gala put on for and by immigrants - which in cologne can also mean anyone born outside the city limits . " a bunch of us met with other artists and musicians in a pub in the southern part of the city and talked for hours , making all sorts of plans for a show , " he said .
" after a while , someone asked ' who at this table was actually born in cologne ? '
and then we realized that no one was originally from cologne . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mocking the tricky ö , ü,ä vowels of german is easier than mastering them rather than put on a typical cologne sitzung performed by foreigners , haarkötter said the " immigrantenstadl , " which started three years ago , aims to incorporate aspects of foreign cultures for an international audience . " cologne 's karneval can be a very traditional thing with a lot of very old styles and ways of having a party , " he said .
" we try to innovate by integrating special forms and customs from other countries and other cultures .
we yodel , we wear bavarian and japanese clothes , and we do brazilian samba and turkish folklore skits . " cologne 's large immigrant population there are jazzy numbers in which the performers sing lines like " we 've come to stay , we 're not leaving " - referring to the one in five people living in cologne who has an immigrant background , in an urban population of around 1 million . yet , by being semi-outsiders , performers are able to point out the quirky characteristics among germans - and even themselves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what would cologne do without all its greek immigrants , even if they are philosophers ?
during one immigrantenstadl skit , a turkish-german actor explains that in turkey , when someone wants to steal something , the thief waits until a person leaves his house , sneaks in and grabs the item .
in germany , he quips , a person will go to a home , ring the bell , say " hello , " take the television and leave a receipt for the item on the table . another number shows a romanian actress who tries to discern the future of karneval in her crystal ball . good-humored mockery it 's poking fun at cultural differences in a good-humored , tongue-in-cheek way that makes the show so appealing , said julien , a frenchman who 's lived in cologne for three years .
he claimed that , contrary to the stereotype , germans are able to mock themselves . " there are some very funny pieces in this show and i like the mixture of jokes about germans and immigrants in germany and how they all live here together , " he said .
" there are a lot of taboos surrounding the subject .
in this show , there are no taboos .
it 's great ! " while the typical cologne sitzung is performed in the local kölsch dialect , which immigrants and germans from outside the city alike have difficulty understanding , the singers and actors in the " immigrantenstadl " dole out their mockery of world events in a kaleidoscope of languages , including german , english , turkish , romanian , greek and czech . creating the mood with a beer - or three bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world players like president bush and condi rice are not left unscathed in one funky , hip-hop sketch , a singer in a cowboy hat masquerading as us president george w. bush complains about his work overload in the white house and iraq .
splashing around in a plastic baby pool , he takes comfort in his cozy relationship with secretary of state condoleezza rice . it could be the turkish hip-hop , the greek melodies , the brazilian sambas or the deliberate on-stage mayhem that make the " immigrantenstadl 's " sold-out shows so attractive to both foreigners and locals .
or it could be the chance to take part in a traditional party tilted just far enough off kilter to suit non-traditionalists . " put on a really wacky costume , get yourself in a good mood - although sometimes , if you go to the right place , people can kind of get you into the right mood , " said american riccio , advising newcomers on how to enjoy karneval .

we have price cuts of 90 percent in some areas and a lot of competitors .
regulation is , then , a part of general competition law .
for me , the regulation authority is , for the most part , an example of successful politics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom , based in bonn , has only partially been privatized you 've said deutsche telekom has an 80 percent market share when it comes to standard telephone customers -lsb- which the authorities view as being too high -rsb- .
when will the regulation authority leave you alone in this area and let you do your work ? it 's a bit speculative , but even when the anti-trust commission and the regulation authority believe that we no longer have a monopolistic position - which will take time , i think - we will still forego telephone connections .
there 's no way around it .
the important thing is that we continue to grow with broad-band and mobile connections and with innovative value-added services . you 're not the only ones in europe in this situation .
other former monopolies like france telecom have similar problems .
how do you see yourself in comparison to the other european telecommunications companies ? stronger and stronger .
we 've worked on our competitiveness and taken a serious look at our cost structures .
we 've made progress in innovation , for example with internet-based television and with mobile internet .
we 're well positioned .
our marketing department is the strongest in germany and our service is getting better and better .
deutsche telekom is developing in the right direction . where do you see deutsche telekom in 10 years ? as one of the leading international providers of services for networked living and working - i 'd say among the top three .
that would be something to aim for in the next 10 years . interview : henrik böhme -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but they have n't been particularly successful . they could potentially be kingmakers and help andrea ypsilanti , the chairwoman of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in the western german state of hesse , get a majority after a closely contested election in which incumbent roland koch 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- won the vote by a wafer-thin margin . but the left party remains an unwanted child in the german political landscape .
though the far-left party is now represented in two state parliaments in western germany , ypsilanti has vowed she will not form a government with them .
and all established parties in germany - whether on the left or right of center - shun the group . left party seen as communist relic for many western germans , the left party is still a relic of former communist east germany , according to tim spier , a political scientist at the institute for party law and research at the university of düsseldorf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prominent faces of germany 's left party - gregor gysi , left , and petra pau forged from the debris of the east german ruling party after reunification in 1990 and known then as the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the left party reached its present incarnation last year when it was joined by a stream of trade unionists , discontented westerners and social democratic party members unhappy with former chancellor gerhard schröder 's package of far-reaching social security and labor market reforms . the origins of the western side of the party as a splinter movement within the social democratic family have left deep wounds .
while the spd and the left party rule together in the city-state of berlin and have at times cooperated in eastern german states , the social democrats refuse to consider a so-called " red-red " coalition in a western state , let alone at the federal level . " it has to be said that in germany , a part of the left still continues in the tradition of the pds and the additional problem is that we have a remnant of the sed -lsb- the former east german ruling party -rsb- there , " said spier .
" west germans have a problem accepting that . " far-left parties in europe enjoy support the situation is distinctly different in other parts of europe where parties left of social democracy are often part of the mainstream political establishment .
in france , sweden and italy , for instance , such parties have been part of national governments . " in the 1970s there was a long period where many traditional communist parties were much more successful than other parties - for instance in france , " spier said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outside russia , communist parties also enjoyed support in europe far-left parties in western europe may have emerged from different ideological traditions and have heterogeneous historical roots . " but they can still be considered as part of a larger family of parties , " said spier . a large chunk of these far-left parties were former communist parties who reinvented themselves after the end of the cold war .
others broke away from the communists much earlier , formed maoist splinter groups to an extent , and finally evolved into moderate left-wing groups . the most successful far-left party in europe is the socialist party in the netherlands . " they took 16.6 percent of the vote in the last parliamentary election , " spier said . far-left parties are also well-established in scandinavia , where they enjoy considerable support among voters - around 10 percent .
for instance , denmark 's socialist people 's party , norway 's socialist left party , sweden 's left party and finland 's left alliance are all far-left parties but represent a more ecological and social stance . far-left parties in italy and france too enjoy popular support .
" though these parties present a significantly moderate face , their rhetoric and their names betray their communist legacy , " said spier . reform-friendly social democrats helped rise of far-left in germany , there was no serious force left of the social democrats and the green party for a long time .
the communist party of germany -lrb- kpd -rrb- was relatively strong during the weimar republic between 1919 and 1933 but was later banned in the 1950s .
the newly formed german communist party -lrb- dkp -rrb- did n't manage to overcome its status as a splinter group .
it was only with reunification in 1990 and the transformation of the sed into the pds , that a political force left of the social democrats take shape .
the party needed until 2005 to become a nation-wide political forced to be reckoned with . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair and schröder 's reform-friendly social democracy has fueled the rise of the far-left the rise of far-left parties in europe has largely been thanks to the social democrats , in particular what tony blair referred to as " new labour " and gerhard schröder the " new center . "
the move away from traditional , labor-friendly politics has indeed fueled the march of the far-left . " the social democrats who remained traditional , as in the case of france , managed to marginalize far-left parties , " said spier . on the other hand , those who turned particularly reform-friendly , such as the social democrats in germany , the netherlands and denmark , have lost large chunks of their traditional voter base to the far-left . " a real dilemma " the far-left in some parts of europe has also made it as far as into national governments - in france , sweden , italy and presently in norway .
but such coalitions have rarely been especially successful . in 1998 , the social democratic party in sweden entered a coalition with the left party and the greens .
one result was that support for the far-left quickly eroded . " we do n't regret being part of the coalition , we could certainly air some of our views , " said gudrun utas of sweden 's left party .
" but we did n't have positive experiences . " after four years of being part of the government , her far-left party has managed to attract just 5 percent of the vote - a far cry from their historic high of 12.8 percent in 1998 . " it 's a real dilemma , " said spier .
" at first , the far-left in sweden profited from the social democrats ' move to the center .
but once they took on governing responsibilities , the far-left lost its halo - as well as votes . "
at the same time , the social democrats won the majority it needed to govern thanks to the far-left . the swedish example may hold lessons for andrea ypsilanti .
depending on the outcome of coalition talks among hesse 's parties , she may yet change her mind and get the left party on board after all in order to gain that magic majority . sejla didic -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but they have n't been particularly successful . they could potentially be kingmakers and help andrea ypsilanti , the chairwoman of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in the western german state of hesse , get a majority after a closely contested election in which incumbent roland koch 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- won the vote by a wafer-thin margin . but the left party remains an unwanted child in the german political landscape .
though the far-left party is now represented in two state parliaments in western germany , ypsilanti has vowed she will not form a government with them .
and all established parties in germany - whether on the left or right of center - shun the group . left party seen as communist relic for many western germans , the left party is still a relic of former communist east germany , according to tim spier , a political scientist at the institute for party law and research at the university of düsseldorf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prominent faces of germany 's left party - gregor gysi , left , and petra pau forged from the debris of the east german ruling party after reunification in 1990 and known then as the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the left party reached its present incarnation last year when it was joined by a stream of trade unionists , discontented westerners and social democratic party members unhappy with former chancellor gerhard schröder 's package of far-reaching social security and labor market reforms . the origins of the western side of the party as a splinter movement within the social democratic family have left deep wounds .
while the spd and the left party rule together in the city-state of berlin and have at times cooperated in eastern german states , the social democrats refuse to consider a so-called " red-red " coalition in a western state , let alone at the federal level . " it has to be said that in germany , a part of the left still continues in the tradition of the pds and the additional problem is that we have a remnant of the sed -lsb- the former east german ruling party -rsb- there , " said spier .
" west germans have a problem accepting that . " far-left parties in europe enjoy support the situation is distinctly different in other parts of europe where parties left of social democracy are often part of the mainstream political establishment .
in france , sweden and italy , for instance , such parties have been part of national governments . " in the 1970s there was a long period where many traditional communist parties were much more successful than other parties - for instance in france , " spier said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outside russia , communist parties also enjoyed support in europe far-left parties in western europe may have emerged from different ideological traditions and have heterogeneous historical roots . " but they can still be considered as part of a larger family of parties , " said spier . a large chunk of these far-left parties were former communist parties who reinvented themselves after the end of the cold war .
others broke away from the communists much earlier , formed maoist splinter groups to an extent , and finally evolved into moderate left-wing groups . the most successful far-left party in europe is the socialist party in the netherlands . " they took 16.6 percent of the vote in the last parliamentary election , " spier said . far-left parties are also well-established in scandinavia , where they enjoy considerable support among voters - around 10 percent .
for instance , denmark 's socialist people 's party , norway 's socialist left party , sweden 's left party and finland 's left alliance are all far-left parties but represent a more ecological and social stance . far-left parties in italy and france too enjoy popular support .
" though these parties present a significantly moderate face , their rhetoric and their names betray their communist legacy , " said spier . reform-friendly social democrats helped rise of far-left in germany , there was no serious force left of the social democrats and the green party for a long time .
the communist party of germany -lrb- kpd -rrb- was relatively strong during the weimar republic between 1919 and 1933 but was later banned in the 1950s .
the newly formed german communist party -lrb- dkp -rrb- did n't manage to overcome its status as a splinter group .
it was only with reunification in 1990 and the transformation of the sed into the pds , that a political force left of the social democrats take shape .
the party needed until 2005 to become a nation-wide political forced to be reckoned with . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair and schröder 's reform-friendly social democracy has fueled the rise of the far-left the rise of far-left parties in europe has largely been thanks to the social democrats , in particular what tony blair referred to as " new labour " and gerhard schröder the " new center . "
the move away from traditional , labor-friendly politics has indeed fueled the march of the far-left . " the social democrats who remained traditional , as in the case of france , managed to marginalize far-left parties , " said spier . on the other hand , those who turned particularly reform-friendly , such as the social democrats in germany , the netherlands and denmark , have lost large chunks of their traditional voter base to the far-left . " a real dilemma " the far-left in some parts of europe has also made it as far as into national governments - in france , sweden , italy and presently in norway .
but such coalitions have rarely been especially successful . in 1998 , the social democratic party in sweden entered a coalition with the left party and the greens .
one result was that support for the far-left quickly eroded . " we do n't regret being part of the coalition , we could certainly air some of our views , " said gudrun utas of sweden 's left party .
" but we did n't have positive experiences . " after four years of being part of the government , her far-left party has managed to attract just 5 percent of the vote - a far cry from their historic high of 12.8 percent in 1998 . " it 's a real dilemma , " said spier .
" at first , the far-left in sweden profited from the social democrats ' move to the center .
but once they took on governing responsibilities , the far-left lost its halo - as well as votes . "
at the same time , the social democrats won the majority it needed to govern thanks to the far-left . the swedish example may hold lessons for andrea ypsilanti .
depending on the outcome of coalition talks among hesse 's parties , she may yet change her mind and get the left party on board after all in order to gain that magic majority . sejla didic -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's comfortable , there is food and drink at hand and no noisy crowds pushing you around .
and yet , a killer could be stalking you . soccer can be a dangerous business for committed fans .

but they have n't been particularly successful . they could potentially be kingmakers and help andrea ypsilanti , the chairwoman of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in the western german state of hesse , get a majority after a closely contested election in which incumbent roland koch 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- won the vote by a wafer-thin margin . but the left party remains an unwanted child in the german political landscape .
though the far-left party is now represented in two state parliaments in western germany , ypsilanti has vowed she will not form a government with them .
and all established parties in germany - whether on the left or right of center - shun the group . left party seen as communist relic for many western germans , the left party is still a relic of former communist east germany , according to tim spier , a political scientist at the institute for party law and research at the university of düsseldorf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prominent faces of germany 's left party - gregor gysi , left , and petra pau forged from the debris of the east german ruling party after reunification in 1990 and known then as the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the left party reached its present incarnation last year when it was joined by a stream of trade unionists , discontented westerners and social democratic party members unhappy with former chancellor gerhard schröder 's package of far-reaching social security and labor market reforms . the origins of the western side of the party as a splinter movement within the social democratic family have left deep wounds .
while the spd and the left party rule together in the city-state of berlin and have at times cooperated in eastern german states , the social democrats refuse to consider a so-called " red-red " coalition in a western state , let alone at the federal level . " it has to be said that in germany , a part of the left still continues in the tradition of the pds and the additional problem is that we have a remnant of the sed -lsb- the former east german ruling party -rsb- there , " said spier .
" west germans have a problem accepting that . " far-left parties in europe enjoy support the situation is distinctly different in other parts of europe where parties left of social democracy are often part of the mainstream political establishment .
in france , sweden and italy , for instance , such parties have been part of national governments . " in the 1970s there was a long period where many traditional communist parties were much more successful than other parties - for instance in france , " spier said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outside russia , communist parties also enjoyed support in europe far-left parties in western europe may have emerged from different ideological traditions and have heterogeneous historical roots . " but they can still be considered as part of a larger family of parties , " said spier . a large chunk of these far-left parties were former communist parties who reinvented themselves after the end of the cold war .
others broke away from the communists much earlier , formed maoist splinter groups to an extent , and finally evolved into moderate left-wing groups . the most successful far-left party in europe is the socialist party in the netherlands . " they took 16.6 percent of the vote in the last parliamentary election , " spier said . far-left parties are also well-established in scandinavia , where they enjoy considerable support among voters - around 10 percent .
for instance , denmark 's socialist people 's party , norway 's socialist left party , sweden 's left party and finland 's left alliance are all far-left parties but represent a more ecological and social stance . far-left parties in italy and france too enjoy popular support .
" though these parties present a significantly moderate face , their rhetoric and their names betray their communist legacy , " said spier . reform-friendly social democrats helped rise of far-left in germany , there was no serious force left of the social democrats and the green party for a long time .
the communist party of germany -lrb- kpd -rrb- was relatively strong during the weimar republic between 1919 and 1933 but was later banned in the 1950s .
the newly formed german communist party -lrb- dkp -rrb- did n't manage to overcome its status as a splinter group .
it was only with reunification in 1990 and the transformation of the sed into the pds , that a political force left of the social democrats take shape .
the party needed until 2005 to become a nation-wide political forced to be reckoned with . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair and schröder 's reform-friendly social democracy has fueled the rise of the far-left the rise of far-left parties in europe has largely been thanks to the social democrats , in particular what tony blair referred to as " new labour " and gerhard schröder the " new center . "
the move away from traditional , labor-friendly politics has indeed fueled the march of the far-left . " the social democrats who remained traditional , as in the case of france , managed to marginalize far-left parties , " said spier . on the other hand , those who turned particularly reform-friendly , such as the social democrats in germany , the netherlands and denmark , have lost large chunks of their traditional voter base to the far-left . " a real dilemma " the far-left in some parts of europe has also made it as far as into national governments - in france , sweden , italy and presently in norway .
but such coalitions have rarely been especially successful . in 1998 , the social democratic party in sweden entered a coalition with the left party and the greens .
one result was that support for the far-left quickly eroded . " we do n't regret being part of the coalition , we could certainly air some of our views , " said gudrun utas of sweden 's left party .
" but we did n't have positive experiences . " after four years of being part of the government , her far-left party has managed to attract just 5 percent of the vote - a far cry from their historic high of 12.8 percent in 1998 . " it 's a real dilemma , " said spier .
" at first , the far-left in sweden profited from the social democrats ' move to the center .
but once they took on governing responsibilities , the far-left lost its halo - as well as votes . "
at the same time , the social democrats won the majority it needed to govern thanks to the far-left . the swedish example may hold lessons for andrea ypsilanti .
depending on the outcome of coalition talks among hesse 's parties , she may yet change her mind and get the left party on board after all in order to gain that magic majority . sejla didic -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he sees the company as becoming one of europe 's top three providers within the decade . rene obermann , 44 , became ceo of deutsche telekom in november 2006 .
prior to that , he served as ceo of t-mobile international , a subsidiary of deutsche telekom . dw-radio : the federal network agency , germany 's telecommunications authority , is celebrating its 10th anniversary this year .
is that a reason for you to celebrate ? rene obermann : in the past 12 months , we 've done much better in this field of regulated competition and increased our market share .
i think that regulation is there where the market is intensely competitive , which is the case with us .
we have price cuts of 90 percent in some areas and a lot of competitors .
regulation is , then , a part of general competition law .
for me , the regulation authority is , for the most part , an example of successful politics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom , based in bonn , has only partially been privatized you 've said deutsche telekom has an 80 percent market share when it comes to standard telephone customers -lsb- which the authorities view as being too high -rsb- .
when will the regulation authority leave you alone in this area and let you do your work ? it 's a bit speculative , but even when the anti-trust commission and the regulation authority believe that we no longer have a monopolistic position - which will take time , i think - we will still forego telephone connections .
there 's no way around it .
the important thing is that we continue to grow with broad-band and mobile connections and with innovative value-added services . you 're not the only ones in europe in this situation .
other former monopolies like france telecom have similar problems .
how do you see yourself in comparison to the other european telecommunications companies ? stronger and stronger .
we 've worked on our competitiveness and taken a serious look at our cost structures .
we 've made progress in innovation , for example with internet-based television and with mobile internet .
we 're well positioned .
our marketing department is the strongest in germany and our service is getting better and better .

31 , top off months of gala soirees that are often incomprehensible to the city 's non-natives .
but one party re-examines the traditional fetes . cologne during carnival can be terrifying for the uninitiated .
they are faced with drunken , costume-clad karneval enthusiasts singing - and staggering - their way down the streets and partaking in the sort of debauchery they 'll never admit to once the celebrations have come to a close . part of the festival traditions are the sitzungen .
literally " sessions " or " sittings , " the more traditional ones are gala events ; the smaller , more alternatives ones resemble comedy or variety shows composed of skits with performers making liberal use of song and dance to mock politicians , each other and themselves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bit of samba spices up karneval for american singer and actress victoria riccio , who came to germany nearly 20 years ago , the introduction to a sitzung was a shocker . " when i first came here , i went to one of these events and did n't understand a word , but at one point , the people on stage took off all their clothes and jumped around naked , " she said .
" i thought ' oh my god , where have i landed ? '
i loved it right away .
for me it was like halloween and the best party you 've ever been to , all wrapped into one . " immigrants take the stage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the immigrantenstadl kicked off three years ago still , despite the lure of scantily-clad hedonists and the beer that flows abundantly , karneval and its sitzungen can make non-germans feel like outsiders due to all the inside jokes about local politics and heavy use of the local dialect . so riccio , along with emcee hektor haarkötter and a host of others , started their own show called the " immigrantenstadl . "
it 's a gala put on for and by immigrants - which in cologne can also mean anyone born outside the city limits . " a bunch of us met with other artists and musicians in a pub in the southern part of the city and talked for hours , making all sorts of plans for a show , " he said .
" after a while , someone asked ' who at this table was actually born in cologne ? '
and then we realized that no one was originally from cologne . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mocking the tricky ö , ü,ä vowels of german is easier than mastering them rather than put on a typical cologne sitzung performed by foreigners , haarkötter said the " immigrantenstadl , " which started three years ago , aims to incorporate aspects of foreign cultures for an international audience . " cologne 's karneval can be a very traditional thing with a lot of very old styles and ways of having a party , " he said .
" we try to innovate by integrating special forms and customs from other countries and other cultures .
we yodel , we wear bavarian and japanese clothes , and we do brazilian samba and turkish folklore skits . " cologne 's large immigrant population there are jazzy numbers in which the performers sing lines like " we 've come to stay , we 're not leaving " - referring to the one in five people living in cologne who has an immigrant background , in an urban population of around 1 million . yet , by being semi-outsiders , performers are able to point out the quirky characteristics among germans - and even themselves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what would cologne do without all its greek immigrants , even if they are philosophers ?
during one immigrantenstadl skit , a turkish-german actor explains that in turkey , when someone wants to steal something , the thief waits until a person leaves his house , sneaks in and grabs the item .
in germany , he quips , a person will go to a home , ring the bell , say " hello , " take the television and leave a receipt for the item on the table . another number shows a romanian actress who tries to discern the future of karneval in her crystal ball . good-humored mockery it 's poking fun at cultural differences in a good-humored , tongue-in-cheek way that makes the show so appealing , said julien , a frenchman who 's lived in cologne for three years .
he claimed that , contrary to the stereotype , germans are able to mock themselves . " there are some very funny pieces in this show and i like the mixture of jokes about germans and immigrants in germany and how they all live here together , " he said .
" there are a lot of taboos surrounding the subject .
in this show , there are no taboos .
it 's great ! " while the typical cologne sitzung is performed in the local kölsch dialect , which immigrants and germans from outside the city alike have difficulty understanding , the singers and actors in the " immigrantenstadl " dole out their mockery of world events in a kaleidoscope of languages , including german , english , turkish , romanian , greek and czech . creating the mood with a beer - or three bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world players like president bush and condi rice are not left unscathed in one funky , hip-hop sketch , a singer in a cowboy hat masquerading as us president george w. bush complains about his work overload in the white house and iraq .
splashing around in a plastic baby pool , he takes comfort in his cozy relationship with secretary of state condoleezza rice . it could be the turkish hip-hop , the greek melodies , the brazilian sambas or the deliberate on-stage mayhem that make the " immigrantenstadl 's " sold-out shows so attractive to both foreigners and locals .
or it could be the chance to take part in a traditional party tilted just far enough off kilter to suit non-traditionalists . " put on a really wacky costume , get yourself in a good mood - although sometimes , if you go to the right place , people can kind of get you into the right mood , " said american riccio , advising newcomers on how to enjoy karneval .
" and of course , i hate to say it , but one or two or three or four kölsch beers do n't hurt either . " louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" after a while , someone asked ' who at this table was actually born in cologne ? '
and then we realized that no one was originally from cologne .

" we try to innovate by integrating special forms and customs from other countries and other cultures .

he claimed that , contrary to the stereotype , germans are able to mock themselves . " there are some very funny pieces in this show and i like the mixture of jokes about germans and immigrants in germany and how they all live here together , " he said .
" there are a lot of taboos surrounding the subject .
in this show , there are no taboos .
it 's great ! " while the typical cologne sitzung is performed in the local kölsch dialect , which immigrants and germans from outside the city alike have difficulty understanding , the singers and actors in the " immigrantenstadl " dole out their mockery of world events in a kaleidoscope of languages , including german , english , turkish , romanian , greek and czech . creating the mood with a beer - or three bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world players like president bush and condi rice are not left unscathed in one funky , hip-hop sketch , a singer in a cowboy hat masquerading as us president george w. bush complains about his work overload in the white house and iraq .

it 's comfortable , there is food and drink at hand and no noisy crowds pushing you around .
and yet , a killer could be stalking you . soccer can be a dangerous business for committed fans .
in the stadiums themselves , supporters face a number of medical risks including serious bladder episodes brought on by too many half-time beers , temporary bouts of tourette 's syndrome and , in the case of england fans , actual death through boredom .
no one who follows a team with passion should take their allegiance lightly .
it can seriously damage your health . those who have ever watched their team 's chances of success end in the lottery of a penalty shoot-out will already know this .
but if anyone was in doubt about the potential danger of staking your happiness on the fortune of 11 men running around on a soccer field , a group of german scientists have done the typically teutonic thing and proved it should be avoided . taking german fans who followed their team through the 2006 world cup as their case study group , the men in lab coats from munich 's ludwig-maximilians university have discovered that the risk of a heart attack or other cardiovascular problem in male fans increased three-fold on days when the german team was in action . it was n't just irrational and emotionally charged fans on the edge of their stadium seats who were suffering .
victims also included over-stressed fans watching the game in the comfort of their own homes .
and they were n't all men , either : female fans also recorded a rise in emergencies , with the amount of heart incidents in women rising by 82 percent during the tournament . the researchers came to their conclusions after reviewing 4,279 medical reports from the seven days the german team played in the 2006 world cup , the 24 days when matches involved teams from other countries , and 242 other days in 2003 , 2005 and 2006 . paying the penalty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's super-fit players handled the shoot-out well the research showed that cardiac emergencies usually occurred within two hours of the start of a match , which would explain why the largest number of attacks occurred during the june 30 quarter-final in which germany defeated argentina in a dramatic penalty shoot-out .
after 90 minutes of regular time and an additional 30 minutes of extra-time , german fans found themselves entering the danger zone and 64 of them suffered heart attacks as a result . the next game , germany 's semi-final loss to italy which went into extra-time , produced almost as many heart attacks . " apparently , of prime importance for triggering a stress-induced event is not the outcome of a game - a win or a loss - but rather the intense strain and excitement experienced during the viewing of a dramatic match , such as one with a penalty shoot-out , " the research report , published in the new england journal of medicine , stated . hosts ' march raises pulses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just remember to breathe watching jürgen klinsmann 's team throughout the world cup on home soil was a potential killer for german fans as six of the seven games in which the team participated were associated with an increase in the number of cardiac emergencies . the only game which produced no spike in heart-related problems was the third-place match in which germany defeated portugal 3-1 .
presumably , with the main prize out of contention , more of the pressure was off and fans could relax their heart valves . while the excitement of germany 's march to the semi-finals was a contributing factor to the increase in heart episodes , others were cited by the report .
fans might have been subject to risk factors such as lack of sleep , overeating , consumption of junk food , alcohol and smoking during the world cup , which would not have helped to keep them in tip-top physical condition for the rigors of supporting germany . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the book 's publisher says kids have a right to enlightenment . the german family ministry is pushing for the children 's book " how do i get to god , asked the small piglet , " by written by michael schmidt-salomon and illustrated by helge nyncke , to be included on a list of literature considered dangerous for young people .

" the distinctive characteristics of each religion are made ridiculous . " the search for god bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the god delusion " for kids ?
the book tells the story of a piglet and a hedgehog , who discover a poster attached to their house that says : " if you do not know god , you are missing something ! " this frightens them because they had never suspected at all that anything was missing in their lives .
thus they set out to look for " god . "

he reacts to the animals by flying into a rage , yelling at them that god had set out to destroy all life on earth at the time of noah and chases them away . the mufti fares little better .
while he greets both animals at first as a quiet man and invites them into his mosque , he soon changes into a ranting fanatic .
he assembles a baying islamic mob and holds the animals up in a clenched fist while condemning them to everlasting damnation through bared teeth and an unruly-looking beard . the insinuation here is that all visitors to mosques are extremists and every imam who appears reasonable is , in truth , nevertheless , a preacher of hate . animals reject religion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the three religious leaders are shown as being violent , insane and intolerant the bishop , a pale fat man with a clearly insinuated predilection for child abuse , makes up the unholy trinity which eventually convinces piglet and hedgehog , after they have survived the long search in the maze of religions , that nothing of any importance has been missing from their lives .

the book 's publisher says kids have a right to enlightenment . the german family ministry is pushing for the children 's book " how do i get to god , asked the small piglet , " by written by michael schmidt-salomon and illustrated by helge nyncke , to be included on a list of literature considered dangerous for young people .

" the distinctive characteristics of each religion are made ridiculous . " the search for god bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the god delusion " for kids ?
the book tells the story of a piglet and a hedgehog , who discover a poster attached to their house that says : " if you do not know god , you are missing something ! " this frightens them because they had never suspected at all that anything was missing in their lives .
thus they set out to look for " god . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 31.01.2008 shunned in germany , far-left gets support elsewhere in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : die linke - germany 's left party - has steadily increased its voter base while the left party in germany is cold-shouldered by all established political groupings , other european nations ' far-left parties are often part of ruling coalitions .
but they have n't been particularly successful . they could potentially be kingmakers and help andrea ypsilanti , the chairwoman of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in the western german state of hesse , get a majority after a closely contested election in which incumbent roland koch 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- won the vote by a wafer-thin margin . but the left party remains an unwanted child in the german political landscape .
though the far-left party is now represented in two state parliaments in western germany , ypsilanti has vowed she will not form a government with them .
and all established parties in germany - whether on the left or right of center - shun the group . left party seen as communist relic for many western germans , the left party is still a relic of former communist east germany , according to tim spier , a political scientist at the institute for party law and research at the university of düsseldorf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prominent faces of germany 's left party - gregor gysi , left , and petra pau forged from the debris of the east german ruling party after reunification in 1990 and known then as the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the left party reached its present incarnation last year when it was joined by a stream of trade unionists , discontented westerners and social democratic party members unhappy with former chancellor gerhard schröder 's package of far-reaching social security and labor market reforms . the origins of the western side of the party as a splinter movement within the social democratic family have left deep wounds .
while the spd and the left party rule together in the city-state of berlin and have at times cooperated in eastern german states , the social democrats refuse to consider a so-called " red-red " coalition in a western state , let alone at the federal level . " it has to be said that in germany , a part of the left still continues in the tradition of the pds and the additional problem is that we have a remnant of the sed -lsb- the former east german ruling party -rsb- there , " said spier .
" west germans have a problem accepting that . " far-left parties in europe enjoy support the situation is distinctly different in other parts of europe where parties left of social democracy are often part of the mainstream political establishment .
in france , sweden and italy , for instance , such parties have been part of national governments . " in the 1970s there was a long period where many traditional communist parties were much more successful than other parties - for instance in france , " spier said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outside russia , communist parties also enjoyed support in europe far-left parties in western europe may have emerged from different ideological traditions and have heterogeneous historical roots . " but they can still be considered as part of a larger family of parties , " said spier . a large chunk of these far-left parties were former communist parties who reinvented themselves after the end of the cold war .
others broke away from the communists much earlier , formed maoist splinter groups to an extent , and finally evolved into moderate left-wing groups . the most successful far-left party in europe is the socialist party in the netherlands . " they took 16.6 percent of the vote in the last parliamentary election , " spier said . far-left parties are also well-established in scandinavia , where they enjoy considerable support among voters - around 10 percent .
for instance , denmark 's socialist people 's party , norway 's socialist left party , sweden 's left party and finland 's left alliance are all far-left parties but represent a more ecological and social stance . far-left parties in italy and france too enjoy popular support .
" though these parties present a significantly moderate face , their rhetoric and their names betray their communist legacy , " said spier . reform-friendly social democrats helped rise of far-left in germany , there was no serious force left of the social democrats and the green party for a long time .
the communist party of germany -lrb- kpd -rrb- was relatively strong during the weimar republic between 1919 and 1933 but was later banned in the 1950s .
the newly formed german communist party -lrb- dkp -rrb- did n't manage to overcome its status as a splinter group .
it was only with reunification in 1990 and the transformation of the sed into the pds , that a political force left of the social democrats take shape .
the party needed until 2005 to become a nation-wide political forced to be reckoned with . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair and schröder 's reform-friendly social democracy has fueled the rise of the far-left the rise of far-left parties in europe has largely been thanks to the social democrats , in particular what tony blair referred to as " new labour " and gerhard schröder the " new center . "
the move away from traditional , labor-friendly politics has indeed fueled the march of the far-left . " the social democrats who remained traditional , as in the case of france , managed to marginalize far-left parties , " said spier . on the other hand , those who turned particularly reform-friendly , such as the social democrats in germany , the netherlands and denmark , have lost large chunks of their traditional voter base to the far-left . " a real dilemma " the far-left in some parts of europe has also made it as far as into national governments - in france , sweden , italy and presently in norway .
but such coalitions have rarely been especially successful . in 1998 , the social democratic party in sweden entered a coalition with the left party and the greens .
one result was that support for the far-left quickly eroded . " we do n't regret being part of the coalition , we could certainly air some of our views , " said gudrun utas of sweden 's left party .
" but we did n't have positive experiences . " after four years of being part of the government , her far-left party has managed to attract just 5 percent of the vote - a far cry from their historic high of 12.8 percent in 1998 . " it 's a real dilemma , " said spier .
" at first , the far-left in sweden profited from the social democrats ' move to the center .
but once they took on governing responsibilities , the far-left lost its halo - as well as votes . "
at the same time , the social democrats won the majority it needed to govern thanks to the far-left . the swedish example may hold lessons for andrea ypsilanti .
depending on the outcome of coalition talks among hesse 's parties , she may yet change her mind and get the left party on board after all in order to gain that magic majority . sejla didic -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" by allowing autocrats to pose as democrats without demanding they uphold the civil and political rights that make democracy meaningful , the united states , the european union and other influential democracies risk undermining human rights worldwide , " the new york-based rights group said in its annual report . fair elections are not the only essential component to democracy , said hrw , adding that a free press , freedom of assembly and free speech are also crucial . the european union 's stance on russia received special condemnation from the human right 's group , which said the 27-member bloc put political ties with an important energy supplier ahead of a responsibility to address moscow 's human rights ' record . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu should have taken a much harder line with russia , the ngo said " human rights did not figure prominently in the broader eu-russia agenda , " the report said .

" ' bad news for eu hopeful turkey was taken to task in the report for violating free speech .
the country has begun accession talks with the european union , but human rights remain a key issue in the discussion . " the criminalization of speech remains a key obstacle to the protection of human rights in turkey , contributing to an atmosphere of intolerance that assumed violent proportions in 2007 , " the report said . hrw recalled the ethnic armenian journalist hrant dink , who was shot dead in istanbul in january last year after labeling as genocide the world war i massacres of armenians in the ottoman empire . pre-olympic slip bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has n't kept its promise to improve human rights before the olympics in the global spotlight ahead of the 2008 olympic games , host country china has promised to improve the human rights situation within its borders .
instead , preparations have only led to more violations , said hrw , including evictions of residents for olympic construction , abysmal work conditions and tighter restrictions on government critics . " official efforts to rid beijing of undesirables ahead of the olympics have accelerated the eviction of petitioners - citizens from the countryside who come to the capital seeking redress for grievances ranging from illegal land seizures to official corruption , " said the report . hrw director kenneth roth on thursday urged the world to put pressure on china to ameliorate the situation before the games . " the olympics are a historic opportunity for the chinese government to show the world that it can make human rights a reality for its 1.4 billion citizens , " said roth . the anti-terror campaign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us was accused of holding prisoners without trial at guantanamo bay not only the us , but also france , pakistan and great britain were criticized by hrw for breaching human rights in the name of the " war on terror .

the american prison in cuba came under fire , in particular . " there is no evidence of progress concerning the treatment of so-called enemy combatants , including those held at guantanamo bay , or the use of secret detention facilities " in foreign countries , the report said . hrw estimated that 275 people are still imprisoned at the guantanamo bay camp and that another 39 are currently being held by in secret us detention facilities . in all , more than 75 countries were admonished in the report for their human rights situation .

" the olympics are a historic opportunity for the chinese government to show the world that it can make human rights a reality for its 1.4 billion citizens , " said roth . the anti-terror campaign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us was accused of holding prisoners without trial at guantanamo bay not only the us , but also france , pakistan and great britain were criticized by hrw for breaching human rights in the name of the " war on terror . "
the american prison in cuba came under fire , in particular . " there is no evidence of progress concerning the treatment of so-called enemy combatants , including those held at guantanamo bay , or the use of secret detention facilities " in foreign countries , the report said . hrw estimated that 275 people are still imprisoned at the guantanamo bay camp and that another 39 are currently being held by in secret us detention facilities . in all , more than 75 countries were admonished in the report for their human rights situation .
among the countries with the most atrocities were chad , the democratic republic of congo , somalia , ethiopia , sri lanka , iraq , and the sudanese region of darfur . burma , china , cuba , eritrea , libya , iran , north korea , saudi arabia and vietnam were named as being closed societies or under severe repression . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it can seriously damage your health . those who have ever watched their team 's chances of success end in the lottery of a penalty shoot-out will already know this .
but if anyone was in doubt about the potential danger of staking your happiness on the fortune of 11 men running around on a soccer field , a group of german scientists have done the typically teutonic thing and proved it should be avoided . taking german fans who followed their team through the 2006 world cup as their case study group , the men in lab coats from munich 's ludwig-maximilians university have discovered that the risk of a heart attack or other cardiovascular problem in male fans increased three-fold on days when the german team was in action . it was n't just irrational and emotionally charged fans on the edge of their stadium seats who were suffering .

and they were n't all men , either : female fans also recorded a rise in emergencies , with the amount of heart incidents in women rising by 82 percent during the tournament . the researchers came to their conclusions after reviewing 4,279 medical reports from the seven days the german team played in the 2006 world cup , the 24 days when matches involved teams from other countries , and 242 other days in 2003 , 2005 and 2006 . paying the penalty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's super-fit players handled the shoot-out well the research showed that cardiac emergencies usually occurred within two hours of the start of a match , which would explain why the largest number of attacks occurred during the june 30 quarter-final in which germany defeated argentina in a dramatic penalty shoot-out .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 31.01.2008 internet , ageing ca n't take fun out of sex , german expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red-light districts or not , germany is n't particularly open about sex since the late 1980s , erika berger has been one of germany 's leading sex experts .
on tv and in print , she 's advised countless people about matters most intimate .
we talked to her on the eve of a historical anniversary . published 60 years ago , the first kinsey report , titled " sexual behavior in the human male , " shocked the general public for discussing subjects that had previously been taboo and for openly challenging conventional sexual beliefs of the day .
though kinsey 's methods have repeatedly been questioned by opponents , the report remains one of the largest studies ever conducted on human sexual behavior . dw-world.de : the kinsey report launched the sexual revolution when it was published on jan .
31 , 1948 .
now it 's celebrating its 60th anniversary .
how important was it to your career ? erika berger : well , i was much too young to read it when it came out , but of course i have it on my shelf at home just like everyone today who 's interested in sexuality .
there are things in it , where you say , " yes , that 's exactly right . "
there 's no reason not to do things that are a bit out of the ordinary and that may be incomprehensible to other people .
and above all we should talk about sexuality .
we should n't try to conceal things , and we should leave people with other sexual preferences and drives in peace . it took several years for the kinsey report to be translated into german .
was germany backwards in this regard ? as i began dealing with sexuality in front of the camera , it was a wasteland .
there was director oswalt kolle who made a number of sex-education films in the 1960s .

sex is the way i experience it and do it - together with my partner .
the concepts of normal and abnormal sex mean nothing to me .
i think it 's impertinent for someone today to say " what gays do , is n't normal . "

there 's no age limit for sex - or love , which i always stress is connected with sex .

it 's only their second or third most important concern - the top one is tenderness .
is there someone there who loves me and whom i can love back ?
it 's a matter of trust , above all , and sexuality develops from it . so there will be more attention paid to older people 's sexuality ? of course , because people are getting older , and - thank god - they 're no longer stupid enough to try and conceal the fact that they 're no longer doing the dirty deed . -lrb- laughs -rrb- look at it this way - everyone , no matter how old , has a baby inside that needs to be cuddled .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 31.01.2008 internet , ageing ca n't take fun out of sex , german expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red-light districts or not , germany is n't particularly open about sex since the late 1980s , erika berger has been one of germany 's leading sex experts .
on tv and in print , she 's advised countless people about matters most intimate .
we talked to her on the eve of a historical anniversary . published 60 years ago , the first kinsey report , titled " sexual behavior in the human male , " shocked the general public for discussing subjects that had previously been taboo and for openly challenging conventional sexual beliefs of the day .
though kinsey 's methods have repeatedly been questioned by opponents , the report remains one of the largest studies ever conducted on human sexual behavior . dw-world.de : the kinsey report launched the sexual revolution when it was published on jan .
31 , 1948 .
now it 's celebrating its 60th anniversary .
how important was it to your career ? erika berger : well , i was much too young to read it when it came out , but of course i have it on my shelf at home just like everyone today who 's interested in sexuality .
there are things in it , where you say , " yes , that 's exactly right . "
there 's no reason not to do things that are a bit out of the ordinary and that may be incomprehensible to other people .
and above all we should talk about sexuality .
we should n't try to conceal things , and we should leave people with other sexual preferences and drives in peace . it took several years for the kinsey report to be translated into german .
was germany backwards in this regard ? as i began dealing with sexuality in front of the camera , it was a wasteland .
there was director oswalt kolle who made a number of sex-education films in the 1960s .
he was an educational pioneer , and i think it was only then that we in germany realized that sex was something completely normal .
in that respect i think germany did lag behind america a bit . the results of the kinsey report suggested that sexual practices traditionally dismissed as perverse were far more widespread than people thought .
is there such a thing as " normal sex ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika berger currently hosts the call-in advice show " night talk " you 'd have to ask yourself the question : what is normal sex for a given individual ?
and you could just as well ask : what is good or bad sex for that individual ?
sex is the way i experience it and do it - together with my partner .
the concepts of normal and abnormal sex mean nothing to me .
i think it 's impertinent for someone today to say " what gays do , is n't normal . "
who are they to say what 's normal ?
i myself determine what 's normal for me . the internet has opened up whole new possibilities for tracking people 's sex preferences .
what effect has that had on sexual research ? i think the web is unbelievably important for sex research .
first of all , it allows you to look things up things instantly .
and it 's very transparent .
i no longer have to go somewhere and buy a book that i hardly dare to ask for because the title is so racy .
instead i just log on to the web , click and i 've got everything i need .
and it 's interesting that you can measure people 's clicks and see whether they are interested in the missionary position , same-sex love or unusual sexual practices .
are they interested in sex toys or masturbation tips ?
that 's very interesting . then public sexual morality often differs drastically from people 's actual online sexual behavior ? absolutely .
you can read about things , click on them and inform yourself .
you can even talk about and discuss them .
but when people are confronted with their own desires , they sometimes lack the courage .
some do n't want to overburden their partners ; others simply do n't know where to begin .
to take a somewhat crass example : if i said , " how about some role playing or bondage tonight ? " or " i 'm into sadomasochism , " i would n't know how my partner would react .
and then it 's too late .
that 's why , in practice , sex is often so boring . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berger says the internet offers positive and negative forms of anonymity is it not ironic that the possibilities opened up by the anonymity of the internet often get in the way of sexual communication ? yes , it 's suffered from that .
today i can choose a partner via the internet - i can virtually " invite " someone into my living room and talk to him via the computer screen .
but , please , what good is that ?
it 's totally one-dimensional .
it 's the same as if i look at pictures of naked women or men or sex practices on the screen .
what good does it do me ? that sounds as if there 's still a need for sexual education in the internet age , a need to bring people together to talk about sex . i think the attempt to bring people together is great .
but it does n't always work .
let 's say i decide i want a man .
so i go to some web page and look for a guy i 'd like to chat with .
then you start talking , and of course your conversations revolve around horizontal kinds of fun .
but i still want to see the guy some time !
i love chatting , and i 'm very involved with the internet .
but i still think that you have to talk face-to-face at some point .
i miss that .
it 's a kind of anonymity that i do n't like very much . you 're 67 , and your last book dealt with growing older and specifically with menopause .
that 's very topical because the average age is increasing in germany and many other western countries .
will it have an effect on our sex lives ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as people get older , they start to question the value of getting horizontal it creates a very important question : is sex in old age a taboo or not ?
personally i 'd plead for treating it as something normal .
who says that you should n't have sex at the age of 60 , 70 or 80 ?
there 's no age limit for sex - or love , which i always stress is connected with sex .
if a person is healthy , he can still have a very fulfilling sexual life .
but one thing i found out from talking to people for my last book was that as they get older , sex becomes less important .
it 's only their second or third most important concern - the top one is tenderness .
is there someone there who loves me and whom i can love back ?
it 's a matter of trust , above all , and sexuality develops from it . so there will be more attention paid to older people 's sexuality ? of course , because people are getting older , and - thank god - they 're no longer stupid enough to try and conceal the fact that they 're no longer doing the dirty deed . -lrb- laughs -rrb- look at it this way - everyone , no matter how old , has a baby inside that needs to be cuddled .
when you enter puberty , it 's great .
and when you 're in the prime of life , you 've lost most of your inhibitions .
but if you 're a woman entering menopause , you have so many inhibitions .
you do n't dare take off your clothes .
you 're afraid that sex will hurt .
you have so many things that can take away your desire for sexuality .
you say , " oh , i 'm old . "
but you 're not old .
you 're just entering a new phase of life .
that 's great .
why are you laughing ? no reason - you just made ageing sound pleasant .
one last - frivolous - question : you recorded a song in the 1990s called " sex is fun . "
when was the last time you listened to it ? -lrb- laughs . -rrb-
oh god , i know exactly when it was .
six months ago .
i was sitting around with some colleagues , chatting interactively , and they said , " hey , we 've found something really funny .
it 's your cd . "
we listened to it and laughed ourselves under the table .
what do think about that ?
pretty funny , huh ? i do n't have any problem with that .
i have no problem with getting older , or with saying that sex is fun , or with anything i 've every done in my professional or personal life .
i think it 's great .
it 's part of life . i would n't have minded making a record - especially not with that title . -lrb- laughs -rrb- too late .
i got there first . interview : jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

we talked to her on the eve of a historical anniversary . published 60 years ago , the first kinsey report , titled " sexual behavior in the human male , " shocked the general public for discussing subjects that had previously been taboo and for openly challenging conventional sexual beliefs of the day .
though kinsey 's methods have repeatedly been questioned by opponents , the report remains one of the largest studies ever conducted on human sexual behavior . dw-world.de : the kinsey report launched the sexual revolution when it was published on jan .
31 , 1948 .
now it 's celebrating its 60th anniversary .
how important was it to your career ? erika berger : well , i was much too young to read it when it came out , but of course i have it on my shelf at home just like everyone today who 's interested in sexuality .
there are things in it , where you say , " yes , that 's exactly right . "
there 's no reason not to do things that are a bit out of the ordinary and that may be incomprehensible to other people .
and above all we should talk about sexuality .
we should n't try to conceal things , and we should leave people with other sexual preferences and drives in peace . it took several years for the kinsey report to be translated into german .
was germany backwards in this regard ? as i began dealing with sexuality in front of the camera , it was a wasteland .
there was director oswalt kolle who made a number of sex-education films in the 1960s .
he was an educational pioneer , and i think it was only then that we in germany realized that sex was something completely normal .
in that respect i think germany did lag behind america a bit . the results of the kinsey report suggested that sexual practices traditionally dismissed as perverse were far more widespread than people thought .
is there such a thing as " normal sex ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika berger currently hosts the call-in advice show " night talk " you 'd have to ask yourself the question : what is normal sex for a given individual ?
and you could just as well ask : what is good or bad sex for that individual ?
sex is the way i experience it and do it - together with my partner .
the concepts of normal and abnormal sex mean nothing to me .
i think it 's impertinent for someone today to say " what gays do , is n't normal . "
who are they to say what 's normal ?
i myself determine what 's normal for me . the internet has opened up whole new possibilities for tracking people 's sex preferences .
what effect has that had on sexual research ? i think the web is unbelievably important for sex research .
first of all , it allows you to look things up things instantly .
and it 's very transparent .
i no longer have to go somewhere and buy a book that i hardly dare to ask for because the title is so racy .
instead i just log on to the web , click and i 've got everything i need .
and it 's interesting that you can measure people 's clicks and see whether they are interested in the missionary position , same-sex love or unusual sexual practices .
are they interested in sex toys or masturbation tips ?
that 's very interesting . then public sexual morality often differs drastically from people 's actual online sexual behavior ? absolutely .
you can read about things , click on them and inform yourself .
you can even talk about and discuss them .
but when people are confronted with their own desires , they sometimes lack the courage .
some do n't want to overburden their partners ; others simply do n't know where to begin .
to take a somewhat crass example : if i said , " how about some role playing or bondage tonight ? " or " i 'm into sadomasochism , " i would n't know how my partner would react .
and then it 's too late .
that 's why , in practice , sex is often so boring . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berger says the internet offers positive and negative forms of anonymity is it not ironic that the possibilities opened up by the anonymity of the internet often get in the way of sexual communication ? yes , it 's suffered from that .
today i can choose a partner via the internet - i can virtually " invite " someone into my living room and talk to him via the computer screen .
but , please , what good is that ?
it 's totally one-dimensional .
it 's the same as if i look at pictures of naked women or men or sex practices on the screen .
what good does it do me ? that sounds as if there 's still a need for sexual education in the internet age , a need to bring people together to talk about sex . i think the attempt to bring people together is great .
but it does n't always work .
let 's say i decide i want a man .
so i go to some web page and look for a guy i 'd like to chat with .
then you start talking , and of course your conversations revolve around horizontal kinds of fun .
but i still want to see the guy some time !
i love chatting , and i 'm very involved with the internet .
but i still think that you have to talk face-to-face at some point .
i miss that .
it 's a kind of anonymity that i do n't like very much . you 're 67 , and your last book dealt with growing older and specifically with menopause .
that 's very topical because the average age is increasing in germany and many other western countries .
will it have an effect on our sex lives ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as people get older , they start to question the value of getting horizontal it creates a very important question : is sex in old age a taboo or not ?
personally i 'd plead for treating it as something normal .
who says that you should n't have sex at the age of 60 , 70 or 80 ?
there 's no age limit for sex - or love , which i always stress is connected with sex .
if a person is healthy , he can still have a very fulfilling sexual life .
but one thing i found out from talking to people for my last book was that as they get older , sex becomes less important .
it 's only their second or third most important concern - the top one is tenderness .
is there someone there who loves me and whom i can love back ?
it 's a matter of trust , above all , and sexuality develops from it . so there will be more attention paid to older people 's sexuality ? of course , because people are getting older , and - thank god - they 're no longer stupid enough to try and conceal the fact that they 're no longer doing the dirty deed . -lrb- laughs -rrb- look at it this way - everyone , no matter how old , has a baby inside that needs to be cuddled .
when you enter puberty , it 's great .
and when you 're in the prime of life , you 've lost most of your inhibitions .
but if you 're a woman entering menopause , you have so many inhibitions .
you do n't dare take off your clothes .
you 're afraid that sex will hurt .
you have so many things that can take away your desire for sexuality .
you say , " oh , i 'm old . "
but you 're not old .
you 're just entering a new phase of life .
that 's great .
why are you laughing ? no reason - you just made ageing sound pleasant .
one last - frivolous - question : you recorded a song in the 1990s called " sex is fun . "
when was the last time you listened to it ? -lrb- laughs . -rrb-
oh god , i know exactly when it was .
six months ago .
i was sitting around with some colleagues , chatting interactively , and they said , " hey , we 've found something really funny .
it 's your cd . "
we listened to it and laughed ourselves under the table .
what do think about that ?
pretty funny , huh ? i do n't have any problem with that .
i have no problem with getting older , or with saying that sex is fun , or with anything i 've every done in my professional or personal life .
i think it 's great .

it 's comfortable , there is food and drink at hand and no noisy crowds pushing you around .
and yet , a killer could be stalking you . soccer can be a dangerous business for committed fans .
in the stadiums themselves , supporters face a number of medical risks including serious bladder episodes brought on by too many half-time beers , temporary bouts of tourette 's syndrome and , in the case of england fans , actual death through boredom .
no one who follows a team with passion should take their allegiance lightly .
it can seriously damage your health . those who have ever watched their team 's chances of success end in the lottery of a penalty shoot-out will already know this .
but if anyone was in doubt about the potential danger of staking your happiness on the fortune of 11 men running around on a soccer field , a group of german scientists have done the typically teutonic thing and proved it should be avoided . taking german fans who followed their team through the 2006 world cup as their case study group , the men in lab coats from munich 's ludwig-maximilians university have discovered that the risk of a heart attack or other cardiovascular problem in male fans increased three-fold on days when the german team was in action . it was n't just irrational and emotionally charged fans on the edge of their stadium seats who were suffering .
victims also included over-stressed fans watching the game in the comfort of their own homes .
and they were n't all men , either : female fans also recorded a rise in emergencies , with the amount of heart incidents in women rising by 82 percent during the tournament . the researchers came to their conclusions after reviewing 4,279 medical reports from the seven days the german team played in the 2006 world cup , the 24 days when matches involved teams from other countries , and 242 other days in 2003 , 2005 and 2006 . paying the penalty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's super-fit players handled the shoot-out well the research showed that cardiac emergencies usually occurred within two hours of the start of a match , which would explain why the largest number of attacks occurred during the june 30 quarter-final in which germany defeated argentina in a dramatic penalty shoot-out .
after 90 minutes of regular time and an additional 30 minutes of extra-time , german fans found themselves entering the danger zone and 64 of them suffered heart attacks as a result . the next game , germany 's semi-final loss to italy which went into extra-time , produced almost as many heart attacks . " apparently , of prime importance for triggering a stress-induced event is not the outcome of a game - a win or a loss - but rather the intense strain and excitement experienced during the viewing of a dramatic match , such as one with a penalty shoot-out , " the research report , published in the new england journal of medicine , stated . hosts ' march raises pulses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just remember to breathe watching jürgen klinsmann 's team throughout the world cup on home soil was a potential killer for german fans as six of the seven games in which the team participated were associated with an increase in the number of cardiac emergencies . the only game which produced no spike in heart-related problems was the third-place match in which germany defeated portugal 3-1 .
presumably , with the main prize out of contention , more of the pressure was off and fans could relax their heart valves . while the excitement of germany 's march to the semi-finals was a contributing factor to the increase in heart episodes , others were cited by the report .
fans might have been subject to risk factors such as lack of sleep , overeating , consumption of junk food , alcohol and smoking during the world cup , which would not have helped to keep them in tip-top physical condition for the rigors of supporting germany . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 31.01.2008 shunned in germany , far-left gets support elsewhere in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : die linke - germany 's left party - has steadily increased its voter base while the left party in germany is cold-shouldered by all established political groupings , other european nations ' far-left parties are often part of ruling coalitions .
but they have n't been particularly successful . they could potentially be kingmakers and help andrea ypsilanti , the chairwoman of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in the western german state of hesse , get a majority after a closely contested election in which incumbent roland koch 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- won the vote by a wafer-thin margin . but the left party remains an unwanted child in the german political landscape .
though the far-left party is now represented in two state parliaments in western germany , ypsilanti has vowed she will not form a government with them .
and all established parties in germany - whether on the left or right of center - shun the group . left party seen as communist relic for many western germans , the left party is still a relic of former communist east germany , according to tim spier , a political scientist at the institute for party law and research at the university of düsseldorf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prominent faces of germany 's left party - gregor gysi , left , and petra pau forged from the debris of the east german ruling party after reunification in 1990 and known then as the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the left party reached its present incarnation last year when it was joined by a stream of trade unionists , discontented westerners and social democratic party members unhappy with former chancellor gerhard schröder 's package of far-reaching social security and labor market reforms . the origins of the western side of the party as a splinter movement within the social democratic family have left deep wounds .
while the spd and the left party rule together in the city-state of berlin and have at times cooperated in eastern german states , the social democrats refuse to consider a so-called " red-red " coalition in a western state , let alone at the federal level . " it has to be said that in germany , a part of the left still continues in the tradition of the pds and the additional problem is that we have a remnant of the sed -lsb- the former east german ruling party -rsb- there , " said spier .
" west germans have a problem accepting that . " far-left parties in europe enjoy support the situation is distinctly different in other parts of europe where parties left of social democracy are often part of the mainstream political establishment .
in france , sweden and italy , for instance , such parties have been part of national governments . " in the 1970s there was a long period where many traditional communist parties were much more successful than other parties - for instance in france , " spier said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outside russia , communist parties also enjoyed support in europe far-left parties in western europe may have emerged from different ideological traditions and have heterogeneous historical roots . " but they can still be considered as part of a larger family of parties , " said spier . a large chunk of these far-left parties were former communist parties who reinvented themselves after the end of the cold war .
others broke away from the communists much earlier , formed maoist splinter groups to an extent , and finally evolved into moderate left-wing groups . the most successful far-left party in europe is the socialist party in the netherlands . " they took 16.6 percent of the vote in the last parliamentary election , " spier said . far-left parties are also well-established in scandinavia , where they enjoy considerable support among voters - around 10 percent .
for instance , denmark 's socialist people 's party , norway 's socialist left party , sweden 's left party and finland 's left alliance are all far-left parties but represent a more ecological and social stance . far-left parties in italy and france too enjoy popular support .
" though these parties present a significantly moderate face , their rhetoric and their names betray their communist legacy , " said spier . reform-friendly social democrats helped rise of far-left in germany , there was no serious force left of the social democrats and the green party for a long time .
the communist party of germany -lrb- kpd -rrb- was relatively strong during the weimar republic between 1919 and 1933 but was later banned in the 1950s .
the newly formed german communist party -lrb- dkp -rrb- did n't manage to overcome its status as a splinter group .
it was only with reunification in 1990 and the transformation of the sed into the pds , that a political force left of the social democrats take shape .
the party needed until 2005 to become a nation-wide political forced to be reckoned with . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair and schröder 's reform-friendly social democracy has fueled the rise of the far-left the rise of far-left parties in europe has largely been thanks to the social democrats , in particular what tony blair referred to as " new labour " and gerhard schröder the " new center . "
the move away from traditional , labor-friendly politics has indeed fueled the march of the far-left . " the social democrats who remained traditional , as in the case of france , managed to marginalize far-left parties , " said spier . on the other hand , those who turned particularly reform-friendly , such as the social democrats in germany , the netherlands and denmark , have lost large chunks of their traditional voter base to the far-left . " a real dilemma " the far-left in some parts of europe has also made it as far as into national governments - in france , sweden , italy and presently in norway .
but such coalitions have rarely been especially successful . in 1998 , the social democratic party in sweden entered a coalition with the left party and the greens .
one result was that support for the far-left quickly eroded . " we do n't regret being part of the coalition , we could certainly air some of our views , " said gudrun utas of sweden 's left party .
" but we did n't have positive experiences . " after four years of being part of the government , her far-left party has managed to attract just 5 percent of the vote - a far cry from their historic high of 12.8 percent in 1998 . " it 's a real dilemma , " said spier .
" at first , the far-left in sweden profited from the social democrats ' move to the center .
but once they took on governing responsibilities , the far-left lost its halo - as well as votes . "
at the same time , the social democrats won the majority it needed to govern thanks to the far-left . the swedish example may hold lessons for andrea ypsilanti .
depending on the outcome of coalition talks among hesse 's parties , she may yet change her mind and get the left party on board after all in order to gain that magic majority . sejla didic -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and all established parties in germany - whether on the left or right of center - shun the group . left party seen as communist relic for many western germans , the left party is still a relic of former communist east germany , according to tim spier , a political scientist at the institute for party law and research at the university of düsseldorf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prominent faces of germany 's left party - gregor gysi , left , and petra pau forged from the debris of the east german ruling party after reunification in 1990 and known then as the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the left party reached its present incarnation last year when it was joined by a stream of trade unionists , discontented westerners and social democratic party members unhappy with former chancellor gerhard schröder 's package of far-reaching social security and labor market reforms . the origins of the western side of the party as a splinter movement within the social democratic family have left deep wounds .
while the spd and the left party rule together in the city-state of berlin and have at times cooperated in eastern german states , the social democrats refuse to consider a so-called " red-red " coalition in a western state , let alone at the federal level . " it has to be said that in germany , a part of the left still continues in the tradition of the pds and the additional problem is that we have a remnant of the sed -lsb- the former east german ruling party -rsb- there , " said spier .
" west germans have a problem accepting that . " far-left parties in europe enjoy support the situation is distinctly different in other parts of europe where parties left of social democracy are often part of the mainstream political establishment .
in france , sweden and italy , for instance , such parties have been part of national governments . " in the 1970s there was a long period where many traditional communist parties were much more successful than other parties - for instance in france , " spier said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outside russia , communist parties also enjoyed support in europe far-left parties in western europe may have emerged from different ideological traditions and have heterogeneous historical roots . " but they can still be considered as part of a larger family of parties , " said spier . a large chunk of these far-left parties were former communist parties who reinvented themselves after the end of the cold war .
others broke away from the communists much earlier , formed maoist splinter groups to an extent , and finally evolved into moderate left-wing groups . the most successful far-left party in europe is the socialist party in the netherlands . " they took 16.6 percent of the vote in the last parliamentary election , " spier said . far-left parties are also well-established in scandinavia , where they enjoy considerable support among voters - around 10 percent .
for instance , denmark 's socialist people 's party , norway 's socialist left party , sweden 's left party and finland 's left alliance are all far-left parties but represent a more ecological and social stance . far-left parties in italy and france too enjoy popular support .
" though these parties present a significantly moderate face , their rhetoric and their names betray their communist legacy , " said spier . reform-friendly social democrats helped rise of far-left in germany , there was no serious force left of the social democrats and the green party for a long time .
the communist party of germany -lrb- kpd -rrb- was relatively strong during the weimar republic between 1919 and 1933 but was later banned in the 1950s .
the newly formed german communist party -lrb- dkp -rrb- did n't manage to overcome its status as a splinter group .

"
the move away from traditional , labor-friendly politics has indeed fueled the march of the far-left . " the social democrats who remained traditional , as in the case of france , managed to marginalize far-left parties , " said spier . on the other hand , those who turned particularly reform-friendly , such as the social democrats in germany , the netherlands and denmark , have lost large chunks of their traditional voter base to the far-left . " a real dilemma " the far-left in some parts of europe has also made it as far as into national governments - in france , sweden , italy and presently in norway .
but such coalitions have rarely been especially successful . in 1998 , the social democratic party in sweden entered a coalition with the left party and the greens .
one result was that support for the far-left quickly eroded . " we do n't regret being part of the coalition , we could certainly air some of our views , " said gudrun utas of sweden 's left party .
" but we did n't have positive experiences . " after four years of being part of the government , her far-left party has managed to attract just 5 percent of the vote - a far cry from their historic high of 12.8 percent in 1998 . " it 's a real dilemma , " said spier .

on tv and in print , she 's advised countless people about matters most intimate .
we talked to her on the eve of a historical anniversary . published 60 years ago , the first kinsey report , titled " sexual behavior in the human male , " shocked the general public for discussing subjects that had previously been taboo and for openly challenging conventional sexual beliefs of the day .
though kinsey 's methods have repeatedly been questioned by opponents , the report remains one of the largest studies ever conducted on human sexual behavior . dw-world.de : the kinsey report launched the sexual revolution when it was published on jan .
31 , 1948 .
now it 's celebrating its 60th anniversary .
how important was it to your career ? erika berger : well , i was much too young to read it when it came out , but of course i have it on my shelf at home just like everyone today who 's interested in sexuality .
there are things in it , where you say , " yes , that 's exactly right . "
there 's no reason not to do things that are a bit out of the ordinary and that may be incomprehensible to other people .
and above all we should talk about sexuality .
we should n't try to conceal things , and we should leave people with other sexual preferences and drives in peace . it took several years for the kinsey report to be translated into german .
was germany backwards in this regard ? as i began dealing with sexuality in front of the camera , it was a wasteland .
there was director oswalt kolle who made a number of sex-education films in the 1960s .
he was an educational pioneer , and i think it was only then that we in germany realized that sex was something completely normal .
in that respect i think germany did lag behind america a bit . the results of the kinsey report suggested that sexual practices traditionally dismissed as perverse were far more widespread than people thought .
is there such a thing as " normal sex ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika berger currently hosts the call-in advice show " night talk " you 'd have to ask yourself the question : what is normal sex for a given individual ?
and you could just as well ask : what is good or bad sex for that individual ?
sex is the way i experience it and do it - together with my partner .
the concepts of normal and abnormal sex mean nothing to me .
i think it 's impertinent for someone today to say " what gays do , is n't normal . "
who are they to say what 's normal ?
i myself determine what 's normal for me . the internet has opened up whole new possibilities for tracking people 's sex preferences .
what effect has that had on sexual research ? i think the web is unbelievably important for sex research .
first of all , it allows you to look things up things instantly .
and it 's very transparent .
i no longer have to go somewhere and buy a book that i hardly dare to ask for because the title is so racy .
instead i just log on to the web , click and i 've got everything i need .
and it 's interesting that you can measure people 's clicks and see whether they are interested in the missionary position , same-sex love or unusual sexual practices .
are they interested in sex toys or masturbation tips ?
that 's very interesting . then public sexual morality often differs drastically from people 's actual online sexual behavior ? absolutely .
you can read about things , click on them and inform yourself .
you can even talk about and discuss them .
but when people are confronted with their own desires , they sometimes lack the courage .
some do n't want to overburden their partners ; others simply do n't know where to begin .
to take a somewhat crass example : if i said , " how about some role playing or bondage tonight ? " or " i 'm into sadomasochism , " i would n't know how my partner would react .
and then it 's too late .
that 's why , in practice , sex is often so boring . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berger says the internet offers positive and negative forms of anonymity is it not ironic that the possibilities opened up by the anonymity of the internet often get in the way of sexual communication ? yes , it 's suffered from that .
today i can choose a partner via the internet - i can virtually " invite " someone into my living room and talk to him via the computer screen .
but , please , what good is that ?
it 's totally one-dimensional .
it 's the same as if i look at pictures of naked women or men or sex practices on the screen .
what good does it do me ? that sounds as if there 's still a need for sexual education in the internet age , a need to bring people together to talk about sex . i think the attempt to bring people together is great .
but it does n't always work .
let 's say i decide i want a man .
so i go to some web page and look for a guy i 'd like to chat with .
then you start talking , and of course your conversations revolve around horizontal kinds of fun .
but i still want to see the guy some time !
i love chatting , and i 'm very involved with the internet .
but i still think that you have to talk face-to-face at some point .
i miss that .
it 's a kind of anonymity that i do n't like very much . you 're 67 , and your last book dealt with growing older and specifically with menopause .
that 's very topical because the average age is increasing in germany and many other western countries .
will it have an effect on our sex lives ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as people get older , they start to question the value of getting horizontal it creates a very important question : is sex in old age a taboo or not ?
personally i 'd plead for treating it as something normal .
who says that you should n't have sex at the age of 60 , 70 or 80 ?
there 's no age limit for sex - or love , which i always stress is connected with sex .
if a person is healthy , he can still have a very fulfilling sexual life .
but one thing i found out from talking to people for my last book was that as they get older , sex becomes less important .
it 's only their second or third most important concern - the top one is tenderness .
is there someone there who loves me and whom i can love back ?
it 's a matter of trust , above all , and sexuality develops from it . so there will be more attention paid to older people 's sexuality ? of course , because people are getting older , and - thank god - they 're no longer stupid enough to try and conceal the fact that they 're no longer doing the dirty deed . -lrb- laughs -rrb- look at it this way - everyone , no matter how old , has a baby inside that needs to be cuddled .
when you enter puberty , it 's great .
and when you 're in the prime of life , you 've lost most of your inhibitions .
but if you 're a woman entering menopause , you have so many inhibitions .
you do n't dare take off your clothes .
you 're afraid that sex will hurt .
you have so many things that can take away your desire for sexuality .
you say , " oh , i 'm old . "
but you 're not old .
you 're just entering a new phase of life .
that 's great .
why are you laughing ? no reason - you just made ageing sound pleasant .
one last - frivolous - question : you recorded a song in the 1990s called " sex is fun . "
when was the last time you listened to it ? -lrb- laughs . -rrb-
oh god , i know exactly when it was .
six months ago .
i was sitting around with some colleagues , chatting interactively , and they said , " hey , we 've found something really funny .
it 's your cd . "
we listened to it and laughed ourselves under the table .
what do think about that ?
pretty funny , huh ? i do n't have any problem with that .
i have no problem with getting older , or with saying that sex is fun , or with anything i 've every done in my professional or personal life .
i think it 's great .
it 's part of life . i would n't have minded making a record - especially not with that title . -lrb- laughs -rrb- too late .
i got there first . interview : jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de german plan to criminalize teen sex put on back burner after facing fierce criticism , a proposal in germany to criminalize teenage sexual activity was deferred .
opponents said the law , which would have lowered the age limit for prosecuting sex offenses , went overboard .

31 , 1948 .
now it 's celebrating its 60th anniversary .
how important was it to your career ? erika berger : well , i was much too young to read it when it came out , but of course i have it on my shelf at home just like everyone today who 's interested in sexuality .
there are things in it , where you say , " yes , that 's exactly right . "
there 's no reason not to do things that are a bit out of the ordinary and that may be incomprehensible to other people .
and above all we should talk about sexuality .
we should n't try to conceal things , and we should leave people with other sexual preferences and drives in peace . it took several years for the kinsey report to be translated into german .
was germany backwards in this regard ? as i began dealing with sexuality in front of the camera , it was a wasteland .
there was director oswalt kolle who made a number of sex-education films in the 1960s .
he was an educational pioneer , and i think it was only then that we in germany realized that sex was something completely normal .
in that respect i think germany did lag behind america a bit . the results of the kinsey report suggested that sexual practices traditionally dismissed as perverse were far more widespread than people thought .
is there such a thing as " normal sex ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika berger currently hosts the call-in advice show " night talk " you 'd have to ask yourself the question : what is normal sex for a given individual ?
and you could just as well ask : what is good or bad sex for that individual ?
sex is the way i experience it and do it - together with my partner .
the concepts of normal and abnormal sex mean nothing to me .
i think it 's impertinent for someone today to say " what gays do , is n't normal . "
who are they to say what 's normal ?
i myself determine what 's normal for me . the internet has opened up whole new possibilities for tracking people 's sex preferences .
what effect has that had on sexual research ? i think the web is unbelievably important for sex research .
first of all , it allows you to look things up things instantly .
and it 's very transparent .
i no longer have to go somewhere and buy a book that i hardly dare to ask for because the title is so racy .
instead i just log on to the web , click and i 've got everything i need .
and it 's interesting that you can measure people 's clicks and see whether they are interested in the missionary position , same-sex love or unusual sexual practices .
are they interested in sex toys or masturbation tips ?
that 's very interesting . then public sexual morality often differs drastically from people 's actual online sexual behavior ? absolutely .
you can read about things , click on them and inform yourself .
you can even talk about and discuss them .
but when people are confronted with their own desires , they sometimes lack the courage .
some do n't want to overburden their partners ; others simply do n't know where to begin .
to take a somewhat crass example : if i said , " how about some role playing or bondage tonight ? " or " i 'm into sadomasochism , " i would n't know how my partner would react .
and then it 's too late .
that 's why , in practice , sex is often so boring . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berger says the internet offers positive and negative forms of anonymity is it not ironic that the possibilities opened up by the anonymity of the internet often get in the way of sexual communication ? yes , it 's suffered from that .
today i can choose a partner via the internet - i can virtually " invite " someone into my living room and talk to him via the computer screen .
but , please , what good is that ?
it 's totally one-dimensional .
it 's the same as if i look at pictures of naked women or men or sex practices on the screen .
what good does it do me ? that sounds as if there 's still a need for sexual education in the internet age , a need to bring people together to talk about sex . i think the attempt to bring people together is great .
but it does n't always work .
let 's say i decide i want a man .
so i go to some web page and look for a guy i 'd like to chat with .
then you start talking , and of course your conversations revolve around horizontal kinds of fun .
but i still want to see the guy some time !
i love chatting , and i 'm very involved with the internet .
but i still think that you have to talk face-to-face at some point .
i miss that .
it 's a kind of anonymity that i do n't like very much . you 're 67 , and your last book dealt with growing older and specifically with menopause .
that 's very topical because the average age is increasing in germany and many other western countries .
will it have an effect on our sex lives ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as people get older , they start to question the value of getting horizontal it creates a very important question : is sex in old age a taboo or not ?
personally i 'd plead for treating it as something normal .
who says that you should n't have sex at the age of 60 , 70 or 80 ?
there 's no age limit for sex - or love , which i always stress is connected with sex .
if a person is healthy , he can still have a very fulfilling sexual life .
but one thing i found out from talking to people for my last book was that as they get older , sex becomes less important .
it 's only their second or third most important concern - the top one is tenderness .
is there someone there who loves me and whom i can love back ?
it 's a matter of trust , above all , and sexuality develops from it . so there will be more attention paid to older people 's sexuality ? of course , because people are getting older , and - thank god - they 're no longer stupid enough to try and conceal the fact that they 're no longer doing the dirty deed . -lrb- laughs -rrb- look at it this way - everyone , no matter how old , has a baby inside that needs to be cuddled .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 31.01.2008 internet , ageing ca n't take fun out of sex , german expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red-light districts or not , germany is n't particularly open about sex since the late 1980s , erika berger has been one of germany 's leading sex experts .
on tv and in print , she 's advised countless people about matters most intimate .
we talked to her on the eve of a historical anniversary . published 60 years ago , the first kinsey report , titled " sexual behavior in the human male , " shocked the general public for discussing subjects that had previously been taboo and for openly challenging conventional sexual beliefs of the day .
though kinsey 's methods have repeatedly been questioned by opponents , the report remains one of the largest studies ever conducted on human sexual behavior . dw-world.de : the kinsey report launched the sexual revolution when it was published on jan .
31 , 1948 .
now it 's celebrating its 60th anniversary .
how important was it to your career ? erika berger : well , i was much too young to read it when it came out , but of course i have it on my shelf at home just like everyone today who 's interested in sexuality .
there are things in it , where you say , " yes , that 's exactly right . "
there 's no reason not to do things that are a bit out of the ordinary and that may be incomprehensible to other people .
and above all we should talk about sexuality .
we should n't try to conceal things , and we should leave people with other sexual preferences and drives in peace . it took several years for the kinsey report to be translated into german .
was germany backwards in this regard ? as i began dealing with sexuality in front of the camera , it was a wasteland .
there was director oswalt kolle who made a number of sex-education films in the 1960s .
he was an educational pioneer , and i think it was only then that we in germany realized that sex was something completely normal .
in that respect i think germany did lag behind america a bit . the results of the kinsey report suggested that sexual practices traditionally dismissed as perverse were far more widespread than people thought .
is there such a thing as " normal sex ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika berger currently hosts the call-in advice show " night talk " you 'd have to ask yourself the question : what is normal sex for a given individual ?
and you could just as well ask : what is good or bad sex for that individual ?
sex is the way i experience it and do it - together with my partner .
the concepts of normal and abnormal sex mean nothing to me .
i think it 's impertinent for someone today to say " what gays do , is n't normal . "
who are they to say what 's normal ?
i myself determine what 's normal for me . the internet has opened up whole new possibilities for tracking people 's sex preferences .
what effect has that had on sexual research ? i think the web is unbelievably important for sex research .
first of all , it allows you to look things up things instantly .
and it 's very transparent .
i no longer have to go somewhere and buy a book that i hardly dare to ask for because the title is so racy .
instead i just log on to the web , click and i 've got everything i need .
and it 's interesting that you can measure people 's clicks and see whether they are interested in the missionary position , same-sex love or unusual sexual practices .
are they interested in sex toys or masturbation tips ?
that 's very interesting . then public sexual morality often differs drastically from people 's actual online sexual behavior ? absolutely .
you can read about things , click on them and inform yourself .
you can even talk about and discuss them .
but when people are confronted with their own desires , they sometimes lack the courage .
some do n't want to overburden their partners ; others simply do n't know where to begin .
to take a somewhat crass example : if i said , " how about some role playing or bondage tonight ? " or " i 'm into sadomasochism , " i would n't know how my partner would react .
and then it 's too late .
that 's why , in practice , sex is often so boring . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berger says the internet offers positive and negative forms of anonymity is it not ironic that the possibilities opened up by the anonymity of the internet often get in the way of sexual communication ? yes , it 's suffered from that .
today i can choose a partner via the internet - i can virtually " invite " someone into my living room and talk to him via the computer screen .
but , please , what good is that ?
it 's totally one-dimensional .
it 's the same as if i look at pictures of naked women or men or sex practices on the screen .
what good does it do me ? that sounds as if there 's still a need for sexual education in the internet age , a need to bring people together to talk about sex . i think the attempt to bring people together is great .
but it does n't always work .
let 's say i decide i want a man .
so i go to some web page and look for a guy i 'd like to chat with .
then you start talking , and of course your conversations revolve around horizontal kinds of fun .
but i still want to see the guy some time !
i love chatting , and i 'm very involved with the internet .
but i still think that you have to talk face-to-face at some point .
i miss that .
it 's a kind of anonymity that i do n't like very much . you 're 67 , and your last book dealt with growing older and specifically with menopause .
that 's very topical because the average age is increasing in germany and many other western countries .
will it have an effect on our sex lives ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as people get older , they start to question the value of getting horizontal it creates a very important question : is sex in old age a taboo or not ?
personally i 'd plead for treating it as something normal .
who says that you should n't have sex at the age of 60 , 70 or 80 ?
there 's no age limit for sex - or love , which i always stress is connected with sex .
if a person is healthy , he can still have a very fulfilling sexual life .
but one thing i found out from talking to people for my last book was that as they get older , sex becomes less important .
it 's only their second or third most important concern - the top one is tenderness .
is there someone there who loves me and whom i can love back ?
it 's a matter of trust , above all , and sexuality develops from it . so there will be more attention paid to older people 's sexuality ? of course , because people are getting older , and - thank god - they 're no longer stupid enough to try and conceal the fact that they 're no longer doing the dirty deed . -lrb- laughs -rrb- look at it this way - everyone , no matter how old , has a baby inside that needs to be cuddled .
when you enter puberty , it 's great .
and when you 're in the prime of life , you 've lost most of your inhibitions .
but if you 're a woman entering menopause , you have so many inhibitions .
you do n't dare take off your clothes .
you 're afraid that sex will hurt .
you have so many things that can take away your desire for sexuality .
you say , " oh , i 'm old . "
but you 're not old .
you 're just entering a new phase of life .
that 's great .
why are you laughing ? no reason - you just made ageing sound pleasant .
one last - frivolous - question : you recorded a song in the 1990s called " sex is fun . "
when was the last time you listened to it ? -lrb- laughs . -rrb-
oh god , i know exactly when it was .
six months ago .
i was sitting around with some colleagues , chatting interactively , and they said , " hey , we 've found something really funny .
it 's your cd . "
we listened to it and laughed ourselves under the table .
what do think about that ?
pretty funny , huh ? i do n't have any problem with that .
i have no problem with getting older , or with saying that sex is fun , or with anything i 've every done in my professional or personal life .
i think it 's great .
it 's part of life . i would n't have minded making a record - especially not with that title . -lrb- laughs -rrb- too late .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 31.01.2008 shunned in germany , far-left gets support elsewhere in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : die linke - germany 's left party - has steadily increased its voter base while the left party in germany is cold-shouldered by all established political groupings , other european nations ' far-left parties are often part of ruling coalitions .
but they have n't been particularly successful . they could potentially be kingmakers and help andrea ypsilanti , the chairwoman of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in the western german state of hesse , get a majority after a closely contested election in which incumbent roland koch 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- won the vote by a wafer-thin margin . but the left party remains an unwanted child in the german political landscape .
though the far-left party is now represented in two state parliaments in western germany , ypsilanti has vowed she will not form a government with them .
and all established parties in germany - whether on the left or right of center - shun the group . left party seen as communist relic for many western germans , the left party is still a relic of former communist east germany , according to tim spier , a political scientist at the institute for party law and research at the university of düsseldorf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prominent faces of germany 's left party - gregor gysi , left , and petra pau forged from the debris of the east german ruling party after reunification in 1990 and known then as the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the left party reached its present incarnation last year when it was joined by a stream of trade unionists , discontented westerners and social democratic party members unhappy with former chancellor gerhard schröder 's package of far-reaching social security and labor market reforms . the origins of the western side of the party as a splinter movement within the social democratic family have left deep wounds .
while the spd and the left party rule together in the city-state of berlin and have at times cooperated in eastern german states , the social democrats refuse to consider a so-called " red-red " coalition in a western state , let alone at the federal level . " it has to be said that in germany , a part of the left still continues in the tradition of the pds and the additional problem is that we have a remnant of the sed -lsb- the former east german ruling party -rsb- there , " said spier .
" west germans have a problem accepting that . " far-left parties in europe enjoy support the situation is distinctly different in other parts of europe where parties left of social democracy are often part of the mainstream political establishment .
in france , sweden and italy , for instance , such parties have been part of national governments . " in the 1970s there was a long period where many traditional communist parties were much more successful than other parties - for instance in france , " spier said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outside russia , communist parties also enjoyed support in europe far-left parties in western europe may have emerged from different ideological traditions and have heterogeneous historical roots . " but they can still be considered as part of a larger family of parties , " said spier . a large chunk of these far-left parties were former communist parties who reinvented themselves after the end of the cold war .
others broke away from the communists much earlier , formed maoist splinter groups to an extent , and finally evolved into moderate left-wing groups . the most successful far-left party in europe is the socialist party in the netherlands . " they took 16.6 percent of the vote in the last parliamentary election , " spier said . far-left parties are also well-established in scandinavia , where they enjoy considerable support among voters - around 10 percent .
for instance , denmark 's socialist people 's party , norway 's socialist left party , sweden 's left party and finland 's left alliance are all far-left parties but represent a more ecological and social stance . far-left parties in italy and france too enjoy popular support .
" though these parties present a significantly moderate face , their rhetoric and their names betray their communist legacy , " said spier . reform-friendly social democrats helped rise of far-left in germany , there was no serious force left of the social democrats and the green party for a long time .
the communist party of germany -lrb- kpd -rrb- was relatively strong during the weimar republic between 1919 and 1933 but was later banned in the 1950s .
the newly formed german communist party -lrb- dkp -rrb- did n't manage to overcome its status as a splinter group .
it was only with reunification in 1990 and the transformation of the sed into the pds , that a political force left of the social democrats take shape .
the party needed until 2005 to become a nation-wide political forced to be reckoned with . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair and schröder 's reform-friendly social democracy has fueled the rise of the far-left the rise of far-left parties in europe has largely been thanks to the social democrats , in particular what tony blair referred to as " new labour " and gerhard schröder the " new center . "
the move away from traditional , labor-friendly politics has indeed fueled the march of the far-left . " the social democrats who remained traditional , as in the case of france , managed to marginalize far-left parties , " said spier . on the other hand , those who turned particularly reform-friendly , such as the social democrats in germany , the netherlands and denmark , have lost large chunks of their traditional voter base to the far-left . " a real dilemma " the far-left in some parts of europe has also made it as far as into national governments - in france , sweden , italy and presently in norway .
but such coalitions have rarely been especially successful . in 1998 , the social democratic party in sweden entered a coalition with the left party and the greens .
one result was that support for the far-left quickly eroded . " we do n't regret being part of the coalition , we could certainly air some of our views , " said gudrun utas of sweden 's left party .
" but we did n't have positive experiences . " after four years of being part of the government , her far-left party has managed to attract just 5 percent of the vote - a far cry from their historic high of 12.8 percent in 1998 . " it 's a real dilemma , " said spier .
" at first , the far-left in sweden profited from the social democrats ' move to the center .
but once they took on governing responsibilities , the far-left lost its halo - as well as votes . "
at the same time , the social democrats won the majority it needed to govern thanks to the far-left . the swedish example may hold lessons for andrea ypsilanti .
depending on the outcome of coalition talks among hesse 's parties , she may yet change her mind and get the left party on board after all in order to gain that magic majority . sejla didic -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move away from traditional , labor-friendly politics has indeed fueled the march of the far-left . " the social democrats who remained traditional , as in the case of france , managed to marginalize far-left parties , " said spier . on the other hand , those who turned particularly reform-friendly , such as the social democrats in germany , the netherlands and denmark , have lost large chunks of their traditional voter base to the far-left . " a real dilemma " the far-left in some parts of europe has also made it as far as into national governments - in france , sweden , italy and presently in norway .
but such coalitions have rarely been especially successful . in 1998 , the social democratic party in sweden entered a coalition with the left party and the greens .
one result was that support for the far-left quickly eroded . " we do n't regret being part of the coalition , we could certainly air some of our views , " said gudrun utas of sweden 's left party .
" but we did n't have positive experiences . " after four years of being part of the government , her far-left party has managed to attract just 5 percent of the vote - a far cry from their historic high of 12.8 percent in 1998 . " it 's a real dilemma , " said spier .
" at first , the far-left in sweden profited from the social democrats ' move to the center .
but once they took on governing responsibilities , the far-left lost its halo - as well as votes . "
at the same time , the social democrats won the majority it needed to govern thanks to the far-left . the swedish example may hold lessons for andrea ypsilanti .

and all established parties in germany - whether on the left or right of center - shun the group . left party seen as communist relic for many western germans , the left party is still a relic of former communist east germany , according to tim spier , a political scientist at the institute for party law and research at the university of düsseldorf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prominent faces of germany 's left party - gregor gysi , left , and petra pau forged from the debris of the east german ruling party after reunification in 1990 and known then as the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the left party reached its present incarnation last year when it was joined by a stream of trade unionists , discontented westerners and social democratic party members unhappy with former chancellor gerhard schröder 's package of far-reaching social security and labor market reforms . the origins of the western side of the party as a splinter movement within the social democratic family have left deep wounds .
while the spd and the left party rule together in the city-state of berlin and have at times cooperated in eastern german states , the social democrats refuse to consider a so-called " red-red " coalition in a western state , let alone at the federal level . " it has to be said that in germany , a part of the left still continues in the tradition of the pds and the additional problem is that we have a remnant of the sed -lsb- the former east german ruling party -rsb- there , " said spier .

others broke away from the communists much earlier , formed maoist splinter groups to an extent , and finally evolved into moderate left-wing groups . the most successful far-left party in europe is the socialist party in the netherlands . " they took 16.6 percent of the vote in the last parliamentary election , " spier said . far-left parties are also well-established in scandinavia , where they enjoy considerable support among voters - around 10 percent .
for instance , denmark 's socialist people 's party , norway 's socialist left party , sweden 's left party and finland 's left alliance are all far-left parties but represent a more ecological and social stance . far-left parties in italy and france too enjoy popular support .

but they have n't been particularly successful . they could potentially be kingmakers and help andrea ypsilanti , the chairwoman of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in the western german state of hesse , get a majority after a closely contested election in which incumbent roland koch 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- won the vote by a wafer-thin margin . but the left party remains an unwanted child in the german political landscape .
though the far-left party is now represented in two state parliaments in western germany , ypsilanti has vowed she will not form a government with them .
and all established parties in germany - whether on the left or right of center - shun the group . left party seen as communist relic for many western germans , the left party is still a relic of former communist east germany , according to tim spier , a political scientist at the institute for party law and research at the university of düsseldorf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prominent faces of germany 's left party - gregor gysi , left , and petra pau forged from the debris of the east german ruling party after reunification in 1990 and known then as the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the left party reached its present incarnation last year when it was joined by a stream of trade unionists , discontented westerners and social democratic party members unhappy with former chancellor gerhard schröder 's package of far-reaching social security and labor market reforms . the origins of the western side of the party as a splinter movement within the social democratic family have left deep wounds .
while the spd and the left party rule together in the city-state of berlin and have at times cooperated in eastern german states , the social democrats refuse to consider a so-called " red-red " coalition in a western state , let alone at the federal level . " it has to be said that in germany , a part of the left still continues in the tradition of the pds and the additional problem is that we have a remnant of the sed -lsb- the former east german ruling party -rsb- there , " said spier .
" west germans have a problem accepting that . " far-left parties in europe enjoy support the situation is distinctly different in other parts of europe where parties left of social democracy are often part of the mainstream political establishment .
in france , sweden and italy , for instance , such parties have been part of national governments . " in the 1970s there was a long period where many traditional communist parties were much more successful than other parties - for instance in france , " spier said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outside russia , communist parties also enjoyed support in europe far-left parties in western europe may have emerged from different ideological traditions and have heterogeneous historical roots . " but they can still be considered as part of a larger family of parties , " said spier . a large chunk of these far-left parties were former communist parties who reinvented themselves after the end of the cold war .
others broke away from the communists much earlier , formed maoist splinter groups to an extent , and finally evolved into moderate left-wing groups . the most successful far-left party in europe is the socialist party in the netherlands . " they took 16.6 percent of the vote in the last parliamentary election , " spier said . far-left parties are also well-established in scandinavia , where they enjoy considerable support among voters - around 10 percent .
for instance , denmark 's socialist people 's party , norway 's socialist left party , sweden 's left party and finland 's left alliance are all far-left parties but represent a more ecological and social stance . far-left parties in italy and france too enjoy popular support .
" though these parties present a significantly moderate face , their rhetoric and their names betray their communist legacy , " said spier . reform-friendly social democrats helped rise of far-left in germany , there was no serious force left of the social democrats and the green party for a long time .
the communist party of germany -lrb- kpd -rrb- was relatively strong during the weimar republic between 1919 and 1933 but was later banned in the 1950s .
the newly formed german communist party -lrb- dkp -rrb- did n't manage to overcome its status as a splinter group .
it was only with reunification in 1990 and the transformation of the sed into the pds , that a political force left of the social democrats take shape .
the party needed until 2005 to become a nation-wide political forced to be reckoned with . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair and schröder 's reform-friendly social democracy has fueled the rise of the far-left the rise of far-left parties in europe has largely been thanks to the social democrats , in particular what tony blair referred to as " new labour " and gerhard schröder the " new center . "
the move away from traditional , labor-friendly politics has indeed fueled the march of the far-left . " the social democrats who remained traditional , as in the case of france , managed to marginalize far-left parties , " said spier . on the other hand , those who turned particularly reform-friendly , such as the social democrats in germany , the netherlands and denmark , have lost large chunks of their traditional voter base to the far-left . " a real dilemma " the far-left in some parts of europe has also made it as far as into national governments - in france , sweden , italy and presently in norway .
but such coalitions have rarely been especially successful . in 1998 , the social democratic party in sweden entered a coalition with the left party and the greens .
one result was that support for the far-left quickly eroded . " we do n't regret being part of the coalition , we could certainly air some of our views , " said gudrun utas of sweden 's left party .
" but we did n't have positive experiences . " after four years of being part of the government , her far-left party has managed to attract just 5 percent of the vote - a far cry from their historic high of 12.8 percent in 1998 . " it 's a real dilemma , " said spier .
" at first , the far-left in sweden profited from the social democrats ' move to the center .
but once they took on governing responsibilities , the far-left lost its halo - as well as votes . "
at the same time , the social democrats won the majority it needed to govern thanks to the far-left . the swedish example may hold lessons for andrea ypsilanti .
depending on the outcome of coalition talks among hesse 's parties , she may yet change her mind and get the left party on board after all in order to gain that magic majority . sejla didic -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 31.01.2008 internet , ageing ca n't take fun out of sex , german expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red-light districts or not , germany is n't particularly open about sex since the late 1980s , erika berger has been one of germany 's leading sex experts .
on tv and in print , she 's advised countless people about matters most intimate .
we talked to her on the eve of a historical anniversary . published 60 years ago , the first kinsey report , titled " sexual behavior in the human male , " shocked the general public for discussing subjects that had previously been taboo and for openly challenging conventional sexual beliefs of the day .
though kinsey 's methods have repeatedly been questioned by opponents , the report remains one of the largest studies ever conducted on human sexual behavior . dw-world.de : the kinsey report launched the sexual revolution when it was published on jan .
31 , 1948 .
now it 's celebrating its 60th anniversary .
how important was it to your career ? erika berger : well , i was much too young to read it when it came out , but of course i have it on my shelf at home just like everyone today who 's interested in sexuality .
there are things in it , where you say , " yes , that 's exactly right . "
there 's no reason not to do things that are a bit out of the ordinary and that may be incomprehensible to other people .
and above all we should talk about sexuality .
we should n't try to conceal things , and we should leave people with other sexual preferences and drives in peace . it took several years for the kinsey report to be translated into german .
was germany backwards in this regard ? as i began dealing with sexuality in front of the camera , it was a wasteland .
there was director oswalt kolle who made a number of sex-education films in the 1960s .
he was an educational pioneer , and i think it was only then that we in germany realized that sex was something completely normal .
in that respect i think germany did lag behind america a bit . the results of the kinsey report suggested that sexual practices traditionally dismissed as perverse were far more widespread than people thought .
is there such a thing as " normal sex ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika berger currently hosts the call-in advice show " night talk " you 'd have to ask yourself the question : what is normal sex for a given individual ?
and you could just as well ask : what is good or bad sex for that individual ?
sex is the way i experience it and do it - together with my partner .
the concepts of normal and abnormal sex mean nothing to me .
i think it 's impertinent for someone today to say " what gays do , is n't normal . "
who are they to say what 's normal ?
i myself determine what 's normal for me . the internet has opened up whole new possibilities for tracking people 's sex preferences .
what effect has that had on sexual research ? i think the web is unbelievably important for sex research .
first of all , it allows you to look things up things instantly .
and it 's very transparent .
i no longer have to go somewhere and buy a book that i hardly dare to ask for because the title is so racy .
instead i just log on to the web , click and i 've got everything i need .
and it 's interesting that you can measure people 's clicks and see whether they are interested in the missionary position , same-sex love or unusual sexual practices .
are they interested in sex toys or masturbation tips ?
that 's very interesting . then public sexual morality often differs drastically from people 's actual online sexual behavior ? absolutely .
you can read about things , click on them and inform yourself .
you can even talk about and discuss them .
but when people are confronted with their own desires , they sometimes lack the courage .
some do n't want to overburden their partners ; others simply do n't know where to begin .
to take a somewhat crass example : if i said , " how about some role playing or bondage tonight ? " or " i 'm into sadomasochism , " i would n't know how my partner would react .
and then it 's too late .
that 's why , in practice , sex is often so boring . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berger says the internet offers positive and negative forms of anonymity is it not ironic that the possibilities opened up by the anonymity of the internet often get in the way of sexual communication ? yes , it 's suffered from that .
today i can choose a partner via the internet - i can virtually " invite " someone into my living room and talk to him via the computer screen .
but , please , what good is that ?
it 's totally one-dimensional .
it 's the same as if i look at pictures of naked women or men or sex practices on the screen .
what good does it do me ? that sounds as if there 's still a need for sexual education in the internet age , a need to bring people together to talk about sex . i think the attempt to bring people together is great .
but it does n't always work .
let 's say i decide i want a man .
so i go to some web page and look for a guy i 'd like to chat with .
then you start talking , and of course your conversations revolve around horizontal kinds of fun .
but i still want to see the guy some time !
i love chatting , and i 'm very involved with the internet .
but i still think that you have to talk face-to-face at some point .
i miss that .
it 's a kind of anonymity that i do n't like very much . you 're 67 , and your last book dealt with growing older and specifically with menopause .
that 's very topical because the average age is increasing in germany and many other western countries .
will it have an effect on our sex lives ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as people get older , they start to question the value of getting horizontal it creates a very important question : is sex in old age a taboo or not ?
personally i 'd plead for treating it as something normal .
who says that you should n't have sex at the age of 60 , 70 or 80 ?
there 's no age limit for sex - or love , which i always stress is connected with sex .
if a person is healthy , he can still have a very fulfilling sexual life .
but one thing i found out from talking to people for my last book was that as they get older , sex becomes less important .
it 's only their second or third most important concern - the top one is tenderness .
is there someone there who loves me and whom i can love back ?
it 's a matter of trust , above all , and sexuality develops from it . so there will be more attention paid to older people 's sexuality ? of course , because people are getting older , and - thank god - they 're no longer stupid enough to try and conceal the fact that they 're no longer doing the dirty deed . -lrb- laughs -rrb- look at it this way - everyone , no matter how old , has a baby inside that needs to be cuddled .
when you enter puberty , it 's great .
and when you 're in the prime of life , you 've lost most of your inhibitions .
but if you 're a woman entering menopause , you have so many inhibitions .
you do n't dare take off your clothes .
you 're afraid that sex will hurt .
you have so many things that can take away your desire for sexuality .
you say , " oh , i 'm old . "
but you 're not old .
you 're just entering a new phase of life .
that 's great .
why are you laughing ? no reason - you just made ageing sound pleasant .
one last - frivolous - question : you recorded a song in the 1990s called " sex is fun . "
when was the last time you listened to it ? -lrb- laughs . -rrb-
oh god , i know exactly when it was .
six months ago .
i was sitting around with some colleagues , chatting interactively , and they said , " hey , we 've found something really funny .
it 's your cd . "
we listened to it and laughed ourselves under the table .
what do think about that ?
pretty funny , huh ? i do n't have any problem with that .
i have no problem with getting older , or with saying that sex is fun , or with anything i 've every done in my professional or personal life .
i think it 's great .
it 's part of life . i would n't have minded making a record - especially not with that title . -lrb- laughs -rrb- too late .

31 , top off months of gala soirees that are often incomprehensible to the city 's non-natives .
but one party re-examines the traditional fetes . cologne during carnival can be terrifying for the uninitiated .
they are faced with drunken , costume-clad karneval enthusiasts singing - and staggering - their way down the streets and partaking in the sort of debauchery they 'll never admit to once the celebrations have come to a close . part of the festival traditions are the sitzungen .
literally " sessions " or " sittings , " the more traditional ones are gala events ; the smaller , more alternatives ones resemble comedy or variety shows composed of skits with performers making liberal use of song and dance to mock politicians , each other and themselves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bit of samba spices up karneval for american singer and actress victoria riccio , who came to germany nearly 20 years ago , the introduction to a sitzung was a shocker . " when i first came here , i went to one of these events and did n't understand a word , but at one point , the people on stage took off all their clothes and jumped around naked , " she said .
" i thought ' oh my god , where have i landed ? '
i loved it right away .
for me it was like halloween and the best party you 've ever been to , all wrapped into one . " immigrants take the stage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the immigrantenstadl kicked off three years ago still , despite the lure of scantily-clad hedonists and the beer that flows abundantly , karneval and its sitzungen can make non-germans feel like outsiders due to all the inside jokes about local politics and heavy use of the local dialect . so riccio , along with emcee hektor haarkötter and a host of others , started their own show called the " immigrantenstadl . "
it 's a gala put on for and by immigrants - which in cologne can also mean anyone born outside the city limits . " a bunch of us met with other artists and musicians in a pub in the southern part of the city and talked for hours , making all sorts of plans for a show , " he said .
" after a while , someone asked ' who at this table was actually born in cologne ? '
and then we realized that no one was originally from cologne . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mocking the tricky ö , ü,ä vowels of german is easier than mastering them rather than put on a typical cologne sitzung performed by foreigners , haarkötter said the " immigrantenstadl , " which started three years ago , aims to incorporate aspects of foreign cultures for an international audience . " cologne 's karneval can be a very traditional thing with a lot of very old styles and ways of having a party , " he said .
" we try to innovate by integrating special forms and customs from other countries and other cultures .
we yodel , we wear bavarian and japanese clothes , and we do brazilian samba and turkish folklore skits . " cologne 's large immigrant population there are jazzy numbers in which the performers sing lines like " we 've come to stay , we 're not leaving " - referring to the one in five people living in cologne who has an immigrant background , in an urban population of around 1 million . yet , by being semi-outsiders , performers are able to point out the quirky characteristics among germans - and even themselves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what would cologne do without all its greek immigrants , even if they are philosophers ?
during one immigrantenstadl skit , a turkish-german actor explains that in turkey , when someone wants to steal something , the thief waits until a person leaves his house , sneaks in and grabs the item .
in germany , he quips , a person will go to a home , ring the bell , say " hello , " take the television and leave a receipt for the item on the table . another number shows a romanian actress who tries to discern the future of karneval in her crystal ball . good-humored mockery it 's poking fun at cultural differences in a good-humored , tongue-in-cheek way that makes the show so appealing , said julien , a frenchman who 's lived in cologne for three years .
he claimed that , contrary to the stereotype , germans are able to mock themselves . " there are some very funny pieces in this show and i like the mixture of jokes about germans and immigrants in germany and how they all live here together , " he said .
" there are a lot of taboos surrounding the subject .
in this show , there are no taboos .
it 's great ! " while the typical cologne sitzung is performed in the local kölsch dialect , which immigrants and germans from outside the city alike have difficulty understanding , the singers and actors in the " immigrantenstadl " dole out their mockery of world events in a kaleidoscope of languages , including german , english , turkish , romanian , greek and czech . creating the mood with a beer - or three bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world players like president bush and condi rice are not left unscathed in one funky , hip-hop sketch , a singer in a cowboy hat masquerading as us president george w. bush complains about his work overload in the white house and iraq .
splashing around in a plastic baby pool , he takes comfort in his cozy relationship with secretary of state condoleezza rice . it could be the turkish hip-hop , the greek melodies , the brazilian sambas or the deliberate on-stage mayhem that make the " immigrantenstadl 's " sold-out shows so attractive to both foreigners and locals .
or it could be the chance to take part in a traditional party tilted just far enough off kilter to suit non-traditionalists . " put on a really wacky costume , get yourself in a good mood - although sometimes , if you go to the right place , people can kind of get you into the right mood , " said american riccio , advising newcomers on how to enjoy karneval .
" and of course , i hate to say it , but one or two or three or four kölsch beers do n't hurt either . " louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

31 , top off months of gala soirees that are often incomprehensible to the city 's non-natives .
but one party re-examines the traditional fetes . cologne during carnival can be terrifying for the uninitiated .
they are faced with drunken , costume-clad karneval enthusiasts singing - and staggering - their way down the streets and partaking in the sort of debauchery they 'll never admit to once the celebrations have come to a close . part of the festival traditions are the sitzungen .
literally " sessions " or " sittings , " the more traditional ones are gala events ; the smaller , more alternatives ones resemble comedy or variety shows composed of skits with performers making liberal use of song and dance to mock politicians , each other and themselves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bit of samba spices up karneval for american singer and actress victoria riccio , who came to germany nearly 20 years ago , the introduction to a sitzung was a shocker . " when i first came here , i went to one of these events and did n't understand a word , but at one point , the people on stage took off all their clothes and jumped around naked , " she said .
" i thought ' oh my god , where have i landed ? '
i loved it right away .
for me it was like halloween and the best party you 've ever been to , all wrapped into one . " immigrants take the stage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the immigrantenstadl kicked off three years ago still , despite the lure of scantily-clad hedonists and the beer that flows abundantly , karneval and its sitzungen can make non-germans feel like outsiders due to all the inside jokes about local politics and heavy use of the local dialect . so riccio , along with emcee hektor haarkötter and a host of others , started their own show called the " immigrantenstadl . "
it 's a gala put on for and by immigrants - which in cologne can also mean anyone born outside the city limits . " a bunch of us met with other artists and musicians in a pub in the southern part of the city and talked for hours , making all sorts of plans for a show , " he said .
" after a while , someone asked ' who at this table was actually born in cologne ? '
and then we realized that no one was originally from cologne . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mocking the tricky ö , ü,ä vowels of german is easier than mastering them rather than put on a typical cologne sitzung performed by foreigners , haarkötter said the " immigrantenstadl , " which started three years ago , aims to incorporate aspects of foreign cultures for an international audience . " cologne 's karneval can be a very traditional thing with a lot of very old styles and ways of having a party , " he said .
" we try to innovate by integrating special forms and customs from other countries and other cultures .
we yodel , we wear bavarian and japanese clothes , and we do brazilian samba and turkish folklore skits . " cologne 's large immigrant population there are jazzy numbers in which the performers sing lines like " we 've come to stay , we 're not leaving " - referring to the one in five people living in cologne who has an immigrant background , in an urban population of around 1 million . yet , by being semi-outsiders , performers are able to point out the quirky characteristics among germans - and even themselves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what would cologne do without all its greek immigrants , even if they are philosophers ?
during one immigrantenstadl skit , a turkish-german actor explains that in turkey , when someone wants to steal something , the thief waits until a person leaves his house , sneaks in and grabs the item .
in germany , he quips , a person will go to a home , ring the bell , say " hello , " take the television and leave a receipt for the item on the table . another number shows a romanian actress who tries to discern the future of karneval in her crystal ball . good-humored mockery it 's poking fun at cultural differences in a good-humored , tongue-in-cheek way that makes the show so appealing , said julien , a frenchman who 's lived in cologne for three years .
he claimed that , contrary to the stereotype , germans are able to mock themselves . " there are some very funny pieces in this show and i like the mixture of jokes about germans and immigrants in germany and how they all live here together , " he said .
" there are a lot of taboos surrounding the subject .
in this show , there are no taboos .
it 's great ! " while the typical cologne sitzung is performed in the local kölsch dialect , which immigrants and germans from outside the city alike have difficulty understanding , the singers and actors in the " immigrantenstadl " dole out their mockery of world events in a kaleidoscope of languages , including german , english , turkish , romanian , greek and czech . creating the mood with a beer - or three bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world players like president bush and condi rice are not left unscathed in one funky , hip-hop sketch , a singer in a cowboy hat masquerading as us president george w. bush complains about his work overload in the white house and iraq .
splashing around in a plastic baby pool , he takes comfort in his cozy relationship with secretary of state condoleezza rice . it could be the turkish hip-hop , the greek melodies , the brazilian sambas or the deliberate on-stage mayhem that make the " immigrantenstadl 's " sold-out shows so attractive to both foreigners and locals .
or it could be the chance to take part in a traditional party tilted just far enough off kilter to suit non-traditionalists . " put on a really wacky costume , get yourself in a good mood - although sometimes , if you go to the right place , people can kind of get you into the right mood , " said american riccio , advising newcomers on how to enjoy karneval .
" and of course , i hate to say it , but one or two or three or four kölsch beers do n't hurt either . " louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i thought ' oh my god , where have i landed ? '
i loved it right away .
for me it was like halloween and the best party you 've ever been to , all wrapped into one . " immigrants take the stage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the immigrantenstadl kicked off three years ago still , despite the lure of scantily-clad hedonists and the beer that flows abundantly , karneval and its sitzungen can make non-germans feel like outsiders due to all the inside jokes about local politics and heavy use of the local dialect . so riccio , along with emcee hektor haarkötter and a host of others , started their own show called the " immigrantenstadl . "
it 's a gala put on for and by immigrants - which in cologne can also mean anyone born outside the city limits . " a bunch of us met with other artists and musicians in a pub in the southern part of the city and talked for hours , making all sorts of plans for a show , " he said .
" after a while , someone asked ' who at this table was actually born in cologne ? '
and then we realized that no one was originally from cologne . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mocking the tricky ö , ü,ä vowels of german is easier than mastering them rather than put on a typical cologne sitzung performed by foreigners , haarkötter said the " immigrantenstadl , " which started three years ago , aims to incorporate aspects of foreign cultures for an international audience . " cologne 's karneval can be a very traditional thing with a lot of very old styles and ways of having a party , " he said .
" we try to innovate by integrating special forms and customs from other countries and other cultures .
we yodel , we wear bavarian and japanese clothes , and we do brazilian samba and turkish folklore skits . " cologne 's large immigrant population there are jazzy numbers in which the performers sing lines like " we 've come to stay , we 're not leaving " - referring to the one in five people living in cologne who has an immigrant background , in an urban population of around 1 million . yet , by being semi-outsiders , performers are able to point out the quirky characteristics among germans - and even themselves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what would cologne do without all its greek immigrants , even if they are philosophers ?
during one immigrantenstadl skit , a turkish-german actor explains that in turkey , when someone wants to steal something , the thief waits until a person leaves his house , sneaks in and grabs the item .
in germany , he quips , a person will go to a home , ring the bell , say " hello , " take the television and leave a receipt for the item on the table . another number shows a romanian actress who tries to discern the future of karneval in her crystal ball . good-humored mockery it 's poking fun at cultural differences in a good-humored , tongue-in-cheek way that makes the show so appealing , said julien , a frenchman who 's lived in cologne for three years .
he claimed that , contrary to the stereotype , germans are able to mock themselves . " there are some very funny pieces in this show and i like the mixture of jokes about germans and immigrants in germany and how they all live here together , " he said .
" there are a lot of taboos surrounding the subject .
in this show , there are no taboos .
it 's great ! " while the typical cologne sitzung is performed in the local kölsch dialect , which immigrants and germans from outside the city alike have difficulty understanding , the singers and actors in the " immigrantenstadl " dole out their mockery of world events in a kaleidoscope of languages , including german , english , turkish , romanian , greek and czech . creating the mood with a beer - or three bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world players like president bush and condi rice are not left unscathed in one funky , hip-hop sketch , a singer in a cowboy hat masquerading as us president george w. bush complains about his work overload in the white house and iraq .
splashing around in a plastic baby pool , he takes comfort in his cozy relationship with secretary of state condoleezza rice . it could be the turkish hip-hop , the greek melodies , the brazilian sambas or the deliberate on-stage mayhem that make the " immigrantenstadl 's " sold-out shows so attractive to both foreigners and locals .
or it could be the chance to take part in a traditional party tilted just far enough off kilter to suit non-traditionalists . " put on a really wacky costume , get yourself in a good mood - although sometimes , if you go to the right place , people can kind of get you into the right mood , " said american riccio , advising newcomers on how to enjoy karneval .
" and of course , i hate to say it , but one or two or three or four kölsch beers do n't hurt either . " louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but if anyone was in doubt about the potential danger of staking your happiness on the fortune of 11 men running around on a soccer field , a group of german scientists have done the typically teutonic thing and proved it should be avoided . taking german fans who followed their team through the 2006 world cup as their case study group , the men in lab coats from munich 's ludwig-maximilians university have discovered that the risk of a heart attack or other cardiovascular problem in male fans increased three-fold on days when the german team was in action . it was n't just irrational and emotionally charged fans on the edge of their stadium seats who were suffering .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 31.01.2008 german authorities slam " the god delusion " for kids großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the animals reach the conclusion that god would not be at home with any of the religions the german family ministry is pushing to have a book it says slurs judaism , christianity and islam labeled dangerous for children .
the book 's publisher says kids have a right to enlightenment . the german family ministry is pushing for the children 's book " how do i get to god , asked the small piglet , " by written by michael schmidt-salomon and illustrated by helge nyncke , to be included on a list of literature considered dangerous for young people . " the three large religions of the world , christianity , islam and judaism , are slurred in the book , " the ministry wrote in a december memo .
" the distinctive characteristics of each religion are made ridiculous . " the search for god bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the god delusion " for kids ?
the book tells the story of a piglet and a hedgehog , who discover a poster attached to their house that says : " if you do not know god , you are missing something ! " this frightens them because they had never suspected at all that anything was missing in their lives .
thus they set out to look for " god . "
along the way they encounter a rabbi , a bishop and a mufti who are portrayed as insane , violent and continually at each other 's throats . the rabbi is drawn in the same way as the caricatures from the propaganda of 1930 's germany ; corkscrew curls , fanatical lights in his eyes , a set of predator 's flashing teeth and hands like claws .
he reacts to the animals by flying into a rage , yelling at them that god had set out to destroy all life on earth at the time of noah and chases them away . the mufti fares little better .
while he greets both animals at first as a quiet man and invites them into his mosque , he soon changes into a ranting fanatic .
he assembles a baying islamic mob and holds the animals up in a clenched fist while condemning them to everlasting damnation through bared teeth and an unruly-looking beard . the insinuation here is that all visitors to mosques are extremists and every imam who appears reasonable is , in truth , nevertheless , a preacher of hate . animals reject religion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the three religious leaders are shown as being violent , insane and intolerant the bishop , a pale fat man with a clearly insinuated predilection for child abuse , makes up the unholy trinity which eventually convinces piglet and hedgehog , after they have survived the long search in the maze of religions , that nothing of any importance has been missing from their lives . " i think that god does n't even exist , " the hedgehog says at the end of the book .

the book 's publisher says kids have a right to enlightenment . the german family ministry is pushing for the children 's book " how do i get to god , asked the small piglet , " by written by michael schmidt-salomon and illustrated by helge nyncke , to be included on a list of literature considered dangerous for young people . " the three large religions of the world , christianity , islam and judaism , are slurred in the book , " the ministry wrote in a december memo .
" the distinctive characteristics of each religion are made ridiculous . " the search for god bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the god delusion " for kids ?
the book tells the story of a piglet and a hedgehog , who discover a poster attached to their house that says : " if you do not know god , you are missing something ! " this frightens them because they had never suspected at all that anything was missing in their lives .
thus they set out to look for " god . "
along the way they encounter a rabbi , a bishop and a mufti who are portrayed as insane , violent and continually at each other 's throats . the rabbi is drawn in the same way as the caricatures from the propaganda of 1930 's germany ; corkscrew curls , fanatical lights in his eyes , a set of predator 's flashing teeth and hands like claws .
he reacts to the animals by flying into a rage , yelling at them that god had set out to destroy all life on earth at the time of noah and chases them away . the mufti fares little better .
while he greets both animals at first as a quiet man and invites them into his mosque , he soon changes into a ranting fanatic .
he assembles a baying islamic mob and holds the animals up in a clenched fist while condemning them to everlasting damnation through bared teeth and an unruly-looking beard . the insinuation here is that all visitors to mosques are extremists and every imam who appears reasonable is , in truth , nevertheless , a preacher of hate . animals reject religion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the three religious leaders are shown as being violent , insane and intolerant the bishop , a pale fat man with a clearly insinuated predilection for child abuse , makes up the unholy trinity which eventually convinces piglet and hedgehog , after they have survived the long search in the maze of religions , that nothing of any importance has been missing from their lives . " i think that god does n't even exist , " the hedgehog says at the end of the book .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 31.01.2008 german authorities slam " the god delusion " for kids großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the animals reach the conclusion that god would not be at home with any of the religions the german family ministry is pushing to have a book it says slurs judaism , christianity and islam labeled dangerous for children .
the book 's publisher says kids have a right to enlightenment . the german family ministry is pushing for the children 's book " how do i get to god , asked the small piglet , " by written by michael schmidt-salomon and illustrated by helge nyncke , to be included on a list of literature considered dangerous for young people . " the three large religions of the world , christianity , islam and judaism , are slurred in the book , " the ministry wrote in a december memo .
" the distinctive characteristics of each religion are made ridiculous . " the search for god bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the god delusion " for kids ?
the book tells the story of a piglet and a hedgehog , who discover a poster attached to their house that says : " if you do not know god , you are missing something ! " this frightens them because they had never suspected at all that anything was missing in their lives .
thus they set out to look for " god . "
along the way they encounter a rabbi , a bishop and a mufti who are portrayed as insane , violent and continually at each other 's throats . the rabbi is drawn in the same way as the caricatures from the propaganda of 1930 's germany ; corkscrew curls , fanatical lights in his eyes , a set of predator 's flashing teeth and hands like claws .
he reacts to the animals by flying into a rage , yelling at them that god had set out to destroy all life on earth at the time of noah and chases them away . the mufti fares little better .
while he greets both animals at first as a quiet man and invites them into his mosque , he soon changes into a ranting fanatic .
he assembles a baying islamic mob and holds the animals up in a clenched fist while condemning them to everlasting damnation through bared teeth and an unruly-looking beard . the insinuation here is that all visitors to mosques are extremists and every imam who appears reasonable is , in truth , nevertheless , a preacher of hate . animals reject religion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the three religious leaders are shown as being violent , insane and intolerant the bishop , a pale fat man with a clearly insinuated predilection for child abuse , makes up the unholy trinity which eventually convinces piglet and hedgehog , after they have survived the long search in the maze of religions , that nothing of any importance has been missing from their lives . " i think that god does n't even exist , " the hedgehog says at the end of the book .
" and if he does , than he definitely does n't live in -lsb- a synagogue , cathedral or mosque -rsb- . " published in october 2007 , the 20-page book 's publisher , alibri , said it was aware it was risking a political battle when it published the book . " it 's clear to me that putting a critique of religion in children 's bedrooms is a hot political topic , " alibri head gunnar schedel said . children 's " right to enlightenment " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bishop comes with obvious connotations calling the ministry 's accusations an " attack on freedom of expression , " the publisher said the book answers the question of whether a nonreligious child is missing part of life " from the perspective of secular humanism . " schedel added that the book is intended for nonreligious parents looking to provide their children with a critical view of religion . " all three religions are treated equally in the book , " he said .
" no one is negatively singled out . " author schmidt-salomon said the book was " desperately needed considering the enormous mass of religious children 's stories . "
he added that he the book offers children and their parents the opportunity to read about agnostic beliefs if they choose . " children also have a right to enlightenment , " he wrote on a web site set up dedicated to the book .
" they should not be left defenseless to the scientifically untenable and ethically problematic stories of religion . " the german department responsible for reviewing children 's literature is scheduled to discuss whether the book presents a danger to children 's upbringing in a march meeting . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's comfortable , there is food and drink at hand and no noisy crowds pushing you around .
and yet , a killer could be stalking you . soccer can be a dangerous business for committed fans .
in the stadiums themselves , supporters face a number of medical risks including serious bladder episodes brought on by too many half-time beers , temporary bouts of tourette 's syndrome and , in the case of england fans , actual death through boredom .
no one who follows a team with passion should take their allegiance lightly .
it can seriously damage your health . those who have ever watched their team 's chances of success end in the lottery of a penalty shoot-out will already know this .
but if anyone was in doubt about the potential danger of staking your happiness on the fortune of 11 men running around on a soccer field , a group of german scientists have done the typically teutonic thing and proved it should be avoided . taking german fans who followed their team through the 2006 world cup as their case study group , the men in lab coats from munich 's ludwig-maximilians university have discovered that the risk of a heart attack or other cardiovascular problem in male fans increased three-fold on days when the german team was in action . it was n't just irrational and emotionally charged fans on the edge of their stadium seats who were suffering .
victims also included over-stressed fans watching the game in the comfort of their own homes .
and they were n't all men , either : female fans also recorded a rise in emergencies , with the amount of heart incidents in women rising by 82 percent during the tournament . the researchers came to their conclusions after reviewing 4,279 medical reports from the seven days the german team played in the 2006 world cup , the 24 days when matches involved teams from other countries , and 242 other days in 2003 , 2005 and 2006 . paying the penalty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's super-fit players handled the shoot-out well the research showed that cardiac emergencies usually occurred within two hours of the start of a match , which would explain why the largest number of attacks occurred during the june 30 quarter-final in which germany defeated argentina in a dramatic penalty shoot-out .
after 90 minutes of regular time and an additional 30 minutes of extra-time , german fans found themselves entering the danger zone and 64 of them suffered heart attacks as a result . the next game , germany 's semi-final loss to italy which went into extra-time , produced almost as many heart attacks . " apparently , of prime importance for triggering a stress-induced event is not the outcome of a game - a win or a loss - but rather the intense strain and excitement experienced during the viewing of a dramatic match , such as one with a penalty shoot-out , " the research report , published in the new england journal of medicine , stated . hosts ' march raises pulses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just remember to breathe watching jürgen klinsmann 's team throughout the world cup on home soil was a potential killer for german fans as six of the seven games in which the team participated were associated with an increase in the number of cardiac emergencies . the only game which produced no spike in heart-related problems was the third-place match in which germany defeated portugal 3-1 .
presumably , with the main prize out of contention , more of the pressure was off and fans could relax their heart valves . while the excitement of germany 's march to the semi-finals was a contributing factor to the increase in heart episodes , others were cited by the report .
fans might have been subject to risk factors such as lack of sleep , overeating , consumption of junk food , alcohol and smoking during the world cup , which would not have helped to keep them in tip-top physical condition for the rigors of supporting germany . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

no one who follows a team with passion should take their allegiance lightly .
it can seriously damage your health . those who have ever watched their team 's chances of success end in the lottery of a penalty shoot-out will already know this .
but if anyone was in doubt about the potential danger of staking your happiness on the fortune of 11 men running around on a soccer field , a group of german scientists have done the typically teutonic thing and proved it should be avoided . taking german fans who followed their team through the 2006 world cup as their case study group , the men in lab coats from munich 's ludwig-maximilians university have discovered that the risk of a heart attack or other cardiovascular problem in male fans increased three-fold on days when the german team was in action . it was n't just irrational and emotionally charged fans on the edge of their stadium seats who were suffering .
victims also included over-stressed fans watching the game in the comfort of their own homes .
and they were n't all men , either : female fans also recorded a rise in emergencies , with the amount of heart incidents in women rising by 82 percent during the tournament . the researchers came to their conclusions after reviewing 4,279 medical reports from the seven days the german team played in the 2006 world cup , the 24 days when matches involved teams from other countries , and 242 other days in 2003 , 2005 and 2006 . paying the penalty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's super-fit players handled the shoot-out well the research showed that cardiac emergencies usually occurred within two hours of the start of a match , which would explain why the largest number of attacks occurred during the june 30 quarter-final in which germany defeated argentina in a dramatic penalty shoot-out .
after 90 minutes of regular time and an additional 30 minutes of extra-time , german fans found themselves entering the danger zone and 64 of them suffered heart attacks as a result . the next game , germany 's semi-final loss to italy which went into extra-time , produced almost as many heart attacks . " apparently , of prime importance for triggering a stress-induced event is not the outcome of a game - a win or a loss - but rather the intense strain and excitement experienced during the viewing of a dramatic match , such as one with a penalty shoot-out , " the research report , published in the new england journal of medicine , stated . hosts ' march raises pulses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just remember to breathe watching jürgen klinsmann 's team throughout the world cup on home soil was a potential killer for german fans as six of the seven games in which the team participated were associated with an increase in the number of cardiac emergencies . the only game which produced no spike in heart-related problems was the third-place match in which germany defeated portugal 3-1 .
presumably , with the main prize out of contention , more of the pressure was off and fans could relax their heart valves . while the excitement of germany 's march to the semi-finals was a contributing factor to the increase in heart episodes , others were cited by the report .

31 , top off months of gala soirees that are often incomprehensible to the city 's non-natives .
but one party re-examines the traditional fetes . cologne during carnival can be terrifying for the uninitiated .
they are faced with drunken , costume-clad karneval enthusiasts singing - and staggering - their way down the streets and partaking in the sort of debauchery they 'll never admit to once the celebrations have come to a close . part of the festival traditions are the sitzungen .
literally " sessions " or " sittings , " the more traditional ones are gala events ; the smaller , more alternatives ones resemble comedy or variety shows composed of skits with performers making liberal use of song and dance to mock politicians , each other and themselves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bit of samba spices up karneval for american singer and actress victoria riccio , who came to germany nearly 20 years ago , the introduction to a sitzung was a shocker . " when i first came here , i went to one of these events and did n't understand a word , but at one point , the people on stage took off all their clothes and jumped around naked , " she said .
" i thought ' oh my god , where have i landed ? '
i loved it right away .
for me it was like halloween and the best party you 've ever been to , all wrapped into one . " immigrants take the stage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the immigrantenstadl kicked off three years ago still , despite the lure of scantily-clad hedonists and the beer that flows abundantly , karneval and its sitzungen can make non-germans feel like outsiders due to all the inside jokes about local politics and heavy use of the local dialect . so riccio , along with emcee hektor haarkötter and a host of others , started their own show called the " immigrantenstadl . "
it 's a gala put on for and by immigrants - which in cologne can also mean anyone born outside the city limits . " a bunch of us met with other artists and musicians in a pub in the southern part of the city and talked for hours , making all sorts of plans for a show , " he said .
" after a while , someone asked ' who at this table was actually born in cologne ? '
and then we realized that no one was originally from cologne . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mocking the tricky ö , ü,ä vowels of german is easier than mastering them rather than put on a typical cologne sitzung performed by foreigners , haarkötter said the " immigrantenstadl , " which started three years ago , aims to incorporate aspects of foreign cultures for an international audience . " cologne 's karneval can be a very traditional thing with a lot of very old styles and ways of having a party , " he said .
" we try to innovate by integrating special forms and customs from other countries and other cultures .
we yodel , we wear bavarian and japanese clothes , and we do brazilian samba and turkish folklore skits . " cologne 's large immigrant population there are jazzy numbers in which the performers sing lines like " we 've come to stay , we 're not leaving " - referring to the one in five people living in cologne who has an immigrant background , in an urban population of around 1 million . yet , by being semi-outsiders , performers are able to point out the quirky characteristics among germans - and even themselves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what would cologne do without all its greek immigrants , even if they are philosophers ?
during one immigrantenstadl skit , a turkish-german actor explains that in turkey , when someone wants to steal something , the thief waits until a person leaves his house , sneaks in and grabs the item .
in germany , he quips , a person will go to a home , ring the bell , say " hello , " take the television and leave a receipt for the item on the table . another number shows a romanian actress who tries to discern the future of karneval in her crystal ball . good-humored mockery it 's poking fun at cultural differences in a good-humored , tongue-in-cheek way that makes the show so appealing , said julien , a frenchman who 's lived in cologne for three years .
he claimed that , contrary to the stereotype , germans are able to mock themselves . " there are some very funny pieces in this show and i like the mixture of jokes about germans and immigrants in germany and how they all live here together , " he said .
" there are a lot of taboos surrounding the subject .
in this show , there are no taboos .
it 's great ! " while the typical cologne sitzung is performed in the local kölsch dialect , which immigrants and germans from outside the city alike have difficulty understanding , the singers and actors in the " immigrantenstadl " dole out their mockery of world events in a kaleidoscope of languages , including german , english , turkish , romanian , greek and czech . creating the mood with a beer - or three bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world players like president bush and condi rice are not left unscathed in one funky , hip-hop sketch , a singer in a cowboy hat masquerading as us president george w. bush complains about his work overload in the white house and iraq .
splashing around in a plastic baby pool , he takes comfort in his cozy relationship with secretary of state condoleezza rice . it could be the turkish hip-hop , the greek melodies , the brazilian sambas or the deliberate on-stage mayhem that make the " immigrantenstadl 's " sold-out shows so attractive to both foreigners and locals .
or it could be the chance to take part in a traditional party tilted just far enough off kilter to suit non-traditionalists . " put on a really wacky costume , get yourself in a good mood - although sometimes , if you go to the right place , people can kind of get you into the right mood , " said american riccio , advising newcomers on how to enjoy karneval .

31 , top off months of gala soirees that are often incomprehensible to the city 's non-natives .
but one party re-examines the traditional fetes . cologne during carnival can be terrifying for the uninitiated .
they are faced with drunken , costume-clad karneval enthusiasts singing - and staggering - their way down the streets and partaking in the sort of debauchery they 'll never admit to once the celebrations have come to a close . part of the festival traditions are the sitzungen .
literally " sessions " or " sittings , " the more traditional ones are gala events ; the smaller , more alternatives ones resemble comedy or variety shows composed of skits with performers making liberal use of song and dance to mock politicians , each other and themselves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bit of samba spices up karneval for american singer and actress victoria riccio , who came to germany nearly 20 years ago , the introduction to a sitzung was a shocker . " when i first came here , i went to one of these events and did n't understand a word , but at one point , the people on stage took off all their clothes and jumped around naked , " she said .
" i thought ' oh my god , where have i landed ? '
i loved it right away .
for me it was like halloween and the best party you 've ever been to , all wrapped into one . " immigrants take the stage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the immigrantenstadl kicked off three years ago still , despite the lure of scantily-clad hedonists and the beer that flows abundantly , karneval and its sitzungen can make non-germans feel like outsiders due to all the inside jokes about local politics and heavy use of the local dialect . so riccio , along with emcee hektor haarkötter and a host of others , started their own show called the " immigrantenstadl . "
it 's a gala put on for and by immigrants - which in cologne can also mean anyone born outside the city limits . " a bunch of us met with other artists and musicians in a pub in the southern part of the city and talked for hours , making all sorts of plans for a show , " he said .
" after a while , someone asked ' who at this table was actually born in cologne ? '
and then we realized that no one was originally from cologne . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mocking the tricky ö , ü,ä vowels of german is easier than mastering them rather than put on a typical cologne sitzung performed by foreigners , haarkötter said the " immigrantenstadl , " which started three years ago , aims to incorporate aspects of foreign cultures for an international audience . " cologne 's karneval can be a very traditional thing with a lot of very old styles and ways of having a party , " he said .
" we try to innovate by integrating special forms and customs from other countries and other cultures .
we yodel , we wear bavarian and japanese clothes , and we do brazilian samba and turkish folklore skits . " cologne 's large immigrant population there are jazzy numbers in which the performers sing lines like " we 've come to stay , we 're not leaving " - referring to the one in five people living in cologne who has an immigrant background , in an urban population of around 1 million . yet , by being semi-outsiders , performers are able to point out the quirky characteristics among germans - and even themselves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what would cologne do without all its greek immigrants , even if they are philosophers ?
during one immigrantenstadl skit , a turkish-german actor explains that in turkey , when someone wants to steal something , the thief waits until a person leaves his house , sneaks in and grabs the item .
in germany , he quips , a person will go to a home , ring the bell , say " hello , " take the television and leave a receipt for the item on the table . another number shows a romanian actress who tries to discern the future of karneval in her crystal ball . good-humored mockery it 's poking fun at cultural differences in a good-humored , tongue-in-cheek way that makes the show so appealing , said julien , a frenchman who 's lived in cologne for three years .
he claimed that , contrary to the stereotype , germans are able to mock themselves . " there are some very funny pieces in this show and i like the mixture of jokes about germans and immigrants in germany and how they all live here together , " he said .
" there are a lot of taboos surrounding the subject .
in this show , there are no taboos .
it 's great ! " while the typical cologne sitzung is performed in the local kölsch dialect , which immigrants and germans from outside the city alike have difficulty understanding , the singers and actors in the " immigrantenstadl " dole out their mockery of world events in a kaleidoscope of languages , including german , english , turkish , romanian , greek and czech . creating the mood with a beer - or three bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world players like president bush and condi rice are not left unscathed in one funky , hip-hop sketch , a singer in a cowboy hat masquerading as us president george w. bush complains about his work overload in the white house and iraq .
splashing around in a plastic baby pool , he takes comfort in his cozy relationship with secretary of state condoleezza rice . it could be the turkish hip-hop , the greek melodies , the brazilian sambas or the deliberate on-stage mayhem that make the " immigrantenstadl 's " sold-out shows so attractive to both foreigners and locals .
or it could be the chance to take part in a traditional party tilted just far enough off kilter to suit non-traditionalists . " put on a really wacky costume , get yourself in a good mood - although sometimes , if you go to the right place , people can kind of get you into the right mood , " said american riccio , advising newcomers on how to enjoy karneval .
" and of course , i hate to say it , but one or two or three or four kölsch beers do n't hurt either . " louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 31.01.2008 internet , ageing ca n't take fun out of sex , german expert says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red-light districts or not , germany is n't particularly open about sex since the late 1980s , erika berger has been one of germany 's leading sex experts .
on tv and in print , she 's advised countless people about matters most intimate .
we talked to her on the eve of a historical anniversary . published 60 years ago , the first kinsey report , titled " sexual behavior in the human male , " shocked the general public for discussing subjects that had previously been taboo and for openly challenging conventional sexual beliefs of the day .
though kinsey 's methods have repeatedly been questioned by opponents , the report remains one of the largest studies ever conducted on human sexual behavior . dw-world.de : the kinsey report launched the sexual revolution when it was published on jan .
31 , 1948 .
now it 's celebrating its 60th anniversary .
how important was it to your career ? erika berger : well , i was much too young to read it when it came out , but of course i have it on my shelf at home just like everyone today who 's interested in sexuality .
there are things in it , where you say , " yes , that 's exactly right . "
there 's no reason not to do things that are a bit out of the ordinary and that may be incomprehensible to other people .
and above all we should talk about sexuality .
we should n't try to conceal things , and we should leave people with other sexual preferences and drives in peace . it took several years for the kinsey report to be translated into german .
was germany backwards in this regard ? as i began dealing with sexuality in front of the camera , it was a wasteland .
there was director oswalt kolle who made a number of sex-education films in the 1960s .
he was an educational pioneer , and i think it was only then that we in germany realized that sex was something completely normal .
in that respect i think germany did lag behind america a bit . the results of the kinsey report suggested that sexual practices traditionally dismissed as perverse were far more widespread than people thought .
is there such a thing as " normal sex ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika berger currently hosts the call-in advice show " night talk " you 'd have to ask yourself the question : what is normal sex for a given individual ?
and you could just as well ask : what is good or bad sex for that individual ?
sex is the way i experience it and do it - together with my partner .
the concepts of normal and abnormal sex mean nothing to me .
i think it 's impertinent for someone today to say " what gays do , is n't normal . "
who are they to say what 's normal ?
i myself determine what 's normal for me . the internet has opened up whole new possibilities for tracking people 's sex preferences .
what effect has that had on sexual research ? i think the web is unbelievably important for sex research .
first of all , it allows you to look things up things instantly .
and it 's very transparent .
i no longer have to go somewhere and buy a book that i hardly dare to ask for because the title is so racy .
instead i just log on to the web , click and i 've got everything i need .
and it 's interesting that you can measure people 's clicks and see whether they are interested in the missionary position , same-sex love or unusual sexual practices .
are they interested in sex toys or masturbation tips ?
that 's very interesting . then public sexual morality often differs drastically from people 's actual online sexual behavior ? absolutely .
you can read about things , click on them and inform yourself .
you can even talk about and discuss them .
but when people are confronted with their own desires , they sometimes lack the courage .
some do n't want to overburden their partners ; others simply do n't know where to begin .
to take a somewhat crass example : if i said , " how about some role playing or bondage tonight ? " or " i 'm into sadomasochism , " i would n't know how my partner would react .
and then it 's too late .
that 's why , in practice , sex is often so boring . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berger says the internet offers positive and negative forms of anonymity is it not ironic that the possibilities opened up by the anonymity of the internet often get in the way of sexual communication ? yes , it 's suffered from that .
today i can choose a partner via the internet - i can virtually " invite " someone into my living room and talk to him via the computer screen .
but , please , what good is that ?
it 's totally one-dimensional .
it 's the same as if i look at pictures of naked women or men or sex practices on the screen .
what good does it do me ? that sounds as if there 's still a need for sexual education in the internet age , a need to bring people together to talk about sex . i think the attempt to bring people together is great .
but it does n't always work .
let 's say i decide i want a man .
so i go to some web page and look for a guy i 'd like to chat with .
then you start talking , and of course your conversations revolve around horizontal kinds of fun .
but i still want to see the guy some time !
i love chatting , and i 'm very involved with the internet .
but i still think that you have to talk face-to-face at some point .
i miss that .
it 's a kind of anonymity that i do n't like very much . you 're 67 , and your last book dealt with growing older and specifically with menopause .
that 's very topical because the average age is increasing in germany and many other western countries .
will it have an effect on our sex lives ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as people get older , they start to question the value of getting horizontal it creates a very important question : is sex in old age a taboo or not ?
personally i 'd plead for treating it as something normal .
who says that you should n't have sex at the age of 60 , 70 or 80 ?
there 's no age limit for sex - or love , which i always stress is connected with sex .
if a person is healthy , he can still have a very fulfilling sexual life .
but one thing i found out from talking to people for my last book was that as they get older , sex becomes less important .
it 's only their second or third most important concern - the top one is tenderness .
is there someone there who loves me and whom i can love back ?
it 's a matter of trust , above all , and sexuality develops from it . so there will be more attention paid to older people 's sexuality ? of course , because people are getting older , and - thank god - they 're no longer stupid enough to try and conceal the fact that they 're no longer doing the dirty deed . -lrb- laughs -rrb- look at it this way - everyone , no matter how old , has a baby inside that needs to be cuddled .
when you enter puberty , it 's great .
and when you 're in the prime of life , you 've lost most of your inhibitions .
but if you 're a woman entering menopause , you have so many inhibitions .
you do n't dare take off your clothes .
you 're afraid that sex will hurt .
you have so many things that can take away your desire for sexuality .
you say , " oh , i 'm old . "
but you 're not old .
you 're just entering a new phase of life .
that 's great .
why are you laughing ? no reason - you just made ageing sound pleasant .
one last - frivolous - question : you recorded a song in the 1990s called " sex is fun . "
when was the last time you listened to it ? -lrb- laughs . -rrb-
oh god , i know exactly when it was .
six months ago .
i was sitting around with some colleagues , chatting interactively , and they said , " hey , we 've found something really funny .
it 's your cd . "
we listened to it and laughed ourselves under the table .
what do think about that ?
pretty funny , huh ? i do n't have any problem with that .
i have no problem with getting older , or with saying that sex is fun , or with anything i 've every done in my professional or personal life .
i think it 's great .
it 's part of life . i would n't have minded making a record - especially not with that title . -lrb- laughs -rrb- too late .

on tv and in print , she 's advised countless people about matters most intimate .
we talked to her on the eve of a historical anniversary . published 60 years ago , the first kinsey report , titled " sexual behavior in the human male , " shocked the general public for discussing subjects that had previously been taboo and for openly challenging conventional sexual beliefs of the day .
though kinsey 's methods have repeatedly been questioned by opponents , the report remains one of the largest studies ever conducted on human sexual behavior . dw-world.de : the kinsey report launched the sexual revolution when it was published on jan .
31 , 1948 .
now it 's celebrating its 60th anniversary .
how important was it to your career ? erika berger : well , i was much too young to read it when it came out , but of course i have it on my shelf at home just like everyone today who 's interested in sexuality .
there are things in it , where you say , " yes , that 's exactly right . "
there 's no reason not to do things that are a bit out of the ordinary and that may be incomprehensible to other people .
and above all we should talk about sexuality .
we should n't try to conceal things , and we should leave people with other sexual preferences and drives in peace . it took several years for the kinsey report to be translated into german .
was germany backwards in this regard ? as i began dealing with sexuality in front of the camera , it was a wasteland .
there was director oswalt kolle who made a number of sex-education films in the 1960s .
he was an educational pioneer , and i think it was only then that we in germany realized that sex was something completely normal .
in that respect i think germany did lag behind america a bit . the results of the kinsey report suggested that sexual practices traditionally dismissed as perverse were far more widespread than people thought .
is there such a thing as " normal sex ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika berger currently hosts the call-in advice show " night talk " you 'd have to ask yourself the question : what is normal sex for a given individual ?
and you could just as well ask : what is good or bad sex for that individual ?
sex is the way i experience it and do it - together with my partner .
the concepts of normal and abnormal sex mean nothing to me .
i think it 's impertinent for someone today to say " what gays do , is n't normal . "
who are they to say what 's normal ?
i myself determine what 's normal for me . the internet has opened up whole new possibilities for tracking people 's sex preferences .
what effect has that had on sexual research ? i think the web is unbelievably important for sex research .
first of all , it allows you to look things up things instantly .
and it 's very transparent .
i no longer have to go somewhere and buy a book that i hardly dare to ask for because the title is so racy .
instead i just log on to the web , click and i 've got everything i need .
and it 's interesting that you can measure people 's clicks and see whether they are interested in the missionary position , same-sex love or unusual sexual practices .
are they interested in sex toys or masturbation tips ?
that 's very interesting . then public sexual morality often differs drastically from people 's actual online sexual behavior ? absolutely .
you can read about things , click on them and inform yourself .
you can even talk about and discuss them .
but when people are confronted with their own desires , they sometimes lack the courage .
some do n't want to overburden their partners ; others simply do n't know where to begin .
to take a somewhat crass example : if i said , " how about some role playing or bondage tonight ? " or " i 'm into sadomasochism , " i would n't know how my partner would react .
and then it 's too late .
that 's why , in practice , sex is often so boring . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berger says the internet offers positive and negative forms of anonymity is it not ironic that the possibilities opened up by the anonymity of the internet often get in the way of sexual communication ? yes , it 's suffered from that .
today i can choose a partner via the internet - i can virtually " invite " someone into my living room and talk to him via the computer screen .
but , please , what good is that ?
it 's totally one-dimensional .
it 's the same as if i look at pictures of naked women or men or sex practices on the screen .
what good does it do me ? that sounds as if there 's still a need for sexual education in the internet age , a need to bring people together to talk about sex . i think the attempt to bring people together is great .
but it does n't always work .
let 's say i decide i want a man .
so i go to some web page and look for a guy i 'd like to chat with .
then you start talking , and of course your conversations revolve around horizontal kinds of fun .
but i still want to see the guy some time !
i love chatting , and i 'm very involved with the internet .
but i still think that you have to talk face-to-face at some point .
i miss that .
it 's a kind of anonymity that i do n't like very much . you 're 67 , and your last book dealt with growing older and specifically with menopause .
that 's very topical because the average age is increasing in germany and many other western countries .
will it have an effect on our sex lives ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as people get older , they start to question the value of getting horizontal it creates a very important question : is sex in old age a taboo or not ?
personally i 'd plead for treating it as something normal .
who says that you should n't have sex at the age of 60 , 70 or 80 ?
there 's no age limit for sex - or love , which i always stress is connected with sex .
if a person is healthy , he can still have a very fulfilling sexual life .
but one thing i found out from talking to people for my last book was that as they get older , sex becomes less important .
it 's only their second or third most important concern - the top one is tenderness .
is there someone there who loves me and whom i can love back ?
it 's a matter of trust , above all , and sexuality develops from it . so there will be more attention paid to older people 's sexuality ? of course , because people are getting older , and - thank god - they 're no longer stupid enough to try and conceal the fact that they 're no longer doing the dirty deed . -lrb- laughs -rrb- look at it this way - everyone , no matter how old , has a baby inside that needs to be cuddled .
when you enter puberty , it 's great .
and when you 're in the prime of life , you 've lost most of your inhibitions .
but if you 're a woman entering menopause , you have so many inhibitions .
you do n't dare take off your clothes .
you 're afraid that sex will hurt .
you have so many things that can take away your desire for sexuality .
you say , " oh , i 'm old . "
but you 're not old .
you 're just entering a new phase of life .
that 's great .
why are you laughing ? no reason - you just made ageing sound pleasant .
one last - frivolous - question : you recorded a song in the 1990s called " sex is fun . "
when was the last time you listened to it ? -lrb- laughs . -rrb-
oh god , i know exactly when it was .
six months ago .
i was sitting around with some colleagues , chatting interactively , and they said , " hey , we 've found something really funny .
it 's your cd . "
we listened to it and laughed ourselves under the table .
what do think about that ?
pretty funny , huh ? i do n't have any problem with that .
i have no problem with getting older , or with saying that sex is fun , or with anything i 've every done in my professional or personal life .
i think it 's great .
it 's part of life . i would n't have minded making a record - especially not with that title . -lrb- laughs -rrb- too late .

on tv and in print , she 's advised countless people about matters most intimate .
we talked to her on the eve of a historical anniversary . published 60 years ago , the first kinsey report , titled " sexual behavior in the human male , " shocked the general public for discussing subjects that had previously been taboo and for openly challenging conventional sexual beliefs of the day .
though kinsey 's methods have repeatedly been questioned by opponents , the report remains one of the largest studies ever conducted on human sexual behavior . dw-world.de : the kinsey report launched the sexual revolution when it was published on jan .
31 , 1948 .
now it 's celebrating its 60th anniversary .
how important was it to your career ? erika berger : well , i was much too young to read it when it came out , but of course i have it on my shelf at home just like everyone today who 's interested in sexuality .
there are things in it , where you say , " yes , that 's exactly right . "
there 's no reason not to do things that are a bit out of the ordinary and that may be incomprehensible to other people .
and above all we should talk about sexuality .
we should n't try to conceal things , and we should leave people with other sexual preferences and drives in peace . it took several years for the kinsey report to be translated into german .
was germany backwards in this regard ? as i began dealing with sexuality in front of the camera , it was a wasteland .
there was director oswalt kolle who made a number of sex-education films in the 1960s .
he was an educational pioneer , and i think it was only then that we in germany realized that sex was something completely normal .
in that respect i think germany did lag behind america a bit . the results of the kinsey report suggested that sexual practices traditionally dismissed as perverse were far more widespread than people thought .
is there such a thing as " normal sex ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erika berger currently hosts the call-in advice show " night talk " you 'd have to ask yourself the question : what is normal sex for a given individual ?
and you could just as well ask : what is good or bad sex for that individual ?
sex is the way i experience it and do it - together with my partner .
the concepts of normal and abnormal sex mean nothing to me .
i think it 's impertinent for someone today to say " what gays do , is n't normal . "
who are they to say what 's normal ?
i myself determine what 's normal for me . the internet has opened up whole new possibilities for tracking people 's sex preferences .
what effect has that had on sexual research ? i think the web is unbelievably important for sex research .
first of all , it allows you to look things up things instantly .
and it 's very transparent .
i no longer have to go somewhere and buy a book that i hardly dare to ask for because the title is so racy .
instead i just log on to the web , click and i 've got everything i need .
and it 's interesting that you can measure people 's clicks and see whether they are interested in the missionary position , same-sex love or unusual sexual practices .
are they interested in sex toys or masturbation tips ?
that 's very interesting . then public sexual morality often differs drastically from people 's actual online sexual behavior ? absolutely .
you can read about things , click on them and inform yourself .
you can even talk about and discuss them .
but when people are confronted with their own desires , they sometimes lack the courage .
some do n't want to overburden their partners ; others simply do n't know where to begin .
to take a somewhat crass example : if i said , " how about some role playing or bondage tonight ? " or " i 'm into sadomasochism , " i would n't know how my partner would react .
and then it 's too late .
that 's why , in practice , sex is often so boring . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berger says the internet offers positive and negative forms of anonymity is it not ironic that the possibilities opened up by the anonymity of the internet often get in the way of sexual communication ? yes , it 's suffered from that .
today i can choose a partner via the internet - i can virtually " invite " someone into my living room and talk to him via the computer screen .
but , please , what good is that ?
it 's totally one-dimensional .
it 's the same as if i look at pictures of naked women or men or sex practices on the screen .
what good does it do me ? that sounds as if there 's still a need for sexual education in the internet age , a need to bring people together to talk about sex . i think the attempt to bring people together is great .
but it does n't always work .
let 's say i decide i want a man .
so i go to some web page and look for a guy i 'd like to chat with .
then you start talking , and of course your conversations revolve around horizontal kinds of fun .
but i still want to see the guy some time !
i love chatting , and i 'm very involved with the internet .
but i still think that you have to talk face-to-face at some point .
i miss that .
it 's a kind of anonymity that i do n't like very much . you 're 67 , and your last book dealt with growing older and specifically with menopause .
that 's very topical because the average age is increasing in germany and many other western countries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 31.01.2008 shunned in germany , far-left gets support elsewhere in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : die linke - germany 's left party - has steadily increased its voter base while the left party in germany is cold-shouldered by all established political groupings , other european nations ' far-left parties are often part of ruling coalitions .
but they have n't been particularly successful . they could potentially be kingmakers and help andrea ypsilanti , the chairwoman of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in the western german state of hesse , get a majority after a closely contested election in which incumbent roland koch 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- won the vote by a wafer-thin margin . but the left party remains an unwanted child in the german political landscape .
though the far-left party is now represented in two state parliaments in western germany , ypsilanti has vowed she will not form a government with them .
and all established parties in germany - whether on the left or right of center - shun the group . left party seen as communist relic for many western germans , the left party is still a relic of former communist east germany , according to tim spier , a political scientist at the institute for party law and research at the university of düsseldorf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prominent faces of germany 's left party - gregor gysi , left , and petra pau forged from the debris of the east german ruling party after reunification in 1990 and known then as the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the left party reached its present incarnation last year when it was joined by a stream of trade unionists , discontented westerners and social democratic party members unhappy with former chancellor gerhard schröder 's package of far-reaching social security and labor market reforms . the origins of the western side of the party as a splinter movement within the social democratic family have left deep wounds .
while the spd and the left party rule together in the city-state of berlin and have at times cooperated in eastern german states , the social democrats refuse to consider a so-called " red-red " coalition in a western state , let alone at the federal level . " it has to be said that in germany , a part of the left still continues in the tradition of the pds and the additional problem is that we have a remnant of the sed -lsb- the former east german ruling party -rsb- there , " said spier .
" west germans have a problem accepting that . " far-left parties in europe enjoy support the situation is distinctly different in other parts of europe where parties left of social democracy are often part of the mainstream political establishment .
in france , sweden and italy , for instance , such parties have been part of national governments . " in the 1970s there was a long period where many traditional communist parties were much more successful than other parties - for instance in france , " spier said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outside russia , communist parties also enjoyed support in europe far-left parties in western europe may have emerged from different ideological traditions and have heterogeneous historical roots . " but they can still be considered as part of a larger family of parties , " said spier . a large chunk of these far-left parties were former communist parties who reinvented themselves after the end of the cold war .
others broke away from the communists much earlier , formed maoist splinter groups to an extent , and finally evolved into moderate left-wing groups . the most successful far-left party in europe is the socialist party in the netherlands . " they took 16.6 percent of the vote in the last parliamentary election , " spier said . far-left parties are also well-established in scandinavia , where they enjoy considerable support among voters - around 10 percent .
for instance , denmark 's socialist people 's party , norway 's socialist left party , sweden 's left party and finland 's left alliance are all far-left parties but represent a more ecological and social stance . far-left parties in italy and france too enjoy popular support .
" though these parties present a significantly moderate face , their rhetoric and their names betray their communist legacy , " said spier . reform-friendly social democrats helped rise of far-left in germany , there was no serious force left of the social democrats and the green party for a long time .
the communist party of germany -lrb- kpd -rrb- was relatively strong during the weimar republic between 1919 and 1933 but was later banned in the 1950s .
the newly formed german communist party -lrb- dkp -rrb- did n't manage to overcome its status as a splinter group .
it was only with reunification in 1990 and the transformation of the sed into the pds , that a political force left of the social democrats take shape .
the party needed until 2005 to become a nation-wide political forced to be reckoned with . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair and schröder 's reform-friendly social democracy has fueled the rise of the far-left the rise of far-left parties in europe has largely been thanks to the social democrats , in particular what tony blair referred to as " new labour " and gerhard schröder the " new center . "
the move away from traditional , labor-friendly politics has indeed fueled the march of the far-left . " the social democrats who remained traditional , as in the case of france , managed to marginalize far-left parties , " said spier . on the other hand , those who turned particularly reform-friendly , such as the social democrats in germany , the netherlands and denmark , have lost large chunks of their traditional voter base to the far-left . " a real dilemma " the far-left in some parts of europe has also made it as far as into national governments - in france , sweden , italy and presently in norway .
but such coalitions have rarely been especially successful . in 1998 , the social democratic party in sweden entered a coalition with the left party and the greens .
one result was that support for the far-left quickly eroded . " we do n't regret being part of the coalition , we could certainly air some of our views , " said gudrun utas of sweden 's left party .
" but we did n't have positive experiences . " after four years of being part of the government , her far-left party has managed to attract just 5 percent of the vote - a far cry from their historic high of 12.8 percent in 1998 . " it 's a real dilemma , " said spier .
" at first , the far-left in sweden profited from the social democrats ' move to the center .
but once they took on governing responsibilities , the far-left lost its halo - as well as votes . "
at the same time , the social democrats won the majority it needed to govern thanks to the far-left . the swedish example may hold lessons for andrea ypsilanti .

and all established parties in germany - whether on the left or right of center - shun the group . left party seen as communist relic for many western germans , the left party is still a relic of former communist east germany , according to tim spier , a political scientist at the institute for party law and research at the university of düsseldorf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prominent faces of germany 's left party - gregor gysi , left , and petra pau forged from the debris of the east german ruling party after reunification in 1990 and known then as the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the left party reached its present incarnation last year when it was joined by a stream of trade unionists , discontented westerners and social democratic party members unhappy with former chancellor gerhard schröder 's package of far-reaching social security and labor market reforms . the origins of the western side of the party as a splinter movement within the social democratic family have left deep wounds .
while the spd and the left party rule together in the city-state of berlin and have at times cooperated in eastern german states , the social democrats refuse to consider a so-called " red-red " coalition in a western state , let alone at the federal level . " it has to be said that in germany , a part of the left still continues in the tradition of the pds and the additional problem is that we have a remnant of the sed -lsb- the former east german ruling party -rsb- there , " said spier .

others broke away from the communists much earlier , formed maoist splinter groups to an extent , and finally evolved into moderate left-wing groups . the most successful far-left party in europe is the socialist party in the netherlands . " they took 16.6 percent of the vote in the last parliamentary election , " spier said . far-left parties are also well-established in scandinavia , where they enjoy considerable support among voters - around 10 percent .
for instance , denmark 's socialist people 's party , norway 's socialist left party , sweden 's left party and finland 's left alliance are all far-left parties but represent a more ecological and social stance . far-left parties in italy and france too enjoy popular support .

31 , top off months of gala soirees that are often incomprehensible to the city 's non-natives .
but one party re-examines the traditional fetes . cologne during carnival can be terrifying for the uninitiated .
they are faced with drunken , costume-clad karneval enthusiasts singing - and staggering - their way down the streets and partaking in the sort of debauchery they 'll never admit to once the celebrations have come to a close . part of the festival traditions are the sitzungen .
literally " sessions " or " sittings , " the more traditional ones are gala events ; the smaller , more alternatives ones resemble comedy or variety shows composed of skits with performers making liberal use of song and dance to mock politicians , each other and themselves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bit of samba spices up karneval for american singer and actress victoria riccio , who came to germany nearly 20 years ago , the introduction to a sitzung was a shocker . " when i first came here , i went to one of these events and did n't understand a word , but at one point , the people on stage took off all their clothes and jumped around naked , " she said .
" i thought ' oh my god , where have i landed ? '
i loved it right away .
for me it was like halloween and the best party you 've ever been to , all wrapped into one . " immigrants take the stage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the immigrantenstadl kicked off three years ago still , despite the lure of scantily-clad hedonists and the beer that flows abundantly , karneval and its sitzungen can make non-germans feel like outsiders due to all the inside jokes about local politics and heavy use of the local dialect . so riccio , along with emcee hektor haarkötter and a host of others , started their own show called the " immigrantenstadl . "
it 's a gala put on for and by immigrants - which in cologne can also mean anyone born outside the city limits . " a bunch of us met with other artists and musicians in a pub in the southern part of the city and talked for hours , making all sorts of plans for a show , " he said .
" after a while , someone asked ' who at this table was actually born in cologne ? '
and then we realized that no one was originally from cologne . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mocking the tricky ö , ü,ä vowels of german is easier than mastering them rather than put on a typical cologne sitzung performed by foreigners , haarkötter said the " immigrantenstadl , " which started three years ago , aims to incorporate aspects of foreign cultures for an international audience . " cologne 's karneval can be a very traditional thing with a lot of very old styles and ways of having a party , " he said .
" we try to innovate by integrating special forms and customs from other countries and other cultures .
we yodel , we wear bavarian and japanese clothes , and we do brazilian samba and turkish folklore skits . " cologne 's large immigrant population there are jazzy numbers in which the performers sing lines like " we 've come to stay , we 're not leaving " - referring to the one in five people living in cologne who has an immigrant background , in an urban population of around 1 million . yet , by being semi-outsiders , performers are able to point out the quirky characteristics among germans - and even themselves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what would cologne do without all its greek immigrants , even if they are philosophers ?
during one immigrantenstadl skit , a turkish-german actor explains that in turkey , when someone wants to steal something , the thief waits until a person leaves his house , sneaks in and grabs the item .
in germany , he quips , a person will go to a home , ring the bell , say " hello , " take the television and leave a receipt for the item on the table . another number shows a romanian actress who tries to discern the future of karneval in her crystal ball . good-humored mockery it 's poking fun at cultural differences in a good-humored , tongue-in-cheek way that makes the show so appealing , said julien , a frenchman who 's lived in cologne for three years .
he claimed that , contrary to the stereotype , germans are able to mock themselves . " there are some very funny pieces in this show and i like the mixture of jokes about germans and immigrants in germany and how they all live here together , " he said .
" there are a lot of taboos surrounding the subject .
in this show , there are no taboos .
it 's great ! " while the typical cologne sitzung is performed in the local kölsch dialect , which immigrants and germans from outside the city alike have difficulty understanding , the singers and actors in the " immigrantenstadl " dole out their mockery of world events in a kaleidoscope of languages , including german , english , turkish , romanian , greek and czech . creating the mood with a beer - or three bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world players like president bush and condi rice are not left unscathed in one funky , hip-hop sketch , a singer in a cowboy hat masquerading as us president george w. bush complains about his work overload in the white house and iraq .
splashing around in a plastic baby pool , he takes comfort in his cozy relationship with secretary of state condoleezza rice . it could be the turkish hip-hop , the greek melodies , the brazilian sambas or the deliberate on-stage mayhem that make the " immigrantenstadl 's " sold-out shows so attractive to both foreigners and locals .
or it could be the chance to take part in a traditional party tilted just far enough off kilter to suit non-traditionalists . " put on a really wacky costume , get yourself in a good mood - although sometimes , if you go to the right place , people can kind of get you into the right mood , " said american riccio , advising newcomers on how to enjoy karneval .
" and of course , i hate to say it , but one or two or three or four kölsch beers do n't hurt either . " louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but they have n't been particularly successful . they could potentially be kingmakers and help andrea ypsilanti , the chairwoman of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in the western german state of hesse , get a majority after a closely contested election in which incumbent roland koch 's christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- won the vote by a wafer-thin margin . but the left party remains an unwanted child in the german political landscape .
though the far-left party is now represented in two state parliaments in western germany , ypsilanti has vowed she will not form a government with them .
and all established parties in germany - whether on the left or right of center - shun the group . left party seen as communist relic for many western germans , the left party is still a relic of former communist east germany , according to tim spier , a political scientist at the institute for party law and research at the university of düsseldorf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prominent faces of germany 's left party - gregor gysi , left , and petra pau forged from the debris of the east german ruling party after reunification in 1990 and known then as the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , the left party reached its present incarnation last year when it was joined by a stream of trade unionists , discontented westerners and social democratic party members unhappy with former chancellor gerhard schröder 's package of far-reaching social security and labor market reforms . the origins of the western side of the party as a splinter movement within the social democratic family have left deep wounds .
while the spd and the left party rule together in the city-state of berlin and have at times cooperated in eastern german states , the social democrats refuse to consider a so-called " red-red " coalition in a western state , let alone at the federal level . " it has to be said that in germany , a part of the left still continues in the tradition of the pds and the additional problem is that we have a remnant of the sed -lsb- the former east german ruling party -rsb- there , " said spier .
" west germans have a problem accepting that . " far-left parties in europe enjoy support the situation is distinctly different in other parts of europe where parties left of social democracy are often part of the mainstream political establishment .
in france , sweden and italy , for instance , such parties have been part of national governments . " in the 1970s there was a long period where many traditional communist parties were much more successful than other parties - for instance in france , " spier said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : outside russia , communist parties also enjoyed support in europe far-left parties in western europe may have emerged from different ideological traditions and have heterogeneous historical roots . " but they can still be considered as part of a larger family of parties , " said spier . a large chunk of these far-left parties were former communist parties who reinvented themselves after the end of the cold war .
others broke away from the communists much earlier , formed maoist splinter groups to an extent , and finally evolved into moderate left-wing groups . the most successful far-left party in europe is the socialist party in the netherlands . " they took 16.6 percent of the vote in the last parliamentary election , " spier said . far-left parties are also well-established in scandinavia , where they enjoy considerable support among voters - around 10 percent .
for instance , denmark 's socialist people 's party , norway 's socialist left party , sweden 's left party and finland 's left alliance are all far-left parties but represent a more ecological and social stance . far-left parties in italy and france too enjoy popular support .
" though these parties present a significantly moderate face , their rhetoric and their names betray their communist legacy , " said spier . reform-friendly social democrats helped rise of far-left in germany , there was no serious force left of the social democrats and the green party for a long time .
the communist party of germany -lrb- kpd -rrb- was relatively strong during the weimar republic between 1919 and 1933 but was later banned in the 1950s .
the newly formed german communist party -lrb- dkp -rrb- did n't manage to overcome its status as a splinter group .
it was only with reunification in 1990 and the transformation of the sed into the pds , that a political force left of the social democrats take shape .
the party needed until 2005 to become a nation-wide political forced to be reckoned with . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair and schröder 's reform-friendly social democracy has fueled the rise of the far-left the rise of far-left parties in europe has largely been thanks to the social democrats , in particular what tony blair referred to as " new labour " and gerhard schröder the " new center . "
the move away from traditional , labor-friendly politics has indeed fueled the march of the far-left . " the social democrats who remained traditional , as in the case of france , managed to marginalize far-left parties , " said spier . on the other hand , those who turned particularly reform-friendly , such as the social democrats in germany , the netherlands and denmark , have lost large chunks of their traditional voter base to the far-left . " a real dilemma " the far-left in some parts of europe has also made it as far as into national governments - in france , sweden , italy and presently in norway .
but such coalitions have rarely been especially successful . in 1998 , the social democratic party in sweden entered a coalition with the left party and the greens .
one result was that support for the far-left quickly eroded . " we do n't regret being part of the coalition , we could certainly air some of our views , " said gudrun utas of sweden 's left party .
" but we did n't have positive experiences . " after four years of being part of the government , her far-left party has managed to attract just 5 percent of the vote - a far cry from their historic high of 12.8 percent in 1998 . " it 's a real dilemma , " said spier .
" at first , the far-left in sweden profited from the social democrats ' move to the center .
but once they took on governing responsibilities , the far-left lost its halo - as well as votes . "
at the same time , the social democrats won the majority it needed to govern thanks to the far-left . the swedish example may hold lessons for andrea ypsilanti .
depending on the outcome of coalition talks among hesse 's parties , she may yet change her mind and get the left party on board after all in order to gain that magic majority . sejla didic -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they are faced with drunken , costume-clad karneval enthusiasts singing - and staggering - their way down the streets and partaking in the sort of debauchery they 'll never admit to once the celebrations have come to a close . part of the festival traditions are the sitzungen .
literally " sessions " or " sittings , " the more traditional ones are gala events ; the smaller , more alternatives ones resemble comedy or variety shows composed of skits with performers making liberal use of song and dance to mock politicians , each other and themselves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bit of samba spices up karneval for american singer and actress victoria riccio , who came to germany nearly 20 years ago , the introduction to a sitzung was a shocker . " when i first came here , i went to one of these events and did n't understand a word , but at one point , the people on stage took off all their clothes and jumped around naked , " she said .
" i thought ' oh my god , where have i landed ? '
i loved it right away .

" immigrants take the stage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the immigrantenstadl kicked off three years ago still , despite the lure of scantily-clad hedonists and the beer that flows abundantly , karneval and its sitzungen can make non-germans feel like outsiders due to all the inside jokes about local politics and heavy use of the local dialect . so riccio , along with emcee hektor haarkötter and a host of others , started their own show called the " immigrantenstadl . "
it 's a gala put on for and by immigrants - which in cologne can also mean anyone born outside the city limits . " a bunch of us met with other artists and musicians in a pub in the southern part of the city and talked for hours , making all sorts of plans for a show , " he said .
" after a while , someone asked ' who at this table was actually born in cologne ? '
and then we realized that no one was originally from cologne . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mocking the tricky ö , ü,ä vowels of german is easier than mastering them rather than put on a typical cologne sitzung performed by foreigners , haarkötter said the " immigrantenstadl , " which started three years ago , aims to incorporate aspects of foreign cultures for an international audience . " cologne 's karneval can be a very traditional thing with a lot of very old styles and ways of having a party , " he said .
" we try to innovate by integrating special forms and customs from other countries and other cultures .
we yodel , we wear bavarian and japanese clothes , and we do brazilian samba and turkish folklore skits . " cologne 's large immigrant population there are jazzy numbers in which the performers sing lines like " we 've come to stay , we 're not leaving " - referring to the one in five people living in cologne who has an immigrant background , in an urban population of around 1 million . yet , by being semi-outsiders , performers are able to point out the quirky characteristics among germans - and even themselves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what would cologne do without all its greek immigrants , even if they are philosophers ?
during one immigrantenstadl skit , a turkish-german actor explains that in turkey , when someone wants to steal something , the thief waits until a person leaves his house , sneaks in and grabs the item .
in germany , he quips , a person will go to a home , ring the bell , say " hello , " take the television and leave a receipt for the item on the table . another number shows a romanian actress who tries to discern the future of karneval in her crystal ball . good-humored mockery it 's poking fun at cultural differences in a good-humored , tongue-in-cheek way that makes the show so appealing , said julien , a frenchman who 's lived in cologne for three years .

" there are a lot of taboos surrounding the subject .
in this show , there are no taboos .
it 's great ! " while the typical cologne sitzung is performed in the local kölsch dialect , which immigrants and germans from outside the city alike have difficulty understanding , the singers and actors in the " immigrantenstadl " dole out their mockery of world events in a kaleidoscope of languages , including german , english , turkish , romanian , greek and czech . creating the mood with a beer - or three bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world players like president bush and condi rice are not left unscathed in one funky , hip-hop sketch , a singer in a cowboy hat masquerading as us president george w. bush complains about his work overload in the white house and iraq .

it 's a gala put on for and by immigrants - which in cologne can also mean anyone born outside the city limits . " a bunch of us met with other artists and musicians in a pub in the southern part of the city and talked for hours , making all sorts of plans for a show , " he said .
" after a while , someone asked ' who at this table was actually born in cologne ? '
and then we realized that no one was originally from cologne . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mocking the tricky ö , ü,ä vowels of german is easier than mastering them rather than put on a typical cologne sitzung performed by foreigners , haarkötter said the " immigrantenstadl , " which started three years ago , aims to incorporate aspects of foreign cultures for an international audience . " cologne 's karneval can be a very traditional thing with a lot of very old styles and ways of having a party , " he said .
" we try to innovate by integrating special forms and customs from other countries and other cultures .
we yodel , we wear bavarian and japanese clothes , and we do brazilian samba and turkish folklore skits . " cologne 's large immigrant population there are jazzy numbers in which the performers sing lines like " we 've come to stay , we 're not leaving " - referring to the one in five people living in cologne who has an immigrant background , in an urban population of around 1 million . yet , by being semi-outsiders , performers are able to point out the quirky characteristics among germans - and even themselves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what would cologne do without all its greek immigrants , even if they are philosophers ?
during one immigrantenstadl skit , a turkish-german actor explains that in turkey , when someone wants to steal something , the thief waits until a person leaves his house , sneaks in and grabs the item .
in germany , he quips , a person will go to a home , ring the bell , say " hello , " take the television and leave a receipt for the item on the table . another number shows a romanian actress who tries to discern the future of karneval in her crystal ball . good-humored mockery it 's poking fun at cultural differences in a good-humored , tongue-in-cheek way that makes the show so appealing , said julien , a frenchman who 's lived in cologne for three years .
he claimed that , contrary to the stereotype , germans are able to mock themselves . " there are some very funny pieces in this show and i like the mixture of jokes about germans and immigrants in germany and how they all live here together , " he said .
" there are a lot of taboos surrounding the subject .
in this show , there are no taboos .
it 's great ! " while the typical cologne sitzung is performed in the local kölsch dialect , which immigrants and germans from outside the city alike have difficulty understanding , the singers and actors in the " immigrantenstadl " dole out their mockery of world events in a kaleidoscope of languages , including german , english , turkish , romanian , greek and czech . creating the mood with a beer - or three bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world players like president bush and condi rice are not left unscathed in one funky , hip-hop sketch , a singer in a cowboy hat masquerading as us president george w. bush complains about his work overload in the white house and iraq .
splashing around in a plastic baby pool , he takes comfort in his cozy relationship with secretary of state condoleezza rice . it could be the turkish hip-hop , the greek melodies , the brazilian sambas or the deliberate on-stage mayhem that make the " immigrantenstadl 's " sold-out shows so attractive to both foreigners and locals .
or it could be the chance to take part in a traditional party tilted just far enough off kilter to suit non-traditionalists . " put on a really wacky costume , get yourself in a good mood - although sometimes , if you go to the right place , people can kind of get you into the right mood , " said american riccio , advising newcomers on how to enjoy karneval .
" and of course , i hate to say it , but one or two or three or four kölsch beers do n't hurt either . " louisa schaefer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the us central bank has cut interest rates aggressively and the us congress is planning an economic stimulus package to prevent a recession .
economic growth in the past few years the us economy has been growing strongly .
but recent troubles in the housing and credit markets have hit the economy hard , with growth slowing sharply at the end of 2007 .
economic forecasts suggest that the us growth in 2008 could be cut by half to about 1.5 % .
inflation the us economy is also facing significant inflationary pressures because of record oil prices which have pushed up the price of petrol and heating oil .
while the fed does not have an explicit inflation target , inflation above 2 % is normally enough to set off the danger signals .
however , core inflation has been more contained , and asset prices like housing and stocks have been falling .
unemployment so far the economic slowdown has not led to a big rise in unemployment , but job growth has slowed to a crawl .

fed rate cuts the us central bank , the federal reserve , has aggressively cut rates in 2008 to ward off a recession .

budget deficit the bush administration and the us congress have moved quickly to agree a $ 150bn temporary stimulus package to help boost economic growth .

the huge us trade deficit , and lower us interest rates , have made the dollar less attractive to investors .
the weaker dollar will hurt countries which depend on exports to the us , because their goods will become more expensive , and could boost us inflation .

mr giuliani announced he was giving his support to arizona senator john mccain , describing him as " an american hero " .
arnold schwarzenegger , california governor , will later endorse mr mccain .
earlier , democrat john edwards left the race , without backing any of his rivals , after failing to win a single party nomination contest .
mr edwards contested iowa , new hampshire , nevada and his native south carolina , but only in iowa did he get higher than third place , and that only by the narrowest of margins .
he told supporters in new orleans , where he launched his latest white house bid in 2006 : " it 's time for me to step aside so that history can blaze its path . "
his endorsement could be crucial in the tight race between the two remaining democratic candidates , hillary clinton and barack obama .
heated debate mr giuliani announced his withdrawal just before the remaining republican candidates began a televised debate at the reagan library in simi valley , california , on wednesday .
with the two other candidates - former arkansas governor mike huckabee and texas congressman ron paul - often struggling to be heard , the 90-minute debate was dominated by the verbal jousting of the two front-runners .
the republican debate saw tense exchanges between candidates former massachusetts governor mitt romney accused mr mccain of " dirty tricks " for accusing him - just before tuesday 's florida primary - of supporting a date for withdrawing troops from iraq .
" it 's offensive to me that someone would suggest that i have , " said mr romney .
mr romney said mr mccain was out of the conservative mainstream , having twice voted against president george w bush 's tax cuts , which the republican establishment had embraced .
mr mccain countered that he was proud of his conservative credentials , and questioned mr romney 's administrative record in massachusetts .
" his job creation was the third worst in the country , " said the arizona senator .
the simmering tensions were indicative of the pressure that is building ahead of next week 's " super tuesday " , when 24 states hold their nominating votes in what could be a decisive day in the race to succeed mr bush .
rudy 's gamble in contrast to the heated exchanges in simi valley , mr giuliani 's address was light-hearted .
he said he had thought he was the sort of person who had the qualities to make a good president of the united states , " but the voters made a different choice " .
" john mccain is the most qualified candidate to be the next commander in chief of the united states , " mr giuliani said .
" he 's an american hero and america could use heroes in the white house . "
florida primary : results republicans john mccain : 36 % mitt romney : 31 % rudy giuliani : 15 % mike huckabee : 13 % ron paul : 3 % democrats hillary clinton : 50 % barack obama : 33 % john edwards : 14 % with 99 % of vote counted profile : rudy giuliani double exit focuses race q & a : us primary elections he added that mr mccain was a long-standing friend and that he would campaign alongside him whenever and wherever he was needed .
mr mccain returned the compliments , praising mr giuliani 's leadership as mayor in the wake of the attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 .
he described his former rival as " my strong right arm and my partner " .
" this man is a national hero and i 'm honoured by his friendship , " he said .
mr giuliani was seen by his supporters as a tough commander-in-chief , while other republicans were wary of his attitude on social issues like abortion .
when he entered the race more than a year ago , he led some national polls and had an impressive war chest .
he is reported to have spent up to a million dollars a week on tv advertising in florida alone .
correspondents say his decision to focus his efforts on florida was always going to be either a stroke of political genius or an unwise gamble that would see him fall at the first hurdle .
mr giuliani won 15 % of the vote , behind mr mccain with 36 % and mitt romney with 31 % , and just ahead of mike huckabee , who won 13 % .

mr giuliani announced he was giving his support to arizona senator john mccain , describing him as " an american hero " .
arnold schwarzenegger , california governor , will later endorse mr mccain .
earlier , democrat john edwards left the race , without backing any of his rivals , after failing to win a single party nomination contest .
mr edwards contested iowa , new hampshire , nevada and his native south carolina , but only in iowa did he get higher than third place , and that only by the narrowest of margins .
he told supporters in new orleans , where he launched his latest white house bid in 2006 : " it 's time for me to step aside so that history can blaze its path . "
his endorsement could be crucial in the tight race between the two remaining democratic candidates , hillary clinton and barack obama .
heated debate mr giuliani announced his withdrawal just before the remaining republican candidates began a televised debate at the reagan library in simi valley , california , on wednesday .
with the two other candidates - former arkansas governor mike huckabee and texas congressman ron paul - often struggling to be heard , the 90-minute debate was dominated by the verbal jousting of the two front-runners .
the republican debate saw tense exchanges between candidates former massachusetts governor mitt romney accused mr mccain of " dirty tricks " for accusing him - just before tuesday 's florida primary - of supporting a date for withdrawing troops from iraq .
" it 's offensive to me that someone would suggest that i have , " said mr romney .
mr romney said mr mccain was out of the conservative mainstream , having twice voted against president george w bush 's tax cuts , which the republican establishment had embraced .
mr mccain countered that he was proud of his conservative credentials , and questioned mr romney 's administrative record in massachusetts .
" his job creation was the third worst in the country , " said the arizona senator .
the simmering tensions were indicative of the pressure that is building ahead of next week 's " super tuesday " , when 24 states hold their nominating votes in what could be a decisive day in the race to succeed mr bush .
rudy 's gamble in contrast to the heated exchanges in simi valley , mr giuliani 's address was light-hearted .
he said he had thought he was the sort of person who had the qualities to make a good president of the united states , " but the voters made a different choice " .
" john mccain is the most qualified candidate to be the next commander in chief of the united states , " mr giuliani said .
" he 's an american hero and america could use heroes in the white house . "
florida primary : results republicans john mccain : 36 % mitt romney : 31 % rudy giuliani : 15 % mike huckabee : 13 % ron paul : 3 % democrats hillary clinton : 50 % barack obama : 33 % john edwards : 14 % with 99 % of vote counted profile : rudy giuliani double exit focuses race q & a : us primary elections he added that mr mccain was a long-standing friend and that he would campaign alongside him whenever and wherever he was needed .
mr mccain returned the compliments , praising mr giuliani 's leadership as mayor in the wake of the attacks on the us on 11 september 2001 .
he described his former rival as " my strong right arm and my partner " .
" this man is a national hero and i 'm honoured by his friendship , " he said .
mr giuliani was seen by his supporters as a tough commander-in-chief , while other republicans were wary of his attitude on social issues like abortion .
when he entered the race more than a year ago , he led some national polls and had an impressive war chest .
he is reported to have spent up to a million dollars a week on tv advertising in florida alone .
correspondents say his decision to focus his efforts on florida was always going to be either a stroke of political genius or an unwise gamble that would see him fall at the first hurdle .
mr giuliani won 15 % of the vote , behind mr mccain with 36 % and mitt romney with 31 % , and just ahead of mike huckabee , who won 13 % .

the boy was taken two hours after he was born to the 18-year-old , who had just left the care of nottingham social services .
hours later , mr justice munby at the high court said no baby could be removed " as the result of a decision taken by officials in some room " .
the woman 's solicitor stuart luke said she would lodge a claim for damages .
' birth plan ' he said she faced the prospect of " an application by the local authority social services for an interim care order , which will be vigorously contested " .
mr justice munby said that without the appropriate order and given that the mother was still in hospital , mother and child should be reunited .
describing the situation as " most unfortunate " , he said officials involved in the case " should have known better " .
the boy was born healthy and taken from his mother about two hours after his birth without an order having been made .
mr luke , from the firm bhatia best , said : " mother and child were reunited 46 minutes after mr justice munby 's order at 1209 -lrb- gmt -rrb- . "
hospital staff were apparently shown a " birth plan " prepared by local authority social services .
' unfortunate removal ' the plan said the mother , who had a troubled childhood and suffered from mental health problems , was to be separated from the child , and no contact allowed without supervision by social workers .
the judge said the removal of a child could only be lawful if a police constable was taking action to protect a child , or there was a court order in place .
mr luke said the mother would be making a claim for damages against social services officials " arising out of the unfortunate removal of her child without lawful authority shortly after his birth " .
the judge ordered the council to prepare a comprehensive plan setting out their proposals to assist the mother as she had recently left local authority care , by no later than 8 february .

the boy was taken two hours after he was born to the 18-year-old , who had just left the care of nottingham social services .
hours later , mr justice munby at the high court said no baby could be removed " as the result of a decision taken by officials in some room " .
the woman 's solicitor stuart luke said she would lodge a claim for damages .
' birth plan ' he said she faced the prospect of " an application by the local authority social services for an interim care order , which will be vigorously contested " .
mr justice munby said that without the appropriate order and given that the mother was still in hospital , mother and child should be reunited .
describing the situation as " most unfortunate " , he said officials involved in the case " should have known better " .
the boy was born healthy and taken from his mother about two hours after his birth without an order having been made .
mr luke , from the firm bhatia best , said : " mother and child were reunited 46 minutes after mr justice munby 's order at 1209 -lrb- gmt -rrb- . "
hospital staff were apparently shown a " birth plan " prepared by local authority social services .
' unfortunate removal ' the plan said the mother , who had a troubled childhood and suffered from mental health problems , was to be separated from the child , and no contact allowed without supervision by social workers .
the judge said the removal of a child could only be lawful if a police constable was taking action to protect a child , or there was a court order in place .
mr luke said the mother would be making a claim for damages against social services officials " arising out of the unfortunate removal of her child without lawful authority shortly after his birth " .
the judge ordered the council to prepare a comprehensive plan setting out their proposals to assist the mother as she had recently left local authority care , by no later than 8 february .

the boy was taken two hours after he was born to the 18-year-old , who had just left the care of nottingham social services .
hours later , mr justice munby at the high court said no baby could be removed " as the result of a decision taken by officials in some room " .
the woman 's solicitor stuart luke said she would lodge a claim for damages .
' birth plan ' he said she faced the prospect of " an application by the local authority social services for an interim care order , which will be vigorously contested " .
mr justice munby said that without the appropriate order and given that the mother was still in hospital , mother and child should be reunited .
describing the situation as " most unfortunate " , he said officials involved in the case " should have known better " .
the boy was born healthy and taken from his mother about two hours after his birth without an order having been made .
mr luke , from the firm bhatia best , said : " mother and child were reunited 46 minutes after mr justice munby 's order at 1209 -lrb- gmt -rrb- . "
hospital staff were apparently shown a " birth plan " prepared by local authority social services .
' unfortunate removal ' the plan said the mother , who had a troubled childhood and suffered from mental health problems , was to be separated from the child , and no contact allowed without supervision by social workers .
the judge said the removal of a child could only be lawful if a police constable was taking action to protect a child , or there was a court order in place .
mr luke said the mother would be making a claim for damages against social services officials " arising out of the unfortunate removal of her child without lawful authority shortly after his birth " .
the judge ordered the council to prepare a comprehensive plan setting out their proposals to assist the mother as she had recently left local authority care , by no later than 8 february .

the most extensive delays are seen on the route from eastwood to nottingham along the a610 , where journey times more than doubled during peak hours .
other traffic hotspots include the a6 north near alvaston in derby and the a607 melton road and the a426 in blaby .
councillors will look at the results and decide what action to take .
the £ 400,000 survey was funded by the department of transport and used data from 180 motorists who were fitted with satellite tracking devices .
derby , leicester and nottingham all experience similar levels of peak time congestion nicholas rushton , leicestershire county council nottingham councillor brian parbutt said the survey could lead to possible congestion charging - but the city 's preferred option is still a tax on workplace parking spaces .
but leicestershire county councillor nick rushton said it does not automatically mean they will bring in congestion charging .
the survey found the worst-affected areas were " radial routes running in and out of the three main cities of nottingham , leicester and derby , particularly on city ring roads " .
' peak time ' the 4.5-mile journey into nottingham , from ruddington on the a60 from the south , takes 8.5 minutes longer during the morning peak hour than it would when the roads are clear .
nicholas rushton , cabinet member for transport at leicestershire county council , said : " it importantly shows that derby , leicester and nottingham all experience similar levels of peak time congestion . "
the areas covered by the survey included greater nottingham , leicester city , derby city , the towns of belper , heanor , ripley , ilkeston , long eaton and sandiacre in derbyshire and ashby de la zouch , coalville , loughborough , melton mowbray and hinckley in leicestershire .

nicholas rushton , cabinet member for transport at leicestershire county council , said : " it importantly shows that derby , leicester and nottingham all experience similar levels of peak time congestion . "
the areas covered by the survey included greater nottingham , leicester city , derby city , the towns of belper , heanor , ripley , ilkeston , long eaton and sandiacre in derbyshire and ashby de la zouch , coalville , loughborough , melton mowbray and hinckley in leicestershire .

mr giuliani 's response on 11 september 2001 made him a hero to many mr giuliani was mayor of new york at the time , and immediately won praise for his determined response to the tragedy .
on the strength of his heroic reputation , " america 's mayor " - as admirers called him - decided to seek the republican party 's nomination for the 2008 presidential election .
but he dropped out of the race when his gamble to focus on big-prize states failed to pay off , wasting an early lead in the polls .
top official mr giuliani , a native new yorker , was born in brooklyn in 1944 , the grandson of italian immigrants .
he began his career as a lawyer , working mostly in government .
he was a top justice department official under ronald reagan in the early 1980s , before returning to new york as a public prosecutor .
he targeted top mafia figures - including the heads of new york 's so-called five families , whom mr giuliani said he intended to " wipe out " - and corrupt wall street traders ivan boesky and michael milken .
rudy giuliani born 28 may 1944 in brooklyn , new york us attorney for the southern district of new york , 1983-1989 mayor of new york city , 1994-2001 time magazine person of the year , honorary knighthood mr giuliani first ran for mayor of new york in 1989 , running as a republican in a heavily democratic city and losing by a razor-thin margin .
he was successful on his second attempt , defeating incumbent david dinkins in 1993 .
as was perhaps to be expected given his background as a prosecutor , mr giuliani set out to bring new york crime under control as mayor .
he instituted controversial policies such as " zero-tolerance policing " , under which even the smallest of offences were prosecuted in order to inculcate respect for the law .
at one point tens of thousands of people were suing the new york police department over alleged abuse by officers .
the city 's crime rate did fall during his tenure , for which he takes credit .
critics say the drop in crime was due to broader social factors such as an improving economy .
he was elected to a second term in 1997 , and , barred by law from running for a third term , considered running for senate in 2000 against hillary clinton , then the outgoing first lady .
a combination of factors including a messy divorce and prostate cancer led mr giuliani to withdraw from the senate race before it had got far .
leadership mr giuliani 's final term as mayor was drawing to a close when 11 september 2001 dawned .
his leadership on the day and in the aftermath of the attacks made him a hero to many .
time magazine named him its man of the year for 2001 , and queen elizabeth ii presented him with an honorary knighthood .
of course , even then he had his doubters - including veteran new york reporters wayne barrett and dan collins , who wrote a highly critical study called grand illusion .
they charged that bad decision-making before 11 september led to more deaths than necessary when the city came under attack .
he was accused of racing to reopen lower manhattan too quickly , before air quality was safe enough .
some new york firefighters have attacked his leadership too .
but such criticism did little to dent mr giuliani 's popularity .
after leaving office in late 2001 , the former mayor pursued a successful consulting career , while nurturing political ambitions .
flawed strategy in 2007 , mr giuliani staked his presidential hopes on his image as a tough leader and his law-and-order conservatism - even though he is comparatively liberal on some social issues .
throughout that year he was a front-runner for the republican nomination in national polls .
however , his strategy of leaving campaigning in early primary states iowa and new hampshire largely to his rivals while focusing on big states went disastrously wrong .
he dropped out of the race after coming third in the florida primary in late january , and endorsed his main rival , fellow republican moderate john mccain .
it was always dubious whether social conservatives would back mr giuliani , given his history of supporting abortion rights and gun control , both anathema to many republicans .
he is also on his third marriage , to a nurse with whom he began an affair while married to his second wife , a potential sticking point for social conservatives .

rudy giuliani born 28 may 1944 in brooklyn , new york us attorney for the southern district of new york , 1983-1989 mayor of new york city , 1994-2001 time magazine person of the year , honorary knighthood mr giuliani first ran for mayor of new york in 1989 , running as a republican in a heavily democratic city and losing by a razor-thin margin .
he was successful on his second attempt , defeating incumbent david dinkins in 1993 .
as was perhaps to be expected given his background as a prosecutor , mr giuliani set out to bring new york crime under control as mayor .
he instituted controversial policies such as " zero-tolerance policing " , under which even the smallest of offences were prosecuted in order to inculcate respect for the law .
at one point tens of thousands of people were suing the new york police department over alleged abuse by officers .
the city 's crime rate did fall during his tenure , for which he takes credit .
critics say the drop in crime was due to broader social factors such as an improving economy .
he was elected to a second term in 1997 , and , barred by law from running for a third term , considered running for senate in 2000 against hillary clinton , then the outgoing first lady .
a combination of factors including a messy divorce and prostate cancer led mr giuliani to withdraw from the senate race before it had got far .
leadership mr giuliani 's final term as mayor was drawing to a close when 11 september 2001 dawned .
his leadership on the day and in the aftermath of the attacks made him a hero to many .
time magazine named him its man of the year for 2001 , and queen elizabeth ii presented him with an honorary knighthood .
of course , even then he had his doubters - including veteran new york reporters wayne barrett and dan collins , who wrote a highly critical study called grand illusion .
they charged that bad decision-making before 11 september led to more deaths than necessary when the city came under attack .
he was accused of racing to reopen lower manhattan too quickly , before air quality was safe enough .
some new york firefighters have attacked his leadership too .
but such criticism did little to dent mr giuliani 's popularity .
after leaving office in late 2001 , the former mayor pursued a successful consulting career , while nurturing political ambitions .
flawed strategy in 2007 , mr giuliani staked his presidential hopes on his image as a tough leader and his law-and-order conservatism - even though he is comparatively liberal on some social issues .
throughout that year he was a front-runner for the republican nomination in national polls .
however , his strategy of leaving campaigning in early primary states iowa and new hampshire largely to his rivals while focusing on big states went disastrously wrong .
he dropped out of the race after coming third in the florida primary in late january , and endorsed his main rival , fellow republican moderate john mccain .
it was always dubious whether social conservatives would back mr giuliani , given his history of supporting abortion rights and gun control , both anathema to many republicans .
he is also on his third marriage , to a nurse with whom he began an affair while married to his second wife , a potential sticking point for social conservatives .

rhodri glyn thomas estimates the cost to wales will be about £ 70m between 2009 and 2012 , and the impact will be felt for years to come .
he has written to his westminster counterpart voicing his concern .
it comes after the arts council for wales -lrb- acw -rrb- said it may lose £ 8m from its budget because of the 2012 games .
in a letter written earlier this month to james purnell - who was then culture secretary - mr thomas said the cuts would have a devastating impact on small community groups throughout wales and many worthwhile projects would be put at risk .
there is a growing perception that wales is paying an unfair price for an event that will primarily benefit london and south east england rhodri glyn thomas in the letter obtained by bbc wales , he said : " the increased contribution from the national lottery announced in march 2007 means that wales stands to lose in the region of £ 70m in lottery funding between 2009 and 2012 .
" the effects are already being felt as distributors in wales begin to plan for reduced budgets , at a time when income from the national lottery is already falling .
" despite assurances about a return of investment from the sale of land after the games , the impact will continue to be felt for years to come and it will take considerable time for wales to recover . "
he went on : " there is a growing perception that wales is paying an unfair price for an event that will primarily benefit london and south east england .
mr thomas said he was " deeply concerned " and stood by his statement to the commons select committee which opposed any further contribution to the 2012 olympic and paralympic games from the lottery .
details of mr thomas 's worries come a day after it was revealed a third of the money usually given to the acw from lottery funding is being lost to the olympics .
one of the organisations affected by the immediate budget cuts is st donat 's arts centre near llantwit major in the vale of glamorgan .
it will lose its £ 45,000 annual grant - a fifth of its annual income .
the centre says could lead to it closing with the loss of three full-time and 12 part-time jobs , as well as ending its annual international storytelling festival .
meanwhile , a report from the auditor general , published on thursday , said the acw was improving arts facilities across the country .

mbia made a net loss of $ 2.3bn -lrb- £ 1.15bn -rrb- in the quarter ending 31 december .

firms like mbia are known as monolines , and are at the centre of the sub-prime crisis .

it is the first prime ministerial visit to the mountainous state in more than 10 years .
it is a particularly sensitive trip because neighbouring china , which borders the state , refuses to recognise india 's sovereignty there .
mr singh was in beijing recently as a guest of the chinese leaders .
ties between the countries have warmed .
but the timing of mr singh 's visit to the remote indian state probably is n't a coincidence .
indian officials have been concerned by recent chinese statements about the border dispute , which has festered for more than four decades since the two countries fought a brief war in 1962 .
now mr singh is signalling the indian intention to speed up the development of arunachal pradesh .
he will inaugurate a big hydro-electric scheme , as well as several road and rail projects .
economic relations between india and china are booming , but other issues are holding back the strengthening of relations between the two rising powers of asia .
negotiations have been proceeding quietly for some years now on how to resolve disagreements all along their shared border .
but there are n't that many signs of real progress .
