program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de political parties -pipe- 15.10.2008 left party chooses tv detective as presidential candidate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actor peter sodann is hoping to swap his role as a tv detective for that of german president germany 's left party has voted to send tv actor peter sodann up against more experienced political opponents as its candidate in the coming campaign for president . ronald reagan managed to put a hollywood career behind him to become the leader of the free world and arnold schwarzenegger has more recently swapped his role as an ultra-violent cyborg for that of the environmentally-friendly overseer of the biggest state economy in the united states .
as a result of this foresight in seeing political capital in promoting entertainers to public office , actors-stroke-politicians have grown in credibility .
the success of reagan and schwarzenegger must have featured in the thought process which led to the left party 's decision tuesday , oct .
13 , to send television detective peter sodann up against incumbent horst koehler and social democratic challenger gesine schwan in the campaign to become germany 's next president .
swapping crime drama for politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sodann , left , in his role as kommissar ehrlicher in tatort sodann , better known among tv fans as kommissar ehrlicher in the german cult crime series tatort , was once considered a candidate for the bundestag for the left party 's former incarnation , the pds , in the 2005 parliamentary election .
however , he withdrew from the campaign only two days after announcing he would run - the reason being that his television paymasters would refuse to consider him for future roles .
while an unusual choice on the surface , sodann has some experience in dealing with political power .
one of east germany 's most popular actors , sodann was incarcerated for two years by the east german communist regime in the 1960s for directing a student theater whose program was defined as being " counter revolutionary . "
he served nine months of his sentence before being released from prison .
the actor , who featured in 45 episodes of tatort between 1991 and 2007 , has little realistic chance of winning .
however , while the left party must know it is effectively making up the numbers by putting forward sodann as their candidate , the publicity will no doubt raise the party 's profile even further at a time when it is making gains on the fractured social democrats and embattled christian democratic union ahead of september 2009 parliamentary elections .
left party looking for boosts to popularity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hanna schygulla was also considered by the left party sodann 's candidacy is not the first attempt by the left party to install an entertainer in the position of germany 's most prominent diplomat .
hanna schygulla , a protagonist in a number of films by director rainer werner fassbinder , was also considered as a candidate before being rejected by a party vote .
sodann will stand against koehler , the conservative incumbent , and spd 's schwan in the vote on may 23 when an assembly of lawmakers and state delegates elect the president .
at present , koehler appears to have just enough support to win re-election , while schwan would need left party votes to have any chance of winning .
it is unclear whether the party would support her if sodann is eliminated in an early round of voting . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

14 , secured 200 million euros -lrb- $ 270 million -rrb- from each of the central banks in neighboring norway and denmark , but talks to secure a much larger loan from russia continued .
icelandic officials arrived in moscow on tuesday for talks , though geir haarde , iceland 's prime minister said the size of any loan from russia had not been decided .
" we look at this as a non-political deal , if there is to be a deal , " he said .
" i do n't know of any particular political strings that the russians would want to attach to this . "
on a third front , iceland is also in discussions with the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , though haarde said the country has not formally requested a loan .
if it does , it would become the first western european country to turn to the imf since 1976 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland 's prime minister geir haarde " we 're entitled to their services like everybody else but there is no decision on behalf of the government as to whether or not to apply for a loan , " haarde said .
" and there is no decision on behalf of the imf as to what kind of conditionality would be involved . "
the imf has sent a delegation to evaluate the situation in iceland , in a process which haarde has described as " friendly . "
" it 's not like the imf is here to take over the country , " he said .
rescuing a stricken economy iceland has been badly affected by the financial turmoil , which has resulted in its main commercial banks being nationalized by the state .
its currency has been severely weakened , and the local stock exchange was shut down for three days .
trading resumed on tuesday , but the day ended badly , with the omx iceland 15 index falling by 77 percent .
the icelandic index has lost 89 percent of its value this year , making it the worst performing stock exchange globally .
despite the grim economic realities , iceland 's president said tuesday that the tiny country is well positioned to recover , and can serve as a model on how to tackle the energy and climate change challenges .
" in the current global financial hurricane , iceland and others have been reminded , to use an analogy , that when a hurricane passes over the ocean toward the powerful mainland it usually crosses small islands where the destruction can be substantial , " olafur ragnar grimsson said in a video address to a united nations seminar on small states .
he said that experience has shown that " small states , due to their flexibility and the closely knit networks of cooperation which characterize their societies , can recover surprisingly quickly . "
iceland is currently campaigning for a two-year seat on the un security council , competing with austria and turkey for the two seats reserved for european states .
on friday , the un general assembly will elect five new members to replace the nations whose terms expire at the end of this year .
though iceland is considered a european country , it is not a member of the european union .
in the wake of the country 's near financial collapse , however , some politicians are raising the idea of joining the eu in order to safeguard the economy . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

here are some of the most important terms to know to understand the scope of the crisis . asset backed securities -lrb- abs -rrb- : a debt security collateralized by specific assets .
although the term applies to any debt backed by identified assets , it generally refers to securities backed by short- term collateral such as credit-card receivables , car loans , and home- equity loans .
credit crunch : since banks are now leery about lending money to one another , there is less money available for making consumer loans .
some companies have also begun to complain about problems in securing loans .
deposit insurance : a government guarantee on individual savings up to a certain monetary level , though some nations have opted to provide unlimited guarantees , regardless of the amount of savings held .

14 , secured 200 million euros -lrb- $ 270 million -rrb- from each of the central banks in neighboring norway and denmark , but talks to secure a much larger loan from russia continued .
icelandic officials arrived in moscow on tuesday for talks , though geir haarde , iceland 's prime minister said the size of any loan from russia had not been decided .
" we look at this as a non-political deal , if there is to be a deal , " he said .
" i do n't know of any particular political strings that the russians would want to attach to this . "
on a third front , iceland is also in discussions with the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , though haarde said the country has not formally requested a loan .
if it does , it would become the first western european country to turn to the imf since 1976 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland 's prime minister geir haarde " we 're entitled to their services like everybody else but there is no decision on behalf of the government as to whether or not to apply for a loan , " haarde said .
" and there is no decision on behalf of the imf as to what kind of conditionality would be involved . "
the imf has sent a delegation to evaluate the situation in iceland , in a process which haarde has described as " friendly . "
" it 's not like the imf is here to take over the country , " he said .
rescuing a stricken economy iceland has been badly affected by the financial turmoil , which has resulted in its main commercial banks being nationalized by the state .
its currency has been severely weakened , and the local stock exchange was shut down for three days .
trading resumed on tuesday , but the day ended badly , with the omx iceland 15 index falling by 77 percent .
the icelandic index has lost 89 percent of its value this year , making it the worst performing stock exchange globally .
despite the grim economic realities , iceland 's president said tuesday that the tiny country is well positioned to recover , and can serve as a model on how to tackle the energy and climate change challenges .
" in the current global financial hurricane , iceland and others have been reminded , to use an analogy , that when a hurricane passes over the ocean toward the powerful mainland it usually crosses small islands where the destruction can be substantial , " olafur ragnar grimsson said in a video address to a united nations seminar on small states .
he said that experience has shown that " small states , due to their flexibility and the closely knit networks of cooperation which characterize their societies , can recover surprisingly quickly . "
iceland is currently campaigning for a two-year seat on the un security council , competing with austria and turkey for the two seats reserved for european states .
on friday , the un general assembly will elect five new members to replace the nations whose terms expire at the end of this year .
though iceland is considered a european country , it is not a member of the european union .

even bavaria , germany 's largest state which had been initially opposed to the plan , signalled its support .
the state 's finance minister erwin huber told the national news broadcaster ard , " i do n't want to see the -lrb- bailout plan -rrb- fall through . "
the federal government expects the 16 regional states to cough up 35 percent of the cost , which combines an injection of capital with loan guarantees .
german finance minister peer steinbrueck is meeting with his regional counterparts this week to discuss details of the rescue plan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister peer steinbrueck -lrb- right -rrb- and leftist political rivals work together germany is under an international obligation to do its share in regulating the turbulence caused by world financial markets , according to a constitutional clause of a federal reform law in 2006 .
the bundesrat is likely to formally vote on the immediate implementation of the rescue package this friday .
some say states ' burden is unfair bavarian finance minister huber , however , did slam the federal government for pushing some of the burden onto the states .
" the nation calls the shots and the states pay the bill .
this is not exactly fair play , " he said .
huber , who was recently forced out as the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- party leader after bavarian state elections last month , claimed that the states face a double burden since they are solely responsible for bailing out and insuring regional banks and savings institutions as well .
the premier of the tiny south-western state of saarland , peter mueller , said that state participation in a federal bailout was inevitable with both state and federal interests intertwined . " we need solidarity on this issue , " said mueller in a interview with the broadcaster deutschlandradio kultur .
bailout makes bedfellows of political rivals other regions such as the heavily populated industrial state north rhine-westphalia and the south-western state baden-wuerttemberg , which is home to automakers such as bmw and daimler , concur .
even berlin 's economic deputy harald wolf of the opposition left party told the german media : " the states have no choice but to support the federal plan . "
among the conservatives , lower saxony 's finance minister hartmut moellring -lrb- cdu -rrb- told a regional broadcaster that the states needed to do their share in risky propositions , but also needed to take a lead role in transactions involving billions of euros .
norbert roettgen , the parliamentary leader of chancellor angela merkel 's governing christian democrat coalition , said it 's a given that the states fulfil their financial obligations .

14 , secured 200 million euros -lrb- $ 270 million -rrb- from each of the central banks in neighboring norway and denmark , but talks to secure a much larger loan from russia continued .
icelandic officials arrived in moscow on tuesday for talks , though geir haarde , iceland 's prime minister said the size of any loan from russia had not been decided .
" we look at this as a non-political deal , if there is to be a deal , " he said .
" i do n't know of any particular political strings that the russians would want to attach to this . "
on a third front , iceland is also in discussions with the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , though haarde said the country has not formally requested a loan .
if it does , it would become the first western european country to turn to the imf since 1976 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland 's prime minister geir haarde " we 're entitled to their services like everybody else but there is no decision on behalf of the government as to whether or not to apply for a loan , " haarde said .
" and there is no decision on behalf of the imf as to what kind of conditionality would be involved . "
the imf has sent a delegation to evaluate the situation in iceland , in a process which haarde has described as " friendly . "
" it 's not like the imf is here to take over the country , " he said .
rescuing a stricken economy iceland has been badly affected by the financial turmoil , which has resulted in its main commercial banks being nationalized by the state .
its currency has been severely weakened , and the local stock exchange was shut down for three days .
trading resumed on tuesday , but the day ended badly , with the omx iceland 15 index falling by 77 percent .
the icelandic index has lost 89 percent of its value this year , making it the worst performing stock exchange globally .
despite the grim economic realities , iceland 's president said tuesday that the tiny country is well positioned to recover , and can serve as a model on how to tackle the energy and climate change challenges .
" in the current global financial hurricane , iceland and others have been reminded , to use an analogy , that when a hurricane passes over the ocean toward the powerful mainland it usually crosses small islands where the destruction can be substantial , " olafur ragnar grimsson said in a video address to a united nations seminar on small states .
he said that experience has shown that " small states , due to their flexibility and the closely knit networks of cooperation which characterize their societies , can recover surprisingly quickly . "
iceland is currently campaigning for a two-year seat on the un security council , competing with austria and turkey for the two seats reserved for european states .
on friday , the un general assembly will elect five new members to replace the nations whose terms expire at the end of this year .
though iceland is considered a european country , it is not a member of the european union .

15 to 20 next year - claim recent failed doping tests involving german rider stefan schumacher and his team gerolsteiner colleague bernhard kohl , have added to the pressure on the sport to clean up and increased lack of faith in cycling by supporters and investors alike .

on monday , it was announced that kohl , the best climber at this year 's tour de france and third overall , tested positive for the latest generation of the banned blood booster epo -lrb- erythropoietin -rrb- , named cera .
kohl is the fourth rider from the tour de france after italians riccardo ricco and leonardo piepoli , to test positive for the drug along with germany 's schumacher .
schumacher is currently the subject of an investigation into allegations of fraud after failing a dope test , stuttgart prosecutors confirmed last week .
the 27-year-old 's house was recently searched with items taken away to be evaluated as possible evidence , a spokeswoman for the stuttgart prosecutor 's office told reporters last thursday .

schumacher , who made no statement during the search of his home , will have the opportunity to give his side of the story in the investigation into whether he fraudulently deceived his gerolsteiner team .

schumacher won both individual time trials at the tour and was the overall leader of the race for two days .
he faces a two-year ban if found guilty of doping .
the german cycling federation bdr and the country 's national anti-doping agency nada have also launched investigations , with the bdr giving schumacher a five-day deadline to explain himself .
schumacher has already been suspended by his gerolsteiner team but the rider 's lawyer michael lehner criticized the doping procedures surrounding the retests at the french laboratory in chatenay-malabry .

the statement came after retests for cera caught out schumacher and the italians ricci and piepoli .
ricci already tested positive for cera during the tour and is banned from competition .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de political parties -pipe- 15.10.2008 left party chooses tv detective as presidential candidate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actor peter sodann is hoping to swap his role as a tv detective for that of german president germany 's left party has voted to send tv actor peter sodann up against more experienced political opponents as its candidate in the coming campaign for president . ronald reagan managed to put a hollywood career behind him to become the leader of the free world and arnold schwarzenegger has more recently swapped his role as an ultra-violent cyborg for that of the environmentally-friendly overseer of the biggest state economy in the united states .
as a result of this foresight in seeing political capital in promoting entertainers to public office , actors-stroke-politicians have grown in credibility .
the success of reagan and schwarzenegger must have featured in the thought process which led to the left party 's decision tuesday , oct .
13 , to send television detective peter sodann up against incumbent horst koehler and social democratic challenger gesine schwan in the campaign to become germany 's next president .
swapping crime drama for politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sodann , left , in his role as kommissar ehrlicher in tatort sodann , better known among tv fans as kommissar ehrlicher in the german cult crime series tatort , was once considered a candidate for the bundestag for the left party 's former incarnation , the pds , in the 2005 parliamentary election .
however , he withdrew from the campaign only two days after announcing he would run - the reason being that his television paymasters would refuse to consider him for future roles .
while an unusual choice on the surface , sodann has some experience in dealing with political power .
one of east germany 's most popular actors , sodann was incarcerated for two years by the east german communist regime in the 1960s for directing a student theater whose program was defined as being " counter revolutionary . "
he served nine months of his sentence before being released from prison .
the actor , who featured in 45 episodes of tatort between 1991 and 2007 , has little realistic chance of winning .
however , while the left party must know it is effectively making up the numbers by putting forward sodann as their candidate , the publicity will no doubt raise the party 's profile even further at a time when it is making gains on the fractured social democrats and embattled christian democratic union ahead of september 2009 parliamentary elections .
left party looking for boosts to popularity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hanna schygulla was also considered by the left party sodann 's candidacy is not the first attempt by the left party to install an entertainer in the position of germany 's most prominent diplomat .
hanna schygulla , a protagonist in a number of films by director rainer werner fassbinder , was also considered as a candidate before being rejected by a party vote .
sodann will stand against koehler , the conservative incumbent , and spd 's schwan in the vote on may 23 when an assembly of lawmakers and state delegates elect the president .
at present , koehler appears to have just enough support to win re-election , while schwan would need left party votes to have any chance of winning .
it is unclear whether the party would support her if sodann is eliminated in an early round of voting . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as a result of this foresight in seeing political capital in promoting entertainers to public office , actors-stroke-politicians have grown in credibility .
the success of reagan and schwarzenegger must have featured in the thought process which led to the left party 's decision tuesday , oct .
13 , to send television detective peter sodann up against incumbent horst koehler and social democratic challenger gesine schwan in the campaign to become germany 's next president .
swapping crime drama for politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sodann , left , in his role as kommissar ehrlicher in tatort sodann , better known among tv fans as kommissar ehrlicher in the german cult crime series tatort , was once considered a candidate for the bundestag for the left party 's former incarnation , the pds , in the 2005 parliamentary election .
however , he withdrew from the campaign only two days after announcing he would run - the reason being that his television paymasters would refuse to consider him for future roles .
while an unusual choice on the surface , sodann has some experience in dealing with political power .
one of east germany 's most popular actors , sodann was incarcerated for two years by the east german communist regime in the 1960s for directing a student theater whose program was defined as being " counter revolutionary . "
he served nine months of his sentence before being released from prison .
the actor , who featured in 45 episodes of tatort between 1991 and 2007 , has little realistic chance of winning .
however , while the left party must know it is effectively making up the numbers by putting forward sodann as their candidate , the publicity will no doubt raise the party 's profile even further at a time when it is making gains on the fractured social democrats and embattled christian democratic union ahead of september 2009 parliamentary elections .
left party looking for boosts to popularity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hanna schygulla was also considered by the left party sodann 's candidacy is not the first attempt by the left party to install an entertainer in the position of germany 's most prominent diplomat .
hanna schygulla , a protagonist in a number of films by director rainer werner fassbinder , was also considered as a candidate before being rejected by a party vote .
sodann will stand against koehler , the conservative incumbent , and spd 's schwan in the vote on may 23 when an assembly of lawmakers and state delegates elect the president .
at present , koehler appears to have just enough support to win re-election , while schwan would need left party votes to have any chance of winning .

warning that the unprecedented global financial crisis requires " unprecedented eu action , " european commission president jose manuel barroso has urged all eu governments to endorse a wide-ranging rescue plan . " i am pleased to see that there is now a consensus on the necessity and on the substance of a coherent effort , " barroso said of the plan worth an estimated 2 trillion euros -lrb- $ 2.7 trillion -rrb- .
" i expect confirmation and strengthening of this consistent and coherent effort by the european council . "
eu leaders are due to meet in brussels on wednesday and thursday for a regular autumn summit whose content will largely be devoted to the credit crunch .
discussions will focus on the outcome of a meeting in paris on sunday in which the 15 countries that share the euro approved a british-style financial rescue package which includes measures to guarantee interbank loans .
bank reluctance threatens recession bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reluctance to lend has had a terrible effect on markets the reluctance of banks to lend out their money is at the heart of the current financial crisis , which is in turn threatening to plunge european economies into recession .
euro zone governments also agreed in paris to guarantee at least 50,000 euros of their citizens ' bank deposits and to bail out financial institutions by providing them with cash in exchange for a share in such companies .
the combined potential cost of such measures for the eu as a whole has been estimated at around 2 trillion euros , with germany , britain and france putting up a large share of that total .
however , officials in brussels note that the combined figure includes a significant amount of bank guarantees that may never be needed .
" if you look at the magnitude of this response , and the effects of coordination , they were credible .
and that is what markets and citizens are looking for , " barroso said .
the head of the eu executive also backed calls by french president nicolas sarkozy for an international conference to reform the global finance system .
" an urgent priority now must be to further deepen coordination at the international level , and specifically with the us , " barroso said .
britain 's brown gets praise for efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro zone 's rescue team owes a lot to brown and he heaped praise on british prime minister gordon brown , whose national rescue plan largely inspired the eu 's own plan .
" let me say on this occasion how appreciative we are of the efforts of prime minister gordon brown , " barroso said .
" his contribution was very important . "
brown was invited to hold talks in paris ahead of the euro-summit , despite britain not being part of the 15-member eurogroup , whose finance ministers meet on a regular basis .
the commission chief also called on national governments to approve a series of proposals introducing common and tougher rules for banks , insurance companies and credit rating agencies .
" even after this crisis , there are some governments that are opposing a more coordinated european approach , " barroso said .
" -lrb- but -rrb- i have boundless faith in the sense of responsibility and the common sense of our heads of state and government .
" to try and go it alone in this climate would be a fatal mistake for any government anywhere in europe , " barroso said . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

15 to 20 next year - claim recent failed doping tests involving german rider stefan schumacher and his team gerolsteiner colleague bernhard kohl , have added to the pressure on the sport to clean up and increased lack of faith in cycling by supporters and investors alike .
" we have held intense discussions over the last few days and decided at the conclusion not to organize the 26th edition of the competition given the current situation in cycling , " organizer andreas kroll told german agency sid tuesday , oct .
14 .
" professional cycling has an enormous image problem at the moment which we ca n't currently change . "
on monday , it was announced that kohl , the best climber at this year 's tour de france and third overall , tested positive for the latest generation of the banned blood booster epo -lrb- erythropoietin -rrb- , named cera .
kohl is the fourth rider from the tour de france after italians riccardo ricco and leonardo piepoli , to test positive for the drug along with germany 's schumacher .
schumacher is currently the subject of an investigation into allegations of fraud after failing a dope test , stuttgart prosecutors confirmed last week .

schumacher , who made no statement during the search of his home , will have the opportunity to give his side of the story in the investigation into whether he fraudulently deceived his gerolsteiner team .
prosecutors have also looked at documents belonging to gerolsteiner team principal hans-michael holczer .
schumacher won both individual time trials at the tour and was the overall leader of the race for two days .
he faces a two-year ban if found guilty of doping .
the german cycling federation bdr and the country 's national anti-doping agency nada have also launched investigations , with the bdr giving schumacher a five-day deadline to explain himself .
schumacher has already been suspended by his gerolsteiner team but the rider 's lawyer michael lehner criticized the doping procedures surrounding the retests at the french laboratory in chatenay-malabry .
" it is completely unclear , according to the documents available , under what circumstances and which blood samples returned apparently positive results for cera in the laboratory in chatenay-malabry , " he said in a statement .

the statement came after retests for cera caught out schumacher and the italians ricci and piepoli .
ricci already tested positive for cera during the tour and is banned from competition .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 15.10.2008 financial crisis : a glossary of terms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world of finance can be a confusing and frustrating place the global economy has been thrashed for the last year by the financial crisis .
here are some of the most important terms to know to understand the scope of the crisis . asset backed securities -lrb- abs -rrb- : a debt security collateralized by specific assets .
although the term applies to any debt backed by identified assets , it generally refers to securities backed by short- term collateral such as credit-card receivables , car loans , and home- equity loans .
credit crunch : since banks are now leery about lending money to one another , there is less money available for making consumer loans .
some companies have also begun to complain about problems in securing loans .
deposit insurance : a government guarantee on individual savings up to a certain monetary level , though some nations have opted to provide unlimited guarantees , regardless of the amount of savings held .
guarantee : the assumption of responsibility for payment of a debt or performance of some obligation if the liable party fails to perform to expectations .
interbank trade : refers to international trade between banks .
trade is usually conducted in currency , shares or commercial paper with fixed interest bonds .
liquidity squeeze : when an entity lacks the financial capital to pay its obligations in a timely manner , it is said to be suffering a liquidity squeeze .
currently , many nations are pumping billions into their banks to protect them from such a squeeze .
moratorium : a suspension of specific , or all , business activities to prevent additional damage .
sometimes a moratorium can be decreed by a nation .
sometimes a business can enact a moratorium on its own .
in bankruptcy law , a legally binding halt of the right to collect debt .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 15.10.2008 regional states show solidarity for huge german rescue plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the national umbrella rescue package involves all 16 german states the banking crisis has made bedfellows of rival parties across germany 's political spectrum , with a majority of parliamentarians agreeing that the regional states need to support the federal bailout . the bundesrat , germany 's upper house of parliament agreed to the government 's 500 billion-euro -lrb- $ 683-billion-dollar -rrb- rescue package by a sweeping majority in spite of critics opposing the deal to shore up the nation 's flailing financial institutions .
even bavaria , germany 's largest state which had been initially opposed to the plan , signalled its support .
the state 's finance minister erwin huber told the national news broadcaster ard , " i do n't want to see the -lrb- bailout plan -rrb- fall through . "
the federal government expects the 16 regional states to cough up 35 percent of the cost , which combines an injection of capital with loan guarantees .
german finance minister peer steinbrueck is meeting with his regional counterparts this week to discuss details of the rescue plan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister peer steinbrueck -lrb- right -rrb- and leftist political rivals work together germany is under an international obligation to do its share in regulating the turbulence caused by world financial markets , according to a constitutional clause of a federal reform law in 2006 .
the bundesrat is likely to formally vote on the immediate implementation of the rescue package this friday .
some say states ' burden is unfair bavarian finance minister huber , however , did slam the federal government for pushing some of the burden onto the states .
" the nation calls the shots and the states pay the bill .
this is not exactly fair play , " he said .
huber , who was recently forced out as the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- party leader after bavarian state elections last month , claimed that the states face a double burden since they are solely responsible for bailing out and insuring regional banks and savings institutions as well .
the premier of the tiny south-western state of saarland , peter mueller , said that state participation in a federal bailout was inevitable with both state and federal interests intertwined . " we need solidarity on this issue , " said mueller in a interview with the broadcaster deutschlandradio kultur .
bailout makes bedfellows of political rivals other regions such as the heavily populated industrial state north rhine-westphalia and the south-western state baden-wuerttemberg , which is home to automakers such as bmw and daimler , concur .
even berlin 's economic deputy harald wolf of the opposition left party told the german media : " the states have no choice but to support the federal plan . "
among the conservatives , lower saxony 's finance minister hartmut moellring -lrb- cdu -rrb- told a regional broadcaster that the states needed to do their share in risky propositions , but also needed to take a lead role in transactions involving billions of euros .
norbert roettgen , the parliamentary leader of chancellor angela merkel 's governing christian democrat coalition , said it 's a given that the states fulfil their financial obligations .
green party financial expert christine scheel warned leaders of the regional states on national television news broadcaster n24 to assume collective responsibility for the banking crisis . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the long term , it could mean more eu-wide regulation .

15 to 20 next year - claim recent failed doping tests involving german rider stefan schumacher and his team gerolsteiner colleague bernhard kohl , have added to the pressure on the sport to clean up and increased lack of faith in cycling by supporters and investors alike .
" we have held intense discussions over the last few days and decided at the conclusion not to organize the 26th edition of the competition given the current situation in cycling , " organizer andreas kroll told german agency sid tuesday , oct .
14 .
" professional cycling has an enormous image problem at the moment which we ca n't currently change . "
on monday , it was announced that kohl , the best climber at this year 's tour de france and third overall , tested positive for the latest generation of the banned blood booster epo -lrb- erythropoietin -rrb- , named cera .
kohl is the fourth rider from the tour de france after italians riccardo ricco and leonardo piepoli , to test positive for the drug along with germany 's schumacher .
schumacher is currently the subject of an investigation into allegations of fraud after failing a dope test , stuttgart prosecutors confirmed last week .
the 27-year-old 's house was recently searched with items taken away to be evaluated as possible evidence , a spokeswoman for the stuttgart prosecutor 's office told reporters last thursday .
schumacher caught in retest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schumacher faces a two-year ban if found guilty at the same time , the french anti-doping agency afld , which was responsible for the anti-doping program at the 2008 tour , said in a statement that schumacher tested positive twice for the newest version of the epo blood-booster , cera -lrb- continuous erythropoiesis receptor activator -rrb- , at the tour de france in july .
schumacher , who made no statement during the search of his home , will have the opportunity to give his side of the story in the investigation into whether he fraudulently deceived his gerolsteiner team .
prosecutors have also looked at documents belonging to gerolsteiner team principal hans-michael holczer .
schumacher won both individual time trials at the tour and was the overall leader of the race for two days .
he faces a two-year ban if found guilty of doping .
the german cycling federation bdr and the country 's national anti-doping agency nada have also launched investigations , with the bdr giving schumacher a five-day deadline to explain himself .
schumacher has already been suspended by his gerolsteiner team but the rider 's lawyer michael lehner criticized the doping procedures surrounding the retests at the french laboratory in chatenay-malabry .
" it is completely unclear , according to the documents available , under what circumstances and which blood samples returned apparently positive results for cera in the laboratory in chatenay-malabry , " he said in a statement .
meanwhile , schumacher 's gerolsteiner teammate sebastian lang told the radsport-news internet site that the cyclist had been asked if his team should " be worried . "
" stefan reassured us that everything was in order , " he said .
new revelations lead to review of samples bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyclists may have used illegal blood transfusions such are the continuing revelations of doping from this year 's tour that samples from the july race will be retested for illegal own blood transfusions which could reveal further drug cheats at the famed event .
the head of the afld , pierre bordry , told german state network zdf that a new test to detect this illegal method is currently being developed .
he said that samples from around 30 riders , who had abnormal blood levels at the start of the july race , will be retested .
" we have already received strong hints of own blood doping cases .
we wo n't be able to say until a later date who that involves , " bordry told zdf .
" soon we will be able to detect own blood transfusions and we will then conduct the retests . "
the statement came after retests for cera caught out schumacher and the italians ricci and piepoli .
ricci already tested positive for cera during the tour and is banned from competition .
the newly developed cera test was also conducted among the riders with abnormal levels .
the test has also prompted the international olympic committee to order retests of the samples gathered at cycling and all other sports at the beijing games .
" the ioc intends to retest the samples collected this summer during the olympic games in beijing .
substances that will be tested for across all sports include epo cera , " ioc spokeswoman emmanuelle moreau told reporters last week .
it was not known immediately whether the ioc retests included own blood transfusions . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

warning that the unprecedented global financial crisis requires " unprecedented eu action , " european commission president jose manuel barroso has urged all eu governments to endorse a wide-ranging rescue plan . " i am pleased to see that there is now a consensus on the necessity and on the substance of a coherent effort , " barroso said of the plan worth an estimated 2 trillion euros -lrb- $ 2.7 trillion -rrb- .
" i expect confirmation and strengthening of this consistent and coherent effort by the european council . "
eu leaders are due to meet in brussels on wednesday and thursday for a regular autumn summit whose content will largely be devoted to the credit crunch .
discussions will focus on the outcome of a meeting in paris on sunday in which the 15 countries that share the euro approved a british-style financial rescue package which includes measures to guarantee interbank loans .
bank reluctance threatens recession bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reluctance to lend has had a terrible effect on markets the reluctance of banks to lend out their money is at the heart of the current financial crisis , which is in turn threatening to plunge european economies into recession .
euro zone governments also agreed in paris to guarantee at least 50,000 euros of their citizens ' bank deposits and to bail out financial institutions by providing them with cash in exchange for a share in such companies .
the combined potential cost of such measures for the eu as a whole has been estimated at around 2 trillion euros , with germany , britain and france putting up a large share of that total .
however , officials in brussels note that the combined figure includes a significant amount of bank guarantees that may never be needed .
" if you look at the magnitude of this response , and the effects of coordination , they were credible .
and that is what markets and citizens are looking for , " barroso said .
the head of the eu executive also backed calls by french president nicolas sarkozy for an international conference to reform the global finance system .

" his contribution was very important . "
brown was invited to hold talks in paris ahead of the euro-summit , despite britain not being part of the 15-member eurogroup , whose finance ministers meet on a regular basis .
the commission chief also called on national governments to approve a series of proposals introducing common and tougher rules for banks , insurance companies and credit rating agencies .
" even after this crisis , there are some governments that are opposing a more coordinated european approach , " barroso said .
" -lrb- but -rrb- i have boundless faith in the sense of responsibility and the common sense of our heads of state and government .

the state 's finance minister erwin huber told the national news broadcaster ard , " i do n't want to see the -lrb- bailout plan -rrb- fall through . "

euro zone governments also agreed in paris to guarantee at least 50,000 euros of their citizens ' bank deposits and to bail out financial institutions by providing them with cash in exchange for a share in such companies .
the combined potential cost of such measures for the eu as a whole has been estimated at around 2 trillion euros , with germany , britain and france putting up a large share of that total .

euro zone governments also agreed in paris to guarantee at least 50,000 euros of their citizens ' bank deposits and to bail out financial institutions by providing them with cash in exchange for a share in such companies .
the combined potential cost of such measures for the eu as a whole has been estimated at around 2 trillion euros , with germany , britain and france putting up a large share of that total .
however , officials in brussels note that the combined figure includes a significant amount of bank guarantees that may never be needed .
" if you look at the magnitude of this response , and the effects of coordination , they were credible .
and that is what markets and citizens are looking for , " barroso said .
the head of the eu executive also backed calls by french president nicolas sarkozy for an international conference to reform the global finance system .
" an urgent priority now must be to further deepen coordination at the international level , and specifically with the us , " barroso said .
britain 's brown gets praise for efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro zone 's rescue team owes a lot to brown and he heaped praise on british prime minister gordon brown , whose national rescue plan largely inspired the eu 's own plan .
" let me say on this occasion how appreciative we are of the efforts of prime minister gordon brown , " barroso said .
" his contribution was very important . "
brown was invited to hold talks in paris ahead of the euro-summit , despite britain not being part of the 15-member eurogroup , whose finance ministers meet on a regular basis .
the commission chief also called on national governments to approve a series of proposals introducing common and tougher rules for banks , insurance companies and credit rating agencies .
" even after this crisis , there are some governments that are opposing a more coordinated european approach , " barroso said .
" -lrb- but -rrb- i have boundless faith in the sense of responsibility and the common sense of our heads of state and government .
" to try and go it alone in this climate would be a fatal mistake for any government anywhere in europe , " barroso said . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on monday , it was announced that kohl , the best climber at this year 's tour de france and third overall , tested positive for the latest generation of the banned blood booster epo -lrb- erythropoietin -rrb- , named cera .
kohl is the fourth rider from the tour de france after italians riccardo ricco and leonardo piepoli , to test positive for the drug along with germany 's schumacher .
schumacher is currently the subject of an investigation into allegations of fraud after failing a dope test , stuttgart prosecutors confirmed last week .
the 27-year-old 's house was recently searched with items taken away to be evaluated as possible evidence , a spokeswoman for the stuttgart prosecutor 's office told reporters last thursday .
schumacher caught in retest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schumacher faces a two-year ban if found guilty at the same time , the french anti-doping agency afld , which was responsible for the anti-doping program at the 2008 tour , said in a statement that schumacher tested positive twice for the newest version of the epo blood-booster , cera -lrb- continuous erythropoiesis receptor activator -rrb- , at the tour de france in july .
schumacher , who made no statement during the search of his home , will have the opportunity to give his side of the story in the investigation into whether he fraudulently deceived his gerolsteiner team .
prosecutors have also looked at documents belonging to gerolsteiner team principal hans-michael holczer .
schumacher won both individual time trials at the tour and was the overall leader of the race for two days .
he faces a two-year ban if found guilty of doping .
the german cycling federation bdr and the country 's national anti-doping agency nada have also launched investigations , with the bdr giving schumacher a five-day deadline to explain himself .
schumacher has already been suspended by his gerolsteiner team but the rider 's lawyer michael lehner criticized the doping procedures surrounding the retests at the french laboratory in chatenay-malabry .
" it is completely unclear , according to the documents available , under what circumstances and which blood samples returned apparently positive results for cera in the laboratory in chatenay-malabry , " he said in a statement .
meanwhile , schumacher 's gerolsteiner teammate sebastian lang told the radsport-news internet site that the cyclist had been asked if his team should " be worried . "

he said that samples from around 30 riders , who had abnormal blood levels at the start of the july race , will be retested .
" we have already received strong hints of own blood doping cases .
we wo n't be able to say until a later date who that involves , " bordry told zdf .
" soon we will be able to detect own blood transfusions and we will then conduct the retests . "
the statement came after retests for cera caught out schumacher and the italians ricci and piepoli .
ricci already tested positive for cera during the tour and is banned from competition .
the newly developed cera test was also conducted among the riders with abnormal levels .
the test has also prompted the international olympic committee to order retests of the samples gathered at cycling and all other sports at the beijing games .

" we have already received strong hints of own blood doping cases .
we wo n't be able to say until a later date who that involves , " bordry told zdf .
" soon we will be able to detect own blood transfusions and we will then conduct the retests . "
the statement came after retests for cera caught out schumacher and the italians ricci and piepoli .
ricci already tested positive for cera during the tour and is banned from competition .
the newly developed cera test was also conducted among the riders with abnormal levels .
the test has also prompted the international olympic committee to order retests of the samples gathered at cycling and all other sports at the beijing games .

as a result of this foresight in seeing political capital in promoting entertainers to public office , actors-stroke-politicians have grown in credibility .
the success of reagan and schwarzenegger must have featured in the thought process which led to the left party 's decision tuesday , oct .
13 , to send television detective peter sodann up against incumbent horst koehler and social democratic challenger gesine schwan in the campaign to become germany 's next president .
swapping crime drama for politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sodann , left , in his role as kommissar ehrlicher in tatort sodann , better known among tv fans as kommissar ehrlicher in the german cult crime series tatort , was once considered a candidate for the bundestag for the left party 's former incarnation , the pds , in the 2005 parliamentary election .
however , he withdrew from the campaign only two days after announcing he would run - the reason being that his television paymasters would refuse to consider him for future roles .
while an unusual choice on the surface , sodann has some experience in dealing with political power .
one of east germany 's most popular actors , sodann was incarcerated for two years by the east german communist regime in the 1960s for directing a student theater whose program was defined as being " counter revolutionary . "
he served nine months of his sentence before being released from prison .
the actor , who featured in 45 episodes of tatort between 1991 and 2007 , has little realistic chance of winning .
however , while the left party must know it is effectively making up the numbers by putting forward sodann as their candidate , the publicity will no doubt raise the party 's profile even further at a time when it is making gains on the fractured social democrats and embattled christian democratic union ahead of september 2009 parliamentary elections .
left party looking for boosts to popularity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hanna schygulla was also considered by the left party sodann 's candidacy is not the first attempt by the left party to install an entertainer in the position of germany 's most prominent diplomat .
hanna schygulla , a protagonist in a number of films by director rainer werner fassbinder , was also considered as a candidate before being rejected by a party vote .
sodann will stand against koehler , the conservative incumbent , and spd 's schwan in the vote on may 23 when an assembly of lawmakers and state delegates elect the president .
at present , koehler appears to have just enough support to win re-election , while schwan would need left party votes to have any chance of winning .
it is unclear whether the party would support her if sodann is eliminated in an early round of voting . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the success of reagan and schwarzenegger must have featured in the thought process which led to the left party 's decision tuesday , oct .

however , he withdrew from the campaign only two days after announcing he would run - the reason being that his television paymasters would refuse to consider him for future roles .
while an unusual choice on the surface , sodann has some experience in dealing with political power .
one of east germany 's most popular actors , sodann was incarcerated for two years by the east german communist regime in the 1960s for directing a student theater whose program was defined as being " counter revolutionary . "
he served nine months of his sentence before being released from prison .
the actor , who featured in 45 episodes of tatort between 1991 and 2007 , has little realistic chance of winning .
however , while the left party must know it is effectively making up the numbers by putting forward sodann as their candidate , the publicity will no doubt raise the party 's profile even further at a time when it is making gains on the fractured social democrats and embattled christian democratic union ahead of september 2009 parliamentary elections .

but economy minister glos said berlin would offer support to struggling exporters . finance minister peer steinbrueck said he was " not prepared to announce a bailout plan for the auto sector or promise tax breaks just because the industry is applying pressure , " in an interview with weekly die zeit to appear on thursday , oct .
16 . on monday , german chancellor angela merkel had rejected a comprehensive economic rescue package despite signs that europe 's biggest economy was heading into recession .
but she was less adamant about germany 's key auto sector in light of $ 25 billion -lrb- 19 billion euros -rrb- worth of aid offered to automakers that have produced cars in the united states for 20 years . france also announced a program that offers 400 million euros to carmakers to promote the development of environmentally automobiles . economic downturn hurts automakers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german automakers want the state to create incentives for people to buy new cars " we will probably have to strongly support the automobile industry ... though that poses questions about european competitiveness , " merkel said .
" we have to look again at how we can react .
aside from that , there will be no economic package in the classic sense . " germany 's vda auto federation then called for " political investment incentives , " such as tax credits for consumers buying new cars and changes to the auto tax changes linked to greenhouse gas emissions to induce owners of older cars to buy new ones . " effects of the financial crisis and global economic deterioration have made conditions more difficult on auto industry markets , " vda president matthias wissmann said tuesday in a statement . car sales in europe dropped by 8.2 percent in september to 1.3 million and sales for the year are down 4 percent to 11.7 million , the european automobile manufacturers ' association said on wednesday . several german car makers have recently announced production cutbacks and revised 2008 earnings owing to slumping auto sales . help for exporters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the auto industry is only one of the sectors impacted by the financial crisis in a move likely to please the export-heavy auto industry , economy minister michael glos said wednesday that the government would aid german exporters . " the deterioration in the overall economic environment can lead to a loss of export momentum , " he said in a statement .
" the slowdown we 're seeing in a number of european countries , and the expected recession in the united states , will put the dampeners on exports . " german was prepared to boost export credit guarantees called the " hermes cover , " glos said .
the governments uses the guarantees to protect german businesses by taking over debt from foreign entities that do not pay their bills . the state engaged in 17 billion euros worth of such guarantees in 2007 , which was less than 2 percent of germany 's 969 billion euros in total exports . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but economy minister glos said berlin would offer support to struggling exporters . finance minister peer steinbrueck said he was " not prepared to announce a bailout plan for the auto sector or promise tax breaks just because the industry is applying pressure , " in an interview with weekly die zeit to appear on thursday , oct .
16 . on monday , german chancellor angela merkel had rejected a comprehensive economic rescue package despite signs that europe 's biggest economy was heading into recession .
but she was less adamant about germany 's key auto sector in light of $ 25 billion -lrb- 19 billion euros -rrb- worth of aid offered to automakers that have produced cars in the united states for 20 years . france also announced a program that offers 400 million euros to carmakers to promote the development of environmentally automobiles . economic downturn hurts automakers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german automakers want the state to create incentives for people to buy new cars " we will probably have to strongly support the automobile industry ... though that poses questions about european competitiveness , " merkel said .
" we have to look again at how we can react .
aside from that , there will be no economic package in the classic sense . " germany 's vda auto federation then called for " political investment incentives , " such as tax credits for consumers buying new cars and changes to the auto tax changes linked to greenhouse gas emissions to induce owners of older cars to buy new ones . " effects of the financial crisis and global economic deterioration have made conditions more difficult on auto industry markets , " vda president matthias wissmann said tuesday in a statement . car sales in europe dropped by 8.2 percent in september to 1.3 million and sales for the year are down 4 percent to 11.7 million , the european automobile manufacturers ' association said on wednesday . several german car makers have recently announced production cutbacks and revised 2008 earnings owing to slumping auto sales . help for exporters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the auto industry is only one of the sectors impacted by the financial crisis in a move likely to please the export-heavy auto industry , economy minister michael glos said wednesday that the government would aid german exporters . " the deterioration in the overall economic environment can lead to a loss of export momentum , " he said in a statement .
" the slowdown we 're seeing in a number of european countries , and the expected recession in the united states , will put the dampeners on exports . " german was prepared to boost export credit guarantees called the " hermes cover , " glos said .
the governments uses the guarantees to protect german businesses by taking over debt from foreign entities that do not pay their bills . the state engaged in 17 billion euros worth of such guarantees in 2007 , which was less than 2 percent of germany 's 969 billion euros in total exports . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de political parties -pipe- 15.10.2008 left party chooses tv detective as presidential candidate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actor peter sodann is hoping to swap his role as a tv detective for that of german president germany 's left party has voted to send tv actor peter sodann up against more experienced political opponents as its candidate in the coming campaign for president . ronald reagan managed to put a hollywood career behind him to become the leader of the free world and arnold schwarzenegger has more recently swapped his role as an ultra-violent cyborg for that of the environmentally-friendly overseer of the biggest state economy in the united states .
as a result of this foresight in seeing political capital in promoting entertainers to public office , actors-stroke-politicians have grown in credibility .
the success of reagan and schwarzenegger must have featured in the thought process which led to the left party 's decision tuesday , oct .
13 , to send television detective peter sodann up against incumbent horst koehler and social democratic challenger gesine schwan in the campaign to become germany 's next president .
swapping crime drama for politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sodann , left , in his role as kommissar ehrlicher in tatort sodann , better known among tv fans as kommissar ehrlicher in the german cult crime series tatort , was once considered a candidate for the bundestag for the left party 's former incarnation , the pds , in the 2005 parliamentary election .
however , he withdrew from the campaign only two days after announcing he would run - the reason being that his television paymasters would refuse to consider him for future roles .
while an unusual choice on the surface , sodann has some experience in dealing with political power .
one of east germany 's most popular actors , sodann was incarcerated for two years by the east german communist regime in the 1960s for directing a student theater whose program was defined as being " counter revolutionary . "
he served nine months of his sentence before being released from prison .
the actor , who featured in 45 episodes of tatort between 1991 and 2007 , has little realistic chance of winning .
however , while the left party must know it is effectively making up the numbers by putting forward sodann as their candidate , the publicity will no doubt raise the party 's profile even further at a time when it is making gains on the fractured social democrats and embattled christian democratic union ahead of september 2009 parliamentary elections .
left party looking for boosts to popularity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hanna schygulla was also considered by the left party sodann 's candidacy is not the first attempt by the left party to install an entertainer in the position of germany 's most prominent diplomat .
hanna schygulla , a protagonist in a number of films by director rainer werner fassbinder , was also considered as a candidate before being rejected by a party vote .
sodann will stand against koehler , the conservative incumbent , and spd 's schwan in the vote on may 23 when an assembly of lawmakers and state delegates elect the president .
at present , koehler appears to have just enough support to win re-election , while schwan would need left party votes to have any chance of winning .
it is unclear whether the party would support her if sodann is eliminated in an early round of voting . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

warning that the unprecedented global financial crisis requires " unprecedented eu action , " european commission president jose manuel barroso has urged all eu governments to endorse a wide-ranging rescue plan . " i am pleased to see that there is now a consensus on the necessity and on the substance of a coherent effort , " barroso said of the plan worth an estimated 2 trillion euros -lrb- $ 2.7 trillion -rrb- .
" i expect confirmation and strengthening of this consistent and coherent effort by the european council . "
eu leaders are due to meet in brussels on wednesday and thursday for a regular autumn summit whose content will largely be devoted to the credit crunch .
discussions will focus on the outcome of a meeting in paris on sunday in which the 15 countries that share the euro approved a british-style financial rescue package which includes measures to guarantee interbank loans .
bank reluctance threatens recession bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reluctance to lend has had a terrible effect on markets the reluctance of banks to lend out their money is at the heart of the current financial crisis , which is in turn threatening to plunge european economies into recession .
euro zone governments also agreed in paris to guarantee at least 50,000 euros of their citizens ' bank deposits and to bail out financial institutions by providing them with cash in exchange for a share in such companies .
the combined potential cost of such measures for the eu as a whole has been estimated at around 2 trillion euros , with germany , britain and france putting up a large share of that total .
however , officials in brussels note that the combined figure includes a significant amount of bank guarantees that may never be needed .
" if you look at the magnitude of this response , and the effects of coordination , they were credible .
and that is what markets and citizens are looking for , " barroso said .
the head of the eu executive also backed calls by french president nicolas sarkozy for an international conference to reform the global finance system .

warning that the unprecedented global financial crisis requires " unprecedented eu action , " european commission president jose manuel barroso has urged all eu governments to endorse a wide-ranging rescue plan . " i am pleased to see that there is now a consensus on the necessity and on the substance of a coherent effort , " barroso said of the plan worth an estimated 2 trillion euros -lrb- $ 2.7 trillion -rrb- .
" i expect confirmation and strengthening of this consistent and coherent effort by the european council . "
eu leaders are due to meet in brussels on wednesday and thursday for a regular autumn summit whose content will largely be devoted to the credit crunch .
discussions will focus on the outcome of a meeting in paris on sunday in which the 15 countries that share the euro approved a british-style financial rescue package which includes measures to guarantee interbank loans .
bank reluctance threatens recession bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reluctance to lend has had a terrible effect on markets the reluctance of banks to lend out their money is at the heart of the current financial crisis , which is in turn threatening to plunge european economies into recession .
euro zone governments also agreed in paris to guarantee at least 50,000 euros of their citizens ' bank deposits and to bail out financial institutions by providing them with cash in exchange for a share in such companies .
the combined potential cost of such measures for the eu as a whole has been estimated at around 2 trillion euros , with germany , britain and france putting up a large share of that total .
however , officials in brussels note that the combined figure includes a significant amount of bank guarantees that may never be needed .
" if you look at the magnitude of this response , and the effects of coordination , they were credible .
and that is what markets and citizens are looking for , " barroso said .
the head of the eu executive also backed calls by french president nicolas sarkozy for an international conference to reform the global finance system .

warning that the unprecedented global financial crisis requires " unprecedented eu action , " european commission president jose manuel barroso has urged all eu governments to endorse a wide-ranging rescue plan . " i am pleased to see that there is now a consensus on the necessity and on the substance of a coherent effort , " barroso said of the plan worth an estimated 2 trillion euros -lrb- $ 2.7 trillion -rrb- .
" i expect confirmation and strengthening of this consistent and coherent effort by the european council . "
eu leaders are due to meet in brussels on wednesday and thursday for a regular autumn summit whose content will largely be devoted to the credit crunch .
discussions will focus on the outcome of a meeting in paris on sunday in which the 15 countries that share the euro approved a british-style financial rescue package which includes measures to guarantee interbank loans .
bank reluctance threatens recession bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reluctance to lend has had a terrible effect on markets the reluctance of banks to lend out their money is at the heart of the current financial crisis , which is in turn threatening to plunge european economies into recession .
euro zone governments also agreed in paris to guarantee at least 50,000 euros of their citizens ' bank deposits and to bail out financial institutions by providing them with cash in exchange for a share in such companies .
the combined potential cost of such measures for the eu as a whole has been estimated at around 2 trillion euros , with germany , britain and france putting up a large share of that total .
however , officials in brussels note that the combined figure includes a significant amount of bank guarantees that may never be needed .
" if you look at the magnitude of this response , and the effects of coordination , they were credible .
and that is what markets and citizens are looking for , " barroso said .
the head of the eu executive also backed calls by french president nicolas sarkozy for an international conference to reform the global finance system .
" an urgent priority now must be to further deepen coordination at the international level , and specifically with the us , " barroso said .

" his contribution was very important . "
brown was invited to hold talks in paris ahead of the euro-summit , despite britain not being part of the 15-member eurogroup , whose finance ministers meet on a regular basis .
the commission chief also called on national governments to approve a series of proposals introducing common and tougher rules for banks , insurance companies and credit rating agencies .

here are some of the most important terms to know to understand the scope of the crisis . asset backed securities -lrb- abs -rrb- : a debt security collateralized by specific assets .
although the term applies to any debt backed by identified assets , it generally refers to securities backed by short- term collateral such as credit-card receivables , car loans , and home- equity loans .
credit crunch : since banks are now leery about lending money to one another , there is less money available for making consumer loans .
some companies have also begun to complain about problems in securing loans .
deposit insurance : a government guarantee on individual savings up to a certain monetary level , though some nations have opted to provide unlimited guarantees , regardless of the amount of savings held .
guarantee : the assumption of responsibility for payment of a debt or performance of some obligation if the liable party fails to perform to expectations .
interbank trade : refers to international trade between banks .
trade is usually conducted in currency , shares or commercial paper with fixed interest bonds .
liquidity squeeze : when an entity lacks the financial capital to pay its obligations in a timely manner , it is said to be suffering a liquidity squeeze .
currently , many nations are pumping billions into their banks to protect them from such a squeeze .
moratorium : a suspension of specific , or all , business activities to prevent additional damage .
sometimes a moratorium can be decreed by a nation .
sometimes a business can enact a moratorium on its own .
in bankruptcy law , a legally binding halt of the right to collect debt .
nationalization : the practice of a government to partially or wholly take control of the assets and administration of a private entity .
real economy : due to the credit crunch , the financial sector crisis is overlapping into manufacturing and services , which make up the so-called real economy .
in a worst-case scenario , this could mean an economic slowdown or a recession .
refinancing : banks need regular infusions of new money , in order to provide new loans or pay out savings .
they often find this money by going to their central bank , using deposits on hand or lending money to one another .
special purpose vehicle : financial institutions spin off special purpose vehicles so that they can focus on specific areas of the market .
many banks used these vehicles to invest in us mortgages .
using the vehicles kept the risky business off the banks ' corporate balance sheets .
subprime : mortgages granted to homeowners who can not provide proof of income or assets as collateral .
many such homeowners found themselves unable to pay off their mortgages over the last year as interest rates rose and house values sank .

15 to 20 next year - claim recent failed doping tests involving german rider stefan schumacher and his team gerolsteiner colleague bernhard kohl , have added to the pressure on the sport to clean up and increased lack of faith in cycling by supporters and investors alike .
" we have held intense discussions over the last few days and decided at the conclusion not to organize the 26th edition of the competition given the current situation in cycling , " organizer andreas kroll told german agency sid tuesday , oct .

" professional cycling has an enormous image problem at the moment which we ca n't currently change . "
on monday , it was announced that kohl , the best climber at this year 's tour de france and third overall , tested positive for the latest generation of the banned blood booster epo -lrb- erythropoietin -rrb- , named cera .
kohl is the fourth rider from the tour de france after italians riccardo ricco and leonardo piepoli , to test positive for the drug along with germany 's schumacher .
schumacher is currently the subject of an investigation into allegations of fraud after failing a dope test , stuttgart prosecutors confirmed last week .

the german cycling federation bdr and the country 's national anti-doping agency nada have also launched investigations , with the bdr giving schumacher a five-day deadline to explain himself .

he said that samples from around 30 riders , who had abnormal blood levels at the start of the july race , will be retested .
" we have already received strong hints of own blood doping cases .
we wo n't be able to say until a later date who that involves , " bordry told zdf .
" soon we will be able to detect own blood transfusions and we will then conduct the retests . "
the statement came after retests for cera caught out schumacher and the italians ricci and piepoli .
ricci already tested positive for cera during the tour and is banned from competition .

" this is about protection of citizens , not the protection of banking interests , " merkel said .
" we 're offering something and they have to offer something in return .

as a result of this foresight in seeing political capital in promoting entertainers to public office , actors-stroke-politicians have grown in credibility .
the success of reagan and schwarzenegger must have featured in the thought process which led to the left party 's decision tuesday , oct .
13 , to send television detective peter sodann up against incumbent horst koehler and social democratic challenger gesine schwan in the campaign to become germany 's next president .
swapping crime drama for politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sodann , left , in his role as kommissar ehrlicher in tatort sodann , better known among tv fans as kommissar ehrlicher in the german cult crime series tatort , was once considered a candidate for the bundestag for the left party 's former incarnation , the pds , in the 2005 parliamentary election .
however , he withdrew from the campaign only two days after announcing he would run - the reason being that his television paymasters would refuse to consider him for future roles .
while an unusual choice on the surface , sodann has some experience in dealing with political power .
one of east germany 's most popular actors , sodann was incarcerated for two years by the east german communist regime in the 1960s for directing a student theater whose program was defined as being " counter revolutionary . "
he served nine months of his sentence before being released from prison .
the actor , who featured in 45 episodes of tatort between 1991 and 2007 , has little realistic chance of winning .
however , while the left party must know it is effectively making up the numbers by putting forward sodann as their candidate , the publicity will no doubt raise the party 's profile even further at a time when it is making gains on the fractured social democrats and embattled christian democratic union ahead of september 2009 parliamentary elections .
left party looking for boosts to popularity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hanna schygulla was also considered by the left party sodann 's candidacy is not the first attempt by the left party to install an entertainer in the position of germany 's most prominent diplomat .
hanna schygulla , a protagonist in a number of films by director rainer werner fassbinder , was also considered as a candidate before being rejected by a party vote .
sodann will stand against koehler , the conservative incumbent , and spd 's schwan in the vote on may 23 when an assembly of lawmakers and state delegates elect the president .
at present , koehler appears to have just enough support to win re-election , while schwan would need left party votes to have any chance of winning .

the success of reagan and schwarzenegger must have featured in the thought process which led to the left party 's decision tuesday , oct .

swapping crime drama for politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sodann , left , in his role as kommissar ehrlicher in tatort sodann , better known among tv fans as kommissar ehrlicher in the german cult crime series tatort , was once considered a candidate for the bundestag for the left party 's former incarnation , the pds , in the 2005 parliamentary election .
however , he withdrew from the campaign only two days after announcing he would run - the reason being that his television paymasters would refuse to consider him for future roles .
while an unusual choice on the surface , sodann has some experience in dealing with political power .
one of east germany 's most popular actors , sodann was incarcerated for two years by the east german communist regime in the 1960s for directing a student theater whose program was defined as being " counter revolutionary . "
he served nine months of his sentence before being released from prison .
the actor , who featured in 45 episodes of tatort between 1991 and 2007 , has little realistic chance of winning .
however , while the left party must know it is effectively making up the numbers by putting forward sodann as their candidate , the publicity will no doubt raise the party 's profile even further at a time when it is making gains on the fractured social democrats and embattled christian democratic union ahead of september 2009 parliamentary elections .
left party looking for boosts to popularity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hanna schygulla was also considered by the left party sodann 's candidacy is not the first attempt by the left party to install an entertainer in the position of germany 's most prominent diplomat .
hanna schygulla , a protagonist in a number of films by director rainer werner fassbinder , was also considered as a candidate before being rejected by a party vote .
sodann will stand against koehler , the conservative incumbent , and spd 's schwan in the vote on may 23 when an assembly of lawmakers and state delegates elect the president .
at present , koehler appears to have just enough support to win re-election , while schwan would need left party votes to have any chance of winning .

14 , secured 200 million euros -lrb- $ 270 million -rrb- from each of the central banks in neighboring norway and denmark , but talks to secure a much larger loan from russia continued .
icelandic officials arrived in moscow on tuesday for talks , though geir haarde , iceland 's prime minister said the size of any loan from russia had not been decided .
" we look at this as a non-political deal , if there is to be a deal , " he said .
" i do n't know of any particular political strings that the russians would want to attach to this . "
on a third front , iceland is also in discussions with the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , though haarde said the country has not formally requested a loan .
if it does , it would become the first western european country to turn to the imf since 1976 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland 's prime minister geir haarde " we 're entitled to their services like everybody else but there is no decision on behalf of the government as to whether or not to apply for a loan , " haarde said .
" and there is no decision on behalf of the imf as to what kind of conditionality would be involved . "
the imf has sent a delegation to evaluate the situation in iceland , in a process which haarde has described as " friendly . "
" it 's not like the imf is here to take over the country , " he said .
rescuing a stricken economy iceland has been badly affected by the financial turmoil , which has resulted in its main commercial banks being nationalized by the state .
its currency has been severely weakened , and the local stock exchange was shut down for three days .
trading resumed on tuesday , but the day ended badly , with the omx iceland 15 index falling by 77 percent .
the icelandic index has lost 89 percent of its value this year , making it the worst performing stock exchange globally .
despite the grim economic realities , iceland 's president said tuesday that the tiny country is well positioned to recover , and can serve as a model on how to tackle the energy and climate change challenges .
" in the current global financial hurricane , iceland and others have been reminded , to use an analogy , that when a hurricane passes over the ocean toward the powerful mainland it usually crosses small islands where the destruction can be substantial , " olafur ragnar grimsson said in a video address to a united nations seminar on small states .
he said that experience has shown that " small states , due to their flexibility and the closely knit networks of cooperation which characterize their societies , can recover surprisingly quickly . "
iceland is currently campaigning for a two-year seat on the un security council , competing with austria and turkey for the two seats reserved for european states .
on friday , the un general assembly will elect five new members to replace the nations whose terms expire at the end of this year .
though iceland is considered a european country , it is not a member of the european union .
in the wake of the country 's near financial collapse , however , some politicians are raising the idea of joining the eu in order to safeguard the economy . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on a third front , iceland is also in discussions with the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , though haarde said the country has not formally requested a loan .

here are some of the most important terms to know to understand the scope of the crisis . asset backed securities -lrb- abs -rrb- : a debt security collateralized by specific assets .
although the term applies to any debt backed by identified assets , it generally refers to securities backed by short- term collateral such as credit-card receivables , car loans , and home- equity loans .
credit crunch : since banks are now leery about lending money to one another , there is less money available for making consumer loans .
some companies have also begun to complain about problems in securing loans .
deposit insurance : a government guarantee on individual savings up to a certain monetary level , though some nations have opted to provide unlimited guarantees , regardless of the amount of savings held .
guarantee : the assumption of responsibility for payment of a debt or performance of some obligation if the liable party fails to perform to expectations .
interbank trade : refers to international trade between banks .
trade is usually conducted in currency , shares or commercial paper with fixed interest bonds .
liquidity squeeze : when an entity lacks the financial capital to pay its obligations in a timely manner , it is said to be suffering a liquidity squeeze .
currently , many nations are pumping billions into their banks to protect them from such a squeeze .
moratorium : a suspension of specific , or all , business activities to prevent additional damage .
sometimes a moratorium can be decreed by a nation .
sometimes a business can enact a moratorium on its own .
in bankruptcy law , a legally binding halt of the right to collect debt .
nationalization : the practice of a government to partially or wholly take control of the assets and administration of a private entity .
real economy : due to the credit crunch , the financial sector crisis is overlapping into manufacturing and services , which make up the so-called real economy .
in a worst-case scenario , this could mean an economic slowdown or a recession .
refinancing : banks need regular infusions of new money , in order to provide new loans or pay out savings .
they often find this money by going to their central bank , using deposits on hand or lending money to one another .
special purpose vehicle : financial institutions spin off special purpose vehicles so that they can focus on specific areas of the market .
many banks used these vehicles to invest in us mortgages .
using the vehicles kept the risky business off the banks ' corporate balance sheets .
subprime : mortgages granted to homeowners who can not provide proof of income or assets as collateral .
many such homeowners found themselves unable to pay off their mortgages over the last year as interest rates rose and house values sank .

here are some of the most important terms to know to understand the scope of the crisis . asset backed securities -lrb- abs -rrb- : a debt security collateralized by specific assets .
although the term applies to any debt backed by identified assets , it generally refers to securities backed by short- term collateral such as credit-card receivables , car loans , and home- equity loans .
credit crunch : since banks are now leery about lending money to one another , there is less money available for making consumer loans .
some companies have also begun to complain about problems in securing loans .
deposit insurance : a government guarantee on individual savings up to a certain monetary level , though some nations have opted to provide unlimited guarantees , regardless of the amount of savings held .
guarantee : the assumption of responsibility for payment of a debt or performance of some obligation if the liable party fails to perform to expectations .
interbank trade : refers to international trade between banks .
trade is usually conducted in currency , shares or commercial paper with fixed interest bonds .
liquidity squeeze : when an entity lacks the financial capital to pay its obligations in a timely manner , it is said to be suffering a liquidity squeeze .
currently , many nations are pumping billions into their banks to protect them from such a squeeze .
moratorium : a suspension of specific , or all , business activities to prevent additional damage .
sometimes a moratorium can be decreed by a nation .
sometimes a business can enact a moratorium on its own .
in bankruptcy law , a legally binding halt of the right to collect debt .
nationalization : the practice of a government to partially or wholly take control of the assets and administration of a private entity .
real economy : due to the credit crunch , the financial sector crisis is overlapping into manufacturing and services , which make up the so-called real economy .
in a worst-case scenario , this could mean an economic slowdown or a recession .
refinancing : banks need regular infusions of new money , in order to provide new loans or pay out savings .
they often find this money by going to their central bank , using deposits on hand or lending money to one another .
special purpose vehicle : financial institutions spin off special purpose vehicles so that they can focus on specific areas of the market .
many banks used these vehicles to invest in us mortgages .
using the vehicles kept the risky business off the banks ' corporate balance sheets .
subprime : mortgages granted to homeowners who can not provide proof of income or assets as collateral .
many such homeowners found themselves unable to pay off their mortgages over the last year as interest rates rose and house values sank .
write-downs : reducing the book value of an asset because it is overvalued compared to the market value . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

warning that the unprecedented global financial crisis requires " unprecedented eu action , " european commission president jose manuel barroso has urged all eu governments to endorse a wide-ranging rescue plan . " i am pleased to see that there is now a consensus on the necessity and on the substance of a coherent effort , " barroso said of the plan worth an estimated 2 trillion euros -lrb- $ 2.7 trillion -rrb- .
" i expect confirmation and strengthening of this consistent and coherent effort by the european council . "
eu leaders are due to meet in brussels on wednesday and thursday for a regular autumn summit whose content will largely be devoted to the credit crunch .
discussions will focus on the outcome of a meeting in paris on sunday in which the 15 countries that share the euro approved a british-style financial rescue package which includes measures to guarantee interbank loans .
bank reluctance threatens recession bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reluctance to lend has had a terrible effect on markets the reluctance of banks to lend out their money is at the heart of the current financial crisis , which is in turn threatening to plunge european economies into recession .
euro zone governments also agreed in paris to guarantee at least 50,000 euros of their citizens ' bank deposits and to bail out financial institutions by providing them with cash in exchange for a share in such companies .
the combined potential cost of such measures for the eu as a whole has been estimated at around 2 trillion euros , with germany , britain and france putting up a large share of that total .
however , officials in brussels note that the combined figure includes a significant amount of bank guarantees that may never be needed .
" if you look at the magnitude of this response , and the effects of coordination , they were credible .
and that is what markets and citizens are looking for , " barroso said .
the head of the eu executive also backed calls by french president nicolas sarkozy for an international conference to reform the global finance system .
" an urgent priority now must be to further deepen coordination at the international level , and specifically with the us , " barroso said .
britain 's brown gets praise for efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro zone 's rescue team owes a lot to brown and he heaped praise on british prime minister gordon brown , whose national rescue plan largely inspired the eu 's own plan .
" let me say on this occasion how appreciative we are of the efforts of prime minister gordon brown , " barroso said .
" his contribution was very important . "
brown was invited to hold talks in paris ahead of the euro-summit , despite britain not being part of the 15-member eurogroup , whose finance ministers meet on a regular basis .
the commission chief also called on national governments to approve a series of proposals introducing common and tougher rules for banks , insurance companies and credit rating agencies .
" even after this crisis , there are some governments that are opposing a more coordinated european approach , " barroso said .
" -lrb- but -rrb- i have boundless faith in the sense of responsibility and the common sense of our heads of state and government .

warning that the unprecedented global financial crisis requires " unprecedented eu action , " european commission president jose manuel barroso has urged all eu governments to endorse a wide-ranging rescue plan . " i am pleased to see that there is now a consensus on the necessity and on the substance of a coherent effort , " barroso said of the plan worth an estimated 2 trillion euros -lrb- $ 2.7 trillion -rrb- .
" i expect confirmation and strengthening of this consistent and coherent effort by the european council . "
eu leaders are due to meet in brussels on wednesday and thursday for a regular autumn summit whose content will largely be devoted to the credit crunch .
discussions will focus on the outcome of a meeting in paris on sunday in which the 15 countries that share the euro approved a british-style financial rescue package which includes measures to guarantee interbank loans .
bank reluctance threatens recession bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reluctance to lend has had a terrible effect on markets the reluctance of banks to lend out their money is at the heart of the current financial crisis , which is in turn threatening to plunge european economies into recession .
euro zone governments also agreed in paris to guarantee at least 50,000 euros of their citizens ' bank deposits and to bail out financial institutions by providing them with cash in exchange for a share in such companies .
the combined potential cost of such measures for the eu as a whole has been estimated at around 2 trillion euros , with germany , britain and france putting up a large share of that total .
however , officials in brussels note that the combined figure includes a significant amount of bank guarantees that may never be needed .
" if you look at the magnitude of this response , and the effects of coordination , they were credible .
and that is what markets and citizens are looking for , " barroso said .
the head of the eu executive also backed calls by french president nicolas sarkozy for an international conference to reform the global finance system .
" an urgent priority now must be to further deepen coordination at the international level , and specifically with the us , " barroso said .
britain 's brown gets praise for efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro zone 's rescue team owes a lot to brown and he heaped praise on british prime minister gordon brown , whose national rescue plan largely inspired the eu 's own plan .
" let me say on this occasion how appreciative we are of the efforts of prime minister gordon brown , " barroso said .
" his contribution was very important . "
brown was invited to hold talks in paris ahead of the euro-summit , despite britain not being part of the 15-member eurogroup , whose finance ministers meet on a regular basis .
the commission chief also called on national governments to approve a series of proposals introducing common and tougher rules for banks , insurance companies and credit rating agencies .
" even after this crisis , there are some governments that are opposing a more coordinated european approach , " barroso said .
" -lrb- but -rrb- i have boundless faith in the sense of responsibility and the common sense of our heads of state and government .

but economy minister glos said berlin would offer support to struggling exporters . finance minister peer steinbrueck said he was " not prepared to announce a bailout plan for the auto sector or promise tax breaks just because the industry is applying pressure , " in an interview with weekly die zeit to appear on thursday , oct .
16 . on monday , german chancellor angela merkel had rejected a comprehensive economic rescue package despite signs that europe 's biggest economy was heading into recession .
but she was less adamant about germany 's key auto sector in light of $ 25 billion -lrb- 19 billion euros -rrb- worth of aid offered to automakers that have produced cars in the united states for 20 years . france also announced a program that offers 400 million euros to carmakers to promote the development of environmentally automobiles . economic downturn hurts automakers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german automakers want the state to create incentives for people to buy new cars " we will probably have to strongly support the automobile industry ... though that poses questions about european competitiveness , " merkel said .
" we have to look again at how we can react .
aside from that , there will be no economic package in the classic sense . " germany 's vda auto federation then called for " political investment incentives , " such as tax credits for consumers buying new cars and changes to the auto tax changes linked to greenhouse gas emissions to induce owners of older cars to buy new ones . " effects of the financial crisis and global economic deterioration have made conditions more difficult on auto industry markets , " vda president matthias wissmann said tuesday in a statement . car sales in europe dropped by 8.2 percent in september to 1.3 million and sales for the year are down 4 percent to 11.7 million , the european automobile manufacturers ' association said on wednesday . several german car makers have recently announced production cutbacks and revised 2008 earnings owing to slumping auto sales . help for exporters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the auto industry is only one of the sectors impacted by the financial crisis in a move likely to please the export-heavy auto industry , economy minister michael glos said wednesday that the government would aid german exporters . " the deterioration in the overall economic environment can lead to a loss of export momentum , " he said in a statement .
" the slowdown we 're seeing in a number of european countries , and the expected recession in the united states , will put the dampeners on exports . " german was prepared to boost export credit guarantees called the " hermes cover , " glos said .
the governments uses the guarantees to protect german businesses by taking over debt from foreign entities that do not pay their bills . the state engaged in 17 billion euros worth of such guarantees in 2007 , which was less than 2 percent of germany 's 969 billion euros in total exports . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but economy minister glos said berlin would offer support to struggling exporters . finance minister peer steinbrueck said he was " not prepared to announce a bailout plan for the auto sector or promise tax breaks just because the industry is applying pressure , " in an interview with weekly die zeit to appear on thursday , oct .
16 . on monday , german chancellor angela merkel had rejected a comprehensive economic rescue package despite signs that europe 's biggest economy was heading into recession .
but she was less adamant about germany 's key auto sector in light of $ 25 billion -lrb- 19 billion euros -rrb- worth of aid offered to automakers that have produced cars in the united states for 20 years . france also announced a program that offers 400 million euros to carmakers to promote the development of environmentally automobiles . economic downturn hurts automakers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german automakers want the state to create incentives for people to buy new cars " we will probably have to strongly support the automobile industry ... though that poses questions about european competitiveness , " merkel said .
" we have to look again at how we can react .
aside from that , there will be no economic package in the classic sense . " germany 's vda auto federation then called for " political investment incentives , " such as tax credits for consumers buying new cars and changes to the auto tax changes linked to greenhouse gas emissions to induce owners of older cars to buy new ones . " effects of the financial crisis and global economic deterioration have made conditions more difficult on auto industry markets , " vda president matthias wissmann said tuesday in a statement . car sales in europe dropped by 8.2 percent in september to 1.3 million and sales for the year are down 4 percent to 11.7 million , the european automobile manufacturers ' association said on wednesday . several german car makers have recently announced production cutbacks and revised 2008 earnings owing to slumping auto sales . help for exporters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the auto industry is only one of the sectors impacted by the financial crisis in a move likely to please the export-heavy auto industry , economy minister michael glos said wednesday that the government would aid german exporters . " the deterioration in the overall economic environment can lead to a loss of export momentum , " he said in a statement .
" the slowdown we 're seeing in a number of european countries , and the expected recession in the united states , will put the dampeners on exports . " german was prepared to boost export credit guarantees called the " hermes cover , " glos said .
the governments uses the guarantees to protect german businesses by taking over debt from foreign entities that do not pay their bills . the state engaged in 17 billion euros worth of such guarantees in 2007 , which was less than 2 percent of germany 's 969 billion euros in total exports . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de doping -pipe- 15.10.2008 organizers cancel tour of stuttgart as cycling scandals increase großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doping scandals have continually overshadowed cycling in the last few years cycling took another major blow when it was announced that the 2009 tour of stuttgart would be cancelled due to recent doping scandals which have tarnished the sport 's image in the german city . the organizers of the six-day event - due to be held in the southern german city from jan .
15 to 20 next year - claim recent failed doping tests involving german rider stefan schumacher and his team gerolsteiner colleague bernhard kohl , have added to the pressure on the sport to clean up and increased lack of faith in cycling by supporters and investors alike .
" we have held intense discussions over the last few days and decided at the conclusion not to organize the 26th edition of the competition given the current situation in cycling , " organizer andreas kroll told german agency sid tuesday , oct .
14 .
" professional cycling has an enormous image problem at the moment which we ca n't currently change . "
on monday , it was announced that kohl , the best climber at this year 's tour de france and third overall , tested positive for the latest generation of the banned blood booster epo -lrb- erythropoietin -rrb- , named cera .
kohl is the fourth rider from the tour de france after italians riccardo ricco and leonardo piepoli , to test positive for the drug along with germany 's schumacher .
schumacher is currently the subject of an investigation into allegations of fraud after failing a dope test , stuttgart prosecutors confirmed last week .
the 27-year-old 's house was recently searched with items taken away to be evaluated as possible evidence , a spokeswoman for the stuttgart prosecutor 's office told reporters last thursday .
schumacher caught in retest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schumacher faces a two-year ban if found guilty at the same time , the french anti-doping agency afld , which was responsible for the anti-doping program at the 2008 tour , said in a statement that schumacher tested positive twice for the newest version of the epo blood-booster , cera -lrb- continuous erythropoiesis receptor activator -rrb- , at the tour de france in july .
schumacher , who made no statement during the search of his home , will have the opportunity to give his side of the story in the investigation into whether he fraudulently deceived his gerolsteiner team .
prosecutors have also looked at documents belonging to gerolsteiner team principal hans-michael holczer .
schumacher won both individual time trials at the tour and was the overall leader of the race for two days .
he faces a two-year ban if found guilty of doping .
the german cycling federation bdr and the country 's national anti-doping agency nada have also launched investigations , with the bdr giving schumacher a five-day deadline to explain himself .
schumacher has already been suspended by his gerolsteiner team but the rider 's lawyer michael lehner criticized the doping procedures surrounding the retests at the french laboratory in chatenay-malabry .
" it is completely unclear , according to the documents available , under what circumstances and which blood samples returned apparently positive results for cera in the laboratory in chatenay-malabry , " he said in a statement .
meanwhile , schumacher 's gerolsteiner teammate sebastian lang told the radsport-news internet site that the cyclist had been asked if his team should " be worried . "
" stefan reassured us that everything was in order , " he said .
new revelations lead to review of samples bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyclists may have used illegal blood transfusions such are the continuing revelations of doping from this year 's tour that samples from the july race will be retested for illegal own blood transfusions which could reveal further drug cheats at the famed event .
the head of the afld , pierre bordry , told german state network zdf that a new test to detect this illegal method is currently being developed .
he said that samples from around 30 riders , who had abnormal blood levels at the start of the july race , will be retested .
" we have already received strong hints of own blood doping cases .
we wo n't be able to say until a later date who that involves , " bordry told zdf .
" soon we will be able to detect own blood transfusions and we will then conduct the retests . "
the statement came after retests for cera caught out schumacher and the italians ricci and piepoli .
ricci already tested positive for cera during the tour and is banned from competition .
the newly developed cera test was also conducted among the riders with abnormal levels .
the test has also prompted the international olympic committee to order retests of the samples gathered at cycling and all other sports at the beijing games .
" the ioc intends to retest the samples collected this summer during the olympic games in beijing .
substances that will be tested for across all sports include epo cera , " ioc spokeswoman emmanuelle moreau told reporters last week .
it was not known immediately whether the ioc retests included own blood transfusions . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

15 to 20 next year - claim recent failed doping tests involving german rider stefan schumacher and his team gerolsteiner colleague bernhard kohl , have added to the pressure on the sport to clean up and increased lack of faith in cycling by supporters and investors alike .

on monday , it was announced that kohl , the best climber at this year 's tour de france and third overall , tested positive for the latest generation of the banned blood booster epo -lrb- erythropoietin -rrb- , named cera .
kohl is the fourth rider from the tour de france after italians riccardo ricco and leonardo piepoli , to test positive for the drug along with germany 's schumacher .
schumacher is currently the subject of an investigation into allegations of fraud after failing a dope test , stuttgart prosecutors confirmed last week .

he faces a two-year ban if found guilty of doping .
the german cycling federation bdr and the country 's national anti-doping agency nada have also launched investigations , with the bdr giving schumacher a five-day deadline to explain himself .

the statement came after retests for cera caught out schumacher and the italians ricci and piepoli .
ricci already tested positive for cera during the tour and is banned from competition .

15 to 20 next year - claim recent failed doping tests involving german rider stefan schumacher and his team gerolsteiner colleague bernhard kohl , have added to the pressure on the sport to clean up and increased lack of faith in cycling by supporters and investors alike .
" we have held intense discussions over the last few days and decided at the conclusion not to organize the 26th edition of the competition given the current situation in cycling , " organizer andreas kroll told german agency sid tuesday , oct .
14 .
" professional cycling has an enormous image problem at the moment which we ca n't currently change . "
on monday , it was announced that kohl , the best climber at this year 's tour de france and third overall , tested positive for the latest generation of the banned blood booster epo -lrb- erythropoietin -rrb- , named cera .
kohl is the fourth rider from the tour de france after italians riccardo ricco and leonardo piepoli , to test positive for the drug along with germany 's schumacher .
schumacher is currently the subject of an investigation into allegations of fraud after failing a dope test , stuttgart prosecutors confirmed last week .
the 27-year-old 's house was recently searched with items taken away to be evaluated as possible evidence , a spokeswoman for the stuttgart prosecutor 's office told reporters last thursday .
schumacher caught in retest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schumacher faces a two-year ban if found guilty at the same time , the french anti-doping agency afld , which was responsible for the anti-doping program at the 2008 tour , said in a statement that schumacher tested positive twice for the newest version of the epo blood-booster , cera -lrb- continuous erythropoiesis receptor activator -rrb- , at the tour de france in july .
schumacher , who made no statement during the search of his home , will have the opportunity to give his side of the story in the investigation into whether he fraudulently deceived his gerolsteiner team .
prosecutors have also looked at documents belonging to gerolsteiner team principal hans-michael holczer .
schumacher won both individual time trials at the tour and was the overall leader of the race for two days .
he faces a two-year ban if found guilty of doping .
the german cycling federation bdr and the country 's national anti-doping agency nada have also launched investigations , with the bdr giving schumacher a five-day deadline to explain himself .
schumacher has already been suspended by his gerolsteiner team but the rider 's lawyer michael lehner criticized the doping procedures surrounding the retests at the french laboratory in chatenay-malabry .
" it is completely unclear , according to the documents available , under what circumstances and which blood samples returned apparently positive results for cera in the laboratory in chatenay-malabry , " he said in a statement .
meanwhile , schumacher 's gerolsteiner teammate sebastian lang told the radsport-news internet site that the cyclist had been asked if his team should " be worried . "
" stefan reassured us that everything was in order , " he said .
new revelations lead to review of samples bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyclists may have used illegal blood transfusions such are the continuing revelations of doping from this year 's tour that samples from the july race will be retested for illegal own blood transfusions which could reveal further drug cheats at the famed event .
the head of the afld , pierre bordry , told german state network zdf that a new test to detect this illegal method is currently being developed .
he said that samples from around 30 riders , who had abnormal blood levels at the start of the july race , will be retested .
" we have already received strong hints of own blood doping cases .
we wo n't be able to say until a later date who that involves , " bordry told zdf .
" soon we will be able to detect own blood transfusions and we will then conduct the retests . "
the statement came after retests for cera caught out schumacher and the italians ricci and piepoli .
ricci already tested positive for cera during the tour and is banned from competition .
the newly developed cera test was also conducted among the riders with abnormal levels .
the test has also prompted the international olympic committee to order retests of the samples gathered at cycling and all other sports at the beijing games .
" the ioc intends to retest the samples collected this summer during the olympic games in beijing .
substances that will be tested for across all sports include epo cera , " ioc spokeswoman emmanuelle moreau told reporters last week .

but economy minister glos said berlin would offer support to struggling exporters . finance minister peer steinbrueck said he was " not prepared to announce a bailout plan for the auto sector or promise tax breaks just because the industry is applying pressure , " in an interview with weekly die zeit to appear on thursday , oct .
16 . on monday , german chancellor angela merkel had rejected a comprehensive economic rescue package despite signs that europe 's biggest economy was heading into recession .
but she was less adamant about germany 's key auto sector in light of $ 25 billion -lrb- 19 billion euros -rrb- worth of aid offered to automakers that have produced cars in the united states for 20 years . france also announced a program that offers 400 million euros to carmakers to promote the development of environmentally automobiles . economic downturn hurts automakers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german automakers want the state to create incentives for people to buy new cars " we will probably have to strongly support the automobile industry ... though that poses questions about european competitiveness , " merkel said .
" we have to look again at how we can react .
aside from that , there will be no economic package in the classic sense . " germany 's vda auto federation then called for " political investment incentives , " such as tax credits for consumers buying new cars and changes to the auto tax changes linked to greenhouse gas emissions to induce owners of older cars to buy new ones . " effects of the financial crisis and global economic deterioration have made conditions more difficult on auto industry markets , " vda president matthias wissmann said tuesday in a statement . car sales in europe dropped by 8.2 percent in september to 1.3 million and sales for the year are down 4 percent to 11.7 million , the european automobile manufacturers ' association said on wednesday . several german car makers have recently announced production cutbacks and revised 2008 earnings owing to slumping auto sales . help for exporters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the auto industry is only one of the sectors impacted by the financial crisis in a move likely to please the export-heavy auto industry , economy minister michael glos said wednesday that the government would aid german exporters . " the deterioration in the overall economic environment can lead to a loss of export momentum , " he said in a statement .
" the slowdown we 're seeing in a number of european countries , and the expected recession in the united states , will put the dampeners on exports . " german was prepared to boost export credit guarantees called the " hermes cover , " glos said .
the governments uses the guarantees to protect german businesses by taking over debt from foreign entities that do not pay their bills . the state engaged in 17 billion euros worth of such guarantees in 2007 , which was less than 2 percent of germany 's 969 billion euros in total exports . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

warning that the unprecedented global financial crisis requires " unprecedented eu action , " european commission president jose manuel barroso has urged all eu governments to endorse a wide-ranging rescue plan . " i am pleased to see that there is now a consensus on the necessity and on the substance of a coherent effort , " barroso said of the plan worth an estimated 2 trillion euros -lrb- $ 2.7 trillion -rrb- .
" i expect confirmation and strengthening of this consistent and coherent effort by the european council . "
eu leaders are due to meet in brussels on wednesday and thursday for a regular autumn summit whose content will largely be devoted to the credit crunch .
discussions will focus on the outcome of a meeting in paris on sunday in which the 15 countries that share the euro approved a british-style financial rescue package which includes measures to guarantee interbank loans .
bank reluctance threatens recession bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reluctance to lend has had a terrible effect on markets the reluctance of banks to lend out their money is at the heart of the current financial crisis , which is in turn threatening to plunge european economies into recession .
euro zone governments also agreed in paris to guarantee at least 50,000 euros of their citizens ' bank deposits and to bail out financial institutions by providing them with cash in exchange for a share in such companies .
the combined potential cost of such measures for the eu as a whole has been estimated at around 2 trillion euros , with germany , britain and france putting up a large share of that total .
however , officials in brussels note that the combined figure includes a significant amount of bank guarantees that may never be needed .
" if you look at the magnitude of this response , and the effects of coordination , they were credible .
and that is what markets and citizens are looking for , " barroso said .
the head of the eu executive also backed calls by french president nicolas sarkozy for an international conference to reform the global finance system .
" an urgent priority now must be to further deepen coordination at the international level , and specifically with the us , " barroso said .
britain 's brown gets praise for efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro zone 's rescue team owes a lot to brown and he heaped praise on british prime minister gordon brown , whose national rescue plan largely inspired the eu 's own plan .
" let me say on this occasion how appreciative we are of the efforts of prime minister gordon brown , " barroso said .
" his contribution was very important . "
brown was invited to hold talks in paris ahead of the euro-summit , despite britain not being part of the 15-member eurogroup , whose finance ministers meet on a regular basis .
the commission chief also called on national governments to approve a series of proposals introducing common and tougher rules for banks , insurance companies and credit rating agencies .
" even after this crisis , there are some governments that are opposing a more coordinated european approach , " barroso said .
" -lrb- but -rrb- i have boundless faith in the sense of responsibility and the common sense of our heads of state and government .

warning that the unprecedented global financial crisis requires " unprecedented eu action , " european commission president jose manuel barroso has urged all eu governments to endorse a wide-ranging rescue plan . " i am pleased to see that there is now a consensus on the necessity and on the substance of a coherent effort , " barroso said of the plan worth an estimated 2 trillion euros -lrb- $ 2.7 trillion -rrb- .
" i expect confirmation and strengthening of this consistent and coherent effort by the european council . "
eu leaders are due to meet in brussels on wednesday and thursday for a regular autumn summit whose content will largely be devoted to the credit crunch .
discussions will focus on the outcome of a meeting in paris on sunday in which the 15 countries that share the euro approved a british-style financial rescue package which includes measures to guarantee interbank loans .
bank reluctance threatens recession bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reluctance to lend has had a terrible effect on markets the reluctance of banks to lend out their money is at the heart of the current financial crisis , which is in turn threatening to plunge european economies into recession .
euro zone governments also agreed in paris to guarantee at least 50,000 euros of their citizens ' bank deposits and to bail out financial institutions by providing them with cash in exchange for a share in such companies .
the combined potential cost of such measures for the eu as a whole has been estimated at around 2 trillion euros , with germany , britain and france putting up a large share of that total .
however , officials in brussels note that the combined figure includes a significant amount of bank guarantees that may never be needed .
" if you look at the magnitude of this response , and the effects of coordination , they were credible .
and that is what markets and citizens are looking for , " barroso said .
the head of the eu executive also backed calls by french president nicolas sarkozy for an international conference to reform the global finance system .
" an urgent priority now must be to further deepen coordination at the international level , and specifically with the us , " barroso said .
britain 's brown gets praise for efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro zone 's rescue team owes a lot to brown and he heaped praise on british prime minister gordon brown , whose national rescue plan largely inspired the eu 's own plan .
" let me say on this occasion how appreciative we are of the efforts of prime minister gordon brown , " barroso said .
" his contribution was very important . "
brown was invited to hold talks in paris ahead of the euro-summit , despite britain not being part of the 15-member eurogroup , whose finance ministers meet on a regular basis .
the commission chief also called on national governments to approve a series of proposals introducing common and tougher rules for banks , insurance companies and credit rating agencies .
" even after this crisis , there are some governments that are opposing a more coordinated european approach , " barroso said .
" -lrb- but -rrb- i have boundless faith in the sense of responsibility and the common sense of our heads of state and government .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 15.10.2008 financial crisis : a glossary of terms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world of finance can be a confusing and frustrating place the global economy has been thrashed for the last year by the financial crisis .
here are some of the most important terms to know to understand the scope of the crisis . asset backed securities -lrb- abs -rrb- : a debt security collateralized by specific assets .
although the term applies to any debt backed by identified assets , it generally refers to securities backed by short- term collateral such as credit-card receivables , car loans , and home- equity loans .
credit crunch : since banks are now leery about lending money to one another , there is less money available for making consumer loans .
some companies have also begun to complain about problems in securing loans .
deposit insurance : a government guarantee on individual savings up to a certain monetary level , though some nations have opted to provide unlimited guarantees , regardless of the amount of savings held .
guarantee : the assumption of responsibility for payment of a debt or performance of some obligation if the liable party fails to perform to expectations .
interbank trade : refers to international trade between banks .
trade is usually conducted in currency , shares or commercial paper with fixed interest bonds .
liquidity squeeze : when an entity lacks the financial capital to pay its obligations in a timely manner , it is said to be suffering a liquidity squeeze .
currently , many nations are pumping billions into their banks to protect them from such a squeeze .
moratorium : a suspension of specific , or all , business activities to prevent additional damage .
sometimes a moratorium can be decreed by a nation .
sometimes a business can enact a moratorium on its own .
in bankruptcy law , a legally binding halt of the right to collect debt .
nationalization : the practice of a government to partially or wholly take control of the assets and administration of a private entity .
real economy : due to the credit crunch , the financial sector crisis is overlapping into manufacturing and services , which make up the so-called real economy .
in a worst-case scenario , this could mean an economic slowdown or a recession .
refinancing : banks need regular infusions of new money , in order to provide new loans or pay out savings .
they often find this money by going to their central bank , using deposits on hand or lending money to one another .
special purpose vehicle : financial institutions spin off special purpose vehicles so that they can focus on specific areas of the market .
many banks used these vehicles to invest in us mortgages .
using the vehicles kept the risky business off the banks ' corporate balance sheets .
subprime : mortgages granted to homeowners who can not provide proof of income or assets as collateral .
many such homeowners found themselves unable to pay off their mortgages over the last year as interest rates rose and house values sank .
write-downs : reducing the book value of an asset because it is overvalued compared to the market value . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

here are some of the most important terms to know to understand the scope of the crisis . asset backed securities -lrb- abs -rrb- : a debt security collateralized by specific assets .
although the term applies to any debt backed by identified assets , it generally refers to securities backed by short- term collateral such as credit-card receivables , car loans , and home- equity loans .
credit crunch : since banks are now leery about lending money to one another , there is less money available for making consumer loans .
some companies have also begun to complain about problems in securing loans .
deposit insurance : a government guarantee on individual savings up to a certain monetary level , though some nations have opted to provide unlimited guarantees , regardless of the amount of savings held .
guarantee : the assumption of responsibility for payment of a debt or performance of some obligation if the liable party fails to perform to expectations .
interbank trade : refers to international trade between banks .
trade is usually conducted in currency , shares or commercial paper with fixed interest bonds .
liquidity squeeze : when an entity lacks the financial capital to pay its obligations in a timely manner , it is said to be suffering a liquidity squeeze .
currently , many nations are pumping billions into their banks to protect them from such a squeeze .

sometimes a moratorium can be decreed by a nation .
sometimes a business can enact a moratorium on its own .
in bankruptcy law , a legally binding halt of the right to collect debt .
nationalization : the practice of a government to partially or wholly take control of the assets and administration of a private entity .
real economy : due to the credit crunch , the financial sector crisis is overlapping into manufacturing and services , which make up the so-called real economy .
in a worst-case scenario , this could mean an economic slowdown or a recession .
refinancing : banks need regular infusions of new money , in order to provide new loans or pay out savings .
they often find this money by going to their central bank , using deposits on hand or lending money to one another .
special purpose vehicle : financial institutions spin off special purpose vehicles so that they can focus on specific areas of the market .
many banks used these vehicles to invest in us mortgages .
using the vehicles kept the risky business off the banks ' corporate balance sheets .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 15.10.2008 in finance crisis , iceland does n't want to be an island großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland is struggling to keep its economy afloat with iceland 's economy frozen by the global financial crisis , the tiny nordic country continues to explore options for recovery , turning to the imf , russia and the eu for help . under a currency swap agreement , iceland on tuesday , oct .
14 , secured 200 million euros -lrb- $ 270 million -rrb- from each of the central banks in neighboring norway and denmark , but talks to secure a much larger loan from russia continued .
icelandic officials arrived in moscow on tuesday for talks , though geir haarde , iceland 's prime minister said the size of any loan from russia had not been decided .
" we look at this as a non-political deal , if there is to be a deal , " he said .
" i do n't know of any particular political strings that the russians would want to attach to this . "
on a third front , iceland is also in discussions with the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , though haarde said the country has not formally requested a loan .
if it does , it would become the first western european country to turn to the imf since 1976 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iceland 's prime minister geir haarde " we 're entitled to their services like everybody else but there is no decision on behalf of the government as to whether or not to apply for a loan , " haarde said .
" and there is no decision on behalf of the imf as to what kind of conditionality would be involved . "
the imf has sent a delegation to evaluate the situation in iceland , in a process which haarde has described as " friendly . "
" it 's not like the imf is here to take over the country , " he said .
rescuing a stricken economy iceland has been badly affected by the financial turmoil , which has resulted in its main commercial banks being nationalized by the state .
its currency has been severely weakened , and the local stock exchange was shut down for three days .
trading resumed on tuesday , but the day ended badly , with the omx iceland 15 index falling by 77 percent .
the icelandic index has lost 89 percent of its value this year , making it the worst performing stock exchange globally .
despite the grim economic realities , iceland 's president said tuesday that the tiny country is well positioned to recover , and can serve as a model on how to tackle the energy and climate change challenges .
" in the current global financial hurricane , iceland and others have been reminded , to use an analogy , that when a hurricane passes over the ocean toward the powerful mainland it usually crosses small islands where the destruction can be substantial , " olafur ragnar grimsson said in a video address to a united nations seminar on small states .
he said that experience has shown that " small states , due to their flexibility and the closely knit networks of cooperation which characterize their societies , can recover surprisingly quickly . "
iceland is currently campaigning for a two-year seat on the un security council , competing with austria and turkey for the two seats reserved for european states .
on friday , the un general assembly will elect five new members to replace the nations whose terms expire at the end of this year .
though iceland is considered a european country , it is not a member of the european union .
in the wake of the country 's near financial collapse , however , some politicians are raising the idea of joining the eu in order to safeguard the economy . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on monday , it was announced that kohl , the best climber at this year 's tour de france and third overall , tested positive for the latest generation of the banned blood booster epo -lrb- erythropoietin -rrb- , named cera .
kohl is the fourth rider from the tour de france after italians riccardo ricco and leonardo piepoli , to test positive for the drug along with germany 's schumacher .
schumacher is currently the subject of an investigation into allegations of fraud after failing a dope test , stuttgart prosecutors confirmed last week .

the german cycling federation bdr and the country 's national anti-doping agency nada have also launched investigations , with the bdr giving schumacher a five-day deadline to explain himself .
schumacher has already been suspended by his gerolsteiner team but the rider 's lawyer michael lehner criticized the doping procedures surrounding the retests at the french laboratory in chatenay-malabry .
" it is completely unclear , according to the documents available , under what circumstances and which blood samples returned apparently positive results for cera in the laboratory in chatenay-malabry , " he said in a statement .

the statement came after retests for cera caught out schumacher and the italians ricci and piepoli .
ricci already tested positive for cera during the tour and is banned from competition .
the newly developed cera test was also conducted among the riders with abnormal levels .
the test has also prompted the international olympic committee to order retests of the samples gathered at cycling and all other sports at the beijing games .

15 to 20 next year - claim recent failed doping tests involving german rider stefan schumacher and his team gerolsteiner colleague bernhard kohl , have added to the pressure on the sport to clean up and increased lack of faith in cycling by supporters and investors alike .
" we have held intense discussions over the last few days and decided at the conclusion not to organize the 26th edition of the competition given the current situation in cycling , " organizer andreas kroll told german agency sid tuesday , oct .
14 .
" professional cycling has an enormous image problem at the moment which we ca n't currently change . "
on monday , it was announced that kohl , the best climber at this year 's tour de france and third overall , tested positive for the latest generation of the banned blood booster epo -lrb- erythropoietin -rrb- , named cera .
kohl is the fourth rider from the tour de france after italians riccardo ricco and leonardo piepoli , to test positive for the drug along with germany 's schumacher .
schumacher is currently the subject of an investigation into allegations of fraud after failing a dope test , stuttgart prosecutors confirmed last week .
the 27-year-old 's house was recently searched with items taken away to be evaluated as possible evidence , a spokeswoman for the stuttgart prosecutor 's office told reporters last thursday .
schumacher caught in retest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schumacher faces a two-year ban if found guilty at the same time , the french anti-doping agency afld , which was responsible for the anti-doping program at the 2008 tour , said in a statement that schumacher tested positive twice for the newest version of the epo blood-booster , cera -lrb- continuous erythropoiesis receptor activator -rrb- , at the tour de france in july .
schumacher , who made no statement during the search of his home , will have the opportunity to give his side of the story in the investigation into whether he fraudulently deceived his gerolsteiner team .
prosecutors have also looked at documents belonging to gerolsteiner team principal hans-michael holczer .
schumacher won both individual time trials at the tour and was the overall leader of the race for two days .
he faces a two-year ban if found guilty of doping .
the german cycling federation bdr and the country 's national anti-doping agency nada have also launched investigations , with the bdr giving schumacher a five-day deadline to explain himself .
schumacher has already been suspended by his gerolsteiner team but the rider 's lawyer michael lehner criticized the doping procedures surrounding the retests at the french laboratory in chatenay-malabry .
" it is completely unclear , according to the documents available , under what circumstances and which blood samples returned apparently positive results for cera in the laboratory in chatenay-malabry , " he said in a statement .
meanwhile , schumacher 's gerolsteiner teammate sebastian lang told the radsport-news internet site that the cyclist had been asked if his team should " be worried . "
" stefan reassured us that everything was in order , " he said .
new revelations lead to review of samples bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyclists may have used illegal blood transfusions such are the continuing revelations of doping from this year 's tour that samples from the july race will be retested for illegal own blood transfusions which could reveal further drug cheats at the famed event .
the head of the afld , pierre bordry , told german state network zdf that a new test to detect this illegal method is currently being developed .
he said that samples from around 30 riders , who had abnormal blood levels at the start of the july race , will be retested .
" we have already received strong hints of own blood doping cases .
we wo n't be able to say until a later date who that involves , " bordry told zdf .
" soon we will be able to detect own blood transfusions and we will then conduct the retests . "
the statement came after retests for cera caught out schumacher and the italians ricci and piepoli .
ricci already tested positive for cera during the tour and is banned from competition .
the newly developed cera test was also conducted among the riders with abnormal levels .
the test has also prompted the international olympic committee to order retests of the samples gathered at cycling and all other sports at the beijing games .
" the ioc intends to retest the samples collected this summer during the olympic games in beijing .
substances that will be tested for across all sports include epo cera , " ioc spokeswoman emmanuelle moreau told reporters last week .

as a result of this foresight in seeing political capital in promoting entertainers to public office , actors-stroke-politicians have grown in credibility .
the success of reagan and schwarzenegger must have featured in the thought process which led to the left party 's decision tuesday , oct .
13 , to send television detective peter sodann up against incumbent horst koehler and social democratic challenger gesine schwan in the campaign to become germany 's next president .
swapping crime drama for politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sodann , left , in his role as kommissar ehrlicher in tatort sodann , better known among tv fans as kommissar ehrlicher in the german cult crime series tatort , was once considered a candidate for the bundestag for the left party 's former incarnation , the pds , in the 2005 parliamentary election .
however , he withdrew from the campaign only two days after announcing he would run - the reason being that his television paymasters would refuse to consider him for future roles .
while an unusual choice on the surface , sodann has some experience in dealing with political power .
one of east germany 's most popular actors , sodann was incarcerated for two years by the east german communist regime in the 1960s for directing a student theater whose program was defined as being " counter revolutionary . "
he served nine months of his sentence before being released from prison .
the actor , who featured in 45 episodes of tatort between 1991 and 2007 , has little realistic chance of winning .
however , while the left party must know it is effectively making up the numbers by putting forward sodann as their candidate , the publicity will no doubt raise the party 's profile even further at a time when it is making gains on the fractured social democrats and embattled christian democratic union ahead of september 2009 parliamentary elections .
left party looking for boosts to popularity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hanna schygulla was also considered by the left party sodann 's candidacy is not the first attempt by the left party to install an entertainer in the position of germany 's most prominent diplomat .
hanna schygulla , a protagonist in a number of films by director rainer werner fassbinder , was also considered as a candidate before being rejected by a party vote .
sodann will stand against koehler , the conservative incumbent , and spd 's schwan in the vote on may 23 when an assembly of lawmakers and state delegates elect the president .
at present , koehler appears to have just enough support to win re-election , while schwan would need left party votes to have any chance of winning .

16 . on monday , german chancellor angela merkel had rejected a comprehensive economic rescue package despite signs that europe 's biggest economy was heading into recession .
but she was less adamant about germany 's key auto sector in light of $ 25 billion -lrb- 19 billion euros -rrb- worth of aid offered to automakers that have produced cars in the united states for 20 years . france also announced a program that offers 400 million euros to carmakers to promote the development of environmentally automobiles . economic downturn hurts automakers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german automakers want the state to create incentives for people to buy new cars " we will probably have to strongly support the automobile industry ... though that poses questions about european competitiveness , " merkel said .

even bavaria , germany 's largest state which had been initially opposed to the plan , signalled its support .
the state 's finance minister erwin huber told the national news broadcaster ard , " i do n't want to see the -lrb- bailout plan -rrb- fall through . "
the federal government expects the 16 regional states to cough up 35 percent of the cost , which combines an injection of capital with loan guarantees .
german finance minister peer steinbrueck is meeting with his regional counterparts this week to discuss details of the rescue plan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister peer steinbrueck -lrb- right -rrb- and leftist political rivals work together germany is under an international obligation to do its share in regulating the turbulence caused by world financial markets , according to a constitutional clause of a federal reform law in 2006 .
the bundesrat is likely to formally vote on the immediate implementation of the rescue package this friday .
some say states ' burden is unfair bavarian finance minister huber , however , did slam the federal government for pushing some of the burden onto the states .
" the nation calls the shots and the states pay the bill .
this is not exactly fair play , " he said .
huber , who was recently forced out as the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- party leader after bavarian state elections last month , claimed that the states face a double burden since they are solely responsible for bailing out and insuring regional banks and savings institutions as well .
the premier of the tiny south-western state of saarland , peter mueller , said that state participation in a federal bailout was inevitable with both state and federal interests intertwined . " we need solidarity on this issue , " said mueller in a interview with the broadcaster deutschlandradio kultur .
bailout makes bedfellows of political rivals other regions such as the heavily populated industrial state north rhine-westphalia and the south-western state baden-wuerttemberg , which is home to automakers such as bmw and daimler , concur .
even berlin 's economic deputy harald wolf of the opposition left party told the german media : " the states have no choice but to support the federal plan . "
among the conservatives , lower saxony 's finance minister hartmut moellring -lrb- cdu -rrb- told a regional broadcaster that the states needed to do their share in risky propositions , but also needed to take a lead role in transactions involving billions of euros .
norbert roettgen , the parliamentary leader of chancellor angela merkel 's governing christian democrat coalition , said it 's a given that the states fulfil their financial obligations .
green party financial expert christine scheel warned leaders of the regional states on national television news broadcaster n24 to assume collective responsibility for the banking crisis . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as a result of this foresight in seeing political capital in promoting entertainers to public office , actors-stroke-politicians have grown in credibility .
the success of reagan and schwarzenegger must have featured in the thought process which led to the left party 's decision tuesday , oct .
13 , to send television detective peter sodann up against incumbent horst koehler and social democratic challenger gesine schwan in the campaign to become germany 's next president .
swapping crime drama for politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sodann , left , in his role as kommissar ehrlicher in tatort sodann , better known among tv fans as kommissar ehrlicher in the german cult crime series tatort , was once considered a candidate for the bundestag for the left party 's former incarnation , the pds , in the 2005 parliamentary election .
however , he withdrew from the campaign only two days after announcing he would run - the reason being that his television paymasters would refuse to consider him for future roles .
while an unusual choice on the surface , sodann has some experience in dealing with political power .
one of east germany 's most popular actors , sodann was incarcerated for two years by the east german communist regime in the 1960s for directing a student theater whose program was defined as being " counter revolutionary . "
he served nine months of his sentence before being released from prison .
the actor , who featured in 45 episodes of tatort between 1991 and 2007 , has little realistic chance of winning .
however , while the left party must know it is effectively making up the numbers by putting forward sodann as their candidate , the publicity will no doubt raise the party 's profile even further at a time when it is making gains on the fractured social democrats and embattled christian democratic union ahead of september 2009 parliamentary elections .
left party looking for boosts to popularity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hanna schygulla was also considered by the left party sodann 's candidacy is not the first attempt by the left party to install an entertainer in the position of germany 's most prominent diplomat .
hanna schygulla , a protagonist in a number of films by director rainer werner fassbinder , was also considered as a candidate before being rejected by a party vote .
sodann will stand against koehler , the conservative incumbent , and spd 's schwan in the vote on may 23 when an assembly of lawmakers and state delegates elect the president .
at present , koehler appears to have just enough support to win re-election , while schwan would need left party votes to have any chance of winning .

15 to 20 next year - claim recent failed doping tests involving german rider stefan schumacher and his team gerolsteiner colleague bernhard kohl , have added to the pressure on the sport to clean up and increased lack of faith in cycling by supporters and investors alike .
" we have held intense discussions over the last few days and decided at the conclusion not to organize the 26th edition of the competition given the current situation in cycling , " organizer andreas kroll told german agency sid tuesday , oct .

" professional cycling has an enormous image problem at the moment which we ca n't currently change . "
on monday , it was announced that kohl , the best climber at this year 's tour de france and third overall , tested positive for the latest generation of the banned blood booster epo -lrb- erythropoietin -rrb- , named cera .
kohl is the fourth rider from the tour de france after italians riccardo ricco and leonardo piepoli , to test positive for the drug along with germany 's schumacher .

schumacher , who made no statement during the search of his home , will have the opportunity to give his side of the story in the investigation into whether he fraudulently deceived his gerolsteiner team .

he faces a two-year ban if found guilty of doping .
the german cycling federation bdr and the country 's national anti-doping agency nada have also launched investigations , with the bdr giving schumacher a five-day deadline to explain himself .

he said that samples from around 30 riders , who had abnormal blood levels at the start of the july race , will be retested .
" we have already received strong hints of own blood doping cases .
we wo n't be able to say until a later date who that involves , " bordry told zdf .
" soon we will be able to detect own blood transfusions and we will then conduct the retests . "
the statement came after retests for cera caught out schumacher and the italians ricci and piepoli .
ricci already tested positive for cera during the tour and is banned from competition .
the newly developed cera test was also conducted among the riders with abnormal levels .
the test has also prompted the international olympic committee to order retests of the samples gathered at cycling and all other sports at the beijing games .

here are some of the most important terms to know to understand the scope of the crisis . asset backed securities -lrb- abs -rrb- : a debt security collateralized by specific assets .
although the term applies to any debt backed by identified assets , it generally refers to securities backed by short- term collateral such as credit-card receivables , car loans , and home- equity loans .
credit crunch : since banks are now leery about lending money to one another , there is less money available for making consumer loans .
some companies have also begun to complain about problems in securing loans .
deposit insurance : a government guarantee on individual savings up to a certain monetary level , though some nations have opted to provide unlimited guarantees , regardless of the amount of savings held .
guarantee : the assumption of responsibility for payment of a debt or performance of some obligation if the liable party fails to perform to expectations .
interbank trade : refers to international trade between banks .
trade is usually conducted in currency , shares or commercial paper with fixed interest bonds .
liquidity squeeze : when an entity lacks the financial capital to pay its obligations in a timely manner , it is said to be suffering a liquidity squeeze .
currently , many nations are pumping billions into their banks to protect them from such a squeeze .
moratorium : a suspension of specific , or all , business activities to prevent additional damage .
sometimes a moratorium can be decreed by a nation .
sometimes a business can enact a moratorium on its own .
in bankruptcy law , a legally binding halt of the right to collect debt .
nationalization : the practice of a government to partially or wholly take control of the assets and administration of a private entity .
real economy : due to the credit crunch , the financial sector crisis is overlapping into manufacturing and services , which make up the so-called real economy .
in a worst-case scenario , this could mean an economic slowdown or a recession .
refinancing : banks need regular infusions of new money , in order to provide new loans or pay out savings .
they often find this money by going to their central bank , using deposits on hand or lending money to one another .
special purpose vehicle : financial institutions spin off special purpose vehicles so that they can focus on specific areas of the market .
many banks used these vehicles to invest in us mortgages .
using the vehicles kept the risky business off the banks ' corporate balance sheets .
subprime : mortgages granted to homeowners who can not provide proof of income or assets as collateral .
many such homeowners found themselves unable to pay off their mortgages over the last year as interest rates rose and house values sank .

here are some of the most important terms to know to understand the scope of the crisis . asset backed securities -lrb- abs -rrb- : a debt security collateralized by specific assets .
although the term applies to any debt backed by identified assets , it generally refers to securities backed by short- term collateral such as credit-card receivables , car loans , and home- equity loans .
credit crunch : since banks are now leery about lending money to one another , there is less money available for making consumer loans .
some companies have also begun to complain about problems in securing loans .
deposit insurance : a government guarantee on individual savings up to a certain monetary level , though some nations have opted to provide unlimited guarantees , regardless of the amount of savings held .
guarantee : the assumption of responsibility for payment of a debt or performance of some obligation if the liable party fails to perform to expectations .
interbank trade : refers to international trade between banks .
trade is usually conducted in currency , shares or commercial paper with fixed interest bonds .
liquidity squeeze : when an entity lacks the financial capital to pay its obligations in a timely manner , it is said to be suffering a liquidity squeeze .
currently , many nations are pumping billions into their banks to protect them from such a squeeze .
moratorium : a suspension of specific , or all , business activities to prevent additional damage .
sometimes a moratorium can be decreed by a nation .
sometimes a business can enact a moratorium on its own .
in bankruptcy law , a legally binding halt of the right to collect debt .
nationalization : the practice of a government to partially or wholly take control of the assets and administration of a private entity .
real economy : due to the credit crunch , the financial sector crisis is overlapping into manufacturing and services , which make up the so-called real economy .
in a worst-case scenario , this could mean an economic slowdown or a recession .
refinancing : banks need regular infusions of new money , in order to provide new loans or pay out savings .
they often find this money by going to their central bank , using deposits on hand or lending money to one another .
special purpose vehicle : financial institutions spin off special purpose vehicles so that they can focus on specific areas of the market .
many banks used these vehicles to invest in us mortgages .
using the vehicles kept the risky business off the banks ' corporate balance sheets .
subprime : mortgages granted to homeowners who can not provide proof of income or assets as collateral .
many such homeowners found themselves unable to pay off their mortgages over the last year as interest rates rose and house values sank .

warning that the unprecedented global financial crisis requires " unprecedented eu action , " european commission president jose manuel barroso has urged all eu governments to endorse a wide-ranging rescue plan . " i am pleased to see that there is now a consensus on the necessity and on the substance of a coherent effort , " barroso said of the plan worth an estimated 2 trillion euros -lrb- $ 2.7 trillion -rrb- .
" i expect confirmation and strengthening of this consistent and coherent effort by the european council . "
eu leaders are due to meet in brussels on wednesday and thursday for a regular autumn summit whose content will largely be devoted to the credit crunch .
discussions will focus on the outcome of a meeting in paris on sunday in which the 15 countries that share the euro approved a british-style financial rescue package which includes measures to guarantee interbank loans .
bank reluctance threatens recession bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reluctance to lend has had a terrible effect on markets the reluctance of banks to lend out their money is at the heart of the current financial crisis , which is in turn threatening to plunge european economies into recession .
euro zone governments also agreed in paris to guarantee at least 50,000 euros of their citizens ' bank deposits and to bail out financial institutions by providing them with cash in exchange for a share in such companies .
the combined potential cost of such measures for the eu as a whole has been estimated at around 2 trillion euros , with germany , britain and france putting up a large share of that total .
however , officials in brussels note that the combined figure includes a significant amount of bank guarantees that may never be needed .
" if you look at the magnitude of this response , and the effects of coordination , they were credible .
and that is what markets and citizens are looking for , " barroso said .
the head of the eu executive also backed calls by french president nicolas sarkozy for an international conference to reform the global finance system .
" an urgent priority now must be to further deepen coordination at the international level , and specifically with the us , " barroso said .
britain 's brown gets praise for efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro zone 's rescue team owes a lot to brown and he heaped praise on british prime minister gordon brown , whose national rescue plan largely inspired the eu 's own plan .
" let me say on this occasion how appreciative we are of the efforts of prime minister gordon brown , " barroso said .
" his contribution was very important . "
brown was invited to hold talks in paris ahead of the euro-summit , despite britain not being part of the 15-member eurogroup , whose finance ministers meet on a regular basis .
the commission chief also called on national governments to approve a series of proposals introducing common and tougher rules for banks , insurance companies and credit rating agencies .
" even after this crisis , there are some governments that are opposing a more coordinated european approach , " barroso said .
" -lrb- but -rrb- i have boundless faith in the sense of responsibility and the common sense of our heads of state and government .
" to try and go it alone in this climate would be a fatal mistake for any government anywhere in europe , " barroso said . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bank reluctance threatens recession bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reluctance to lend has had a terrible effect on markets the reluctance of banks to lend out their money is at the heart of the current financial crisis , which is in turn threatening to plunge european economies into recession .
euro zone governments also agreed in paris to guarantee at least 50,000 euros of their citizens ' bank deposits and to bail out financial institutions by providing them with cash in exchange for a share in such companies .
the combined potential cost of such measures for the eu as a whole has been estimated at around 2 trillion euros , with germany , britain and france putting up a large share of that total .
however , officials in brussels note that the combined figure includes a significant amount of bank guarantees that may never be needed .
" if you look at the magnitude of this response , and the effects of coordination , they were credible .
and that is what markets and citizens are looking for , " barroso said .
the head of the eu executive also backed calls by french president nicolas sarkozy for an international conference to reform the global finance system .
" an urgent priority now must be to further deepen coordination at the international level , and specifically with the us , " barroso said .

" his contribution was very important . "
brown was invited to hold talks in paris ahead of the euro-summit , despite britain not being part of the 15-member eurogroup , whose finance ministers meet on a regular basis .
the commission chief also called on national governments to approve a series of proposals introducing common and tougher rules for banks , insurance companies and credit rating agencies .

huber , who was recently forced out as the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- party leader after bavarian state elections last month , claimed that the states face a double burden since they are solely responsible for bailing out and insuring regional banks and savings institutions as well .
the premier of the tiny south-western state of saarland , peter mueller , said that state participation in a federal bailout was inevitable with both state and federal interests intertwined . " we need solidarity on this issue , " said mueller in a interview with the broadcaster deutschlandradio kultur .

even bavaria , germany 's largest state which had been initially opposed to the plan , signalled its support .
the state 's finance minister erwin huber told the national news broadcaster ard , " i do n't want to see the -lrb- bailout plan -rrb- fall through . "
the federal government expects the 16 regional states to cough up 35 percent of the cost , which combines an injection of capital with loan guarantees .
german finance minister peer steinbrueck is meeting with his regional counterparts this week to discuss details of the rescue plan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister peer steinbrueck -lrb- right -rrb- and leftist political rivals work together germany is under an international obligation to do its share in regulating the turbulence caused by world financial markets , according to a constitutional clause of a federal reform law in 2006 .
the bundesrat is likely to formally vote on the immediate implementation of the rescue package this friday .
some say states ' burden is unfair bavarian finance minister huber , however , did slam the federal government for pushing some of the burden onto the states .
" the nation calls the shots and the states pay the bill .
this is not exactly fair play , " he said .
huber , who was recently forced out as the conservative christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- party leader after bavarian state elections last month , claimed that the states face a double burden since they are solely responsible for bailing out and insuring regional banks and savings institutions as well .
the premier of the tiny south-western state of saarland , peter mueller , said that state participation in a federal bailout was inevitable with both state and federal interests intertwined . " we need solidarity on this issue , " said mueller in a interview with the broadcaster deutschlandradio kultur .
bailout makes bedfellows of political rivals other regions such as the heavily populated industrial state north rhine-westphalia and the south-western state baden-wuerttemberg , which is home to automakers such as bmw and daimler , concur .
even berlin 's economic deputy harald wolf of the opposition left party told the german media : " the states have no choice but to support the federal plan . "
among the conservatives , lower saxony 's finance minister hartmut moellring -lrb- cdu -rrb- told a regional broadcaster that the states needed to do their share in risky propositions , but also needed to take a lead role in transactions involving billions of euros .
norbert roettgen , the parliamentary leader of chancellor angela merkel 's governing christian democrat coalition , said it 's a given that the states fulfil their financial obligations .
green party financial expert christine scheel warned leaders of the regional states on national television news broadcaster n24 to assume collective responsibility for the banking crisis . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de political parties -pipe- 15.10.2008 left party chooses tv detective as presidential candidate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actor peter sodann is hoping to swap his role as a tv detective for that of german president germany 's left party has voted to send tv actor peter sodann up against more experienced political opponents as its candidate in the coming campaign for president . ronald reagan managed to put a hollywood career behind him to become the leader of the free world and arnold schwarzenegger has more recently swapped his role as an ultra-violent cyborg for that of the environmentally-friendly overseer of the biggest state economy in the united states .
as a result of this foresight in seeing political capital in promoting entertainers to public office , actors-stroke-politicians have grown in credibility .
the success of reagan and schwarzenegger must have featured in the thought process which led to the left party 's decision tuesday , oct .
13 , to send television detective peter sodann up against incumbent horst koehler and social democratic challenger gesine schwan in the campaign to become germany 's next president .
swapping crime drama for politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sodann , left , in his role as kommissar ehrlicher in tatort sodann , better known among tv fans as kommissar ehrlicher in the german cult crime series tatort , was once considered a candidate for the bundestag for the left party 's former incarnation , the pds , in the 2005 parliamentary election .
however , he withdrew from the campaign only two days after announcing he would run - the reason being that his television paymasters would refuse to consider him for future roles .
while an unusual choice on the surface , sodann has some experience in dealing with political power .
one of east germany 's most popular actors , sodann was incarcerated for two years by the east german communist regime in the 1960s for directing a student theater whose program was defined as being " counter revolutionary . "
he served nine months of his sentence before being released from prison .
the actor , who featured in 45 episodes of tatort between 1991 and 2007 , has little realistic chance of winning .
however , while the left party must know it is effectively making up the numbers by putting forward sodann as their candidate , the publicity will no doubt raise the party 's profile even further at a time when it is making gains on the fractured social democrats and embattled christian democratic union ahead of september 2009 parliamentary elections .
left party looking for boosts to popularity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hanna schygulla was also considered by the left party sodann 's candidacy is not the first attempt by the left party to install an entertainer in the position of germany 's most prominent diplomat .
hanna schygulla , a protagonist in a number of films by director rainer werner fassbinder , was also considered as a candidate before being rejected by a party vote .
sodann will stand against koehler , the conservative incumbent , and spd 's schwan in the vote on may 23 when an assembly of lawmakers and state delegates elect the president .
at present , koehler appears to have just enough support to win re-election , while schwan would need left party votes to have any chance of winning .
it is unclear whether the party would support her if sodann is eliminated in an early round of voting . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but economy minister glos said berlin would offer support to struggling exporters . finance minister peer steinbrueck said he was " not prepared to announce a bailout plan for the auto sector or promise tax breaks just because the industry is applying pressure , " in an interview with weekly die zeit to appear on thursday , oct .
16 . on monday , german chancellor angela merkel had rejected a comprehensive economic rescue package despite signs that europe 's biggest economy was heading into recession .
but she was less adamant about germany 's key auto sector in light of $ 25 billion -lrb- 19 billion euros -rrb- worth of aid offered to automakers that have produced cars in the united states for 20 years . france also announced a program that offers 400 million euros to carmakers to promote the development of environmentally automobiles . economic downturn hurts automakers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german automakers want the state to create incentives for people to buy new cars " we will probably have to strongly support the automobile industry ... though that poses questions about european competitiveness , " merkel said .
" we have to look again at how we can react .
aside from that , there will be no economic package in the classic sense . " germany 's vda auto federation then called for " political investment incentives , " such as tax credits for consumers buying new cars and changes to the auto tax changes linked to greenhouse gas emissions to induce owners of older cars to buy new ones . " effects of the financial crisis and global economic deterioration have made conditions more difficult on auto industry markets , " vda president matthias wissmann said tuesday in a statement . car sales in europe dropped by 8.2 percent in september to 1.3 million and sales for the year are down 4 percent to 11.7 million , the european automobile manufacturers ' association said on wednesday . several german car makers have recently announced production cutbacks and revised 2008 earnings owing to slumping auto sales . help for exporters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the auto industry is only one of the sectors impacted by the financial crisis in a move likely to please the export-heavy auto industry , economy minister michael glos said wednesday that the government would aid german exporters . " the deterioration in the overall economic environment can lead to a loss of export momentum , " he said in a statement .
" the slowdown we 're seeing in a number of european countries , and the expected recession in the united states , will put the dampeners on exports . " german was prepared to boost export credit guarantees called the " hermes cover , " glos said .
the governments uses the guarantees to protect german businesses by taking over debt from foreign entities that do not pay their bills . the state engaged in 17 billion euros worth of such guarantees in 2007 , which was less than 2 percent of germany 's 969 billion euros in total exports . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but economy minister glos said berlin would offer support to struggling exporters . finance minister peer steinbrueck said he was " not prepared to announce a bailout plan for the auto sector or promise tax breaks just because the industry is applying pressure , " in an interview with weekly die zeit to appear on thursday , oct .
16 . on monday , german chancellor angela merkel had rejected a comprehensive economic rescue package despite signs that europe 's biggest economy was heading into recession .
but she was less adamant about germany 's key auto sector in light of $ 25 billion -lrb- 19 billion euros -rrb- worth of aid offered to automakers that have produced cars in the united states for 20 years . france also announced a program that offers 400 million euros to carmakers to promote the development of environmentally automobiles . economic downturn hurts automakers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german automakers want the state to create incentives for people to buy new cars " we will probably have to strongly support the automobile industry ... though that poses questions about european competitiveness , " merkel said .
" we have to look again at how we can react .
aside from that , there will be no economic package in the classic sense . " germany 's vda auto federation then called for " political investment incentives , " such as tax credits for consumers buying new cars and changes to the auto tax changes linked to greenhouse gas emissions to induce owners of older cars to buy new ones . " effects of the financial crisis and global economic deterioration have made conditions more difficult on auto industry markets , " vda president matthias wissmann said tuesday in a statement . car sales in europe dropped by 8.2 percent in september to 1.3 million and sales for the year are down 4 percent to 11.7 million , the european automobile manufacturers ' association said on wednesday . several german car makers have recently announced production cutbacks and revised 2008 earnings owing to slumping auto sales . help for exporters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the auto industry is only one of the sectors impacted by the financial crisis in a move likely to please the export-heavy auto industry , economy minister michael glos said wednesday that the government would aid german exporters . " the deterioration in the overall economic environment can lead to a loss of export momentum , " he said in a statement .
" the slowdown we 're seeing in a number of european countries , and the expected recession in the united states , will put the dampeners on exports . " german was prepared to boost export credit guarantees called the " hermes cover , " glos said .
the governments uses the guarantees to protect german businesses by taking over debt from foreign entities that do not pay their bills . the state engaged in 17 billion euros worth of such guarantees in 2007 , which was less than 2 percent of germany 's 969 billion euros in total exports . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as a result of this foresight in seeing political capital in promoting entertainers to public office , actors-stroke-politicians have grown in credibility .
the success of reagan and schwarzenegger must have featured in the thought process which led to the left party 's decision tuesday , oct .
13 , to send television detective peter sodann up against incumbent horst koehler and social democratic challenger gesine schwan in the campaign to become germany 's next president .
swapping crime drama for politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sodann , left , in his role as kommissar ehrlicher in tatort sodann , better known among tv fans as kommissar ehrlicher in the german cult crime series tatort , was once considered a candidate for the bundestag for the left party 's former incarnation , the pds , in the 2005 parliamentary election .
however , he withdrew from the campaign only two days after announcing he would run - the reason being that his television paymasters would refuse to consider him for future roles .
while an unusual choice on the surface , sodann has some experience in dealing with political power .
one of east germany 's most popular actors , sodann was incarcerated for two years by the east german communist regime in the 1960s for directing a student theater whose program was defined as being " counter revolutionary . "
he served nine months of his sentence before being released from prison .
the actor , who featured in 45 episodes of tatort between 1991 and 2007 , has little realistic chance of winning .
however , while the left party must know it is effectively making up the numbers by putting forward sodann as their candidate , the publicity will no doubt raise the party 's profile even further at a time when it is making gains on the fractured social democrats and embattled christian democratic union ahead of september 2009 parliamentary elections .
left party looking for boosts to popularity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hanna schygulla was also considered by the left party sodann 's candidacy is not the first attempt by the left party to install an entertainer in the position of germany 's most prominent diplomat .
hanna schygulla , a protagonist in a number of films by director rainer werner fassbinder , was also considered as a candidate before being rejected by a party vote .
sodann will stand against koehler , the conservative incumbent , and spd 's schwan in the vote on may 23 when an assembly of lawmakers and state delegates elect the president .
at present , koehler appears to have just enough support to win re-election , while schwan would need left party votes to have any chance of winning .
it is unclear whether the party would support her if sodann is eliminated in an early round of voting . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , he withdrew from the campaign only two days after announcing he would run - the reason being that his television paymasters would refuse to consider him for future roles .
while an unusual choice on the surface , sodann has some experience in dealing with political power .
one of east germany 's most popular actors , sodann was incarcerated for two years by the east german communist regime in the 1960s for directing a student theater whose program was defined as being " counter revolutionary . "
he served nine months of his sentence before being released from prison .
the actor , who featured in 45 episodes of tatort between 1991 and 2007 , has little realistic chance of winning .
however , while the left party must know it is effectively making up the numbers by putting forward sodann as their candidate , the publicity will no doubt raise the party 's profile even further at a time when it is making gains on the fractured social democrats and embattled christian democratic union ahead of september 2009 parliamentary elections .
left party looking for boosts to popularity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hanna schygulla was also considered by the left party sodann 's candidacy is not the first attempt by the left party to install an entertainer in the position of germany 's most prominent diplomat .
hanna schygulla , a protagonist in a number of films by director rainer werner fassbinder , was also considered as a candidate before being rejected by a party vote .
sodann will stand against koehler , the conservative incumbent , and spd 's schwan in the vote on may 23 when an assembly of lawmakers and state delegates elect the president .
at present , koehler appears to have just enough support to win re-election , while schwan would need left party votes to have any chance of winning .
it is unclear whether the party would support her if sodann is eliminated in an early round of voting . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as a result of this foresight in seeing political capital in promoting entertainers to public office , actors-stroke-politicians have grown in credibility .
the success of reagan and schwarzenegger must have featured in the thought process which led to the left party 's decision tuesday , oct .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de political parties -pipe- 15.10.2008 left party chooses tv detective as presidential candidate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actor peter sodann is hoping to swap his role as a tv detective for that of german president germany 's left party has voted to send tv actor peter sodann up against more experienced political opponents as its candidate in the coming campaign for president . ronald reagan managed to put a hollywood career behind him to become the leader of the free world and arnold schwarzenegger has more recently swapped his role as an ultra-violent cyborg for that of the environmentally-friendly overseer of the biggest state economy in the united states .
as a result of this foresight in seeing political capital in promoting entertainers to public office , actors-stroke-politicians have grown in credibility .
the success of reagan and schwarzenegger must have featured in the thought process which led to the left party 's decision tuesday , oct .
13 , to send television detective peter sodann up against incumbent horst koehler and social democratic challenger gesine schwan in the campaign to become germany 's next president .
swapping crime drama for politics bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sodann , left , in his role as kommissar ehrlicher in tatort sodann , better known among tv fans as kommissar ehrlicher in the german cult crime series tatort , was once considered a candidate for the bundestag for the left party 's former incarnation , the pds , in the 2005 parliamentary election .
however , he withdrew from the campaign only two days after announcing he would run - the reason being that his television paymasters would refuse to consider him for future roles .
while an unusual choice on the surface , sodann has some experience in dealing with political power .
one of east germany 's most popular actors , sodann was incarcerated for two years by the east german communist regime in the 1960s for directing a student theater whose program was defined as being " counter revolutionary . "
he served nine months of his sentence before being released from prison .
the actor , who featured in 45 episodes of tatort between 1991 and 2007 , has little realistic chance of winning .
however , while the left party must know it is effectively making up the numbers by putting forward sodann as their candidate , the publicity will no doubt raise the party 's profile even further at a time when it is making gains on the fractured social democrats and embattled christian democratic union ahead of september 2009 parliamentary elections .

advertisement claw to claw - how do the chinese mitten crab and non-native crayfish size up ?
two of the uk 's worst aquatic invasive species are set to meet .
scientists believe that the ranges of the plague-carrying non-native crayfish and the fierce chinese mitten crab are beginning to overlap .
since their introduction , both of these animals have had a dramatic impact on local ecology and are especially harmful to native species in the uk .
scientists are unsure what will happen when the two alien invaders eventually cross paths .
various sites around the uk have been highlighted as potential meeting places ; they include the river lee , in the south , and the river ouse and the aire in yorkshire .
see how the crab and crayfish compare the non-native crayfish was first introduced to the uk in the late 1970s for aquaculture , but it soon began to spread .
where the non-natives move in , the white claws are lost stephanie peay several different species now exist in the uk 's waterways , but the signal crayfish -lrb- pacifastacus leniusculus -rrb- , which comes from north america , has so far caused the most damage - thanks , in part , to a disease it carries .
ecologist stephanie peay told the bbc : " the plague does not seem to harm the non-natives , but if our native white-clawed crayfish -lsb- austropotamobius pallipes -rsb- encounter it , they die within weeks . "
even if the non-native crayfish do not carry the plague , they still cause problems for the uk 's white-clawed species .
ms peay describes the crustaceans as " aquatic thugs " .
see distribution of signal crayfish enlarge map she explained : " where the non-natives move in , the white claws are lost .
survey work has shown that it only takes between four and seven years from first arrival to achieve a complete local extinction .
" the only future for the white claws is in isolated water bodies that are completely free from non-native crayfish . "
see distribution of chinese mitten crabs enlarge map and it is not only the white-clawed crayfish that are at risk .
the alien species is also having a big impact on other elements of the aquatic ecosystem and its burrows are also causing huge damage to water banks .
voracious predator until now , non-native crayfish have been seen as one of the worst invaders in the waterways - but could another alien crustacean knock them off top spot ?
the chinese mitten crab - so called because of its furry , mitten-like claws - was first recorded in the uk in 1935 .
they eat anything that they can get their claws into paul clark , nhm however , it really began to take hold in the 1980s after large numbers were thought to have been unleashed into the thames and other rivers around the uk from ships ' ballast water .
paul clark from the natural history museum said : " since the late 80s , their range has been expanding massively .
" it is difficult to estimate the exact population , but i suspect the numbers are in the millions . "
the crabs are voracious predators .
dr clark said : " they eat anything that they can get their claws into : weeds , fish eggs , snails , molluscs - anything .
" they are just an opportunistic feeder .
weird water invaders " it is hugely disruptive to local ecosystems - nobody has been able to do an assessment on how much damage they actually cause , but it could be quite significant . "
chinese mitten crabs inhabit both fresh and saltwater .
the young are born in coastal regions or estuaries , they then migrate up the river to spend their adult lives in freshwater , before returning back to saltwater years later to breed .
once in freshwater , they can move huge distances .
dr clark said that in china , some studies have shown they can migrate up to 1,500km -lrb- 930 miles -rrb- .
alien versus predator in the uk , year upon year , the mittens have been increasing their range .
philine zu ermgassen , an aquatic ecologist at the university of cambridge , said : " mitten crabs are spreading so quickly at the moment .
you could predict a clash between the two philine zu ermgassen " they are now moving further up rivers into areas where there are crayfish - it seems they are starting to encroach upon crayfish terrain . "
scientists do not know what will happen when the two meet .
ms zu ermgassen said : " you could predict a clash between the two .
" if this is the case , the mitten crabs do seem to be more dominant as a species - the crabs are very aggressive and very strong .
they will also be directly competing for food . "
more worrying , however , could be the effect on the local ecosystem of the presence of two aggressive alien crustaceans .
she added : " you could end up with an additive effect .
they are both broadly omnivorous and both burrow under banks . "
stephanie peay says that this could be bad news .
she told the bbc : " what tends to happen when successful invasive non-native species move in is that you tend to get a reduction in the diversity of native species and a reduction in abundance .
" that will be bad for the native environment overall . "

advertisement claw to claw - how do the chinese mitten crab and non-native crayfish size up ?
two of the uk 's worst aquatic invasive species are set to meet .
scientists believe that the ranges of the plague-carrying non-native crayfish and the fierce chinese mitten crab are beginning to overlap .
since their introduction , both of these animals have had a dramatic impact on local ecology and are especially harmful to native species in the uk .
scientists are unsure what will happen when the two alien invaders eventually cross paths .
various sites around the uk have been highlighted as potential meeting places ; they include the river lee , in the south , and the river ouse and the aire in yorkshire .

ecologist stephanie peay told the bbc : " the plague does not seem to harm the non-natives , but if our native white-clawed crayfish -lsb- austropotamobius pallipes -rsb- encounter it , they die within weeks . "
even if the non-native crayfish do not carry the plague , they still cause problems for the uk 's white-clawed species .
ms peay describes the crustaceans as " aquatic thugs " .

survey work has shown that it only takes between four and seven years from first arrival to achieve a complete local extinction .
" the only future for the white claws is in isolated water bodies that are completely free from non-native crayfish . "
see distribution of chinese mitten crabs enlarge map and it is not only the white-clawed crayfish that are at risk .
the alien species is also having a big impact on other elements of the aquatic ecosystem and its burrows are also causing huge damage to water banks .

paul clark from the natural history museum said : " since the late 80s , their range has been expanding massively .
" it is difficult to estimate the exact population , but i suspect the numbers are in the millions . "
the crabs are voracious predators .
dr clark said : " they eat anything that they can get their claws into : weeds , fish eggs , snails , molluscs - anything .
" they are just an opportunistic feeder .
weird water invaders " it is hugely disruptive to local ecosystems - nobody has been able to do an assessment on how much damage they actually cause , but it could be quite significant . "
chinese mitten crabs inhabit both fresh and saltwater .
the young are born in coastal regions or estuaries , they then migrate up the river to spend their adult lives in freshwater , before returning back to saltwater years later to breed .
once in freshwater , they can move huge distances .
dr clark said that in china , some studies have shown they can migrate up to 1,500km -lrb- 930 miles -rrb- .

scientists do not know what will happen when the two meet .
ms zu ermgassen said : " you could predict a clash between the two .
" if this is the case , the mitten crabs do seem to be more dominant as a species - the crabs are very aggressive and very strong .
they will also be directly competing for food . "
more worrying , however , could be the effect on the local ecosystem of the presence of two aggressive alien crustaceans .
she added : " you could end up with an additive effect .

scientists believe that the ranges of the plague-carrying non-native crayfish and the fierce chinese mitten crab are beginning to overlap .
since their introduction , both of these animals have had a dramatic impact on local ecology and are especially harmful to native species in the uk .
scientists are unsure what will happen when the two alien invaders eventually cross paths .
various sites around the uk have been highlighted as potential meeting places ; they include the river lee , in the south , and the river ouse and the aire in yorkshire .
see how the crab and crayfish compare the non-native crayfish was first introduced to the uk in the late 1970s for aquaculture , but it soon began to spread . "
where the non-natives move in , the white claws are lost " stephanie peay several different species now exist in the uk 's waterways , but the signal crayfish -lrb- pacifastacus leniusculus -rrb- , which comes from north america , has so far caused the most damage - thanks , in part , to a disease it carries .
ecologist stephanie peay told the bbc : " the plague does not seem to harm the non-natives , but if our native white-clawed crayfish -lsb- austropotamobius pallipes -rsb- encounter it , they die within weeks . "
even if the non-native crayfish do not carry the plague , they still cause problems for the uk 's white-clawed species .
ms peay describes the crustaceans as " aquatic thugs " .
she explained : " where the non-natives move in , the white claws are lost .
survey work has shown that it only takes between four and seven years from first arrival to achieve a complete local extinction .
" the only future for the white claws is in isolated water bodies that are completely free from non-native crayfish . "
and it is not only the white-clawed crayfish that are at risk .
the alien species is also having a big impact on other elements of the aquatic ecosystem and its burrows are also causing huge damage to water banks .
voracious predator until now , non-native crayfish have been seen as one of the worst invaders in the waterways - but could another alien crustacean knock them off top spot ?
the chinese mitten crab - so called because of its furry , mitten-like claws - was first recorded in the uk in 1935 . "
they eat anything that they can get their claws into " paul clark , nhm however , it really began to take hold in the 1980s after large numbers were thought to have been unleashed into the thames and other rivers around the uk from ships ' ballast water .
paul clark from the natural history museum said : " since the late 80s , their range has been expanding massively .
" it is difficult to estimate the exact population , but i suspect the numbers are in the millions . "
the crabs are voracious predators .
dr clark said : " they eat anything that they can get their claws into : weeds , fish eggs , snails , molluscs - anything .
" they are just an opportunistic feeder .
weird water invaders " it is hugely disruptive to local ecosystems - nobody has been able to do an assessment on how much damage they actually cause , but it could be quite significant . "
chinese mitten crabs inhabit both fresh and saltwater .
the young are born in coastal regions or estuaries , they then migrate up the river to spend their adult lives in freshwater , before returning back to saltwater years later to breed .
once in freshwater , they can move huge distances .
dr clark said that in china , some studies have shown they can migrate up to 1,500km -lrb- 930 miles -rrb- .

in india , cricket star sachin tendulkar will be leading the campaign that will see children across south asia simultaneously washing their hands .
the un says it wants to get over the message that this simple routine is one of the most effective ways of preventing killer diseases .
nearly half the world 's population do not have access to adequate sanitation .
' critical times ' more than 120 million children in 70 countries across five continents are expected to participate in the campaign .
from kabul to karachi and from delhi to dhaka , millions of children will take part in the campaign and pledge to embrace more hygienic practices by the simple act of washing their hands .
india has recruited one of the country 's biggest sporting icons , cricket star sachin tendulkar , to be the face of the campaign .
washing hands will be the topic of afghan television and radio talk shows and pakistani newscasts .
nepal 's new maoist government is sending out mobile text messages .
in bhutan , special animated videos have been made with bhutanese characters .
" the message we are really trying to get out is the importance of correctly washing your hands with soap and water at the critical times , " unicef 's senior sanitation and hygiene programme adviser , therese dooley , said .
" and those critical times are before you cook or prepare food , before you eat and after using the toilet and after cleaning a baby . "
the un says washing hands with water alone is not enough " because you fail to wash off the germs " .
" we are recommending hand-washing with soap , " ms dooley said .
unicef says using soap to wash hands , particularly after contact with excreta , can reduce diarrhoeal diseases by over 40 % and respiratory infections by 30 % .
diarrhoea and respiratory infections are the main cause for child deaths in india .
nearly half the population of south asia has no access to toilets , whilst in sub-saharan africa this figure is as low as 28 % .
with such poor sanitation standards , it is little surprise that children in the region are susceptible to diarrhoea , hepatitis and pneumonia - often leading to their deaths , the un says .
the un is celebrating 2008 as the international year of sanitation .

in caernarfon bay it 's a sunny and warm autumnal day .
some people are out on pleasure crafts , and fishing boats .
none as large as the aegis .
this is the main patrol boat of the north western and north wales sea fisheries committee .
currently this 53ft -lrb- 16m -rrb- boat , with a crew of three , polices inshore waters between cardigan in ceredigion and barrow in cumbria .
on this particular morning the crew , using an inflatable dinghy launched off the back of the aegis , supervise a handful of local fishermen to check they had n't caught any under-sized fish , or small shellfish .
under european union regulations , fish quota affects the welsh inshore fishing boatmen , as much as the large trawlers of spain , scotland , cornwall and eastern england .
all 's well and good , and we move off , to patrol down the menai strait before heading for the aegis ' home port of conwy .
there are 12 sea fisheries committees -lrb- sfcs -rrb- in england and wales but after over a century , a big shake-up is on the way .
the sfcs are a network of local management regulators , consisting of local authorities and sea officers with scientific backgrounds to manage and develop inshore fisheries - within six nautical miles of the coastline .
according to the north western and north wales sfc -lrb- nwnw sfc -rrb- website , rural affairs minister elin jones is proposing to abandon more than " 100 years of successful inshore fisheries management in favour of the welsh assembly government doing the job itself " .
not so said the minister , who said last month : " i am determined that the new arrangements will not result in the loss of the expertise of the sfcs and their officers , nor their close working relationship with fishermen .
" we will be integrating current sfc staff into the new structure to ensure continuity , and retaining legislative powers similar to those which the sfcs have at present . "
with the marine bill proceeding through westminster , england intends to modernise and beef up its sfcs and call them inshore fisheries and conservation authorities -lrb- ifcas -rrb- .
they 'll take on a bigger role in protecting the marine environment , with potentially £ 4-6m extra in their budget .
in wales currently , inshore fisheries are managed by the two sfcs , the environment agency as well as the assembly government .
' back up the options ' the latter would prefer to bring everything in-house with a new wales fisheries zone , and assume full responsibility for the management and enforcement of sea fisheries and wants to implement this through the marine bill .
assembly government officials claim through their proposal , the changes would have the following advantages : they would modernise fisheries management and provide an unified approach to managing welsh inshore waters all running costs would be met from funds available to existing sfcs through local authorities the proposals in general have been welcomed by most local authorities and the fishing industry they would have a direct influence on the industry rather than rely on appointees to committees if accepted , the assembly government proposals could be implemented by april 2010 .
some of the organisations which could be affected are questioning the lack of details .
in response , the countryside council for wales -lrb- ccw -rrb- felt the " current system of fisheries management within wales works fairly well . "
its main reservations was to its " brevity " and that the plan " does not have detail back up the options proposed " .
it wants clarification on how management and enforcement of sea fisheries in-house would operate in practice .
conservation organisation wwf cymru 's senior marine policy officer dr iwan ball is more blunt .
" in the absence of detailed proposals ... we believe that it would be a retrograde step simply to abandon the long-standing sfc model in favour of more remote and centralised structure . "
but not every organisation has misgivings .
many fishermen feel there 's duplication in various regulating bodies and some like jerry percy , chief executive of the welsh federation of fishermen association , are supportive .
experience and knowledge " the federation broadly supports the principles expressed within the consultation , " he said .
mr percy said " many welsh fishermen do not consider the sea fisheries committee fit for purpose . "
but he also complains that the consultation paper does not provide sufficient detail .
so far the sfcs control fishing within six miles of the shore , but the area of control for wales is out to 12 nautical miles , where for a few weeks a year the royal navy normally operate .
now there talk of policing out to the median line - which could be as far as 25 miles out to the irish and celtic seas .
there 's even been a verbal suggestion , say fisheries officers , that they 'll be expected to patrol that far out to sea in their 40hp inflatable dinghies , which are open to the elements and are only 16ft long .
not many would relish working in those conditions .
martyn boyce , the nwnw sfc principal fishery officer , said : " on a nice calm day , a small rib , no problem at all .
you could operate a mile or two mile off the shore - no problem .
" but what we 're talking about maybe , of operating an area 20 to 25 miles off-shore .
there 's no way we 'd be allowed to take a small rib unsupported . "
but in a statement , the assembly government said : " there is no question that north wales will be without a boat once the enforcement of fisheries has come the welsh assembly government , or that staff will be made to patrol waters in vessels which are not suitable . "
but there are concerns that within the £ 1m combined annual budget of the south and north wales sea fisheries committees , there would n't be sufficient funds to keep the aegis in the water .
purpose-built for the nwnw sfc , the concern between cardigan and the dee estuary is that this patrol boat will be used on the english side of liverpool bay - and that welsh officers would have to make do with their inflatable dinghies .
other concerns are about the potential loss of local regulation with locally elected representatives of the local councils and others who 've been appointed on fishery committee 's because of their experience and knowledge .
they could be fishermen , fish processors , scientists and merchants .
even if retained as advisers , they 'd lose their regulating teeth .
but the main questions seem to be about the dangers of making decisions for political rather than scientific reasons , and the worrying lack of details , especially regarding funding .

north and south wales sea fisheries ' committee responsibilities could come under the control of the welsh assembly government with change on the cards for management and enforcement of welsh inshore sea fisheries , bbc wales environment correspondent iolo ap dafydd goes to sea with a patrol .
in caernarfon bay it 's a sunny and warm autumnal day .
some people are out on pleasure crafts , and fishing boats .
none as large as the aegis .
this is the main patrol boat of the north western and north wales sea fisheries committee .
currently this 53ft -lrb- 16m -rrb- boat , with a crew of three , polices inshore waters between cardigan in ceredigion and barrow in cumbria .
on this particular morning the crew , using an inflatable dinghy launched off the back of the aegis , supervise a handful of local fishermen to check they had n't caught any under-sized fish , or small shellfish .
on board the aegis on the menai strait , off anglesey .
photo : iolo ap dafydd under european union regulations , fish quota affects the welsh inshore fishing boatmen , as much as the large trawlers of spain , scotland , cornwall and eastern england .
all 's well and good , and we move off , to patrol down the menai strait before heading for the aegis ' home port of conwy .
there are 12 sea fisheries committees -lrb- sfcs -rrb- in england and wales but after over a century , a big shake-up is on the way .
the sfcs are a network of local management regulators , consisting of local authorities and sea officers with scientific backgrounds to manage and develop inshore fisheries - within six nautical miles of the coastline .
according to the north western and north wales sfc -lrb- nwnw sfc -rrb- website , rural affairs minister elin jones is proposing to abandon more than " 100 years of successful inshore fisheries management in favour of the welsh assembly government doing the job itself " .
not so said the minister , who said last month : " i am determined that the new arrangements will not result in the loss of the expertise of the sfcs and their officers , nor their close working relationship with fishermen .
" we will be integrating current sfc staff into the new structure to ensure continuity , and retaining legislative powers similar to those which the sfcs have at present . "
there are concerns about lack of details in the proposals as they stand with the marine bill proceeding through westminster , england intends to modernise and beef up its sfcs and call them inshore fisheries and conservation authorities -lrb- ifcas -rrb- .
they 'll take on a bigger role in protecting the marine environment , with potentially £ 4-6m extra in their budget .
in wales currently , inshore fisheries are managed by the two sfcs , the environment agency as well as the assembly government .
' back up the options ' the latter would prefer to bring everything in-house with a new wales fisheries zone , and assume full responsibility for the management and enforcement of sea fisheries and wants to implement this through the marine bill .
assembly government officials claim through their proposal , the changes would have the following advantages : they would modernise fisheries management and provide an unified approach to managing welsh inshore waters all running costs would be met from funds available to existing sfcs through local authorities the proposals in general have been welcomed by most local authorities and the fishing industry they would have a direct influence on the industry rather than rely on appointees to committees if accepted , the assembly government proposals could be implemented by april 2010 .
some of the organisations which could be affected are questioning the lack of details .
there are worries if inflatables have to patrol an area further out to sea in response , the countryside council for wales -lrb- ccw -rrb- felt the " current system of fisheries management within wales works fairly well . "
its main reservations was to its " brevity " and that the plan " does not have detail back up the options proposed " .
it wants clarification on how management and enforcement of sea fisheries in-house would operate in practice .
conservation organisation wwf cymru 's senior marine policy officer dr iwan ball is more blunt .
" in the absence of detailed proposals ... we believe that it would be a retrograde step simply to abandon the long-standing sfc model in favour of more remote and centralised structure . "
but not every organisation has misgivings .
many fishermen feel there 's duplication in various regulating bodies and some like jerry percy , chief executive of the welsh federation of fishermen association , are supportive .
experience and knowledge " the federation broadly supports the principles expressed within the consultation , " he said .
mr percy said " many welsh fishermen do not consider the sea fisheries committee fit for purpose . "
but he also complains that the consultation paper does not provide sufficient detail .
so far the sfcs control fishing within six miles of the shore , but the area of control for wales is out to 12 nautical miles , where for a few weeks a year the royal navy normally operate .
now there talk of policing out to the median line - which could be as far as 25 miles out to the irish and celtic seas .
there 's even been a verbal suggestion , say fisheries officers , that they 'll be expected to patrol that far out to sea in their 40hp inflatable dinghies , which are open to the elements and are only 16ft long .
there are also budget concerns in keeping the aegis in the water not many would relish working in those conditions .
martyn boyce , the nwnw sfc principal fishery officer , said : " on a nice calm day , a small rib , no problem at all .
you could operate a mile or two mile off the shore - no problem .
" but what we 're talking about maybe , of operating an area 20 to 25 miles off-shore .
there 's no way we 'd be allowed to take a small rib unsupported . "
but in a statement , the assembly government said : " there is no question that north wales will be without a boat once the enforcement of fisheries has come the welsh assembly government , or that staff will be made to patrol waters in vessels which are not suitable . "
but there are concerns that within the £ 1m combined annual budget of the south and north wales sea fisheries committees , there would n't be sufficient funds to keep the aegis in the water .
purpose-built for the nwnw sfc , the concern between cardigan and the dee estuary is that this patrol boat will be used on the english side of liverpool bay - and that welsh officers would have to make do with their inflatable dinghies .
other concerns are about the potential loss of local regulation with locally elected representatives of the local councils and others who 've been appointed on fishery committee 's because of their experience and knowledge .
they could be fishermen , fish processors , scientists and merchants .
even if retained as advisers , they 'd lose their regulating teeth .
but the main questions seem to be about the dangers of making decisions for political rather than scientific reasons , and the worrying lack of details , especially regarding funding .

" the message we are really trying to get out is the importance of correctly washing your hands with soap and water at the critical times , " unicef 's senior sanitation and hygiene programme adviser , therese dooley , said .
" and those critical times are before you cook or prepare food , before you eat and after using the toilet and after cleaning a baby . "
the un says washing hands with water alone is not enough " because you fail to wash off the germs " .
" we are recommending hand-washing with soap , " ms dooley said .
unicef says using soap to wash hands , particularly after contact with excreta , can reduce diarrhoeal diseases by over 40 % and respiratory infections by 30 % .
diarrhoea and respiratory infections are the main cause for child deaths in india .
nearly half the population of south asia has no access to toilets , whilst in sub-saharan africa this figure is as low as 28 % .
with such poor sanitation standards , it is little surprise that children in the region are susceptible to diarrhoea , hepatitis and pneumonia - often leading to their deaths , the un says .
the un is celebrating 2008 as the international year of sanitation .

" the message we are really trying to get out is the importance of correctly washing your hands with soap and water at the critical times , " unicef 's senior sanitation and hygiene programme adviser , therese dooley , said .
" and those critical times are before you cook or prepare food , before you eat and after using the toilet and after cleaning a baby . "
the un says washing hands with water alone is not enough " because you fail to wash off the germs " .
" we are recommending hand-washing with soap , " ms dooley said .
unicef says using soap to wash hands , particularly after contact with excreta , can reduce diarrhoeal diseases by over 40 % and respiratory infections by 30 % .
diarrhoea and respiratory infections are the main cause for child deaths in india .
nearly half the population of south asia has no access to toilets , whilst in sub-saharan africa this figure is as low as 28 % .
with such poor sanitation standards , it is little surprise that children in the region are susceptible to diarrhoea , hepatitis and pneumonia - often leading to their deaths , the un says .
the un is celebrating 2008 as the international year of sanitation .

here is a look at the main campaign issues , the key battlegrounds and what triggered the vote .
why another election ?
the ruling right-of-centre conservative party , under prime minister stephen harper , was elected in january 2006 with a minority government .
the economy emerged as the major campaign issue although mr harper passed a law after he took office for elections to be held every four years , he called a snap election in september , saying parliament was deadlocked and " dysfunctional " .
the conservatives took over from the centre-left liberal party , which had been in office since 1993 , first under jean chretien for 10 years and then paul martin .
who are the key players ?
the main opposition liberal party - under stephane dion - had tried to block the conservatives from gaining a majority in parliament .
the liberals consistently trailed the conservatives in opinion polls and had little chance of forming a government themselves unless , in a rare event in canadian politics , they formed a coalition with one or more other parties .
jack layton steered the left-leaning new democratic party -lrb- ndp -rrb- to greater representation in parliament - picking up seven more seats for a total of 37 .
the bloc quebecois represents the aspirations of quebec separatists in ottawa .
leader gilles duceppe increased its number of seats to 50 of the quebec 's 75 .
the bloc held 48 in the outgoing parliament .
what are the main issues ?
with global financial markets in turmoil , the economy emerged as the biggest campaign issue .
the conservatives were enjoying a widening lead in opinion polls until , in one of the two leaders ' debates , mr harper said that canadians were not concerned about their jobs or houses .
mr harper repeatedly said that canada is well-prepared to weather the economic storm and has said the country should " stay the course -lsb- with -rsb- lower taxes , lower debt and prudent spending " .
mr dion and mr layton attacked mr harper for waiting until one week before polling day to announce a plan to bolster central canada 's flagging aerospace and automotive sectors with a c $ 400m -lrb- $ 340m -rrb- loan fund .
other measures worth c $ 8.6bn -lrb- $ 7.3bn -rrb- include a variety of tax cuts , tax benefits for senior citizens and single parents , a venture capital fund and the abolition of tariffs on machinery imports .
the liberals ' stephane dion said he would stick to his " green shift " plan of taxing greenhouse gas emissions in order to fund tax cuts for low- and middle-income earners and small businesses .
he also promised to increase spending on infrastructure and research and development .
he dismissed criticism of the plan , saying it would stimulate the economy and not harm it .
the ndp promised to roll back corporate tax cuts , lower taxes for small businesses and train workers for " green-collar " jobs .
mr layton said they would reverse conservative cuts to arts funding and launch a national child care plan and a home care plan for senior citizens .
the green party proposed a $ c50 per tonne carbon tax on greenhouse gas emissions that would be used to cut income tax .
the greens want to cut greenhouse gas emissions to 30 % below 1990 levels by 2020 and 80 % by 2050 .
canada 's military presence in afghanistan also entered the campaign just days before the vote when a parliamentary report was issued saying the cost of the mission may total c $ 18bn -lrb- $ 15.5bn -rrb- by the time its mandate ends in 2011 .
the conservatives promised to withdraw most of canada 's 2,500 troops from afghanistan by 2011 .
mr dion said that voting liberal is the only way to ensure that the deadline is met .
the ndp called for the troops to be withdrawn and for the un and nato to seek a ceasefire .
the mission in afghanistan has never been popular in quebec .
the bloc wants canada 's contingent pulled out of volatile kandahar province and the mission redefined to give it a humanitarian focus .
the greens want to begin withdrawing canada 's troops from afghanistan by no later than february 2009 .
the opposition parties were unanimous in attacking the conservatives over cuts to arts spending announced in august - just before the election was called .
mr harper came under fire for saying that " ordinary canadians " did not care about cultural issues and that artists were a spoiled elite .
he has since reversed a controversial move to cancel tax credits for films the government decides are " unsuitable " .
the opposition parties all pledged a mix of increased spending or increased tax breaks for the arts sector .
what are the main battlegrounds ?
the key to a majority in any canadian election is to win big in the populous provinces of ontario and quebec , which between them account for 181 of the 308 seats in the house of commons .
as the election was called , the conservatives were gaining popularity in quebec , where they held 11 seats when parliament was dissolved .
this put bloc quebecois leader gilles duceppe in the odd position of being favoured by anglophone canadians opposed to the re-election of the conservatives .
the tories were also popular in ontario as the campaign began and nationwide polls suggested the conservatives were within striking distance of a majority government .
that momentum was lost in the final two weeks of the campaign as mr harper seemed to be caught flat-footed by the extent of the global financial crisis .
but polling day revealed that although the conservatives could not secure a majority , they increased their standing in the house of commons by about 16 seats .

here is a look at the main campaign issues , the key battlegrounds and what triggered the vote .
why another election ?
the ruling right-of-centre conservative party , under prime minister stephen harper , was elected in january 2006 with a minority government .
the economy emerged as the major campaign issue although mr harper passed a law after he took office for elections to be held every four years , he called a snap election in september , saying parliament was deadlocked and " dysfunctional " .
the conservatives took over from the centre-left liberal party , which had been in office since 1993 , first under jean chretien for 10 years and then paul martin .
who are the key players ?
the main opposition liberal party - under stephane dion - had tried to block the conservatives from gaining a majority in parliament .
the liberals consistently trailed the conservatives in opinion polls and had little chance of forming a government themselves unless , in a rare event in canadian politics , they formed a coalition with one or more other parties .
jack layton steered the left-leaning new democratic party -lrb- ndp -rrb- to greater representation in parliament - picking up seven more seats for a total of 37 .
the bloc quebecois represents the aspirations of quebec separatists in ottawa .
leader gilles duceppe increased its number of seats to 50 of the quebec 's 75 .
the bloc held 48 in the outgoing parliament .
what are the main issues ?
with global financial markets in turmoil , the economy emerged as the biggest campaign issue .
the conservatives were enjoying a widening lead in opinion polls until , in one of the two leaders ' debates , mr harper said that canadians were not concerned about their jobs or houses .
mr harper repeatedly said that canada is well-prepared to weather the economic storm and has said the country should " stay the course -lsb- with -rsb- lower taxes , lower debt and prudent spending " .
mr dion and mr layton attacked mr harper for waiting until one week before polling day to announce a plan to bolster central canada 's flagging aerospace and automotive sectors with a c $ 400m -lrb- $ 340m -rrb- loan fund .
other measures worth c $ 8.6bn -lrb- $ 7.3bn -rrb- include a variety of tax cuts , tax benefits for senior citizens and single parents , a venture capital fund and the abolition of tariffs on machinery imports .
the liberals ' stephane dion said he would stick to his " green shift " plan of taxing greenhouse gas emissions in order to fund tax cuts for low- and middle-income earners and small businesses .
he also promised to increase spending on infrastructure and research and development .
he dismissed criticism of the plan , saying it would stimulate the economy and not harm it .
the ndp promised to roll back corporate tax cuts , lower taxes for small businesses and train workers for " green-collar " jobs .
mr layton said they would reverse conservative cuts to arts funding and launch a national child care plan and a home care plan for senior citizens .
the green party proposed a $ c50 per tonne carbon tax on greenhouse gas emissions that would be used to cut income tax .
the greens want to cut greenhouse gas emissions to 30 % below 1990 levels by 2020 and 80 % by 2050 .
canada 's military presence in afghanistan also entered the campaign just days before the vote when a parliamentary report was issued saying the cost of the mission may total c $ 18bn -lrb- $ 15.5bn -rrb- by the time its mandate ends in 2011 .
the conservatives promised to withdraw most of canada 's 2,500 troops from afghanistan by 2011 .
mr dion said that voting liberal is the only way to ensure that the deadline is met .
the ndp called for the troops to be withdrawn and for the un and nato to seek a ceasefire .
the mission in afghanistan has never been popular in quebec .
the bloc wants canada 's contingent pulled out of volatile kandahar province and the mission redefined to give it a humanitarian focus .
the greens want to begin withdrawing canada 's troops from afghanistan by no later than february 2009 .
the opposition parties were unanimous in attacking the conservatives over cuts to arts spending announced in august - just before the election was called .
mr harper came under fire for saying that " ordinary canadians " did not care about cultural issues and that artists were a spoiled elite .
he has since reversed a controversial move to cancel tax credits for films the government decides are " unsuitable " .
the opposition parties all pledged a mix of increased spending or increased tax breaks for the arts sector .
what are the main battlegrounds ?
the key to a majority in any canadian election is to win big in the populous provinces of ontario and quebec , which between them account for 181 of the 308 seats in the house of commons .
as the election was called , the conservatives were gaining popularity in quebec , where they held 11 seats when parliament was dissolved .
this put bloc quebecois leader gilles duceppe in the odd position of being favoured by anglophone canadians opposed to the re-election of the conservatives .
the tories were also popular in ontario as the campaign began and nationwide polls suggested the conservatives were within striking distance of a majority government .
that momentum was lost in the final two weeks of the campaign as mr harper seemed to be caught flat-footed by the extent of the global financial crisis .
but polling day revealed that although the conservatives could not secure a majority , they increased their standing in the house of commons by about 16 seats .

however , the businessman is about to play his dirtiest trick yet when he puts an end to his fiancée carla 's affair with liam connor .
in real life , actor gray o 'brien reveals what it is like to play the itv1 soap 's bad guy .
warning : the following interview may contain spoilers .
how has the reaction to your character been so far ?
i was worried when i heard the storyline .
i was worried that i was going to be the most hated man in soap , but i think you 'll agree after watching it there 's two sides to this .
i do n't know what will happen on friday .
i 'm not going to be in the country , so we 'll see what happens .
i expect to get a bit of stick for it , but i think there 's an interest in tony because he 's not just the villain .
there 's other sides to him and the onion starts to unpeel and i think the audience are interested in seeing the unravelling of tony and that 's the fun part to play .
you filmed three endings - why ?
because of the press interest .
we tried to keep it to ourselves because every time we turn up at a location there are people waiting for us and it 's always revealed the next day , so it 's just a way to keep it guarded .
what is it like being part of such a huge storyline ?
it 's actually just being involved in coronation street as a whole , it 's great to be involved in this iconic show .
i do n't think it really matters what role you play - to be part of it is a great honour .
to be at the forefront of it is quite daunting though , but it 's been really exciting too .
how many people have you told what really happens ?
i have n't told anybody .
i 've absolutely kept it under my hat .
i do n't have anything to gain by telling anyone , because it ruins it .
i just had my mother on the phone saying ' why do n't you tell us ? '
did you know when you accepted the role the storyline would develop like this ?
coming in to play the coronation street villain has a life span , so i was aware of that .
i knew he was going to be villainous , but i think it was all based on audience reaction that they liked him and the writers just went with it .
so it 's been a really organic process , i do n't think i expected this to happen , quite as it has happened .
i think it 's certainly going to play on till next year , but i do n't know how long for .
i was aware that i was n't coming in for 20 years on the street , that was never the case .
do you have any ideas as to what should happen to tony ?
none at all , i 've just spent three hours on the train with the producer and she was n't giving anything away .
i 've dropped a few hints .
obviously he 's got to come to an end , and whether that will be a grisly end or whatever , i do n't know .
i 've got great faith in the writers at coronation street and entrust that they 'll keep the momentum with the character going .
he 's a great character to play and he 's popular so i do trust whichever way it ends will be the correct ending .

however , the businessman is about to play his dirtiest trick yet when he puts an end to his fiancée carla 's affair with liam connor .
in real life , actor gray o 'brien reveals what it is like to play the itv1 soap 's bad guy .
warning : the following interview may contain spoilers .
how has the reaction to your character been so far ?
i was worried when i heard the storyline .
i was worried that i was going to be the most hated man in soap , but i think you 'll agree after watching it there 's two sides to this .
i do n't know what will happen on friday .
i 'm not going to be in the country , so we 'll see what happens .
i expect to get a bit of stick for it , but i think there 's an interest in tony because he 's not just the villain .
there 's other sides to him and the onion starts to unpeel and i think the audience are interested in seeing the unravelling of tony and that 's the fun part to play .
carla and liam have been having an affair behind tony 's back you filmed three endings - why ?
because of the press interest .
we tried to keep it to ourselves because every time we turn up at a location there are people waiting for us and it 's always revealed the next day , so it 's just a way to keep it guarded .
what is it like being part of such a huge storyline ?
it 's actually just being involved in coronation street as a whole , it 's great to be involved in this iconic show .
i do n't think it really matters what role you play - to be part of it is a great honour .
to be at the forefront of it is quite daunting though , but it 's been really exciting too .
how many people have you told what really happens ?
i have n't told anybody .
i 've absolutely kept it under my hat .
i do n't have anything to gain by telling anyone , because it ruins it .
i just had my mother on the phone saying ' why do n't you tell us ? '
did you know when you accepted the role the storyline would develop like this ?
three different endings of liam 's murder have been shot coming in to play the coronation street villain has a life span , so i was aware of that .
i knew he was going to be villainous , but i think it was all based on audience reaction that they liked him and the writers just went with it .
so it 's been a really organic process , i do n't think i expected this to happen , quite as it has happened .
i think it 's certainly going to play on till next year , but i do n't know how long for .
i was aware that i was n't coming in for 20 years on the street , that was never the case .
do you have any ideas as to what should happen to tony ?
none at all , i 've just spent three hours on the train with the producer and she was n't giving anything away .
i 've dropped a few hints .
obviously he 's got to come to an end , and whether that will be a grisly end or whatever , i do n't know .
i 've got great faith in the writers at coronation street and entrust that they 'll keep the momentum with the character going .
he 's a great character to play and he 's popular so i do trust whichever way it ends will be the correct ending .

however , the businessman is about to play his dirtiest trick yet when he puts an end to his fiancée carla 's affair with liam connor .
in real life , actor gray o 'brien reveals what it is like to play the itv1 soap 's bad guy .
warning : the following interview may contain spoilers .
how has the reaction to your character been so far ?
i was worried when i heard the storyline .
i was worried that i was going to be the most hated man in soap , but i think you 'll agree after watching it there 's two sides to this .
i do n't know what will happen on friday .
i 'm not going to be in the country , so we 'll see what happens .
i expect to get a bit of stick for it , but i think there 's an interest in tony because he 's not just the villain .
there 's other sides to him and the onion starts to unpeel and i think the audience are interested in seeing the unravelling of tony and that 's the fun part to play .
carla and liam have been having an affair behind tony 's back you filmed three endings - why ?
because of the press interest .
we tried to keep it to ourselves because every time we turn up at a location there are people waiting for us and it 's always revealed the next day , so it 's just a way to keep it guarded .
what is it like being part of such a huge storyline ?
it 's actually just being involved in coronation street as a whole , it 's great to be involved in this iconic show .
i do n't think it really matters what role you play - to be part of it is a great honour .
to be at the forefront of it is quite daunting though , but it 's been really exciting too .
how many people have you told what really happens ?
i have n't told anybody .
i 've absolutely kept it under my hat .
i do n't have anything to gain by telling anyone , because it ruins it .
i just had my mother on the phone saying ' why do n't you tell us ? '
did you know when you accepted the role the storyline would develop like this ?
three different endings of liam 's murder have been shot coming in to play the coronation street villain has a life span , so i was aware of that .
i knew he was going to be villainous , but i think it was all based on audience reaction that they liked him and the writers just went with it .
so it 's been a really organic process , i do n't think i expected this to happen , quite as it has happened .
i think it 's certainly going to play on till next year , but i do n't know how long for .
i was aware that i was n't coming in for 20 years on the street , that was never the case .
do you have any ideas as to what should happen to tony ?
none at all , i 've just spent three hours on the train with the producer and she was n't giving anything away .
i 've dropped a few hints .
obviously he 's got to come to an end , and whether that will be a grisly end or whatever , i do n't know .
i 've got great faith in the writers at coronation street and entrust that they 'll keep the momentum with the character going .
he 's a great character to play and he 's popular so i do trust whichever way it ends will be the correct ending .
gray o 'brien was speaking to bbc entertainment reporter fiona pryor .
the denouement to the liam , carla and tony storyline is on itv1 on friday 17 october from 1930 bst .

it was originally supposed to fill a six-week gap in scheduling . • the show is named after the blue-and-white flag flown on a ship 's yard arm to show it is ready to go to sea - suggesting a voyage of discovery for viewers .

presenter anthea turner still owns the original she crafted on the show in 1993 .
another favourite was the christmas advent crown made from coat hangers and fireproof tinsel . • on 30 july 1968 , itv launched magpie - a rival show made by thames television which launched on the new licensee 's first day of broadcast .
the programme , which had a mascot called murgatroyd the magpie , aimed to be hipper than its bbc counterpart .
blue peter eventually saw it off in 1980 . • there have been only six editors in the show 's 50-year history .
the first was ms baxter who stepped up from producer into the newly-created role in 1965 .
she was followed by lewis bronze , oliver macfarlane , steve hocking , richard marson and current editor tim levell . • the programme blazed a trail for many subsequent bbc shows by breaking out of the studio and making full use of bbc television centre as a location .
initially , this prompted a memo from bbc management warning that " television centre is not a place of entertainment " . • blue peter has won 40 awards , including a special award at the tv baftas in 1998 for " outstanding contribution to children 's television " .
presenters • according to biddy baxter , blue peter creator john hunter blair had two passions - 00 gauge railways and attractive women .
the first presenters of the show were 00 gauge railway enthusiast christopher trace and 21-year-old leila williams , crowned miss great britain the previous year . • yorkshireman john noakes presented the programme for 12 and a half years between 1965 and 1978 .
he left at the age of 45 , making him the longest-serving of the 34 blue peter presenters . • anita west had the briefest stint , spending four months on the show - from 7 may to 3 september 1962 - before returning to her acting career . • yvette fielding , who was 18 when she joined the show in 1987 , was its youngest-ever presenter . • the classic line-up of john noakes , valerie singleton and peter purves presented the show for five years from 1967 to 1972 . • peter duncan , who wore trademark green-and-white checked outfits , is the only presenter to have had two stints on blue peter - between 1980 and 1984 , and 1985 and 1986 .
he was awarded a gold blue peter badge in february 2007 in recognition of his work as chief scout . • like john noakes , whose " long fall " earned him a place in the guinness book of records for the longest freefall parachute jump by a civilian , peter duncan became associated with daredevil stunts .
he went on to host duncan dares after quitting blue peter . • in january 1990 , diane-louise jordan became blue peter 's first black presenter .
louise-jordan , who stayed in the show for six years , now hosts songs of praise . • presenters who became more well-known after leaving the show include john leslie , who had a relationship with catherine zeta jones while he was in blue peter , sarah greene and the late caron keating .

gaffes and scandals • host john noakes was famously asked to drop his trousers after a bruising adventure on a bobsleigh .
at which point , he realised he was wearing his wife 's underwear which he had put on by accident in the dark . • simon groom , who appeared on the show for eight years from 1978 to 1986 , along with his dog goldie , once said on the show : " what a beautiful pair of knockers . "
he was commenting on replacements for the historical door knocker at durham cathedral . • in 1987 , it was revealed that janet ellis was an unmarried mother .
the presenter - who left the show following the birth of her second child , jack - already had a daughter , the future pop star sophie ellis-bextor . • richard bacon became the first blue peter presenter to be sacked , in october 1998 , after he admitted taking cocaine , following reports in a tabloid newspaper .
lorraine heggessey , then head of bbc children 's programmes , apologised on air . • in 2007 , presenters were forced to apologise after faking the results of a phone-in competition .
a technical problem led to a visiting child posing as a competition winner .
" we let you down , " konnie huq told viewers .
appeals • in the programme 's early years , christopher trace presented christmas toy reviews .
the first appeal began with the idea of giving , rather than receiving toys - with the audience asked to send in toys for members of the audience who would not be receiving any . • it is estimated that , across 46 blue peter appeals , the equivalent of more than £ 100m in today 's money has been raised , while 14 bring and buy sale initiatives have netted the equivalent of about £ 57m . • blue peter appeals have raised money to help buy : 8,350 lavatories , 57 lorries , 32 ponies , 25 lifeboats - some of which can still be found at seven lifeboat stations around the uk - 12 romanian houses , eight flats for homeless people , six bungalows , three caravans , three schools , two guide dogs and two day centres .
the blue peter garden • following the launch of the garden at bbc television centre in 1974 , gardener percy thrower became a household name alongside the show 's presenters .
he retired in 1988 , and was followed by chris crowder , clare bradley and chris collins . • in november 1983 , the garden was devastated by vandals , leaving thrower in tears . • in 2000 , footballer les ferdinand , who was brought up close to television centre , told reporters he had been involved in the raid on the blue peter garden .
but last year , he told the guardian newspaper that , under pressure from journalists , he had made the story up as a joke . • george the tortoise , blue peter 's longest-surviving pet who died at the age of 81 , is the only animal to have been buried in the blue peter garden . • three time capsules have been buried around bbc television centre .
the first , buried in 1971 , had to be moved because of building development .
a second was buried in 1984 , and another in 2000 - scheduled to be opened in 2029 . • another millennium time capsule was hidden under the building that is now the o2 arena in south-east london , as part of the build up to 2000 , and will be opened in 2050 .
badges • introduced in 1963 , the blue peter badge was biddy baxter 's idea .
she wanted to generate fresh ideas for the programme and offered the badges as an incentive to eager young viewers to write in . • the badge allows free admission into 200 venues around the uk .
however , in 2006 , the scheme was briefly suspended when the badges were found to have been auctioned on the ebay website . • there are six types of badges now in existence - blue , green , purple , orange , silver and gold . • the gold blue peter badge is the show 's highest honour and is awarded to those who have displayed , among other things , exceptional courage , or have represented their country in an international event . • famous gold badge winners include the queen - who visited the studio in 2001 - author jk rowling and footballer david beckham . • olympic bronze medallist bryony stokes wore her blue peter badge as she windsurfed to victory at the beijing olympics 2008 .
animals • among the blue peter pets there have been eight dogs , five tortoises , nine cats and two parrots . • fred the tortoise , who first appeared on 21 october 1963 , had to be renamed freda , after it was discovered , four years later , that he was actually a girl . • bonnie , a much-loved golden retriever , was given a gold blue peter badge on her retirement in 1991 . • john noakes ' catchphrase , " get down shep " , used to control his canine companion , was incorporated into a pop song of the same name by the barron knights in 1978 , reaching number 44 in the charts . • and finally , in 1969 , lulu the elephant famously defecated , urinated and dragged her keeper through the mess in the studio .
during the chaotic scenes , the keeper could be heard shouting for someone to fetch " me stick " .
as peter purves explains : " during rehearsals , anytime he wanted the elephant to do anything , he had a chain around its neck and he 'd pull it , the elephant would n't go and he 'd bonk it on the head with a stick and biddy thought it looked cruel .
" she said , ' would you please do it without a stick , ' - so he did .
the elephant went wherever it liked - end of story . "

" i 'm doing management and finance and i do n't have one particular career path in mind , i 'm keeping my options open .
" i 'm from aberdeen and a lot of the economy is oil and gas related and i 'm worried if that is still going to be around in 20-30 years time .

alan porteous , is studying risk management at glasgow caledonian university .
the 22-year-old graduates in two years and was waiting to speak to someone from the hbos stall .

ms graham is one of the organisers of the two-day event , which is in its nineteenth year .

under these deals , people struggling to pay their mortgage sell their home at a discount to firms who let them stay on in the property as tenants .
but an oft report found that this was not the best option for some , and others were quickly evicted .
it wants the estimated 1,000-plus firms involved to be more transparent .
an unknown number of amateur landlords are also involved in the relatively new industry .
the oft said that about 50,000 transactions of this kind have already taken place .
' vulnerable ' " our research shows that sale and rent back deals have potential to cause serious and permanent harm to often vulnerable homeowners , " said oft chief executive john fingleton . "
a small number of rogue operators have now brought the entire market under close scrutiny " david salusbury , national landlords association one couple 's story " the unfamiliar and highly pressurised situations that these people find themselves in may leave them particularly vulnerable to misleading statements or valuations from sale and rent back firms looking to make a deal .
" even those customers for whom sale and rent back might be the best option could be unaware they are currently bearing almost of all the risks . "
he added that statutory regulation , which should be outlined by the financial services authority -lrb- fsa -rrb- , was necessary to stop " unacceptable behaviour " of some operators .
consumer groups have called for regulation of these schemes , also known as mortgage rescue .
rising stakes advertisements for these deals often target those facing repossession , homeowners can accept a quick sale at a discount , and then rent the property until they might be able to buy it back again .
the council of mortgage lenders predicts that there will be 45,000 repossessions in the uk in 2008 , up from 27,100 in the previous year .
but the oft study suggested there were better options for some of these consumers .
other findings included : misleading details , with some tenancies only guaranteed for six to 12 months although residents believed they could stay in their homes for years .
some landlords raise the rent substantially and quickly evict tenants who struggle to pay .
former homeowners who become tenants have lost their homes anyway , because the new landlord has defaulted on the mortgage and the property has been repossessed .
the oft wants sale and rent back firms to be more transparent about valuation and sale prices , and about the terms of tenancy and the rent required .
these should match the assurances they give when approaching customers .
the watchdog also wants a requirement that firms tell customers about free , impartial and independent advice available to them before they decide to sell .
it is unhappy that even if sale and rent back is the best option for some homeowners , they are unaware that they bear almost all the risk .
' no quick fix ' the report warned that regulation of the industry would not be quick .
but it said that some firms might be breaking existing regulations aimed at protecting consumers in general .
the oft said it would work with trading standards officers to take action against these firms .
the national landlords association -lrb- nla -rrb- said that there was a place for ethical use of sale and rent back schemes in the housing market , and it wanted to see a code of practice in place .
" we believe the majority of sale and rent back landlords act with professionalism and integrity , " said nla chairman david salusbury .
" a small number of rogue operators have now brought the entire market under close scrutiny . "
the council of mortgage lenders and citizens advice called for the swift implementation of regulation in the sector .
" while sale and rent back agreements might be the right thing for some people , consumers need the sort of robust and binding safeguards that only statutory regulation is likely to provide , " said citizens advice chief executive david harker .

rising stakes advertisements for these deals often target those facing repossession , homeowners can accept a quick sale at a discount , and then rent the property until they might be able to buy it back again .
the council of mortgage lenders predicts that there will be 45,000 repossessions in the uk in 2008 , up from 27,100 in the previous year .
but the oft study suggested there were better options for some of these consumers .
other findings included : misleading details , with some tenancies only guaranteed for six to 12 months although residents believed they could stay in their homes for years .
some landlords raise the rent substantially and quickly evict tenants who struggle to pay .
former homeowners who become tenants have lost their homes anyway , because the new landlord has defaulted on the mortgage and the property has been repossessed .
the oft wants sale and rent back firms to be more transparent about valuation and sale prices , and about the terms of tenancy and the rent required .
these should match the assurances they give when approaching customers .
the watchdog also wants a requirement that firms tell customers about free , impartial and independent advice available to them before they decide to sell .
it is unhappy that even if sale and rent back is the best option for some homeowners , they are unaware that they bear almost all the risk .
' no quick fix ' the report warned that regulation of the industry would not be quick .
various groups are calling for regulation to be brought in quickly but it said that some firms might be breaking existing regulations aimed at protecting consumers in general .
the oft said it would work with trading standards officers to take action against these firms .
the national landlords association -lrb- nla -rrb- said that there was a place for ethical use of sale and rent back schemes in the housing market , and it wanted to see a code of practice in place .
" we believe the majority of sale and rent back landlords act with professionalism and integrity , " said nla chairman david salusbury .
" a small number of rogue operators have now brought the entire market under close scrutiny . "
the council of mortgage lenders and citizens advice called for the swift implementation of regulation in the sector .
" while sale and rent back agreements might be the right thing for some people , consumers need the sort of robust and binding safeguards that only statutory regulation is likely to provide , " said citizens advice chief executive david harker .

prisons watchdog anne owers attacked indeterminate sentences for public protection , saying their scope and impact had damaged the penal system .
her joint report with the probation inspectorate said the law 's introduction was a lesson in " how not to " tackle offenders .
there are some 4,200 inmates on the sentences , according to figures .
indeterminate sentences for public protection , known as ipps , came into force in april 2005 .
they gave judges the power to jail a serious offender for a specific term - but order that the criminal remains behind bars until they have proven they had reduced the risk they posed .
but in their joint report , the prisons and probation inspectorates said that ipps would affect the criminal justice system " for years to come " . "
we have already identified many of the shortcomings raised in this report which was undertaken a year ago and work is being carried out to address them " prisons minister david hanson q & a : indeterminate sentences ms owers said that by the time the courts started to use the new sentencing powers , the prison population was already " surging " .
" this large number of new , and resource-intensive , prisoners was fed into a system that was already under strain , " she said .
" this has not only increased pressure , and reduced manoeuvrability , within the prison system ; it has also meant that a great deal of officials ' time and energy has been taken up with simply finding enough prison spaces . "
the joint report said the arrival of ipps coincided with a weakening of systems designed to manage prisoners serving a life sentence .
at the same time , the probation service was under-prepared and resourced for its critical role in deciding which of these inmates should remain inside or be released .
in turn , many ipp inmates on relatively short sentences remained behind bars , further adding to record population pressures .
" this was a perfect storm , " said ms owers .
" it led to ipp prisoners languishing in local prisons for months and years , unable to access the interventions they would need before the expiry of their often short tariffs . "
the report revealed that one prison governor described the effect of all of this was akin to the government doing its shopping without first having a fridge .
' vital protection ' justice minister david hanson said the sentences were " vital " to protect the public .
" we have already identified many of the shortcomings raised in this report which was undertaken a year ago and work is being carried out to address them .
" we have made clear on a number of occasions that the ipp sentence was never intended to be used generally for short tariff prisoners .
" we now have legislation in place to ensure the sentence is used as intended . "
but juliet lyon of the prison reform trust accused ministers of " acting tough , not smart " to chase headlines .
" despite some changes , it is likely that many of these prisoners who have served their minimum tariff but remain in prison do so because they have had no opportunity to demonstrate they pose no risk , if released .
" ministers can not abandon these people in a maze with no exit and must act quickly and decisively to put things right and prevent more costly legal challenges . "
' huge frustration ' erica restall , of switalskis solicitors , was involved in a high court test case involving brett james who was detained for longer than his tariff under an ipp sentence .
he was jailed in 2005 with a minimum tariff of one year and 295 days for a violent attack on a man near wakefield .
his sentence expired in july 2007 , but he was not released until february 2008 .
ms restall said : " in brett 's case he did not even get to take the first step and undergo assessment for the courses he would need to complete to show that he posed a reduced risk . "
james was held at doncaster prison , and while ms restall says he was a model prisoner and completed as many courses there as he could , none of it would count with the parole board .
she said : " it was a huge frustration for him , and very demoralising .
going into prison was a huge shock to him and throughout his time he was impeccably behaved and tried to access as many courses as he could to show he was attempting to better himself .
" yet he watched other people come and go under different sentences and that was hard , although he always accepted the seriousness of his crime . "
ms restall said ipp sentences will cause ongoing problems while there is insufficient access to assessment and subsequent courses for inmates to present appropriate evidence to the parole board .

indeterminate sentences for public protection , known as ipps , came into force in april 2005 .
they gave judges the power to jail a serious offender for a specific term - but order that the criminal remains behind bars until they have proven they had reduced the risk they posed .
but in their joint report , the prisons and probation inspectorates said that ipps would affect the criminal justice system " for years to come " .
we have already identified many of the shortcomings raised in this report which was undertaken a year ago and work is being carried out to address them prisons minister david hanson q & a : indeterminate sentences ms owers said that by the time the courts started to use the new sentencing powers , the prison population was already " surging " .
" this large number of new , and resource-intensive , prisoners was fed into a system that was already under strain , " she said .
" this has not only increased pressure , and reduced manoeuvrability , within the prison system ; it has also meant that a great deal of officials ' time and energy has been taken up with simply finding enough prison spaces . "
the joint report said the arrival of ipps coincided with a weakening of systems designed to manage prisoners serving a life sentence .
at the same time , the probation service was under-prepared and resourced for its critical role in deciding which of these inmates should remain inside or be released .
in turn , many ipp inmates on relatively short sentences remained behind bars , further adding to record population pressures .
" this was a perfect storm , " said ms owers .
" it led to ipp prisoners languishing in local prisons for months and years , unable to access the interventions they would need before the expiry of their often short tariffs . "
the report revealed that one prison governor described the effect of all of this was akin to the government doing its shopping without first having a fridge .
' vital protection ' justice minister david hanson said the sentences were " vital " to protect the public .
" we have already identified many of the shortcomings raised in this report which was undertaken a year ago and work is being carried out to address them .
" we have made clear on a number of occasions that the ipp sentence was never intended to be used generally for short tariff prisoners .
" we now have legislation in place to ensure the sentence is used as intended . "
but juliet lyon of the prison reform trust accused ministers of " acting tough , not smart " to chase headlines .
" despite some changes , it is likely that many of these prisoners who have served their minimum tariff but remain in prison do so because they have had no opportunity to demonstrate they pose no risk , if released .
" ministers can not abandon these people in a maze with no exit and must act quickly and decisively to put things right and prevent more costly legal challenges . "
' huge frustration ' erica restall , of switalskis solicitors , was involved in a high court test case involving brett james who was detained for longer than his tariff under an ipp sentence .
he was jailed in 2005 with a minimum tariff of one year and 295 days for a violent attack on a man near wakefield .
his sentence expired in july 2007 , but he was not released until february 2008 .
ms restall said : " in brett 's case he did not even get to take the first step and undergo assessment for the courses he would need to complete to show that he posed a reduced risk . "
james was held at doncaster prison , and while ms restall says he was a model prisoner and completed as many courses there as he could , none of it would count with the parole board .
she said : " it was a huge frustration for him , and very demoralising .
going into prison was a huge shock to him and throughout his time he was impeccably behaved and tried to access as many courses as he could to show he was attempting to better himself .
" yet he watched other people come and go under different sentences and that was hard , although he always accepted the seriousness of his crime . "
ms restall said ipp sentences will cause ongoing problems while there is insufficient access to assessment and subsequent courses for inmates to present appropriate evidence to the parole board .

' huge frustration ' erica restall , of switalskis solicitors , was involved in a high court test case involving brett james who was detained for longer than his tariff under an ipp sentence .
he was jailed in 2005 with a minimum tariff of one year and 295 days for a violent attack on a man near wakefield .
his sentence expired in july 2007 , but he was not released until february 2008 .
ms restall said : " in brett 's case he did not even get to take the first step and undergo assessment for the courses he would need to complete to show that he posed a reduced risk . "
james was held at doncaster prison , and while ms restall says he was a model prisoner and completed as many courses there as he could , none of it would count with the parole board .
she said : " it was a huge frustration for him , and very demoralising .
going into prison was a huge shock to him and throughout his time he was impeccably behaved and tried to access as many courses as he could to show he was attempting to better himself .
" yet he watched other people come and go under different sentences and that was hard , although he always accepted the seriousness of his crime . "
ms restall said ipp sentences will cause ongoing problems while there is insufficient access to assessment and subsequent courses for inmates to present appropriate evidence to the parole board .

prisons watchdog anne owers attacked indeterminate sentences for public protection , saying their scope and impact had damaged the penal system .
her joint report with the probation inspectorate said the law 's introduction was a lesson in " how not to " tackle offenders .
there are some 4,200 inmates on the sentences , according to figures .
indeterminate sentences for public protection , known as ipps , came into force in april 2005 .
they gave judges the power to jail a serious offender for a specific term - but order that the criminal remains behind bars until they have proven they had reduced the risk they posed .
but in their joint report , the prisons and probation inspectorates said that ipps would affect the criminal justice system " for years to come " .
we have already identified many of the shortcomings raised in this report which was undertaken a year ago and work is being carried out to address them prisons minister david hanson q & a : indeterminate sentences ms owers said that by the time the courts started to use the new sentencing powers , the prison population was already " surging " .
" this large number of new , and resource-intensive , prisoners was fed into a system that was already under strain , " she said .
" this has not only increased pressure , and reduced manoeuvrability , within the prison system ; it has also meant that a great deal of officials ' time and energy has been taken up with simply finding enough prison spaces . "
the joint report said the arrival of ipps coincided with a weakening of systems designed to manage prisoners serving a life sentence .
at the same time , the probation service was under-prepared and resourced for its critical role in deciding which of these inmates should remain inside or be released .
in turn , many ipp inmates on relatively short sentences remained behind bars , further adding to record population pressures .
" this was a perfect storm , " said ms owers .
" it led to ipp prisoners languishing in local prisons for months and years , unable to access the interventions they would need before the expiry of their often short tariffs . "
the report revealed that one prison governor described the effect of all of this was akin to the government doing its shopping without first having a fridge .
' vital protection ' justice minister david hanson said the sentences were " vital " to protect the public .
" we have already identified many of the shortcomings raised in this report which was undertaken a year ago and work is being carried out to address them .
" we have made clear on a number of occasions that the ipp sentence was never intended to be used generally for short tariff prisoners .
" we now have legislation in place to ensure the sentence is used as intended . "
but juliet lyon of the prison reform trust accused ministers of " acting tough , not smart " to chase headlines .
