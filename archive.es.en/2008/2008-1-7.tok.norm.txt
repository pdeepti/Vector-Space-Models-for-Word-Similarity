the 2006 leader slipped significantly in the 2007 rankings , dropping from first to seventh place behind portugal and slovenia . " the general trend is that privacy is being extinguished in country after country , " said simon davies , director of the group .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : tackling youth crime german conservatives want crackdown on youth crime politicians call for tougher laws against young offenders conservative cdu turns youth crime debate into election issue german plan to criminalize teen sex put on back burner politics -pipe- 07.01.2008 squeezed in state poll , german politician pulls out old tricks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we have too many criminal young foreigners , " koch has said a senior figure in chancellor merkel 's conservative party has focused his re-election campaign in a regional poll on crime , in particular offenses by foreigners .
it 's not the first time the party has used such tactics . seeking a third consecutive term as leader of the prosperous western german state of hesse , roland koch has made immigration the centerpiece of his campaign , stirring memories of a similar election bid almost a decade ago . facing a strong challenge from his social democratic challenger who is focusing on demands for a national minimum wage , koch has seized on a recent violent attack on a german pensioner by two young immigrants on a munich subway train to call for the deportation of " criminal foreigners " and urge an end to " multicultural " coddling of immigrants . the attack , which left the 76-year-old victim with a fractured skull , was captured on close circuit cameras and aired for days on german television . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch is no stranger to controversy " how much are we prepared to take from a small proportion of violent youths , who frequently have a foreign background ? "
koch , once a rising star but now struggling , told mass circulation tabloid bild .
" we have spent too long showing a strange sociological understanding for groups that consciously commit violence as ethnic minorities . " koch 's comments on young immigrant criminals follow a proposal last month for a ban on students wearing the all-encompassing burqa in schools even though there was no reported incident of it . playing with fire while koch 's comments have sparked an outcry among left-wing politicians and immigrant groups and fuelled a heated debate on juvenile crime , political observers point out that it 's not the first time the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- has used anti-immigrant rhetoric to gain political mileage . " the cdu is a highly pragmatic party that does n't shy away from using the anti-foreigner card to reinforce prejudices and appeal to right-wing elements in the population , " said peter lösche , a retired professor of political science at the university of göttingen .
" it 's done it before and had success with it . " in 1999 , koch used criticism of immigration to oust a center-left administration and win the hesse state election .
he launched a successful signature campaign in which his party hit out against federal government plans to introduce dual citizenship for foreign citizens living in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu ran a notorious campaign against skilled indian software specialists in 2000 , another cdu politician , jürgen rüttgers , of north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state , unleashed a campaign against proposed " green cards " for indian software engineers .
his slogan , " kinder statt inder " or " children instead of indians " referred to a preference for home-grown it talent over skilled foreign workers .
while he failed to win that election , he did become the state 's premier in 2005 . members of the cdu 's sister bavarian party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , have often used anti-immigrant rhetoric in their speeches , most notably former bavarian premier edmund stoiber . germany is home to 15 million people of immigrant background , making up about 18 percent of the population .
most of them came as foreign " guest workers " from turkey and italy to help rebuild the country after the war and stayed on . many takers for anti-immigrant rhetoric ? some point out that koch 's populism and anti-immigrant campaigning is not out of place in hesse , home to around 6.1 million people and the city of frankfurt , one of europe 's major financial markets . " the cdu in hesse has always been a law and order party and is known for its ultra-conservative wing , " said gero neugebauer , a political scientist at berlin 's free university .
" koch 's current campaign is an obvious attempt to mobilize this hard core of its supporters who the cdu fears it might lose to far-right parties . " while far-right parties are largely successful in former communist eastern germany - the anti-immigrant npd is represented in two of five state assemblies - experts underline that xenophobic tendencies also exist among voters of mainstream political parties in the western part of the country . " hostility against foreigners and immigrants is equally widespread in western germany , too , " said elmar brähler from the university of leipzig , who carried out a study in 2006 for the friedrich ebert foundation on right-wing extremism in germany .
" the phenomenon is worst among those over the age of 60 . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 68 percent of the cdu 's members are older than 50 analysts say it 's no coincidence koch is appealing to an older generation of conservative voters who are increasingly important to his re-election bid and those of conservative premiers in other states . according to the party 's latest statistics , cdu membership has fallen from 638,000 in 1999 to 541,289 at the end of sept 2007 .
around 68 percent of the members are older than 50 , compared with 14 percent in the age group 16 to 39 . " whipping up fears about security after a brutal attack on the munich subway is a sure tactic of getting the attention of these older voters , " neugebauer said . minimum wage may be a vote-getter this time while koch 's anti-foreigner rhetoric has put further strain on his party 's uneasy grand coalition with the social democrats at the federal level , experts say chancellor angela merkel is unlikely to publicly rein in koch for fear of losing an economically and politically important state that the cdu has ruled for almost a decade . polls indicate that the spd has made huge gains in hesse and that koch is struggling to keep his absolute majority . merkel herself has talked often about the need to integrate the country 's 2.3 million muslims , most of who are of turkish origin , but says immigrants must accept german culture .
an opponent of turkey 's eu membership , merkel won thunderous applause at a recent party conference for saying mosques should not dwarf churches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say voters are more interested in getting decent wages while the outcome of the election in hesse is still open , some believe that the cdu 's tactic of using stirring fears of immigration as a vote-getter may no longer work this time . the spd 's push for a national minimum wage in an effort to dethrone koch - it 's opposed by merkel 's cdu - has wide public support and comes at a time when fears about economic uncertainty are growing , said richard stöss , a politics professor at berlin 's free university . " hesse is home to lots of industry and factories and an issue like a national minimum wage is likely to resonate far better with voters than fears of immigration , " he said . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the cdu is a highly pragmatic party that does n't shy away from using the anti-foreigner card to reinforce prejudices and appeal to right-wing elements in the population , " said peter lösche , a retired professor of political science at the university of göttingen .
" it 's done it before and had success with it . " in 1999 , koch used criticism of immigration to oust a center-left administration and win the hesse state election .
he launched a successful signature campaign in which his party hit out against federal government plans to introduce dual citizenship for foreign citizens living in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu ran a notorious campaign against skilled indian software specialists in 2000 , another cdu politician , jürgen rüttgers , of north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state , unleashed a campaign against proposed " green cards " for indian software engineers .
his slogan , " kinder statt inder " or " children instead of indians " referred to a preference for home-grown it talent over skilled foreign workers .
while he failed to win that election , he did become the state 's premier in 2005 . members of the cdu 's sister bavarian party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , have often used anti-immigrant rhetoric in their speeches , most notably former bavarian premier edmund stoiber . germany is home to 15 million people of immigrant background , making up about 18 percent of the population .
most of them came as foreign " guest workers " from turkey and italy to help rebuild the country after the war and stayed on . many takers for anti-immigrant rhetoric ? some point out that koch 's populism and anti-immigrant campaigning is not out of place in hesse , home to around 6.1 million people and the city of frankfurt , one of europe 's major financial markets . " the cdu in hesse has always been a law and order party and is known for its ultra-conservative wing , " said gero neugebauer , a political scientist at berlin 's free university .
" koch 's current campaign is an obvious attempt to mobilize this hard core of its supporters who the cdu fears it might lose to far-right parties . " while far-right parties are largely successful in former communist eastern germany - the anti-immigrant npd is represented in two of five state assemblies - experts underline that xenophobic tendencies also exist among voters of mainstream political parties in the western part of the country . " hostility against foreigners and immigrants is equally widespread in western germany , too , " said elmar brähler from the university of leipzig , who carried out a study in 2006 for the friedrich ebert foundation on right-wing extremism in germany .
" the phenomenon is worst among those over the age of 60 . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 68 percent of the cdu 's members are older than 50 analysts say it 's no coincidence koch is appealing to an older generation of conservative voters who are increasingly important to his re-election bid and those of conservative premiers in other states . according to the party 's latest statistics , cdu membership has fallen from 638,000 in 1999 to 541,289 at the end of sept 2007 .

it 's not the first time the party has used such tactics . seeking a third consecutive term as leader of the prosperous western german state of hesse , roland koch has made immigration the centerpiece of his campaign , stirring memories of a similar election bid almost a decade ago . facing a strong challenge from his social democratic challenger who is focusing on demands for a national minimum wage , koch has seized on a recent violent attack on a german pensioner by two young immigrants on a munich subway train to call for the deportation of " criminal foreigners " and urge an end to " multicultural " coddling of immigrants . the attack , which left the 76-year-old victim with a fractured skull , was captured on close circuit cameras and aired for days on german television . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch is no stranger to controversy " how much are we prepared to take from a small proportion of violent youths , who frequently have a foreign background ? "
koch , once a rising star but now struggling , told mass circulation tabloid bild .

in karlsruhe on thursday , a baby girl was found dead in a similar baby hatch ; officials say she had likely died before being left there .
in both cases , there are no clues as to the identity of the parents .
baby hatches have existed in germany since the 19th century in the hope of preventing infanticide by giving desperate mothers a safe place to leave their unwanted babies .
but they have always been controversial , mainly because it is illegal to give birth anonymously in germany .
critics of the hatches say they help women circumvent the law .
but voices on the other side of the debate say that anonymous births will take place no matter what the law says , and that it is better to provide mothers who feel compelled to give birth in secret an anonymous drop-off point for their babies .
calls to legalize anonymous births now , the two incidents in hanover and karlsruhe are rekindling the anonymous birth debate .
both government and protestant church officials in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg have renewed calls for legalizing anonymous births , which would give pregnant women the option of delivering in a hospital without stating their name .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : legalizing anonymous birth could save the lives of as many as 50 babies a year , experts say the state of baden-württemberg has long been a proponent of legal anonymous births in germany and , together with the state of bavaria , has drawn up draft legislation .
but while the draft has frequently been up for discussion , it has never received the necessary majority from all the committees involved , according to a spokesperson from the state justice ministry .
according to statistics from the regional government in stuttgart , 40 to 50 babies are born in secret without medical assistance each year nationwide , and less than half survive .
having the option of giving birth anonymously in a hospital would reduce the risks for both mother and child , proponents argue .
officials discuss how to help desperate moms in the eastern german state of lower saxony , social minister mechthild ross-luttmann said she intends to talk with those organizations that sponsor baby hatches about ways to improve the service .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could hatches be part of a support concept for pregnant women in need ?
" perhaps there 's a need for improvement at some of the hatches , " she told german news agency dpa , adding that signs with instructions in several languages would be a sensible addition .
a spokeswoman from the free-market liberal free democratic party 's parliamentary group said that the cases in hanover and karlsruhe should not result in criticism of baby hatches .
instead , they should inspire more discussion of how to give such services a legal framework , and how best to help desperate mothers-to-be .

the hessen premier wants to defend his seat this month and so he drops his standards .
the conservative politician has chosen to follow the route of populism and has found a subject that is being widely debated at dinner tables all across the country : juvenile delinquency among foreigners in germany . the subject is not only old and is just a minor part of a larger problem : the brutalization of society .
ignoring the larger picture , koch has demanded that violent foreign youngsters be punished harder and thrown out of the country faster . he has chosen his moment well .
the festive season over christmas and the new year is traditionally slow for news .
as a result , koch has been in the headlines for days .
everyone has heard roland koch 's opinion .
his timing is perfidious . this has not been advantageous for either the debate or any possible solution to the problem . politicians on the right and the left are pulled apart in anger over which direction to take .
koch 's loud exhortations from the middle-class conservative corner have been derided by the left-wing liberals who see a darker agenda at work : hostility to foreigners . not only a foreign problem the truth is that there is evidence that foreign youngsters and those with a migration background regularly feature in violent crime statistics .
but this is not the whole story .
the problem does not come from them being foreign .
investigations show that the lives of violent german youngsters share remarkable similarities with those of culprits with migrant backgrounds . both sets of perpetrators come from disadvantaged social groups and areas .
their stories read the same : broken homes , borderline poverty , unfinished school careers , unemployment . these are the childhood and youth experiences of young delinquents , whether they are named ali , sergei or jürgen .
the main problem in juvenile delinquency in germany is a structural one , and only secondly - or thirdly - can it be regarded as a problem among foreigners or migrants . germany 's social failings must be addressed these failed lives and the inadequacies of social structure should not be used to excuse individuals of responsibility , but it must be accepted that german integration policy has failed at its most basic levels , and that education has failed in the early stage of kindergarten . these weaknesses will not be repaired by harder punishments and deportations .
the united states of america is an example of that .
the congested prisons and draconian punishments such as the death penalty in the us have not made its towns safer . one more thing points to a dishonest and opportunist attempt by roland koch to win votes through this tactical and manipulated debate : if koch and his supporters really want to push through harder and more effective punishments for the likes of " violent ali " and " thieving sergei , " then why has the hesse premier cut 700 permanent police jobs and 80 permanent justice positions during his time in office ? this dangerous game will have a familiar and sad outcome .
come the day after the hessen election on january 27 , the problem will disappear from public debate - unsolved . volker wagener works at deutsche welle 's central news desk -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , it seems , it 's not only adoring crowds who rate him highly . critics and fans alike marveled at the diminutive playmaker 's all-round performance and eye for goal before the winter break as bremen charged up the league to devour bayern munich 's early season lead to leave the league finely poised in the second half run-in .
now it seems that diego 's brilliance has n't gone unnoticed by his peers .
despite being tantalized , teased and trounced by the little dynamo , diego 's fellow players have bestowed on him the accolade of being the best outfield player in the bundesliga in the first half of the season .
the bremen star 's nine goals which have made him the league 's joint top scorer - which is not bad considering he 's a midfielder and that he has some stiff competition - helped land 44.9 percent of the 275 votes in the survey by kicker magazine .

contergan , a sedative which contained the active ingredient thalidomide , was prescribed to pregnant women in the late 1950s , and caused their fetuses to be born with severely shortened limbs , or in some cases , no limbs at all .
around half of the 10,000 thalidomide victims worldwide were born in west germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas meyer the president of germany 's association of contergan victims , andreas meyer , says the tragedy has never been fully investigated , nor is he happy with what he says is grünenthal 's silence on the issue .
the company has never formally apologized , although in the past month , it has begun meeting with victims ' representatives seeking an improved health and financial situation for the some 2,700 thalidomide victims still living in germany .
" we want to know exactly what happened , " meyer said , adding that he was not prepared to accept an apology on its own without the appropriate compensation .
more financial aid needed , victims say thalidomide victims say a compensation fund set up in 1970 has been exhausted and that many now need extra help as arthritis and age bring pain after a lifetime of unnatural movement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's thalidomide babies were often raised and schooled apart from other children grünenthal had said that the 110 million deutsche marks -lrb- 56.3 million euros or $ 83 million at current rates -rrb- it paid into a trust in 1971 was a final settlement of all claims in germany .
the modest monthly stipends of 545 euros victims currently receive are entirely funded by the government .
among the victims ' demands is a six-fold increase in these monthly payments to an amount between 2,100 and 3,500 euros , as well as a one-time compensation payment of around 1 million euros per victim .
the victims ' representatives are planning a parliamentary campaign to make their case to both the federal government and grünenthal .
" an independent lifestyle is not possible with the current level of monthly payments , " said udo herterich of the regional thalidomide victims ' association in the state of north rhine-westphalia .
" we 're getting older , we 're suffering more from the consequences of our disabilities and we need more and more help . "
grünenthal ceo " very moved " the victims ' associations were hopeful that grünenthal would reassess its position following an initial meeting with employees last month .
grünenthal ceo sebastian wirtz described the meeting as " very moving , " and said that he and his family regretted very much the events of 50 years ago .
" even though i had n't been born at that point , as a family member of the third generation , i would like to try , together with those affected , to come to terms with the contergan tragedy , " wirtz said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from the tv drama " eine einzige tablette " -lrb- a single pill -rrb- on the weekend , various associations of german contergan victims joined forces with the international contergan alliance , made up of the national associations of great britain , spain , sweden and canada .

both meinhof 's ex-husband kalus-heinz röhl and her daughter bettina röhl have written about meinhof and the process of disintegration of german society beginning in the spring of 1968 that led to the formation of the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- . unravelling myths bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf has been the subject of numerous books but jutta ditfurth 's biography on meinhof , released in november , disputes many of the myths that surround meinhof 's transformation from journalist to raf terrorist . in her six years researching the biography , ditfurth , a founder of the german greens party , who has since left the stage of national politics , uncovered previously unpublished material , including documents kept in archives outside of germany . " ulrike meinhof was a much more interesting , much more multi-faceted person than i used to think , " ditfurth told dw-radio .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bettina röhl has written a book about her mother while ditfurth admits the book is politically biased , she said there is a big difference between writing from a left wing point of view and endorsing anarchic terrorism .

" but still i did my best to find out all the things that i had ever wanted to know .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : tackling youth crime german conservatives want crackdown on youth crime politicians call for tougher laws against young offenders conservative cdu turns youth crime debate into election issue german plan to criminalize teen sex put on back burner politics -pipe- 07.01.2008 squeezed in state poll , german politician pulls out old tricks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we have too many criminal young foreigners , " koch has said a senior figure in chancellor merkel 's conservative party has focused his re-election campaign in a regional poll on crime , in particular offenses by foreigners .
it 's not the first time the party has used such tactics . seeking a third consecutive term as leader of the prosperous western german state of hesse , roland koch has made immigration the centerpiece of his campaign , stirring memories of a similar election bid almost a decade ago . facing a strong challenge from his social democratic challenger who is focusing on demands for a national minimum wage , koch has seized on a recent violent attack on a german pensioner by two young immigrants on a munich subway train to call for the deportation of " criminal foreigners " and urge an end to " multicultural " coddling of immigrants . the attack , which left the 76-year-old victim with a fractured skull , was captured on close circuit cameras and aired for days on german television . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch is no stranger to controversy " how much are we prepared to take from a small proportion of violent youths , who frequently have a foreign background ? "
koch , once a rising star but now struggling , told mass circulation tabloid bild .
" we have spent too long showing a strange sociological understanding for groups that consciously commit violence as ethnic minorities . " koch 's comments on young immigrant criminals follow a proposal last month for a ban on students wearing the all-encompassing burqa in schools even though there was no reported incident of it . playing with fire while koch 's comments have sparked an outcry among left-wing politicians and immigrant groups and fuelled a heated debate on juvenile crime , political observers point out that it 's not the first time the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- has used anti-immigrant rhetoric to gain political mileage . " the cdu is a highly pragmatic party that does n't shy away from using the anti-foreigner card to reinforce prejudices and appeal to right-wing elements in the population , " said peter lösche , a retired professor of political science at the university of göttingen .
" it 's done it before and had success with it . " in 1999 , koch used criticism of immigration to oust a center-left administration and win the hesse state election .
he launched a successful signature campaign in which his party hit out against federal government plans to introduce dual citizenship for foreign citizens living in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu ran a notorious campaign against skilled indian software specialists in 2000 , another cdu politician , jürgen rüttgers , of north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state , unleashed a campaign against proposed " green cards " for indian software engineers .
his slogan , " kinder statt inder " or " children instead of indians " referred to a preference for home-grown it talent over skilled foreign workers .
while he failed to win that election , he did become the state 's premier in 2005 . members of the cdu 's sister bavarian party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , have often used anti-immigrant rhetoric in their speeches , most notably former bavarian premier edmund stoiber . germany is home to 15 million people of immigrant background , making up about 18 percent of the population .
most of them came as foreign " guest workers " from turkey and italy to help rebuild the country after the war and stayed on . many takers for anti-immigrant rhetoric ? some point out that koch 's populism and anti-immigrant campaigning is not out of place in hesse , home to around 6.1 million people and the city of frankfurt , one of europe 's major financial markets . " the cdu in hesse has always been a law and order party and is known for its ultra-conservative wing , " said gero neugebauer , a political scientist at berlin 's free university .
" koch 's current campaign is an obvious attempt to mobilize this hard core of its supporters who the cdu fears it might lose to far-right parties . " while far-right parties are largely successful in former communist eastern germany - the anti-immigrant npd is represented in two of five state assemblies - experts underline that xenophobic tendencies also exist among voters of mainstream political parties in the western part of the country . " hostility against foreigners and immigrants is equally widespread in western germany , too , " said elmar brähler from the university of leipzig , who carried out a study in 2006 for the friedrich ebert foundation on right-wing extremism in germany .
" the phenomenon is worst among those over the age of 60 . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 68 percent of the cdu 's members are older than 50 analysts say it 's no coincidence koch is appealing to an older generation of conservative voters who are increasingly important to his re-election bid and those of conservative premiers in other states . according to the party 's latest statistics , cdu membership has fallen from 638,000 in 1999 to 541,289 at the end of sept 2007 .
around 68 percent of the members are older than 50 , compared with 14 percent in the age group 16 to 39 . " whipping up fears about security after a brutal attack on the munich subway is a sure tactic of getting the attention of these older voters , " neugebauer said . minimum wage may be a vote-getter this time while koch 's anti-foreigner rhetoric has put further strain on his party 's uneasy grand coalition with the social democrats at the federal level , experts say chancellor angela merkel is unlikely to publicly rein in koch for fear of losing an economically and politically important state that the cdu has ruled for almost a decade . polls indicate that the spd has made huge gains in hesse and that koch is struggling to keep his absolute majority . merkel herself has talked often about the need to integrate the country 's 2.3 million muslims , most of who are of turkish origin , but says immigrants must accept german culture .
an opponent of turkey 's eu membership , merkel won thunderous applause at a recent party conference for saying mosques should not dwarf churches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say voters are more interested in getting decent wages while the outcome of the election in hesse is still open , some believe that the cdu 's tactic of using stirring fears of immigration as a vote-getter may no longer work this time . the spd 's push for a national minimum wage in an effort to dethrone koch - it 's opposed by merkel 's cdu - has wide public support and comes at a time when fears about economic uncertainty are growing , said richard stöss , a politics professor at berlin 's free university . " hesse is home to lots of industry and factories and an issue like a national minimum wage is likely to resonate far better with voters than fears of immigration , " he said . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : german state elections in hesse and lower saxony german ex-minister warns against own party in key state poll immigrant groups protest against koch 's justice plans germany mulls extending voting rights to foreigners german ex-chancellor criticizes xenophobic election campaign politics -pipe- 07.01.2008 state election policies reveal extent of divide in german coalition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the state polls are seen as the starting pistol for the 2009 general election campiagn state elections this year are likely to be the catalyst for open war between the country 's ruling coalition partners .
both parties are attempting to stake out their ground ahead of a 2009 federal election . as things stand , chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- counterparts appear to be barely holding their fractious relationship together .
once the voters go to the polls in state elections this year , divisions over two key policy issues could see the brittle façade finally shatter . the wrangling over a proposed national minimum wage , championed by the spd , and a conservative-led plan to crackdown on juvenile crime are the issues likely to dominate the first elections , taking place in hessen and lower saxony in late january and in hamburg in february .
bavaria will vote in september .
the results of the state elections could indicate how the general election in 2009 could play out . the way each party makes its arguments and the results of the polls in relation to the issues may drive the current wedge between the coalition partners deeper , effectively splitting the government .
the spd have set the call for a national minimum wage at the heart of their campaign in the key state polls , much to the chagrin of the cdu . minimum wage central to spd campaign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the campaign for no wage under 7.50 euros is popular among labor unionists at the launch of the campaign , peter struck , the head of the spd 's parliamentary group , announced that the social democrats intended to harness the strong public backing for a minimum hourly wage of 7.50 euros -lrb- $ 10.77 -rrb- in the three regional races . " we will start petition drives during the state elections , " struck said in december .
" then the voters will have their say .
we will make the state elections and the general election in 2009 into a referendum on the minimum wage . " the social democrats , who have been trailing the conservatives in the polls by around 10 points for several months , argue that europe 's biggest economy must ensure that wages are high enough to keep workers above the poverty level .
germany is one of the few countries in the eu without a national minimum wage , though it does have a series of industry-specific wage agreements . many leading conservative members , the chancellor included , have reacted angrily to the spd 's stance , saying that an across-the-board minimum wage would be a job killer , driving companies to eastern europe and asia where pay is lower . merkel favors industry control on wages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor has led the opposition to the proposal at the launch of the cdu election program on saturday , the party ruled out a debate on the minimum wage , defiantly putting itself in opposition to the spd 's central election theme . merkel has said that the national minimum wage is " not the right answer " and has reiterated her support for the traditional practice of leaving unions and employers to negotiate wage levels in each industry . meanwhile , the conservatives seem intent on fighting the state elections on a law and order ticket , riling the spd in the process . the cdu leadership has called for stiffer penalties for juveniles convicted of violent crimes , proposing an increase in the maximum sentence for young people convicted of serious offences from 10 to 15 years . the party has also called for a " warning shot " period of detention for those given probation for violent crimes and the introduction of boot camps where young offenders could be sent for re-education .
under the new cdu proposals , rules for deporting foreigners convicted of serious crimes would also be eased . conservatives react to upsurge in violent crime bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violent crime has been grabbing the headlines " i think ' warning-shot arrests ' -lsb- short periods in detention -rsb- and boot camps could indeed be a sensible supplement to current laws , " merkel said .
" it could turn young people around so they do not wind up in prison . " the proposals , in line with those put forward by roland koch , the under-pressure cdu premier of hesse , who is seeking a third term of office on jan .
27 , come after a spate of violent attacks across germany . " how much are we prepared to take from a small proportion of violent youths , who frequently have a foreign background , " koch said in an interview after the attack , which has been repeatedly broadcast on television . " something has to be done , " merkel added .
" there is no point in delaying matters .
it is unacceptable that many people do not dare ride the subway at night because they are afraid of violence ... we need the feeling of personal security again in germany . " -lrb- the social democrats -rrb- can not close their eyes to the fact that 43 percent of all violent crimes in germany are committed by people who are under the age of 21 and that among them , nearly half are foreign-born youth , " she said . cdu accused of targeting foreigners bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch -lrb- l . -rrb- and interior minister volker bouffier promote a " secure life " the social democrats have accused koch and the conservatives of fuelling anti-foreigner sentiment in order to gain re-election and said existing laws were sufficient to punish violent offenders . however , spd leader kurt beck conceded that steps need to be taken to combat the upsurge in youth crime as long they involved better application of current laws instead of introducing new legislation . " this is better than taking hasty action arising solely from motives related to elections , " beck told the news magazine der spiegel . it is unlikely that any further concessions will be made by either party as the coalition partners plot their own slow and potentially bitter courses towards the 2009 general election . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de conservative cdu turns youth crime debate into election issue conservative politicians in the state of hesse are latching on to the issue of how to deal with crime committed by young foreigners to score points with voters in a key regional election later this month .

germany is one of the few countries in the eu without a national minimum wage , though it does have a series of industry-specific wage agreements . many leading conservative members , the chancellor included , have reacted angrily to the spd 's stance , saying that an across-the-board minimum wage would be a job killer , driving companies to eastern europe and asia where pay is lower . merkel favors industry control on wages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor has led the opposition to the proposal at the launch of the cdu election program on saturday , the party ruled out a debate on the minimum wage , defiantly putting itself in opposition to the spd 's central election theme . merkel has said that the national minimum wage is " not the right answer " and has reiterated her support for the traditional practice of leaving unions and employers to negotiate wage levels in each industry . meanwhile , the conservatives seem intent on fighting the state elections on a law and order ticket , riling the spd in the process . the cdu leadership has called for stiffer penalties for juveniles convicted of violent crimes , proposing an increase in the maximum sentence for young people convicted of serious offences from 10 to 15 years . the party has also called for a " warning shot " period of detention for those given probation for violent crimes and the introduction of boot camps where young offenders could be sent for re-education .
under the new cdu proposals , rules for deporting foreigners convicted of serious crimes would also be eased . conservatives react to upsurge in violent crime bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violent crime has been grabbing the headlines " i think ' warning-shot arrests ' -lsb- short periods in detention -rsb- and boot camps could indeed be a sensible supplement to current laws , " merkel said .
" it could turn young people around so they do not wind up in prison . " the proposals , in line with those put forward by roland koch , the under-pressure cdu premier of hesse , who is seeking a third term of office on jan .
27 , come after a spate of violent attacks across germany . " how much are we prepared to take from a small proportion of violent youths , who frequently have a foreign background , " koch said in an interview after the attack , which has been repeatedly broadcast on television . " something has to be done , " merkel added .
" there is no point in delaying matters .
it is unacceptable that many people do not dare ride the subway at night because they are afraid of violence ... we need the feeling of personal security again in germany . " -lrb- the social democrats -rrb- can not close their eyes to the fact that 43 percent of all violent crimes in germany are committed by people who are under the age of 21 and that among them , nearly half are foreign-born youth , " she said . cdu accused of targeting foreigners bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch -lrb- l . -rrb- and interior minister volker bouffier promote a " secure life " the social democrats have accused koch and the conservatives of fuelling anti-foreigner sentiment in order to gain re-election and said existing laws were sufficient to punish violent offenders . however , spd leader kurt beck conceded that steps need to be taken to combat the upsurge in youth crime as long they involved better application of current laws instead of introducing new legislation . " this is better than taking hasty action arising solely from motives related to elections , " beck told the news magazine der spiegel . it is unlikely that any further concessions will be made by either party as the coalition partners plot their own slow and potentially bitter courses towards the 2009 general election . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

contergan , a sedative which contained the active ingredient thalidomide , was prescribed to pregnant women in the late 1950s , and caused their fetuses to be born with severely shortened limbs , or in some cases , no limbs at all .
around half of the 10,000 thalidomide victims worldwide were born in west germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas meyer the president of germany 's association of contergan victims , andreas meyer , says the tragedy has never been fully investigated , nor is he happy with what he says is grünenthal 's silence on the issue .
the company has never formally apologized , although in the past month , it has begun meeting with victims ' representatives seeking an improved health and financial situation for the some 2,700 thalidomide victims still living in germany .
" we want to know exactly what happened , " meyer said , adding that he was not prepared to accept an apology on its own without the appropriate compensation .
more financial aid needed , victims say thalidomide victims say a compensation fund set up in 1970 has been exhausted and that many now need extra help as arthritis and age bring pain after a lifetime of unnatural movement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's thalidomide babies were often raised and schooled apart from other children grünenthal had said that the 110 million deutsche marks -lrb- 56.3 million euros or $ 83 million at current rates -rrb- it paid into a trust in 1971 was a final settlement of all claims in germany .
the modest monthly stipends of 545 euros victims currently receive are entirely funded by the government .

contergan , a sedative which contained the active ingredient thalidomide , was prescribed to pregnant women in the late 1950s , and caused their fetuses to be born with severely shortened limbs , or in some cases , no limbs at all .
around half of the 10,000 thalidomide victims worldwide were born in west germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas meyer the president of germany 's association of contergan victims , andreas meyer , says the tragedy has never been fully investigated , nor is he happy with what he says is grünenthal 's silence on the issue .
the company has never formally apologized , although in the past month , it has begun meeting with victims ' representatives seeking an improved health and financial situation for the some 2,700 thalidomide victims still living in germany .
" we want to know exactly what happened , " meyer said , adding that he was not prepared to accept an apology on its own without the appropriate compensation .
more financial aid needed , victims say thalidomide victims say a compensation fund set up in 1970 has been exhausted and that many now need extra help as arthritis and age bring pain after a lifetime of unnatural movement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's thalidomide babies were often raised and schooled apart from other children grünenthal had said that the 110 million deutsche marks -lrb- 56.3 million euros or $ 83 million at current rates -rrb- it paid into a trust in 1971 was a final settlement of all claims in germany .
the modest monthly stipends of 545 euros victims currently receive are entirely funded by the government .
among the victims ' demands is a six-fold increase in these monthly payments to an amount between 2,100 and 3,500 euros , as well as a one-time compensation payment of around 1 million euros per victim .
the victims ' representatives are planning a parliamentary campaign to make their case to both the federal government and grünenthal .

now , it seems , it 's not only adoring crowds who rate him highly . critics and fans alike marveled at the diminutive playmaker 's all-round performance and eye for goal before the winter break as bremen charged up the league to devour bayern munich 's early season lead to leave the league finely poised in the second half run-in .
now it seems that diego 's brilliance has n't gone unnoticed by his peers .
despite being tantalized , teased and trounced by the little dynamo , diego 's fellow players have bestowed on him the accolade of being the best outfield player in the bundesliga in the first half of the season .
the bremen star 's nine goals which have made him the league 's joint top scorer - which is not bad considering he 's a midfielder and that he has some stiff competition - helped land 44.9 percent of the 275 votes in the survey by kicker magazine .
diego beat french midfielder franck ribery of bayern munich -lrb- 21.5 percent -rrb- into second place and dutch playmaker rafael van der vaart of sv hamburg -lrb- 16.8 percent -rrb- into third .
diego looks on target to repeat his 2006/2007 achievement of being voted the best player at the end of the season by his contemporaries .
bremen maestro in world 's top four bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego , here with robinho , is rated among the world 's best he also features in the " world 's best " list voted for by the bundesliga players .
diego sits joint fourth with compatriot ronaldinho of barcelona , while fellow brazilian kaka of ac milan tops the list .
barca 's argentinean genius lionel messi and manchester united winger cristiano ronaldo separate the selecao stars , in second and third respectively .
the top german star in kicker 's bundesliga poll was bayer leverkusen midfielder simon rolfes -lrb- 4.3 percent -rrb- who came in behind van der vaart in fourth place .
in a separate vote for goalkeepers , leverkusen 's rene adler was voted the best keeper with 35.8 percent of the vote , followed by hanover 's robert enke -lrb- 28 percent -rrb- and frank rost of sv hamburg -lrb- 11.4 percent -rrb- .
promotion suprise package wins coach plaudits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : becker 's karlsruhe are fighting for a european place edmund becker of promoted sc karlsruhe was named the bundesliga 's best coach of the season so far .
while their fortunes dipped a little before the break , becker 's boys have been a consistent top five team since august when many were tipping them to struggle for survival from the first whistle .
karlsruhe 's exploits earned their coach 39.4 percent of the players ' votes .
hamburg 's huub stevens -lrb- 31.7 percent -rrb- and hanover 's dieter hecking -lrb- 12 percent -rrb- were next .
it was n't only winners who got a mention in the kicker poll .
in the coaching " losers " category , arminia bielefeld 's ernst middendorp was deemed the biggest flop so far , followed by thomas doll of borussia dortmund .
the poll , published monday , kept all votes anonymous , allowing players to return to their clubs for post-break training without fear of reprisals .
merk the world 's best ref the kicker poll comes as germany 's soccer referees were also getting congratulations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus merk remains on top of the world game after his success in 2004 and 2005 , german ref markus merk was voted the world 's best by the international federation of football history & statistics .
compatriot herbert fandel was second and slovakia 's lubos michel third .
merk officiated at the world cup in japan and korea in 2002 and germany in 2006 .
he also reffed the euro 2004 final between greece and portugal , along with 2003 champions league final .

it 's not the first time the party has used such tactics . seeking a third consecutive term as leader of the prosperous western german state of hesse , roland koch has made immigration the centerpiece of his campaign , stirring memories of a similar election bid almost a decade ago . facing a strong challenge from his social democratic challenger who is focusing on demands for a national minimum wage , koch has seized on a recent violent attack on a german pensioner by two young immigrants on a munich subway train to call for the deportation of " criminal foreigners " and urge an end to " multicultural " coddling of immigrants . the attack , which left the 76-year-old victim with a fractured skull , was captured on close circuit cameras and aired for days on german television . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch is no stranger to controversy " how much are we prepared to take from a small proportion of violent youths , who frequently have a foreign background ? "
koch , once a rising star but now struggling , told mass circulation tabloid bild .
" we have spent too long showing a strange sociological understanding for groups that consciously commit violence as ethnic minorities . " koch 's comments on young immigrant criminals follow a proposal last month for a ban on students wearing the all-encompassing burqa in schools even though there was no reported incident of it . playing with fire while koch 's comments have sparked an outcry among left-wing politicians and immigrant groups and fuelled a heated debate on juvenile crime , political observers point out that it 's not the first time the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- has used anti-immigrant rhetoric to gain political mileage . " the cdu is a highly pragmatic party that does n't shy away from using the anti-foreigner card to reinforce prejudices and appeal to right-wing elements in the population , " said peter lösche , a retired professor of political science at the university of göttingen .
" it 's done it before and had success with it . " in 1999 , koch used criticism of immigration to oust a center-left administration and win the hesse state election .
he launched a successful signature campaign in which his party hit out against federal government plans to introduce dual citizenship for foreign citizens living in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu ran a notorious campaign against skilled indian software specialists in 2000 , another cdu politician , jürgen rüttgers , of north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state , unleashed a campaign against proposed " green cards " for indian software engineers .
his slogan , " kinder statt inder " or " children instead of indians " referred to a preference for home-grown it talent over skilled foreign workers .
while he failed to win that election , he did become the state 's premier in 2005 . members of the cdu 's sister bavarian party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , have often used anti-immigrant rhetoric in their speeches , most notably former bavarian premier edmund stoiber . germany is home to 15 million people of immigrant background , making up about 18 percent of the population .
most of them came as foreign " guest workers " from turkey and italy to help rebuild the country after the war and stayed on . many takers for anti-immigrant rhetoric ? some point out that koch 's populism and anti-immigrant campaigning is not out of place in hesse , home to around 6.1 million people and the city of frankfurt , one of europe 's major financial markets . " the cdu in hesse has always been a law and order party and is known for its ultra-conservative wing , " said gero neugebauer , a political scientist at berlin 's free university .
" koch 's current campaign is an obvious attempt to mobilize this hard core of its supporters who the cdu fears it might lose to far-right parties . " while far-right parties are largely successful in former communist eastern germany - the anti-immigrant npd is represented in two of five state assemblies - experts underline that xenophobic tendencies also exist among voters of mainstream political parties in the western part of the country . " hostility against foreigners and immigrants is equally widespread in western germany , too , " said elmar brähler from the university of leipzig , who carried out a study in 2006 for the friedrich ebert foundation on right-wing extremism in germany .
" the phenomenon is worst among those over the age of 60 . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 68 percent of the cdu 's members are older than 50 analysts say it 's no coincidence koch is appealing to an older generation of conservative voters who are increasingly important to his re-election bid and those of conservative premiers in other states . according to the party 's latest statistics , cdu membership has fallen from 638,000 in 1999 to 541,289 at the end of sept 2007 .
around 68 percent of the members are older than 50 , compared with 14 percent in the age group 16 to 39 . " whipping up fears about security after a brutal attack on the munich subway is a sure tactic of getting the attention of these older voters , " neugebauer said . minimum wage may be a vote-getter this time while koch 's anti-foreigner rhetoric has put further strain on his party 's uneasy grand coalition with the social democrats at the federal level , experts say chancellor angela merkel is unlikely to publicly rein in koch for fear of losing an economically and politically important state that the cdu has ruled for almost a decade . polls indicate that the spd has made huge gains in hesse and that koch is struggling to keep his absolute majority . merkel herself has talked often about the need to integrate the country 's 2.3 million muslims , most of who are of turkish origin , but says immigrants must accept german culture .
an opponent of turkey 's eu membership , merkel won thunderous applause at a recent party conference for saying mosques should not dwarf churches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say voters are more interested in getting decent wages while the outcome of the election in hesse is still open , some believe that the cdu 's tactic of using stirring fears of immigration as a vote-getter may no longer work this time . the spd 's push for a national minimum wage in an effort to dethrone koch - it 's opposed by merkel 's cdu - has wide public support and comes at a time when fears about economic uncertainty are growing , said richard stöss , a politics professor at berlin 's free university . " hesse is home to lots of industry and factories and an issue like a national minimum wage is likely to resonate far better with voters than fears of immigration , " he said . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in light of the recent caucuses in the us state of iowa , europeans have no right to criticize the american election process , said readers . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . i agree that the us system of electing a president may not be perfect and can put too much emphasis how a person conducts himself / herself rather than an ability to run a country , but i still prefer it over the german system -lrb- i was born and raised in germany -rrb- .
i assume mr. unger knows that the us is a republic and not a democracy , much less a parliamentary democracy - and thanks for that .
he really thinks a party is better at selecting leaders than the people ?
all of my german friends are disillusioned with the party system because they feel they are not in the loop and have no input at all .
here i can visit with my representative or staff person and tell them what i think about legislation .
for better or for worse , our representatives listen to the input from their constituents .
i e-mail on a regular basis with my representative in the florida legislature .
as far as i am concerned , europe can keep its parliamentary democracies . - marga e.doerr , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us system does n't work in other cultures , said a reader when do you think a german with a kenyan father and a middle name of hussein will stir the hearts of say bavarian farmers ?
it will come - the war in iraq is unsustainable , breaking the country 's back , the dollar is diving and we are violating our principles of democracy .
people are thinking for the first time that the next generation will have it worse and what is the use ?
the most important thing for us is to change from the path of tyranny , ruinous war and torture - and the change will come .
we will take our country back .
we have had good luck in the past and we could use european help .
next time germany has a problem , let us rub something in your eye to make you feel worse instead of giving you hope ! - robert friedman , us many americans think we should make changes to our elections , especially in how they are financed .
but any place that has free speech , including europe , is subject to the concept of political propaganda being funded by what in the united states are called " political action committees . "
even if campaign financing were reformed to only public financing in the us those who want to influence the voters will always be able to disseminate information / propaganda to the public in proportion to their funding .
and sometimes the funding is massive .
one thing not mentioned in this article is that in the iowa caucuses the republican winner was one of the least funded candidates thus far , as was the second place democratic candidate .
indeed , the democratic winner brought record numbers of young people -lrb- under age 25 -rrb- into the political process for the first time .
messages won iowa .
" establishment " candidates on both sides were rebuked .
by far , this is the story from iowa that is worth noting . - bryan beyer , us unfortunately , you have decided to completely ignore the historical significance of barack obama 's success in favor of criticizing the us election system .
maybe you will follow up with a more socially relevant discussion if obama wins in new hampshire .
regarding the us system , it is uniquely ours , only works for us , and has largely not been transferable to other cultures .
we are americans and not europeans and our system was set up specifically rejecting anything european . - kathleen johnson , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton is not one of the candidates with a modest campaign budget no surprise here : europeans critical of the united states .
this is just another example of europe holding itself above the us .
add your " displeasure " of our political system to the never ending list .
we are so tired of hearing how superior europe is to the us that we have stopped listening and caring what you think . - e.h. day , us i have never read an article in the american press criticizing the arcane political practices in germany .
policy criticisms , yes .
we never criticized schröder 's bad hair dye when there was room for criticism .
yet the german elite seem to find no end of problems with the american political system .
after the primary win by the first african-american candidate in us history , you trot out german college professors who criticize the process itself and they ignore the substance of what just took place .
when i last visited berlin , berliners could not wait to sit me down and tell me everything that was wrong with america .
i did not respond similarly because i was , after all , a guest in their country and it would not be appropriate for me to start criticizing .
but it seems that berliners have no qualms about criticizing and complaining about a guest 's home country . - john alus , us compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is to reach the auschwitz death camp in poland on may 8 . but the group claims it has fought resistance from federally owned german railway concern deutsche bahn every step of the way .
representatives are particularly angry that they have to pay the same fees as any other private train operator to use the german railway tracks , despite the company 's historic involvement in the transports . deutsche bahn acknowledged on friday , jan .
4 , that it was charging the group the same toll for track use as other private train operators .
a bahn spokesman said the company had to treat all customers equally . bahn 's historic responsibility the train of commemoration group argues that the bahn must face up to its historic responsibility as the transport provider to the nazis .
it said the tens of thousands of euros of tolls charged to the rolling exhibit were " in effect a boycott of this public commemoration . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibit is based on a similar one by nazi hunter beate klarsfeld the exhibition uses letters and biographies to show how jewish children were caught up in the nazi machinery of death and taken to the gas chambers in cattle wagons . the german citizens ' initiative behind the exhibit was formed by a group of journalists , artists , lawyers and academics , in the wake of a 2003 french exhibition organized by french nazi hunters and activists beate and serge klarsfeld .
the klarsfeld exhibit , which focused on the deportation of 11,000 jewish children via rail from france to nazi death camps , was shown in french train stations . deutsche bahn denied a request to display the french exhibit in german train stations . " that 's when we got the idea to do our own exhibit , " journalist hans-ruediger minow , spokesman for the train of commemoration project , told germany 's mitteldeutsche zeitung newspaper . no exceptions to the rule , bahn says the train of commemoration group came up with the notion of creating an exhibit that would symbolically travel through the country on the very railways that were used in the deportations .
but both deutsche bahn and the german transportation ministry , which issued the transport orders under the nazi regime , failed to show interest in the project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn is charging the project to use its rails susanne kill , corporate historian for deutsche bahn , told the mitteldeutsche zeitung that the company " is processing its nazi history in numerous projects of its own . "
she added that deutsche bahn would be bringing its own traveling exhibit to appropriate train stations . moreover , she said , " deutsche bahn ca n't allow free use of the rails in individual cases . " earnings could go to charity according to german law , anyone is allowed to use the railways and train stations - as long as they meet certain standards , and can pay the costs . minow is now trying to drum up support for his cause . " we expect protests in germany and internationally until deutsche bahn and the ministry of transport see reason , " he told the leftist newspaper neues deutschland on saturday . a transportation ministry spokesman told the dpa news agency that deutsche bahn was considering to donate the income from the train of commemoration in the form of a corporate charitable grant . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a bahn spokesman said the company had to treat all customers equally . bahn 's historic responsibility the train of commemoration group argues that the bahn must face up to its historic responsibility as the transport provider to the nazis .

" that 's when we got the idea to do our own exhibit , " journalist hans-ruediger minow , spokesman for the train of commemoration project , told germany 's mitteldeutsche zeitung newspaper . no exceptions to the rule , bahn says the train of commemoration group came up with the notion of creating an exhibit that would symbolically travel through the country on the very railways that were used in the deportations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : tackling youth crime german conservatives want crackdown on youth crime politicians call for tougher laws against young offenders conservative cdu turns youth crime debate into election issue german plan to criminalize teen sex put on back burner politics -pipe- 07.01.2008 squeezed in state poll , german politician pulls out old tricks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we have too many criminal young foreigners , " koch has said a senior figure in chancellor merkel 's conservative party has focused his re-election campaign in a regional poll on crime , in particular offenses by foreigners .
it 's not the first time the party has used such tactics . seeking a third consecutive term as leader of the prosperous western german state of hesse , roland koch has made immigration the centerpiece of his campaign , stirring memories of a similar election bid almost a decade ago . facing a strong challenge from his social democratic challenger who is focusing on demands for a national minimum wage , koch has seized on a recent violent attack on a german pensioner by two young immigrants on a munich subway train to call for the deportation of " criminal foreigners " and urge an end to " multicultural " coddling of immigrants . the attack , which left the 76-year-old victim with a fractured skull , was captured on close circuit cameras and aired for days on german television . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch is no stranger to controversy " how much are we prepared to take from a small proportion of violent youths , who frequently have a foreign background ? "
koch , once a rising star but now struggling , told mass circulation tabloid bild .
" we have spent too long showing a strange sociological understanding for groups that consciously commit violence as ethnic minorities . " koch 's comments on young immigrant criminals follow a proposal last month for a ban on students wearing the all-encompassing burqa in schools even though there was no reported incident of it . playing with fire while koch 's comments have sparked an outcry among left-wing politicians and immigrant groups and fuelled a heated debate on juvenile crime , political observers point out that it 's not the first time the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- has used anti-immigrant rhetoric to gain political mileage . " the cdu is a highly pragmatic party that does n't shy away from using the anti-foreigner card to reinforce prejudices and appeal to right-wing elements in the population , " said peter lösche , a retired professor of political science at the university of göttingen .
" it 's done it before and had success with it . " in 1999 , koch used criticism of immigration to oust a center-left administration and win the hesse state election .
he launched a successful signature campaign in which his party hit out against federal government plans to introduce dual citizenship for foreign citizens living in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu ran a notorious campaign against skilled indian software specialists in 2000 , another cdu politician , jürgen rüttgers , of north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state , unleashed a campaign against proposed " green cards " for indian software engineers .
his slogan , " kinder statt inder " or " children instead of indians " referred to a preference for home-grown it talent over skilled foreign workers .
while he failed to win that election , he did become the state 's premier in 2005 . members of the cdu 's sister bavarian party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , have often used anti-immigrant rhetoric in their speeches , most notably former bavarian premier edmund stoiber . germany is home to 15 million people of immigrant background , making up about 18 percent of the population .
most of them came as foreign " guest workers " from turkey and italy to help rebuild the country after the war and stayed on . many takers for anti-immigrant rhetoric ? some point out that koch 's populism and anti-immigrant campaigning is not out of place in hesse , home to around 6.1 million people and the city of frankfurt , one of europe 's major financial markets . " the cdu in hesse has always been a law and order party and is known for its ultra-conservative wing , " said gero neugebauer , a political scientist at berlin 's free university .
" koch 's current campaign is an obvious attempt to mobilize this hard core of its supporters who the cdu fears it might lose to far-right parties . " while far-right parties are largely successful in former communist eastern germany - the anti-immigrant npd is represented in two of five state assemblies - experts underline that xenophobic tendencies also exist among voters of mainstream political parties in the western part of the country . " hostility against foreigners and immigrants is equally widespread in western germany , too , " said elmar brähler from the university of leipzig , who carried out a study in 2006 for the friedrich ebert foundation on right-wing extremism in germany .
" the phenomenon is worst among those over the age of 60 . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 68 percent of the cdu 's members are older than 50 analysts say it 's no coincidence koch is appealing to an older generation of conservative voters who are increasingly important to his re-election bid and those of conservative premiers in other states . according to the party 's latest statistics , cdu membership has fallen from 638,000 in 1999 to 541,289 at the end of sept 2007 .
around 68 percent of the members are older than 50 , compared with 14 percent in the age group 16 to 39 . " whipping up fears about security after a brutal attack on the munich subway is a sure tactic of getting the attention of these older voters , " neugebauer said . minimum wage may be a vote-getter this time while koch 's anti-foreigner rhetoric has put further strain on his party 's uneasy grand coalition with the social democrats at the federal level , experts say chancellor angela merkel is unlikely to publicly rein in koch for fear of losing an economically and politically important state that the cdu has ruled for almost a decade . polls indicate that the spd has made huge gains in hesse and that koch is struggling to keep his absolute majority . merkel herself has talked often about the need to integrate the country 's 2.3 million muslims , most of who are of turkish origin , but says immigrants must accept german culture .
an opponent of turkey 's eu membership , merkel won thunderous applause at a recent party conference for saying mosques should not dwarf churches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say voters are more interested in getting decent wages while the outcome of the election in hesse is still open , some believe that the cdu 's tactic of using stirring fears of immigration as a vote-getter may no longer work this time . the spd 's push for a national minimum wage in an effort to dethrone koch - it 's opposed by merkel 's cdu - has wide public support and comes at a time when fears about economic uncertainty are growing , said richard stöss , a politics professor at berlin 's free university .

it 's not the first time the party has used such tactics . seeking a third consecutive term as leader of the prosperous western german state of hesse , roland koch has made immigration the centerpiece of his campaign , stirring memories of a similar election bid almost a decade ago . facing a strong challenge from his social democratic challenger who is focusing on demands for a national minimum wage , koch has seized on a recent violent attack on a german pensioner by two young immigrants on a munich subway train to call for the deportation of " criminal foreigners " and urge an end to " multicultural " coddling of immigrants . the attack , which left the 76-year-old victim with a fractured skull , was captured on close circuit cameras and aired for days on german television . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch is no stranger to controversy " how much are we prepared to take from a small proportion of violent youths , who frequently have a foreign background ? "
koch , once a rising star but now struggling , told mass circulation tabloid bild .
" we have spent too long showing a strange sociological understanding for groups that consciously commit violence as ethnic minorities . " koch 's comments on young immigrant criminals follow a proposal last month for a ban on students wearing the all-encompassing burqa in schools even though there was no reported incident of it . playing with fire while koch 's comments have sparked an outcry among left-wing politicians and immigrant groups and fuelled a heated debate on juvenile crime , political observers point out that it 's not the first time the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- has used anti-immigrant rhetoric to gain political mileage . " the cdu is a highly pragmatic party that does n't shy away from using the anti-foreigner card to reinforce prejudices and appeal to right-wing elements in the population , " said peter lösche , a retired professor of political science at the university of göttingen .
" it 's done it before and had success with it . " in 1999 , koch used criticism of immigration to oust a center-left administration and win the hesse state election .
he launched a successful signature campaign in which his party hit out against federal government plans to introduce dual citizenship for foreign citizens living in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu ran a notorious campaign against skilled indian software specialists in 2000 , another cdu politician , jürgen rüttgers , of north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state , unleashed a campaign against proposed " green cards " for indian software engineers .
his slogan , " kinder statt inder " or " children instead of indians " referred to a preference for home-grown it talent over skilled foreign workers .
while he failed to win that election , he did become the state 's premier in 2005 . members of the cdu 's sister bavarian party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , have often used anti-immigrant rhetoric in their speeches , most notably former bavarian premier edmund stoiber . germany is home to 15 million people of immigrant background , making up about 18 percent of the population .
most of them came as foreign " guest workers " from turkey and italy to help rebuild the country after the war and stayed on . many takers for anti-immigrant rhetoric ? some point out that koch 's populism and anti-immigrant campaigning is not out of place in hesse , home to around 6.1 million people and the city of frankfurt , one of europe 's major financial markets . " the cdu in hesse has always been a law and order party and is known for its ultra-conservative wing , " said gero neugebauer , a political scientist at berlin 's free university .
" koch 's current campaign is an obvious attempt to mobilize this hard core of its supporters who the cdu fears it might lose to far-right parties . " while far-right parties are largely successful in former communist eastern germany - the anti-immigrant npd is represented in two of five state assemblies - experts underline that xenophobic tendencies also exist among voters of mainstream political parties in the western part of the country . " hostility against foreigners and immigrants is equally widespread in western germany , too , " said elmar brähler from the university of leipzig , who carried out a study in 2006 for the friedrich ebert foundation on right-wing extremism in germany .
" the phenomenon is worst among those over the age of 60 . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 68 percent of the cdu 's members are older than 50 analysts say it 's no coincidence koch is appealing to an older generation of conservative voters who are increasingly important to his re-election bid and those of conservative premiers in other states . according to the party 's latest statistics , cdu membership has fallen from 638,000 in 1999 to 541,289 at the end of sept 2007 .
around 68 percent of the members are older than 50 , compared with 14 percent in the age group 16 to 39 . " whipping up fears about security after a brutal attack on the munich subway is a sure tactic of getting the attention of these older voters , " neugebauer said . minimum wage may be a vote-getter this time while koch 's anti-foreigner rhetoric has put further strain on his party 's uneasy grand coalition with the social democrats at the federal level , experts say chancellor angela merkel is unlikely to publicly rein in koch for fear of losing an economically and politically important state that the cdu has ruled for almost a decade . polls indicate that the spd has made huge gains in hesse and that koch is struggling to keep his absolute majority . merkel herself has talked often about the need to integrate the country 's 2.3 million muslims , most of who are of turkish origin , but says immigrants must accept german culture .
an opponent of turkey 's eu membership , merkel won thunderous applause at a recent party conference for saying mosques should not dwarf churches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say voters are more interested in getting decent wages while the outcome of the election in hesse is still open , some believe that the cdu 's tactic of using stirring fears of immigration as a vote-getter may no longer work this time . the spd 's push for a national minimum wage in an effort to dethrone koch - it 's opposed by merkel 's cdu - has wide public support and comes at a time when fears about economic uncertainty are growing , said richard stöss , a politics professor at berlin 's free university .

it 's not the first time the party has used such tactics . seeking a third consecutive term as leader of the prosperous western german state of hesse , roland koch has made immigration the centerpiece of his campaign , stirring memories of a similar election bid almost a decade ago . facing a strong challenge from his social democratic challenger who is focusing on demands for a national minimum wage , koch has seized on a recent violent attack on a german pensioner by two young immigrants on a munich subway train to call for the deportation of " criminal foreigners " and urge an end to " multicultural " coddling of immigrants . the attack , which left the 76-year-old victim with a fractured skull , was captured on close circuit cameras and aired for days on german television . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch is no stranger to controversy " how much are we prepared to take from a small proportion of violent youths , who frequently have a foreign background ? "
koch , once a rising star but now struggling , told mass circulation tabloid bild .
" we have spent too long showing a strange sociological understanding for groups that consciously commit violence as ethnic minorities . " koch 's comments on young immigrant criminals follow a proposal last month for a ban on students wearing the all-encompassing burqa in schools even though there was no reported incident of it . playing with fire while koch 's comments have sparked an outcry among left-wing politicians and immigrant groups and fuelled a heated debate on juvenile crime , political observers point out that it 's not the first time the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- has used anti-immigrant rhetoric to gain political mileage . " the cdu is a highly pragmatic party that does n't shy away from using the anti-foreigner card to reinforce prejudices and appeal to right-wing elements in the population , " said peter lösche , a retired professor of political science at the university of göttingen .
" it 's done it before and had success with it . " in 1999 , koch used criticism of immigration to oust a center-left administration and win the hesse state election .
he launched a successful signature campaign in which his party hit out against federal government plans to introduce dual citizenship for foreign citizens living in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu ran a notorious campaign against skilled indian software specialists in 2000 , another cdu politician , jürgen rüttgers , of north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state , unleashed a campaign against proposed " green cards " for indian software engineers .
his slogan , " kinder statt inder " or " children instead of indians " referred to a preference for home-grown it talent over skilled foreign workers .
while he failed to win that election , he did become the state 's premier in 2005 . members of the cdu 's sister bavarian party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , have often used anti-immigrant rhetoric in their speeches , most notably former bavarian premier edmund stoiber . germany is home to 15 million people of immigrant background , making up about 18 percent of the population .
most of them came as foreign " guest workers " from turkey and italy to help rebuild the country after the war and stayed on . many takers for anti-immigrant rhetoric ? some point out that koch 's populism and anti-immigrant campaigning is not out of place in hesse , home to around 6.1 million people and the city of frankfurt , one of europe 's major financial markets . " the cdu in hesse has always been a law and order party and is known for its ultra-conservative wing , " said gero neugebauer , a political scientist at berlin 's free university .
" koch 's current campaign is an obvious attempt to mobilize this hard core of its supporters who the cdu fears it might lose to far-right parties . " while far-right parties are largely successful in former communist eastern germany - the anti-immigrant npd is represented in two of five state assemblies - experts underline that xenophobic tendencies also exist among voters of mainstream political parties in the western part of the country . " hostility against foreigners and immigrants is equally widespread in western germany , too , " said elmar brähler from the university of leipzig , who carried out a study in 2006 for the friedrich ebert foundation on right-wing extremism in germany .
" the phenomenon is worst among those over the age of 60 . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 68 percent of the cdu 's members are older than 50 analysts say it 's no coincidence koch is appealing to an older generation of conservative voters who are increasingly important to his re-election bid and those of conservative premiers in other states . according to the party 's latest statistics , cdu membership has fallen from 638,000 in 1999 to 541,289 at the end of sept 2007 .
around 68 percent of the members are older than 50 , compared with 14 percent in the age group 16 to 39 . " whipping up fears about security after a brutal attack on the munich subway is a sure tactic of getting the attention of these older voters , " neugebauer said . minimum wage may be a vote-getter this time while koch 's anti-foreigner rhetoric has put further strain on his party 's uneasy grand coalition with the social democrats at the federal level , experts say chancellor angela merkel is unlikely to publicly rein in koch for fear of losing an economically and politically important state that the cdu has ruled for almost a decade . polls indicate that the spd has made huge gains in hesse and that koch is struggling to keep his absolute majority . merkel herself has talked often about the need to integrate the country 's 2.3 million muslims , most of who are of turkish origin , but says immigrants must accept german culture .
an opponent of turkey 's eu membership , merkel won thunderous applause at a recent party conference for saying mosques should not dwarf churches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say voters are more interested in getting decent wages while the outcome of the election in hesse is still open , some believe that the cdu 's tactic of using stirring fears of immigration as a vote-getter may no longer work this time . the spd 's push for a national minimum wage in an effort to dethrone koch - it 's opposed by merkel 's cdu - has wide public support and comes at a time when fears about economic uncertainty are growing , said richard stöss , a politics professor at berlin 's free university . " hesse is home to lots of industry and factories and an issue like a national minimum wage is likely to resonate far better with voters than fears of immigration , " he said . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is to reach the auschwitz death camp in poland on may 8 . but the group claims it has fought resistance from federally owned german railway concern deutsche bahn every step of the way .
representatives are particularly angry that they have to pay the same fees as any other private train operator to use the german railway tracks , despite the company 's historic involvement in the transports . deutsche bahn acknowledged on friday , jan .
4 , that it was charging the group the same toll for track use as other private train operators .
a bahn spokesman said the company had to treat all customers equally . bahn 's historic responsibility the train of commemoration group argues that the bahn must face up to its historic responsibility as the transport provider to the nazis .
it said the tens of thousands of euros of tolls charged to the rolling exhibit were " in effect a boycott of this public commemoration . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibit is based on a similar one by nazi hunter beate klarsfeld the exhibition uses letters and biographies to show how jewish children were caught up in the nazi machinery of death and taken to the gas chambers in cattle wagons . the german citizens ' initiative behind the exhibit was formed by a group of journalists , artists , lawyers and academics , in the wake of a 2003 french exhibition organized by french nazi hunters and activists beate and serge klarsfeld .
the klarsfeld exhibit , which focused on the deportation of 11,000 jewish children via rail from france to nazi death camps , was shown in french train stations . deutsche bahn denied a request to display the french exhibit in german train stations . " that 's when we got the idea to do our own exhibit , " journalist hans-ruediger minow , spokesman for the train of commemoration project , told germany 's mitteldeutsche zeitung newspaper . no exceptions to the rule , bahn says the train of commemoration group came up with the notion of creating an exhibit that would symbolically travel through the country on the very railways that were used in the deportations .
but both deutsche bahn and the german transportation ministry , which issued the transport orders under the nazi regime , failed to show interest in the project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn is charging the project to use its rails susanne kill , corporate historian for deutsche bahn , told the mitteldeutsche zeitung that the company " is processing its nazi history in numerous projects of its own . "
she added that deutsche bahn would be bringing its own traveling exhibit to appropriate train stations . moreover , she said , " deutsche bahn ca n't allow free use of the rails in individual cases . " earnings could go to charity according to german law , anyone is allowed to use the railways and train stations - as long as they meet certain standards , and can pay the costs . minow is now trying to drum up support for his cause . " we expect protests in germany and internationally until deutsche bahn and the ministry of transport see reason , " he told the leftist newspaper neues deutschland on saturday . a transportation ministry spokesman told the dpa news agency that deutsche bahn was considering to donate the income from the train of commemoration in the form of a corporate charitable grant . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 07.01.2008 thalidomide victims demand more compensation , inquest großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : contergan victims are taking their case for more compensation to the federal government the german association of victims of thalidomide , a drug that caused them to be born with severe deformities , is launching a campaign to demand further compensation payments , and an inquest into how the tragedy unfolded . fifty years after one of the worst pharmaceutical scandals in history , germany 's thalidomide victims are demanding an inquest into events surrounding the production and marketing of contergan by the german drugs company grünenthal , based in aachen .
contergan , a sedative which contained the active ingredient thalidomide , was prescribed to pregnant women in the late 1950s , and caused their fetuses to be born with severely shortened limbs , or in some cases , no limbs at all .
around half of the 10,000 thalidomide victims worldwide were born in west germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas meyer the president of germany 's association of contergan victims , andreas meyer , says the tragedy has never been fully investigated , nor is he happy with what he says is grünenthal 's silence on the issue .
the company has never formally apologized , although in the past month , it has begun meeting with victims ' representatives seeking an improved health and financial situation for the some 2,700 thalidomide victims still living in germany .
" we want to know exactly what happened , " meyer said , adding that he was not prepared to accept an apology on its own without the appropriate compensation .
more financial aid needed , victims say thalidomide victims say a compensation fund set up in 1970 has been exhausted and that many now need extra help as arthritis and age bring pain after a lifetime of unnatural movement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's thalidomide babies were often raised and schooled apart from other children grünenthal had said that the 110 million deutsche marks -lrb- 56.3 million euros or $ 83 million at current rates -rrb- it paid into a trust in 1971 was a final settlement of all claims in germany .
the modest monthly stipends of 545 euros victims currently receive are entirely funded by the government .
among the victims ' demands is a six-fold increase in these monthly payments to an amount between 2,100 and 3,500 euros , as well as a one-time compensation payment of around 1 million euros per victim .
the victims ' representatives are planning a parliamentary campaign to make their case to both the federal government and grünenthal .
" an independent lifestyle is not possible with the current level of monthly payments , " said udo herterich of the regional thalidomide victims ' association in the state of north rhine-westphalia .
" we 're getting older , we 're suffering more from the consequences of our disabilities and we need more and more help . "
grünenthal ceo " very moved " the victims ' associations were hopeful that grünenthal would reassess its position following an initial meeting with employees last month .
grünenthal ceo sebastian wirtz described the meeting as " very moving , " and said that he and his family regretted very much the events of 50 years ago .
" even though i had n't been born at that point , as a family member of the third generation , i would like to try , together with those affected , to come to terms with the contergan tragedy , " wirtz said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from the tv drama " eine einzige tablette " -lrb- a single pill -rrb- on the weekend , various associations of german contergan victims joined forces with the international contergan alliance , made up of the national associations of great britain , spain , sweden and canada .
the british alliance has already attained monthly payments of between 2,100 and 3,500 euros for its members .
the thalidomide dispute again made headlines in germany following a two-part television drama that aired in november about parents who struggle for justice after their daughter is born with only one leg and shortened arms . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

both meinhof 's ex-husband kalus-heinz röhl and her daughter bettina röhl have written about meinhof and the process of disintegration of german society beginning in the spring of 1968 that led to the formation of the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- . unravelling myths bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf has been the subject of numerous books but jutta ditfurth 's biography on meinhof , released in november , disputes many of the myths that surround meinhof 's transformation from journalist to raf terrorist . in her six years researching the biography , ditfurth , a founder of the german greens party , who has since left the stage of national politics , uncovered previously unpublished material , including documents kept in archives outside of germany . " ulrike meinhof was a much more interesting , much more multi-faceted person than i used to think , " ditfurth told dw-radio .
" she was a woman who would have had a huge amount of opportunities and prospects - if only she 'd had the good fortune to have grown up somewhere other than germany . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meinhof after her arrest in june 1972 the biography also encompasses the post-war history of west germany and the politically charged climate of the 1960s and 1970s . ditfurth examines the often forgotten social conditions , such as state violence , the biased nature of german courts , the rigidity of law-making , and the terrible conditions for political prisoners that drove the raf movement , also known as the baader-meinhof gang , in what was then a flourishing west german democracy . contaminated by terrorism ? the biography is written entirely chronological and largely devoid of commentary , but critics have said that while the information used might be factual it only tells half of the story .
even meinhof 's daughter , bettina röhl , labelled the latest biography about her mother " poisonous rubbish contaminated by terrorism . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bettina röhl has written a book about her mother while ditfurth admits the book is politically biased , she said there is a big difference between writing from a left wing point of view and endorsing anarchic terrorism . " i am a leftie from a different generation and the raf was really never my cup of tea , " she said .
" i always drew a distinct line and sharply criticised their terrorist acts . " far from helping her , ditfurth said her political credentials as former leader of the german green 's left wing and her well documented opposition to the red army faction actually made researching the biography more difficult . " i was considered an outsider and was dealt with by people in certain raf circles with a lot of scepticism , " she said .
" but still i did my best to find out all the things that i had ever wanted to know . " while ditfurth is no apologist and she suggested that meinhof 's path was wrong , she also said it was wholly understandable . ditfurth is not the first to be accused of crossing the line between writing about the raf and supporting the raf – in 2002 critics said a film about raf co-founder andreas baader " glamorized the leader .

in karlsruhe on thursday , a baby girl was found dead in a similar baby hatch ; officials say she had likely died before being left there .
in both cases , there are no clues as to the identity of the parents .
baby hatches have existed in germany since the 19th century in the hope of preventing infanticide by giving desperate mothers a safe place to leave their unwanted babies .
but they have always been controversial , mainly because it is illegal to give birth anonymously in germany .
critics of the hatches say they help women circumvent the law .
but voices on the other side of the debate say that anonymous births will take place no matter what the law says , and that it is better to provide mothers who feel compelled to give birth in secret an anonymous drop-off point for their babies .
calls to legalize anonymous births now , the two incidents in hanover and karlsruhe are rekindling the anonymous birth debate .
both government and protestant church officials in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg have renewed calls for legalizing anonymous births , which would give pregnant women the option of delivering in a hospital without stating their name .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : legalizing anonymous birth could save the lives of as many as 50 babies a year , experts say the state of baden-württemberg has long been a proponent of legal anonymous births in germany and , together with the state of bavaria , has drawn up draft legislation .
but while the draft has frequently been up for discussion , it has never received the necessary majority from all the committees involved , according to a spokesperson from the state justice ministry .
according to statistics from the regional government in stuttgart , 40 to 50 babies are born in secret without medical assistance each year nationwide , and less than half survive .
having the option of giving birth anonymously in a hospital would reduce the risks for both mother and child , proponents argue .
officials discuss how to help desperate moms in the eastern german state of lower saxony , social minister mechthild ross-luttmann said she intends to talk with those organizations that sponsor baby hatches about ways to improve the service .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could hatches be part of a support concept for pregnant women in need ?
" perhaps there 's a need for improvement at some of the hatches , " she told german news agency dpa , adding that signs with instructions in several languages would be a sensible addition .
a spokeswoman from the free-market liberal free democratic party 's parliamentary group said that the cases in hanover and karlsruhe should not result in criticism of baby hatches .
instead , they should inspire more discussion of how to give such services a legal framework , and how best to help desperate mothers-to-be .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : tackling youth crime squeezed in state poll , german politician pulls out old tricks conservative cdu turns youth crime debate into election issue german conservatives want crackdown on youth crime politicians call for tougher laws against young offenders opinion -pipe- 07.01.2008 opinion : populist electioneering damaging german crime debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's volker wagener believes hessen premier roland koch 's demand for radical changes in juvenile criminal law is nothing more than a populist attempt to win favor as he faces a tough re-election campaign . roland koch knows how elections are won .
the hessen premier wants to defend his seat this month and so he drops his standards .
the conservative politician has chosen to follow the route of populism and has found a subject that is being widely debated at dinner tables all across the country : juvenile delinquency among foreigners in germany . the subject is not only old and is just a minor part of a larger problem : the brutalization of society .
ignoring the larger picture , koch has demanded that violent foreign youngsters be punished harder and thrown out of the country faster . he has chosen his moment well .
the festive season over christmas and the new year is traditionally slow for news .
as a result , koch has been in the headlines for days .
everyone has heard roland koch 's opinion .
his timing is perfidious . this has not been advantageous for either the debate or any possible solution to the problem . politicians on the right and the left are pulled apart in anger over which direction to take .
koch 's loud exhortations from the middle-class conservative corner have been derided by the left-wing liberals who see a darker agenda at work : hostility to foreigners . not only a foreign problem the truth is that there is evidence that foreign youngsters and those with a migration background regularly feature in violent crime statistics .
but this is not the whole story .
the problem does not come from them being foreign .
investigations show that the lives of violent german youngsters share remarkable similarities with those of culprits with migrant backgrounds . both sets of perpetrators come from disadvantaged social groups and areas .
their stories read the same : broken homes , borderline poverty , unfinished school careers , unemployment . these are the childhood and youth experiences of young delinquents , whether they are named ali , sergei or jürgen .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : tackling youth crime squeezed in state poll , german politician pulls out old tricks conservative cdu turns youth crime debate into election issue german conservatives want crackdown on youth crime politicians call for tougher laws against young offenders opinion -pipe- 07.01.2008 opinion : populist electioneering damaging german crime debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's volker wagener believes hessen premier roland koch 's demand for radical changes in juvenile criminal law is nothing more than a populist attempt to win favor as he faces a tough re-election campaign . roland koch knows how elections are won .
the hessen premier wants to defend his seat this month and so he drops his standards .
the conservative politician has chosen to follow the route of populism and has found a subject that is being widely debated at dinner tables all across the country : juvenile delinquency among foreigners in germany . the subject is not only old and is just a minor part of a larger problem : the brutalization of society .
ignoring the larger picture , koch has demanded that violent foreign youngsters be punished harder and thrown out of the country faster . he has chosen his moment well .
the festive season over christmas and the new year is traditionally slow for news .
as a result , koch has been in the headlines for days .
everyone has heard roland koch 's opinion .
his timing is perfidious . this has not been advantageous for either the debate or any possible solution to the problem . politicians on the right and the left are pulled apart in anger over which direction to take .
koch 's loud exhortations from the middle-class conservative corner have been derided by the left-wing liberals who see a darker agenda at work : hostility to foreigners . not only a foreign problem the truth is that there is evidence that foreign youngsters and those with a migration background regularly feature in violent crime statistics .
but this is not the whole story .
the problem does not come from them being foreign .
investigations show that the lives of violent german youngsters share remarkable similarities with those of culprits with migrant backgrounds . both sets of perpetrators come from disadvantaged social groups and areas .
their stories read the same : broken homes , borderline poverty , unfinished school careers , unemployment . these are the childhood and youth experiences of young delinquents , whether they are named ali , sergei or jürgen .
the main problem in juvenile delinquency in germany is a structural one , and only secondly - or thirdly - can it be regarded as a problem among foreigners or migrants . germany 's social failings must be addressed these failed lives and the inadequacies of social structure should not be used to excuse individuals of responsibility , but it must be accepted that german integration policy has failed at its most basic levels , and that education has failed in the early stage of kindergarten . these weaknesses will not be repaired by harder punishments and deportations .
the united states of america is an example of that .
the congested prisons and draconian punishments such as the death penalty in the us have not made its towns safer . one more thing points to a dishonest and opportunist attempt by roland koch to win votes through this tactical and manipulated debate : if koch and his supporters really want to push through harder and more effective punishments for the likes of " violent ali " and " thieving sergei , " then why has the hesse premier cut 700 permanent police jobs and 80 permanent justice positions during his time in office ? this dangerous game will have a familiar and sad outcome .

instead , it fermented inside the hungry hound 's stomach until - bingo ! - the dog was stinking drunk .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . i agree that the us system of electing a president may not be perfect and can put too much emphasis how a person conducts himself / herself rather than an ability to run a country , but i still prefer it over the german system -lrb- i was born and raised in germany -rrb- .
i assume mr. unger knows that the us is a republic and not a democracy , much less a parliamentary democracy - and thanks for that .
he really thinks a party is better at selecting leaders than the people ?
all of my german friends are disillusioned with the party system because they feel they are not in the loop and have no input at all .

it will come - the war in iraq is unsustainable , breaking the country 's back , the dollar is diving and we are violating our principles of democracy .
people are thinking for the first time that the next generation will have it worse and what is the use ?
the most important thing for us is to change from the path of tyranny , ruinous war and torture - and the change will come .
we will take our country back .
we have had good luck in the past and we could use european help .
next time germany has a problem , let us rub something in your eye to make you feel worse instead of giving you hope ! - robert friedman , us many americans think we should make changes to our elections , especially in how they are financed .

one thing not mentioned in this article is that in the iowa caucuses the republican winner was one of the least funded candidates thus far , as was the second place democratic candidate .
indeed , the democratic winner brought record numbers of young people -lrb- under age 25 -rrb- into the political process for the first time .

in karlsruhe on thursday , a baby girl was found dead in a similar baby hatch ; officials say she had likely died before being left there .
in both cases , there are no clues as to the identity of the parents .
baby hatches have existed in germany since the 19th century in the hope of preventing infanticide by giving desperate mothers a safe place to leave their unwanted babies .
but they have always been controversial , mainly because it is illegal to give birth anonymously in germany .
critics of the hatches say they help women circumvent the law .
but voices on the other side of the debate say that anonymous births will take place no matter what the law says , and that it is better to provide mothers who feel compelled to give birth in secret an anonymous drop-off point for their babies .
calls to legalize anonymous births now , the two incidents in hanover and karlsruhe are rekindling the anonymous birth debate .
both government and protestant church officials in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg have renewed calls for legalizing anonymous births , which would give pregnant women the option of delivering in a hospital without stating their name .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : legalizing anonymous birth could save the lives of as many as 50 babies a year , experts say the state of baden-württemberg has long been a proponent of legal anonymous births in germany and , together with the state of bavaria , has drawn up draft legislation .
but while the draft has frequently been up for discussion , it has never received the necessary majority from all the committees involved , according to a spokesperson from the state justice ministry .
according to statistics from the regional government in stuttgart , 40 to 50 babies are born in secret without medical assistance each year nationwide , and less than half survive .
having the option of giving birth anonymously in a hospital would reduce the risks for both mother and child , proponents argue .
officials discuss how to help desperate moms in the eastern german state of lower saxony , social minister mechthild ross-luttmann said she intends to talk with those organizations that sponsor baby hatches about ways to improve the service .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could hatches be part of a support concept for pregnant women in need ?
" perhaps there 's a need for improvement at some of the hatches , " she told german news agency dpa , adding that signs with instructions in several languages would be a sensible addition .
a spokeswoman from the free-market liberal free democratic party 's parliamentary group said that the cases in hanover and karlsruhe should not result in criticism of baby hatches .
instead , they should inspire more discussion of how to give such services a legal framework , and how best to help desperate mothers-to-be .
hanover 's regional bishop , margot kässmann , an outspoken proponent of baby hatches , also rejected criticism of the service .
baby hatches could be " part of a broader concept to help pregnant women in need . " dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the hessen premier wants to defend his seat this month and so he drops his standards .
the conservative politician has chosen to follow the route of populism and has found a subject that is being widely debated at dinner tables all across the country : juvenile delinquency among foreigners in germany . the subject is not only old and is just a minor part of a larger problem : the brutalization of society .
ignoring the larger picture , koch has demanded that violent foreign youngsters be punished harder and thrown out of the country faster . he has chosen his moment well .
the festive season over christmas and the new year is traditionally slow for news .
as a result , koch has been in the headlines for days .
everyone has heard roland koch 's opinion .
his timing is perfidious . this has not been advantageous for either the debate or any possible solution to the problem . politicians on the right and the left are pulled apart in anger over which direction to take .
koch 's loud exhortations from the middle-class conservative corner have been derided by the left-wing liberals who see a darker agenda at work : hostility to foreigners . not only a foreign problem the truth is that there is evidence that foreign youngsters and those with a migration background regularly feature in violent crime statistics .
but this is not the whole story .
the problem does not come from them being foreign .
investigations show that the lives of violent german youngsters share remarkable similarities with those of culprits with migrant backgrounds . both sets of perpetrators come from disadvantaged social groups and areas .
their stories read the same : broken homes , borderline poverty , unfinished school careers , unemployment . these are the childhood and youth experiences of young delinquents , whether they are named ali , sergei or jürgen .
the main problem in juvenile delinquency in germany is a structural one , and only secondly - or thirdly - can it be regarded as a problem among foreigners or migrants . germany 's social failings must be addressed these failed lives and the inadequacies of social structure should not be used to excuse individuals of responsibility , but it must be accepted that german integration policy has failed at its most basic levels , and that education has failed in the early stage of kindergarten . these weaknesses will not be repaired by harder punishments and deportations .
the united states of america is an example of that .
the congested prisons and draconian punishments such as the death penalty in the us have not made its towns safer . one more thing points to a dishonest and opportunist attempt by roland koch to win votes through this tactical and manipulated debate : if koch and his supporters really want to push through harder and more effective punishments for the likes of " violent ali " and " thieving sergei , " then why has the hesse premier cut 700 permanent police jobs and 80 permanent justice positions during his time in office ? this dangerous game will have a familiar and sad outcome .
come the day after the hessen election on january 27 , the problem will disappear from public debate - unsolved . volker wagener works at deutsche welle 's central news desk -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

both meinhof 's ex-husband kalus-heinz röhl and her daughter bettina röhl have written about meinhof and the process of disintegration of german society beginning in the spring of 1968 that led to the formation of the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- . unravelling myths bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf has been the subject of numerous books but jutta ditfurth 's biography on meinhof , released in november , disputes many of the myths that surround meinhof 's transformation from journalist to raf terrorist . in her six years researching the biography , ditfurth , a founder of the german greens party , who has since left the stage of national politics , uncovered previously unpublished material , including documents kept in archives outside of germany . " ulrike meinhof was a much more interesting , much more multi-faceted person than i used to think , " ditfurth told dw-radio .
" she was a woman who would have had a huge amount of opportunities and prospects - if only she 'd had the good fortune to have grown up somewhere other than germany . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meinhof after her arrest in june 1972 the biography also encompasses the post-war history of west germany and the politically charged climate of the 1960s and 1970s . ditfurth examines the often forgotten social conditions , such as state violence , the biased nature of german courts , the rigidity of law-making , and the terrible conditions for political prisoners that drove the raf movement , also known as the baader-meinhof gang , in what was then a flourishing west german democracy . contaminated by terrorism ? the biography is written entirely chronological and largely devoid of commentary , but critics have said that while the information used might be factual it only tells half of the story .
even meinhof 's daughter , bettina röhl , labelled the latest biography about her mother " poisonous rubbish contaminated by terrorism . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bettina röhl has written a book about her mother while ditfurth admits the book is politically biased , she said there is a big difference between writing from a left wing point of view and endorsing anarchic terrorism . " i am a leftie from a different generation and the raf was really never my cup of tea , " she said .
" i always drew a distinct line and sharply criticised their terrorist acts . " far from helping her , ditfurth said her political credentials as former leader of the german green 's left wing and her well documented opposition to the red army faction actually made researching the biography more difficult . " i was considered an outsider and was dealt with by people in certain raf circles with a lot of scepticism , " she said .
" but still i did my best to find out all the things that i had ever wanted to know . " while ditfurth is no apologist and she suggested that meinhof 's path was wrong , she also said it was wholly understandable . ditfurth is not the first to be accused of crossing the line between writing about the raf and supporting the raf – in 2002 critics said a film about raf co-founder andreas baader " glamorized the leader .

contergan , a sedative which contained the active ingredient thalidomide , was prescribed to pregnant women in the late 1950s , and caused their fetuses to be born with severely shortened limbs , or in some cases , no limbs at all .
around half of the 10,000 thalidomide victims worldwide were born in west germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas meyer the president of germany 's association of contergan victims , andreas meyer , says the tragedy has never been fully investigated , nor is he happy with what he says is grünenthal 's silence on the issue .
the company has never formally apologized , although in the past month , it has begun meeting with victims ' representatives seeking an improved health and financial situation for the some 2,700 thalidomide victims still living in germany .
" we want to know exactly what happened , " meyer said , adding that he was not prepared to accept an apology on its own without the appropriate compensation .
more financial aid needed , victims say thalidomide victims say a compensation fund set up in 1970 has been exhausted and that many now need extra help as arthritis and age bring pain after a lifetime of unnatural movement .

the modest monthly stipends of 545 euros victims currently receive are entirely funded by the government .
among the victims ' demands is a six-fold increase in these monthly payments to an amount between 2,100 and 3,500 euros , as well as a one-time compensation payment of around 1 million euros per victim .
the victims ' representatives are planning a parliamentary campaign to make their case to both the federal government and grünenthal .
" an independent lifestyle is not possible with the current level of monthly payments , " said udo herterich of the regional thalidomide victims ' association in the state of north rhine-westphalia .
" we 're getting older , we 're suffering more from the consequences of our disabilities and we need more and more help . "
grünenthal ceo " very moved " the victims ' associations were hopeful that grünenthal would reassess its position following an initial meeting with employees last month .
grünenthal ceo sebastian wirtz described the meeting as " very moving , " and said that he and his family regretted very much the events of 50 years ago .
" even though i had n't been born at that point , as a family member of the third generation , i would like to try , together with those affected , to come to terms with the contergan tragedy , " wirtz said .

the hessen premier wants to defend his seat this month and so he drops his standards .
the conservative politician has chosen to follow the route of populism and has found a subject that is being widely debated at dinner tables all across the country : juvenile delinquency among foreigners in germany . the subject is not only old and is just a minor part of a larger problem : the brutalization of society .
ignoring the larger picture , koch has demanded that violent foreign youngsters be punished harder and thrown out of the country faster . he has chosen his moment well .
the festive season over christmas and the new year is traditionally slow for news .
as a result , koch has been in the headlines for days .
everyone has heard roland koch 's opinion .
his timing is perfidious . this has not been advantageous for either the debate or any possible solution to the problem . politicians on the right and the left are pulled apart in anger over which direction to take .
koch 's loud exhortations from the middle-class conservative corner have been derided by the left-wing liberals who see a darker agenda at work : hostility to foreigners . not only a foreign problem the truth is that there is evidence that foreign youngsters and those with a migration background regularly feature in violent crime statistics .
but this is not the whole story .
the problem does not come from them being foreign .
investigations show that the lives of violent german youngsters share remarkable similarities with those of culprits with migrant backgrounds . both sets of perpetrators come from disadvantaged social groups and areas .
their stories read the same : broken homes , borderline poverty , unfinished school careers , unemployment . these are the childhood and youth experiences of young delinquents , whether they are named ali , sergei or jürgen .
the main problem in juvenile delinquency in germany is a structural one , and only secondly - or thirdly - can it be regarded as a problem among foreigners or migrants . germany 's social failings must be addressed these failed lives and the inadequacies of social structure should not be used to excuse individuals of responsibility , but it must be accepted that german integration policy has failed at its most basic levels , and that education has failed in the early stage of kindergarten . these weaknesses will not be repaired by harder punishments and deportations .
the united states of america is an example of that .
the congested prisons and draconian punishments such as the death penalty in the us have not made its towns safer . one more thing points to a dishonest and opportunist attempt by roland koch to win votes through this tactical and manipulated debate : if koch and his supporters really want to push through harder and more effective punishments for the likes of " violent ali " and " thieving sergei , " then why has the hesse premier cut 700 permanent police jobs and 80 permanent justice positions during his time in office ? this dangerous game will have a familiar and sad outcome .

their stories read the same : broken homes , borderline poverty , unfinished school careers , unemployment . these are the childhood and youth experiences of young delinquents , whether they are named ali , sergei or jürgen .
the main problem in juvenile delinquency in germany is a structural one , and only secondly - or thirdly - can it be regarded as a problem among foreigners or migrants . germany 's social failings must be addressed these failed lives and the inadequacies of social structure should not be used to excuse individuals of responsibility , but it must be accepted that german integration policy has failed at its most basic levels , and that education has failed in the early stage of kindergarten . these weaknesses will not be repaired by harder punishments and deportations .
the united states of america is an example of that .
the congested prisons and draconian punishments such as the death penalty in the us have not made its towns safer . one more thing points to a dishonest and opportunist attempt by roland koch to win votes through this tactical and manipulated debate : if koch and his supporters really want to push through harder and more effective punishments for the likes of " violent ali " and " thieving sergei , " then why has the hesse premier cut 700 permanent police jobs and 80 permanent justice positions during his time in office ? this dangerous game will have a familiar and sad outcome .

once the voters go to the polls in state elections this year , divisions over two key policy issues could see the brittle façade finally shatter . the wrangling over a proposed national minimum wage , championed by the spd , and a conservative-led plan to crackdown on juvenile crime are the issues likely to dominate the first elections , taking place in hessen and lower saxony in late january and in hamburg in february .

the results of the state elections could indicate how the general election in 2009 could play out . the way each party makes its arguments and the results of the polls in relation to the issues may drive the current wedge between the coalition partners deeper , effectively splitting the government .

contergan , a sedative which contained the active ingredient thalidomide , was prescribed to pregnant women in the late 1950s , and caused their fetuses to be born with severely shortened limbs , or in some cases , no limbs at all .
around half of the 10,000 thalidomide victims worldwide were born in west germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas meyer the president of germany 's association of contergan victims , andreas meyer , says the tragedy has never been fully investigated , nor is he happy with what he says is grünenthal 's silence on the issue .
the company has never formally apologized , although in the past month , it has begun meeting with victims ' representatives seeking an improved health and financial situation for the some 2,700 thalidomide victims still living in germany .
" we want to know exactly what happened , " meyer said , adding that he was not prepared to accept an apology on its own without the appropriate compensation .
more financial aid needed , victims say thalidomide victims say a compensation fund set up in 1970 has been exhausted and that many now need extra help as arthritis and age bring pain after a lifetime of unnatural movement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's thalidomide babies were often raised and schooled apart from other children grünenthal had said that the 110 million deutsche marks -lrb- 56.3 million euros or $ 83 million at current rates -rrb- it paid into a trust in 1971 was a final settlement of all claims in germany .
the modest monthly stipends of 545 euros victims currently receive are entirely funded by the government .
among the victims ' demands is a six-fold increase in these monthly payments to an amount between 2,100 and 3,500 euros , as well as a one-time compensation payment of around 1 million euros per victim .
the victims ' representatives are planning a parliamentary campaign to make their case to both the federal government and grünenthal .
" an independent lifestyle is not possible with the current level of monthly payments , " said udo herterich of the regional thalidomide victims ' association in the state of north rhine-westphalia .
" we 're getting older , we 're suffering more from the consequences of our disabilities and we need more and more help . "
grünenthal ceo " very moved " the victims ' associations were hopeful that grünenthal would reassess its position following an initial meeting with employees last month .
grünenthal ceo sebastian wirtz described the meeting as " very moving , " and said that he and his family regretted very much the events of 50 years ago .
" even though i had n't been born at that point , as a family member of the third generation , i would like to try , together with those affected , to come to terms with the contergan tragedy , " wirtz said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from the tv drama " eine einzige tablette " -lrb- a single pill -rrb- on the weekend , various associations of german contergan victims joined forces with the international contergan alliance , made up of the national associations of great britain , spain , sweden and canada .
the british alliance has already attained monthly payments of between 2,100 and 3,500 euros for its members .

the results of the state elections could indicate how the general election in 2009 could play out . the way each party makes its arguments and the results of the polls in relation to the issues may drive the current wedge between the coalition partners deeper , effectively splitting the government .
the spd have set the call for a national minimum wage at the heart of their campaign in the key state polls , much to the chagrin of the cdu . minimum wage central to spd campaign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the campaign for no wage under 7.50 euros is popular among labor unionists at the launch of the campaign , peter struck , the head of the spd 's parliamentary group , announced that the social democrats intended to harness the strong public backing for a minimum hourly wage of 7.50 euros -lrb- $ 10.77 -rrb- in the three regional races . " we will start petition drives during the state elections , " struck said in december .
" then the voters will have their say .
we will make the state elections and the general election in 2009 into a referendum on the minimum wage . " the social democrats , who have been trailing the conservatives in the polls by around 10 points for several months , argue that europe 's biggest economy must ensure that wages are high enough to keep workers above the poverty level .
germany is one of the few countries in the eu without a national minimum wage , though it does have a series of industry-specific wage agreements . many leading conservative members , the chancellor included , have reacted angrily to the spd 's stance , saying that an across-the-board minimum wage would be a job killer , driving companies to eastern europe and asia where pay is lower . merkel favors industry control on wages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor has led the opposition to the proposal at the launch of the cdu election program on saturday , the party ruled out a debate on the minimum wage , defiantly putting itself in opposition to the spd 's central election theme . merkel has said that the national minimum wage is " not the right answer " and has reiterated her support for the traditional practice of leaving unions and employers to negotiate wage levels in each industry . meanwhile , the conservatives seem intent on fighting the state elections on a law and order ticket , riling the spd in the process . the cdu leadership has called for stiffer penalties for juveniles convicted of violent crimes , proposing an increase in the maximum sentence for young people convicted of serious offences from 10 to 15 years . the party has also called for a " warning shot " period of detention for those given probation for violent crimes and the introduction of boot camps where young offenders could be sent for re-education .
under the new cdu proposals , rules for deporting foreigners convicted of serious crimes would also be eased . conservatives react to upsurge in violent crime bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violent crime has been grabbing the headlines " i think ' warning-shot arrests ' -lsb- short periods in detention -rsb- and boot camps could indeed be a sensible supplement to current laws , " merkel said .
" it could turn young people around so they do not wind up in prison . " the proposals , in line with those put forward by roland koch , the under-pressure cdu premier of hesse , who is seeking a third term of office on jan .
27 , come after a spate of violent attacks across germany . " how much are we prepared to take from a small proportion of violent youths , who frequently have a foreign background , " koch said in an interview after the attack , which has been repeatedly broadcast on television . " something has to be done , " merkel added .
" there is no point in delaying matters .
it is unacceptable that many people do not dare ride the subway at night because they are afraid of violence ... we need the feeling of personal security again in germany . " -lrb- the social democrats -rrb- can not close their eyes to the fact that 43 percent of all violent crimes in germany are committed by people who are under the age of 21 and that among them , nearly half are foreign-born youth , " she said . cdu accused of targeting foreigners bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch -lrb- l . -rrb- and interior minister volker bouffier promote a " secure life " the social democrats have accused koch and the conservatives of fuelling anti-foreigner sentiment in order to gain re-election and said existing laws were sufficient to punish violent offenders . however , spd leader kurt beck conceded that steps need to be taken to combat the upsurge in youth crime as long they involved better application of current laws instead of introducing new legislation . " this is better than taking hasty action arising solely from motives related to elections , " beck told the news magazine der spiegel . it is unlikely that any further concessions will be made by either party as the coalition partners plot their own slow and potentially bitter courses towards the 2009 general election . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in karlsruhe on thursday , a baby girl was found dead in a similar baby hatch ; officials say she had likely died before being left there .
in both cases , there are no clues as to the identity of the parents .
baby hatches have existed in germany since the 19th century in the hope of preventing infanticide by giving desperate mothers a safe place to leave their unwanted babies .
but they have always been controversial , mainly because it is illegal to give birth anonymously in germany .
critics of the hatches say they help women circumvent the law .
but voices on the other side of the debate say that anonymous births will take place no matter what the law says , and that it is better to provide mothers who feel compelled to give birth in secret an anonymous drop-off point for their babies .
calls to legalize anonymous births now , the two incidents in hanover and karlsruhe are rekindling the anonymous birth debate .
both government and protestant church officials in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg have renewed calls for legalizing anonymous births , which would give pregnant women the option of delivering in a hospital without stating their name .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : legalizing anonymous birth could save the lives of as many as 50 babies a year , experts say the state of baden-württemberg has long been a proponent of legal anonymous births in germany and , together with the state of bavaria , has drawn up draft legislation .
but while the draft has frequently been up for discussion , it has never received the necessary majority from all the committees involved , according to a spokesperson from the state justice ministry .
according to statistics from the regional government in stuttgart , 40 to 50 babies are born in secret without medical assistance each year nationwide , and less than half survive .
having the option of giving birth anonymously in a hospital would reduce the risks for both mother and child , proponents argue .
officials discuss how to help desperate moms in the eastern german state of lower saxony , social minister mechthild ross-luttmann said she intends to talk with those organizations that sponsor baby hatches about ways to improve the service .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could hatches be part of a support concept for pregnant women in need ?
" perhaps there 's a need for improvement at some of the hatches , " she told german news agency dpa , adding that signs with instructions in several languages would be a sensible addition .
a spokeswoman from the free-market liberal free democratic party 's parliamentary group said that the cases in hanover and karlsruhe should not result in criticism of baby hatches .
instead , they should inspire more discussion of how to give such services a legal framework , and how best to help desperate mothers-to-be .
hanover 's regional bishop , margot kässmann , an outspoken proponent of baby hatches , also rejected criticism of the service .
baby hatches could be " part of a broader concept to help pregnant women in need . " dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in both cases , there are no clues as to the identity of the parents .
baby hatches have existed in germany since the 19th century in the hope of preventing infanticide by giving desperate mothers a safe place to leave their unwanted babies .
but they have always been controversial , mainly because it is illegal to give birth anonymously in germany .
critics of the hatches say they help women circumvent the law .
but voices on the other side of the debate say that anonymous births will take place no matter what the law says , and that it is better to provide mothers who feel compelled to give birth in secret an anonymous drop-off point for their babies .
calls to legalize anonymous births now , the two incidents in hanover and karlsruhe are rekindling the anonymous birth debate .
both government and protestant church officials in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg have renewed calls for legalizing anonymous births , which would give pregnant women the option of delivering in a hospital without stating their name .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : legalizing anonymous birth could save the lives of as many as 50 babies a year , experts say the state of baden-württemberg has long been a proponent of legal anonymous births in germany and , together with the state of bavaria , has drawn up draft legislation .
but while the draft has frequently been up for discussion , it has never received the necessary majority from all the committees involved , according to a spokesperson from the state justice ministry .
according to statistics from the regional government in stuttgart , 40 to 50 babies are born in secret without medical assistance each year nationwide , and less than half survive .
having the option of giving birth anonymously in a hospital would reduce the risks for both mother and child , proponents argue .
officials discuss how to help desperate moms in the eastern german state of lower saxony , social minister mechthild ross-luttmann said she intends to talk with those organizations that sponsor baby hatches about ways to improve the service .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could hatches be part of a support concept for pregnant women in need ?
" perhaps there 's a need for improvement at some of the hatches , " she told german news agency dpa , adding that signs with instructions in several languages would be a sensible addition .
a spokeswoman from the free-market liberal free democratic party 's parliamentary group said that the cases in hanover and karlsruhe should not result in criticism of baby hatches .
instead , they should inspire more discussion of how to give such services a legal framework , and how best to help desperate mothers-to-be .
hanover 's regional bishop , margot kässmann , an outspoken proponent of baby hatches , also rejected criticism of the service .
baby hatches could be " part of a broader concept to help pregnant women in need . " dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : tackling youth crime squeezed in state poll , german politician pulls out old tricks conservative cdu turns youth crime debate into election issue german conservatives want crackdown on youth crime politicians call for tougher laws against young offenders opinion -pipe- 07.01.2008 opinion : populist electioneering damaging german crime debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's volker wagener believes hessen premier roland koch 's demand for radical changes in juvenile criminal law is nothing more than a populist attempt to win favor as he faces a tough re-election campaign . roland koch knows how elections are won .
the hessen premier wants to defend his seat this month and so he drops his standards .
the conservative politician has chosen to follow the route of populism and has found a subject that is being widely debated at dinner tables all across the country : juvenile delinquency among foreigners in germany . the subject is not only old and is just a minor part of a larger problem : the brutalization of society .
ignoring the larger picture , koch has demanded that violent foreign youngsters be punished harder and thrown out of the country faster . he has chosen his moment well .
the festive season over christmas and the new year is traditionally slow for news .
as a result , koch has been in the headlines for days .
everyone has heard roland koch 's opinion .
his timing is perfidious . this has not been advantageous for either the debate or any possible solution to the problem . politicians on the right and the left are pulled apart in anger over which direction to take .
koch 's loud exhortations from the middle-class conservative corner have been derided by the left-wing liberals who see a darker agenda at work : hostility to foreigners . not only a foreign problem the truth is that there is evidence that foreign youngsters and those with a migration background regularly feature in violent crime statistics .
but this is not the whole story .
the problem does not come from them being foreign .
investigations show that the lives of violent german youngsters share remarkable similarities with those of culprits with migrant backgrounds . both sets of perpetrators come from disadvantaged social groups and areas .
their stories read the same : broken homes , borderline poverty , unfinished school careers , unemployment . these are the childhood and youth experiences of young delinquents , whether they are named ali , sergei or jürgen .
the main problem in juvenile delinquency in germany is a structural one , and only secondly - or thirdly - can it be regarded as a problem among foreigners or migrants . germany 's social failings must be addressed these failed lives and the inadequacies of social structure should not be used to excuse individuals of responsibility , but it must be accepted that german integration policy has failed at its most basic levels , and that education has failed in the early stage of kindergarten . these weaknesses will not be repaired by harder punishments and deportations .
the united states of america is an example of that .
the congested prisons and draconian punishments such as the death penalty in the us have not made its towns safer . one more thing points to a dishonest and opportunist attempt by roland koch to win votes through this tactical and manipulated debate : if koch and his supporters really want to push through harder and more effective punishments for the likes of " violent ali " and " thieving sergei , " then why has the hesse premier cut 700 permanent police jobs and 80 permanent justice positions during his time in office ? this dangerous game will have a familiar and sad outcome .
come the day after the hessen election on january 27 , the problem will disappear from public debate - unsolved . volker wagener works at deutsche welle 's central news desk -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's not the first time the party has used such tactics . seeking a third consecutive term as leader of the prosperous western german state of hesse , roland koch has made immigration the centerpiece of his campaign , stirring memories of a similar election bid almost a decade ago . facing a strong challenge from his social democratic challenger who is focusing on demands for a national minimum wage , koch has seized on a recent violent attack on a german pensioner by two young immigrants on a munich subway train to call for the deportation of " criminal foreigners " and urge an end to " multicultural " coddling of immigrants . the attack , which left the 76-year-old victim with a fractured skull , was captured on close circuit cameras and aired for days on german television . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch is no stranger to controversy " how much are we prepared to take from a small proportion of violent youths , who frequently have a foreign background ? "
koch , once a rising star but now struggling , told mass circulation tabloid bild .
" we have spent too long showing a strange sociological understanding for groups that consciously commit violence as ethnic minorities . " koch 's comments on young immigrant criminals follow a proposal last month for a ban on students wearing the all-encompassing burqa in schools even though there was no reported incident of it . playing with fire while koch 's comments have sparked an outcry among left-wing politicians and immigrant groups and fuelled a heated debate on juvenile crime , political observers point out that it 's not the first time the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- has used anti-immigrant rhetoric to gain political mileage . " the cdu is a highly pragmatic party that does n't shy away from using the anti-foreigner card to reinforce prejudices and appeal to right-wing elements in the population , " said peter lösche , a retired professor of political science at the university of göttingen .
" it 's done it before and had success with it . " in 1999 , koch used criticism of immigration to oust a center-left administration and win the hesse state election .
he launched a successful signature campaign in which his party hit out against federal government plans to introduce dual citizenship for foreign citizens living in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu ran a notorious campaign against skilled indian software specialists in 2000 , another cdu politician , jürgen rüttgers , of north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state , unleashed a campaign against proposed " green cards " for indian software engineers .
his slogan , " kinder statt inder " or " children instead of indians " referred to a preference for home-grown it talent over skilled foreign workers .
while he failed to win that election , he did become the state 's premier in 2005 . members of the cdu 's sister bavarian party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , have often used anti-immigrant rhetoric in their speeches , most notably former bavarian premier edmund stoiber . germany is home to 15 million people of immigrant background , making up about 18 percent of the population .
most of them came as foreign " guest workers " from turkey and italy to help rebuild the country after the war and stayed on . many takers for anti-immigrant rhetoric ? some point out that koch 's populism and anti-immigrant campaigning is not out of place in hesse , home to around 6.1 million people and the city of frankfurt , one of europe 's major financial markets . " the cdu in hesse has always been a law and order party and is known for its ultra-conservative wing , " said gero neugebauer , a political scientist at berlin 's free university .
" koch 's current campaign is an obvious attempt to mobilize this hard core of its supporters who the cdu fears it might lose to far-right parties . " while far-right parties are largely successful in former communist eastern germany - the anti-immigrant npd is represented in two of five state assemblies - experts underline that xenophobic tendencies also exist among voters of mainstream political parties in the western part of the country . " hostility against foreigners and immigrants is equally widespread in western germany , too , " said elmar brähler from the university of leipzig , who carried out a study in 2006 for the friedrich ebert foundation on right-wing extremism in germany .
" the phenomenon is worst among those over the age of 60 . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 68 percent of the cdu 's members are older than 50 analysts say it 's no coincidence koch is appealing to an older generation of conservative voters who are increasingly important to his re-election bid and those of conservative premiers in other states . according to the party 's latest statistics , cdu membership has fallen from 638,000 in 1999 to 541,289 at the end of sept 2007 .
around 68 percent of the members are older than 50 , compared with 14 percent in the age group 16 to 39 . " whipping up fears about security after a brutal attack on the munich subway is a sure tactic of getting the attention of these older voters , " neugebauer said . minimum wage may be a vote-getter this time while koch 's anti-foreigner rhetoric has put further strain on his party 's uneasy grand coalition with the social democrats at the federal level , experts say chancellor angela merkel is unlikely to publicly rein in koch for fear of losing an economically and politically important state that the cdu has ruled for almost a decade . polls indicate that the spd has made huge gains in hesse and that koch is struggling to keep his absolute majority . merkel herself has talked often about the need to integrate the country 's 2.3 million muslims , most of who are of turkish origin , but says immigrants must accept german culture .
an opponent of turkey 's eu membership , merkel won thunderous applause at a recent party conference for saying mosques should not dwarf churches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say voters are more interested in getting decent wages while the outcome of the election in hesse is still open , some believe that the cdu 's tactic of using stirring fears of immigration as a vote-getter may no longer work this time . the spd 's push for a national minimum wage in an effort to dethrone koch - it 's opposed by merkel 's cdu - has wide public support and comes at a time when fears about economic uncertainty are growing , said richard stöss , a politics professor at berlin 's free university . " hesse is home to lots of industry and factories and an issue like a national minimum wage is likely to resonate far better with voters than fears of immigration , " he said . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in karlsruhe on thursday , a baby girl was found dead in a similar baby hatch ; officials say she had likely died before being left there .
in both cases , there are no clues as to the identity of the parents .
baby hatches have existed in germany since the 19th century in the hope of preventing infanticide by giving desperate mothers a safe place to leave their unwanted babies .
but they have always been controversial , mainly because it is illegal to give birth anonymously in germany .
critics of the hatches say they help women circumvent the law .
but voices on the other side of the debate say that anonymous births will take place no matter what the law says , and that it is better to provide mothers who feel compelled to give birth in secret an anonymous drop-off point for their babies .
calls to legalize anonymous births now , the two incidents in hanover and karlsruhe are rekindling the anonymous birth debate .
both government and protestant church officials in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg have renewed calls for legalizing anonymous births , which would give pregnant women the option of delivering in a hospital without stating their name .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : legalizing anonymous birth could save the lives of as many as 50 babies a year , experts say the state of baden-württemberg has long been a proponent of legal anonymous births in germany and , together with the state of bavaria , has drawn up draft legislation .
but while the draft has frequently been up for discussion , it has never received the necessary majority from all the committees involved , according to a spokesperson from the state justice ministry .
according to statistics from the regional government in stuttgart , 40 to 50 babies are born in secret without medical assistance each year nationwide , and less than half survive .
having the option of giving birth anonymously in a hospital would reduce the risks for both mother and child , proponents argue .
officials discuss how to help desperate moms in the eastern german state of lower saxony , social minister mechthild ross-luttmann said she intends to talk with those organizations that sponsor baby hatches about ways to improve the service .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could hatches be part of a support concept for pregnant women in need ?
" perhaps there 's a need for improvement at some of the hatches , " she told german news agency dpa , adding that signs with instructions in several languages would be a sensible addition .
a spokeswoman from the free-market liberal free democratic party 's parliamentary group said that the cases in hanover and karlsruhe should not result in criticism of baby hatches .
instead , they should inspire more discussion of how to give such services a legal framework , and how best to help desperate mothers-to-be .
hanover 's regional bishop , margot kässmann , an outspoken proponent of baby hatches , also rejected criticism of the service .
baby hatches could be " part of a broader concept to help pregnant women in need . " dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in karlsruhe on thursday , a baby girl was found dead in a similar baby hatch ; officials say she had likely died before being left there .
in both cases , there are no clues as to the identity of the parents .
baby hatches have existed in germany since the 19th century in the hope of preventing infanticide by giving desperate mothers a safe place to leave their unwanted babies .
but they have always been controversial , mainly because it is illegal to give birth anonymously in germany .
critics of the hatches say they help women circumvent the law .
but voices on the other side of the debate say that anonymous births will take place no matter what the law says , and that it is better to provide mothers who feel compelled to give birth in secret an anonymous drop-off point for their babies .
calls to legalize anonymous births now , the two incidents in hanover and karlsruhe are rekindling the anonymous birth debate .
both government and protestant church officials in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg have renewed calls for legalizing anonymous births , which would give pregnant women the option of delivering in a hospital without stating their name .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : legalizing anonymous birth could save the lives of as many as 50 babies a year , experts say the state of baden-württemberg has long been a proponent of legal anonymous births in germany and , together with the state of bavaria , has drawn up draft legislation .
but while the draft has frequently been up for discussion , it has never received the necessary majority from all the committees involved , according to a spokesperson from the state justice ministry .
according to statistics from the regional government in stuttgart , 40 to 50 babies are born in secret without medical assistance each year nationwide , and less than half survive .
having the option of giving birth anonymously in a hospital would reduce the risks for both mother and child , proponents argue .
officials discuss how to help desperate moms in the eastern german state of lower saxony , social minister mechthild ross-luttmann said she intends to talk with those organizations that sponsor baby hatches about ways to improve the service .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could hatches be part of a support concept for pregnant women in need ?
" perhaps there 's a need for improvement at some of the hatches , " she told german news agency dpa , adding that signs with instructions in several languages would be a sensible addition .
a spokeswoman from the free-market liberal free democratic party 's parliamentary group said that the cases in hanover and karlsruhe should not result in criticism of baby hatches .
instead , they should inspire more discussion of how to give such services a legal framework , and how best to help desperate mothers-to-be .
hanover 's regional bishop , margot kässmann , an outspoken proponent of baby hatches , also rejected criticism of the service .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : tackling youth crime german conservatives want crackdown on youth crime politicians call for tougher laws against young offenders conservative cdu turns youth crime debate into election issue german plan to criminalize teen sex put on back burner politics -pipe- 07.01.2008 squeezed in state poll , german politician pulls out old tricks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we have too many criminal young foreigners , " koch has said a senior figure in chancellor merkel 's conservative party has focused his re-election campaign in a regional poll on crime , in particular offenses by foreigners .
it 's not the first time the party has used such tactics . seeking a third consecutive term as leader of the prosperous western german state of hesse , roland koch has made immigration the centerpiece of his campaign , stirring memories of a similar election bid almost a decade ago . facing a strong challenge from his social democratic challenger who is focusing on demands for a national minimum wage , koch has seized on a recent violent attack on a german pensioner by two young immigrants on a munich subway train to call for the deportation of " criminal foreigners " and urge an end to " multicultural " coddling of immigrants . the attack , which left the 76-year-old victim with a fractured skull , was captured on close circuit cameras and aired for days on german television . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch is no stranger to controversy " how much are we prepared to take from a small proportion of violent youths , who frequently have a foreign background ? "
koch , once a rising star but now struggling , told mass circulation tabloid bild .
" we have spent too long showing a strange sociological understanding for groups that consciously commit violence as ethnic minorities . " koch 's comments on young immigrant criminals follow a proposal last month for a ban on students wearing the all-encompassing burqa in schools even though there was no reported incident of it . playing with fire while koch 's comments have sparked an outcry among left-wing politicians and immigrant groups and fuelled a heated debate on juvenile crime , political observers point out that it 's not the first time the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- has used anti-immigrant rhetoric to gain political mileage . " the cdu is a highly pragmatic party that does n't shy away from using the anti-foreigner card to reinforce prejudices and appeal to right-wing elements in the population , " said peter lösche , a retired professor of political science at the university of göttingen .
" it 's done it before and had success with it . " in 1999 , koch used criticism of immigration to oust a center-left administration and win the hesse state election .
he launched a successful signature campaign in which his party hit out against federal government plans to introduce dual citizenship for foreign citizens living in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu ran a notorious campaign against skilled indian software specialists in 2000 , another cdu politician , jürgen rüttgers , of north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state , unleashed a campaign against proposed " green cards " for indian software engineers .
his slogan , " kinder statt inder " or " children instead of indians " referred to a preference for home-grown it talent over skilled foreign workers .
while he failed to win that election , he did become the state 's premier in 2005 . members of the cdu 's sister bavarian party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , have often used anti-immigrant rhetoric in their speeches , most notably former bavarian premier edmund stoiber . germany is home to 15 million people of immigrant background , making up about 18 percent of the population .
most of them came as foreign " guest workers " from turkey and italy to help rebuild the country after the war and stayed on . many takers for anti-immigrant rhetoric ? some point out that koch 's populism and anti-immigrant campaigning is not out of place in hesse , home to around 6.1 million people and the city of frankfurt , one of europe 's major financial markets . " the cdu in hesse has always been a law and order party and is known for its ultra-conservative wing , " said gero neugebauer , a political scientist at berlin 's free university .
" koch 's current campaign is an obvious attempt to mobilize this hard core of its supporters who the cdu fears it might lose to far-right parties . " while far-right parties are largely successful in former communist eastern germany - the anti-immigrant npd is represented in two of five state assemblies - experts underline that xenophobic tendencies also exist among voters of mainstream political parties in the western part of the country . " hostility against foreigners and immigrants is equally widespread in western germany , too , " said elmar brähler from the university of leipzig , who carried out a study in 2006 for the friedrich ebert foundation on right-wing extremism in germany .
" the phenomenon is worst among those over the age of 60 . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 68 percent of the cdu 's members are older than 50 analysts say it 's no coincidence koch is appealing to an older generation of conservative voters who are increasingly important to his re-election bid and those of conservative premiers in other states . according to the party 's latest statistics , cdu membership has fallen from 638,000 in 1999 to 541,289 at the end of sept 2007 .
around 68 percent of the members are older than 50 , compared with 14 percent in the age group 16 to 39 . " whipping up fears about security after a brutal attack on the munich subway is a sure tactic of getting the attention of these older voters , " neugebauer said . minimum wage may be a vote-getter this time while koch 's anti-foreigner rhetoric has put further strain on his party 's uneasy grand coalition with the social democrats at the federal level , experts say chancellor angela merkel is unlikely to publicly rein in koch for fear of losing an economically and politically important state that the cdu has ruled for almost a decade . polls indicate that the spd has made huge gains in hesse and that koch is struggling to keep his absolute majority . merkel herself has talked often about the need to integrate the country 's 2.3 million muslims , most of who are of turkish origin , but says immigrants must accept german culture .
an opponent of turkey 's eu membership , merkel won thunderous applause at a recent party conference for saying mosques should not dwarf churches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say voters are more interested in getting decent wages while the outcome of the election in hesse is still open , some believe that the cdu 's tactic of using stirring fears of immigration as a vote-getter may no longer work this time . the spd 's push for a national minimum wage in an effort to dethrone koch - it 's opposed by merkel 's cdu - has wide public support and comes at a time when fears about economic uncertainty are growing , said richard stöss , a politics professor at berlin 's free university .

in karlsruhe on thursday , a baby girl was found dead in a similar baby hatch ; officials say she had likely died before being left there .
in both cases , there are no clues as to the identity of the parents .
baby hatches have existed in germany since the 19th century in the hope of preventing infanticide by giving desperate mothers a safe place to leave their unwanted babies .
but they have always been controversial , mainly because it is illegal to give birth anonymously in germany .
critics of the hatches say they help women circumvent the law .
but voices on the other side of the debate say that anonymous births will take place no matter what the law says , and that it is better to provide mothers who feel compelled to give birth in secret an anonymous drop-off point for their babies .
calls to legalize anonymous births now , the two incidents in hanover and karlsruhe are rekindling the anonymous birth debate .
both government and protestant church officials in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg have renewed calls for legalizing anonymous births , which would give pregnant women the option of delivering in a hospital without stating their name .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : legalizing anonymous birth could save the lives of as many as 50 babies a year , experts say the state of baden-württemberg has long been a proponent of legal anonymous births in germany and , together with the state of bavaria , has drawn up draft legislation .
but while the draft has frequently been up for discussion , it has never received the necessary majority from all the committees involved , according to a spokesperson from the state justice ministry .
according to statistics from the regional government in stuttgart , 40 to 50 babies are born in secret without medical assistance each year nationwide , and less than half survive .
having the option of giving birth anonymously in a hospital would reduce the risks for both mother and child , proponents argue .
officials discuss how to help desperate moms in the eastern german state of lower saxony , social minister mechthild ross-luttmann said she intends to talk with those organizations that sponsor baby hatches about ways to improve the service .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could hatches be part of a support concept for pregnant women in need ?
" perhaps there 's a need for improvement at some of the hatches , " she told german news agency dpa , adding that signs with instructions in several languages would be a sensible addition .
a spokeswoman from the free-market liberal free democratic party 's parliamentary group said that the cases in hanover and karlsruhe should not result in criticism of baby hatches .
instead , they should inspire more discussion of how to give such services a legal framework , and how best to help desperate mothers-to-be .

it 's not the first time the party has used such tactics . seeking a third consecutive term as leader of the prosperous western german state of hesse , roland koch has made immigration the centerpiece of his campaign , stirring memories of a similar election bid almost a decade ago . facing a strong challenge from his social democratic challenger who is focusing on demands for a national minimum wage , koch has seized on a recent violent attack on a german pensioner by two young immigrants on a munich subway train to call for the deportation of " criminal foreigners " and urge an end to " multicultural " coddling of immigrants . the attack , which left the 76-year-old victim with a fractured skull , was captured on close circuit cameras and aired for days on german television . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch is no stranger to controversy " how much are we prepared to take from a small proportion of violent youths , who frequently have a foreign background ? "
koch , once a rising star but now struggling , told mass circulation tabloid bild .
" we have spent too long showing a strange sociological understanding for groups that consciously commit violence as ethnic minorities . " koch 's comments on young immigrant criminals follow a proposal last month for a ban on students wearing the all-encompassing burqa in schools even though there was no reported incident of it . playing with fire while koch 's comments have sparked an outcry among left-wing politicians and immigrant groups and fuelled a heated debate on juvenile crime , political observers point out that it 's not the first time the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- has used anti-immigrant rhetoric to gain political mileage . " the cdu is a highly pragmatic party that does n't shy away from using the anti-foreigner card to reinforce prejudices and appeal to right-wing elements in the population , " said peter lösche , a retired professor of political science at the university of göttingen .
" it 's done it before and had success with it . " in 1999 , koch used criticism of immigration to oust a center-left administration and win the hesse state election .
he launched a successful signature campaign in which his party hit out against federal government plans to introduce dual citizenship for foreign citizens living in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu ran a notorious campaign against skilled indian software specialists in 2000 , another cdu politician , jürgen rüttgers , of north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state , unleashed a campaign against proposed " green cards " for indian software engineers .
his slogan , " kinder statt inder " or " children instead of indians " referred to a preference for home-grown it talent over skilled foreign workers .
while he failed to win that election , he did become the state 's premier in 2005 . members of the cdu 's sister bavarian party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , have often used anti-immigrant rhetoric in their speeches , most notably former bavarian premier edmund stoiber . germany is home to 15 million people of immigrant background , making up about 18 percent of the population .
most of them came as foreign " guest workers " from turkey and italy to help rebuild the country after the war and stayed on . many takers for anti-immigrant rhetoric ? some point out that koch 's populism and anti-immigrant campaigning is not out of place in hesse , home to around 6.1 million people and the city of frankfurt , one of europe 's major financial markets . " the cdu in hesse has always been a law and order party and is known for its ultra-conservative wing , " said gero neugebauer , a political scientist at berlin 's free university .
" koch 's current campaign is an obvious attempt to mobilize this hard core of its supporters who the cdu fears it might lose to far-right parties . " while far-right parties are largely successful in former communist eastern germany - the anti-immigrant npd is represented in two of five state assemblies - experts underline that xenophobic tendencies also exist among voters of mainstream political parties in the western part of the country . " hostility against foreigners and immigrants is equally widespread in western germany , too , " said elmar brähler from the university of leipzig , who carried out a study in 2006 for the friedrich ebert foundation on right-wing extremism in germany .
" the phenomenon is worst among those over the age of 60 .

it 's not the first time the party has used such tactics . seeking a third consecutive term as leader of the prosperous western german state of hesse , roland koch has made immigration the centerpiece of his campaign , stirring memories of a similar election bid almost a decade ago . facing a strong challenge from his social democratic challenger who is focusing on demands for a national minimum wage , koch has seized on a recent violent attack on a german pensioner by two young immigrants on a munich subway train to call for the deportation of " criminal foreigners " and urge an end to " multicultural " coddling of immigrants . the attack , which left the 76-year-old victim with a fractured skull , was captured on close circuit cameras and aired for days on german television . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch is no stranger to controversy " how much are we prepared to take from a small proportion of violent youths , who frequently have a foreign background ? "
koch , once a rising star but now struggling , told mass circulation tabloid bild .
" we have spent too long showing a strange sociological understanding for groups that consciously commit violence as ethnic minorities . " koch 's comments on young immigrant criminals follow a proposal last month for a ban on students wearing the all-encompassing burqa in schools even though there was no reported incident of it . playing with fire while koch 's comments have sparked an outcry among left-wing politicians and immigrant groups and fuelled a heated debate on juvenile crime , political observers point out that it 's not the first time the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- has used anti-immigrant rhetoric to gain political mileage . " the cdu is a highly pragmatic party that does n't shy away from using the anti-foreigner card to reinforce prejudices and appeal to right-wing elements in the population , " said peter lösche , a retired professor of political science at the university of göttingen .
" it 's done it before and had success with it . " in 1999 , koch used criticism of immigration to oust a center-left administration and win the hesse state election .
he launched a successful signature campaign in which his party hit out against federal government plans to introduce dual citizenship for foreign citizens living in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu ran a notorious campaign against skilled indian software specialists in 2000 , another cdu politician , jürgen rüttgers , of north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state , unleashed a campaign against proposed " green cards " for indian software engineers .
his slogan , " kinder statt inder " or " children instead of indians " referred to a preference for home-grown it talent over skilled foreign workers .
while he failed to win that election , he did become the state 's premier in 2005 . members of the cdu 's sister bavarian party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , have often used anti-immigrant rhetoric in their speeches , most notably former bavarian premier edmund stoiber . germany is home to 15 million people of immigrant background , making up about 18 percent of the population .
most of them came as foreign " guest workers " from turkey and italy to help rebuild the country after the war and stayed on . many takers for anti-immigrant rhetoric ? some point out that koch 's populism and anti-immigrant campaigning is not out of place in hesse , home to around 6.1 million people and the city of frankfurt , one of europe 's major financial markets . " the cdu in hesse has always been a law and order party and is known for its ultra-conservative wing , " said gero neugebauer , a political scientist at berlin 's free university .
" koch 's current campaign is an obvious attempt to mobilize this hard core of its supporters who the cdu fears it might lose to far-right parties . " while far-right parties are largely successful in former communist eastern germany - the anti-immigrant npd is represented in two of five state assemblies - experts underline that xenophobic tendencies also exist among voters of mainstream political parties in the western part of the country . " hostility against foreigners and immigrants is equally widespread in western germany , too , " said elmar brähler from the university of leipzig , who carried out a study in 2006 for the friedrich ebert foundation on right-wing extremism in germany .

in karlsruhe on thursday , a baby girl was found dead in a similar baby hatch ; officials say she had likely died before being left there .
in both cases , there are no clues as to the identity of the parents .
baby hatches have existed in germany since the 19th century in the hope of preventing infanticide by giving desperate mothers a safe place to leave their unwanted babies .
but they have always been controversial , mainly because it is illegal to give birth anonymously in germany .
critics of the hatches say they help women circumvent the law .
but voices on the other side of the debate say that anonymous births will take place no matter what the law says , and that it is better to provide mothers who feel compelled to give birth in secret an anonymous drop-off point for their babies .
calls to legalize anonymous births now , the two incidents in hanover and karlsruhe are rekindling the anonymous birth debate .
both government and protestant church officials in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg have renewed calls for legalizing anonymous births , which would give pregnant women the option of delivering in a hospital without stating their name .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : legalizing anonymous birth could save the lives of as many as 50 babies a year , experts say the state of baden-württemberg has long been a proponent of legal anonymous births in germany and , together with the state of bavaria , has drawn up draft legislation .
but while the draft has frequently been up for discussion , it has never received the necessary majority from all the committees involved , according to a spokesperson from the state justice ministry .
according to statistics from the regional government in stuttgart , 40 to 50 babies are born in secret without medical assistance each year nationwide , and less than half survive .
having the option of giving birth anonymously in a hospital would reduce the risks for both mother and child , proponents argue .
officials discuss how to help desperate moms in the eastern german state of lower saxony , social minister mechthild ross-luttmann said she intends to talk with those organizations that sponsor baby hatches about ways to improve the service .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could hatches be part of a support concept for pregnant women in need ?
" perhaps there 's a need for improvement at some of the hatches , " she told german news agency dpa , adding that signs with instructions in several languages would be a sensible addition .
a spokeswoman from the free-market liberal free democratic party 's parliamentary group said that the cases in hanover and karlsruhe should not result in criticism of baby hatches .
instead , they should inspire more discussion of how to give such services a legal framework , and how best to help desperate mothers-to-be .
hanover 's regional bishop , margot kässmann , an outspoken proponent of baby hatches , also rejected criticism of the service .
baby hatches could be " part of a broader concept to help pregnant women in need . " dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

critics of the hatches say they help women circumvent the law .
but voices on the other side of the debate say that anonymous births will take place no matter what the law says , and that it is better to provide mothers who feel compelled to give birth in secret an anonymous drop-off point for their babies .
calls to legalize anonymous births now , the two incidents in hanover and karlsruhe are rekindling the anonymous birth debate .
both government and protestant church officials in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg have renewed calls for legalizing anonymous births , which would give pregnant women the option of delivering in a hospital without stating their name .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : legalizing anonymous birth could save the lives of as many as 50 babies a year , experts say the state of baden-württemberg has long been a proponent of legal anonymous births in germany and , together with the state of bavaria , has drawn up draft legislation .
but while the draft has frequently been up for discussion , it has never received the necessary majority from all the committees involved , according to a spokesperson from the state justice ministry .
according to statistics from the regional government in stuttgart , 40 to 50 babies are born in secret without medical assistance each year nationwide , and less than half survive .
having the option of giving birth anonymously in a hospital would reduce the risks for both mother and child , proponents argue .
officials discuss how to help desperate moms in the eastern german state of lower saxony , social minister mechthild ross-luttmann said she intends to talk with those organizations that sponsor baby hatches about ways to improve the service .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could hatches be part of a support concept for pregnant women in need ?
" perhaps there 's a need for improvement at some of the hatches , " she told german news agency dpa , adding that signs with instructions in several languages would be a sensible addition .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : tackling youth crime german conservatives want crackdown on youth crime politicians call for tougher laws against young offenders conservative cdu turns youth crime debate into election issue german plan to criminalize teen sex put on back burner politics -pipe- 07.01.2008 squeezed in state poll , german politician pulls out old tricks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we have too many criminal young foreigners , " koch has said a senior figure in chancellor merkel 's conservative party has focused his re-election campaign in a regional poll on crime , in particular offenses by foreigners .
it 's not the first time the party has used such tactics . seeking a third consecutive term as leader of the prosperous western german state of hesse , roland koch has made immigration the centerpiece of his campaign , stirring memories of a similar election bid almost a decade ago . facing a strong challenge from his social democratic challenger who is focusing on demands for a national minimum wage , koch has seized on a recent violent attack on a german pensioner by two young immigrants on a munich subway train to call for the deportation of " criminal foreigners " and urge an end to " multicultural " coddling of immigrants . the attack , which left the 76-year-old victim with a fractured skull , was captured on close circuit cameras and aired for days on german television . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch is no stranger to controversy " how much are we prepared to take from a small proportion of violent youths , who frequently have a foreign background ? "
koch , once a rising star but now struggling , told mass circulation tabloid bild .
" we have spent too long showing a strange sociological understanding for groups that consciously commit violence as ethnic minorities . " koch 's comments on young immigrant criminals follow a proposal last month for a ban on students wearing the all-encompassing burqa in schools even though there was no reported incident of it . playing with fire while koch 's comments have sparked an outcry among left-wing politicians and immigrant groups and fuelled a heated debate on juvenile crime , political observers point out that it 's not the first time the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- has used anti-immigrant rhetoric to gain political mileage . " the cdu is a highly pragmatic party that does n't shy away from using the anti-foreigner card to reinforce prejudices and appeal to right-wing elements in the population , " said peter lösche , a retired professor of political science at the university of göttingen .
" it 's done it before and had success with it . " in 1999 , koch used criticism of immigration to oust a center-left administration and win the hesse state election .
he launched a successful signature campaign in which his party hit out against federal government plans to introduce dual citizenship for foreign citizens living in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu ran a notorious campaign against skilled indian software specialists in 2000 , another cdu politician , jürgen rüttgers , of north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state , unleashed a campaign against proposed " green cards " for indian software engineers .
his slogan , " kinder statt inder " or " children instead of indians " referred to a preference for home-grown it talent over skilled foreign workers .
while he failed to win that election , he did become the state 's premier in 2005 . members of the cdu 's sister bavarian party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , have often used anti-immigrant rhetoric in their speeches , most notably former bavarian premier edmund stoiber . germany is home to 15 million people of immigrant background , making up about 18 percent of the population .
most of them came as foreign " guest workers " from turkey and italy to help rebuild the country after the war and stayed on . many takers for anti-immigrant rhetoric ? some point out that koch 's populism and anti-immigrant campaigning is not out of place in hesse , home to around 6.1 million people and the city of frankfurt , one of europe 's major financial markets . " the cdu in hesse has always been a law and order party and is known for its ultra-conservative wing , " said gero neugebauer , a political scientist at berlin 's free university .
" koch 's current campaign is an obvious attempt to mobilize this hard core of its supporters who the cdu fears it might lose to far-right parties . " while far-right parties are largely successful in former communist eastern germany - the anti-immigrant npd is represented in two of five state assemblies - experts underline that xenophobic tendencies also exist among voters of mainstream political parties in the western part of the country . " hostility against foreigners and immigrants is equally widespread in western germany , too , " said elmar brähler from the university of leipzig , who carried out a study in 2006 for the friedrich ebert foundation on right-wing extremism in germany .
" the phenomenon is worst among those over the age of 60 . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 68 percent of the cdu 's members are older than 50 analysts say it 's no coincidence koch is appealing to an older generation of conservative voters who are increasingly important to his re-election bid and those of conservative premiers in other states . according to the party 's latest statistics , cdu membership has fallen from 638,000 in 1999 to 541,289 at the end of sept 2007 .
around 68 percent of the members are older than 50 , compared with 14 percent in the age group 16 to 39 . " whipping up fears about security after a brutal attack on the munich subway is a sure tactic of getting the attention of these older voters , " neugebauer said . minimum wage may be a vote-getter this time while koch 's anti-foreigner rhetoric has put further strain on his party 's uneasy grand coalition with the social democrats at the federal level , experts say chancellor angela merkel is unlikely to publicly rein in koch for fear of losing an economically and politically important state that the cdu has ruled for almost a decade . polls indicate that the spd has made huge gains in hesse and that koch is struggling to keep his absolute majority . merkel herself has talked often about the need to integrate the country 's 2.3 million muslims , most of who are of turkish origin , but says immigrants must accept german culture .
an opponent of turkey 's eu membership , merkel won thunderous applause at a recent party conference for saying mosques should not dwarf churches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say voters are more interested in getting decent wages while the outcome of the election in hesse is still open , some believe that the cdu 's tactic of using stirring fears of immigration as a vote-getter may no longer work this time . the spd 's push for a national minimum wage in an effort to dethrone koch - it 's opposed by merkel 's cdu - has wide public support and comes at a time when fears about economic uncertainty are growing , said richard stöss , a politics professor at berlin 's free university . " hesse is home to lots of industry and factories and an issue like a national minimum wage is likely to resonate far better with voters than fears of immigration , " he said . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in karlsruhe on thursday , a baby girl was found dead in a similar baby hatch ; officials say she had likely died before being left there .
in both cases , there are no clues as to the identity of the parents .
baby hatches have existed in germany since the 19th century in the hope of preventing infanticide by giving desperate mothers a safe place to leave their unwanted babies .
but they have always been controversial , mainly because it is illegal to give birth anonymously in germany .
critics of the hatches say they help women circumvent the law .
but voices on the other side of the debate say that anonymous births will take place no matter what the law says , and that it is better to provide mothers who feel compelled to give birth in secret an anonymous drop-off point for their babies .
calls to legalize anonymous births now , the two incidents in hanover and karlsruhe are rekindling the anonymous birth debate .
both government and protestant church officials in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg have renewed calls for legalizing anonymous births , which would give pregnant women the option of delivering in a hospital without stating their name .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : legalizing anonymous birth could save the lives of as many as 50 babies a year , experts say the state of baden-württemberg has long been a proponent of legal anonymous births in germany and , together with the state of bavaria , has drawn up draft legislation .
but while the draft has frequently been up for discussion , it has never received the necessary majority from all the committees involved , according to a spokesperson from the state justice ministry .
according to statistics from the regional government in stuttgart , 40 to 50 babies are born in secret without medical assistance each year nationwide , and less than half survive .
having the option of giving birth anonymously in a hospital would reduce the risks for both mother and child , proponents argue .
officials discuss how to help desperate moms in the eastern german state of lower saxony , social minister mechthild ross-luttmann said she intends to talk with those organizations that sponsor baby hatches about ways to improve the service .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could hatches be part of a support concept for pregnant women in need ?
" perhaps there 's a need for improvement at some of the hatches , " she told german news agency dpa , adding that signs with instructions in several languages would be a sensible addition .
a spokeswoman from the free-market liberal free democratic party 's parliamentary group said that the cases in hanover and karlsruhe should not result in criticism of baby hatches .
instead , they should inspire more discussion of how to give such services a legal framework , and how best to help desperate mothers-to-be .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : tackling youth crime german conservatives want crackdown on youth crime politicians call for tougher laws against young offenders conservative cdu turns youth crime debate into election issue german plan to criminalize teen sex put on back burner politics -pipe- 07.01.2008 squeezed in state poll , german politician pulls out old tricks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we have too many criminal young foreigners , " koch has said a senior figure in chancellor merkel 's conservative party has focused his re-election campaign in a regional poll on crime , in particular offenses by foreigners .
it 's not the first time the party has used such tactics . seeking a third consecutive term as leader of the prosperous western german state of hesse , roland koch has made immigration the centerpiece of his campaign , stirring memories of a similar election bid almost a decade ago . facing a strong challenge from his social democratic challenger who is focusing on demands for a national minimum wage , koch has seized on a recent violent attack on a german pensioner by two young immigrants on a munich subway train to call for the deportation of " criminal foreigners " and urge an end to " multicultural " coddling of immigrants . the attack , which left the 76-year-old victim with a fractured skull , was captured on close circuit cameras and aired for days on german television . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch is no stranger to controversy " how much are we prepared to take from a small proportion of violent youths , who frequently have a foreign background ? "
koch , once a rising star but now struggling , told mass circulation tabloid bild .
" we have spent too long showing a strange sociological understanding for groups that consciously commit violence as ethnic minorities . " koch 's comments on young immigrant criminals follow a proposal last month for a ban on students wearing the all-encompassing burqa in schools even though there was no reported incident of it . playing with fire while koch 's comments have sparked an outcry among left-wing politicians and immigrant groups and fuelled a heated debate on juvenile crime , political observers point out that it 's not the first time the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- has used anti-immigrant rhetoric to gain political mileage . " the cdu is a highly pragmatic party that does n't shy away from using the anti-foreigner card to reinforce prejudices and appeal to right-wing elements in the population , " said peter lösche , a retired professor of political science at the university of göttingen .
" it 's done it before and had success with it . " in 1999 , koch used criticism of immigration to oust a center-left administration and win the hesse state election .
he launched a successful signature campaign in which his party hit out against federal government plans to introduce dual citizenship for foreign citizens living in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu ran a notorious campaign against skilled indian software specialists in 2000 , another cdu politician , jürgen rüttgers , of north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state , unleashed a campaign against proposed " green cards " for indian software engineers .
his slogan , " kinder statt inder " or " children instead of indians " referred to a preference for home-grown it talent over skilled foreign workers .
while he failed to win that election , he did become the state 's premier in 2005 . members of the cdu 's sister bavarian party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , have often used anti-immigrant rhetoric in their speeches , most notably former bavarian premier edmund stoiber . germany is home to 15 million people of immigrant background , making up about 18 percent of the population .
most of them came as foreign " guest workers " from turkey and italy to help rebuild the country after the war and stayed on . many takers for anti-immigrant rhetoric ? some point out that koch 's populism and anti-immigrant campaigning is not out of place in hesse , home to around 6.1 million people and the city of frankfurt , one of europe 's major financial markets . " the cdu in hesse has always been a law and order party and is known for its ultra-conservative wing , " said gero neugebauer , a political scientist at berlin 's free university .
" koch 's current campaign is an obvious attempt to mobilize this hard core of its supporters who the cdu fears it might lose to far-right parties . " while far-right parties are largely successful in former communist eastern germany - the anti-immigrant npd is represented in two of five state assemblies - experts underline that xenophobic tendencies also exist among voters of mainstream political parties in the western part of the country . " hostility against foreigners and immigrants is equally widespread in western germany , too , " said elmar brähler from the university of leipzig , who carried out a study in 2006 for the friedrich ebert foundation on right-wing extremism in germany .
" the phenomenon is worst among those over the age of 60 . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 68 percent of the cdu 's members are older than 50 analysts say it 's no coincidence koch is appealing to an older generation of conservative voters who are increasingly important to his re-election bid and those of conservative premiers in other states . according to the party 's latest statistics , cdu membership has fallen from 638,000 in 1999 to 541,289 at the end of sept 2007 .
around 68 percent of the members are older than 50 , compared with 14 percent in the age group 16 to 39 . " whipping up fears about security after a brutal attack on the munich subway is a sure tactic of getting the attention of these older voters , " neugebauer said . minimum wage may be a vote-getter this time while koch 's anti-foreigner rhetoric has put further strain on his party 's uneasy grand coalition with the social democrats at the federal level , experts say chancellor angela merkel is unlikely to publicly rein in koch for fear of losing an economically and politically important state that the cdu has ruled for almost a decade . polls indicate that the spd has made huge gains in hesse and that koch is struggling to keep his absolute majority . merkel herself has talked often about the need to integrate the country 's 2.3 million muslims , most of who are of turkish origin , but says immigrants must accept german culture .
an opponent of turkey 's eu membership , merkel won thunderous applause at a recent party conference for saying mosques should not dwarf churches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say voters are more interested in getting decent wages while the outcome of the election in hesse is still open , some believe that the cdu 's tactic of using stirring fears of immigration as a vote-getter may no longer work this time . the spd 's push for a national minimum wage in an effort to dethrone koch - it 's opposed by merkel 's cdu - has wide public support and comes at a time when fears about economic uncertainty are growing , said richard stöss , a politics professor at berlin 's free university . " hesse is home to lots of industry and factories and an issue like a national minimum wage is likely to resonate far better with voters than fears of immigration , " he said . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's not the first time the party has used such tactics . seeking a third consecutive term as leader of the prosperous western german state of hesse , roland koch has made immigration the centerpiece of his campaign , stirring memories of a similar election bid almost a decade ago . facing a strong challenge from his social democratic challenger who is focusing on demands for a national minimum wage , koch has seized on a recent violent attack on a german pensioner by two young immigrants on a munich subway train to call for the deportation of " criminal foreigners " and urge an end to " multicultural " coddling of immigrants . the attack , which left the 76-year-old victim with a fractured skull , was captured on close circuit cameras and aired for days on german television . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch is no stranger to controversy " how much are we prepared to take from a small proportion of violent youths , who frequently have a foreign background ? "
koch , once a rising star but now struggling , told mass circulation tabloid bild .
" we have spent too long showing a strange sociological understanding for groups that consciously commit violence as ethnic minorities . " koch 's comments on young immigrant criminals follow a proposal last month for a ban on students wearing the all-encompassing burqa in schools even though there was no reported incident of it . playing with fire while koch 's comments have sparked an outcry among left-wing politicians and immigrant groups and fuelled a heated debate on juvenile crime , political observers point out that it 's not the first time the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- has used anti-immigrant rhetoric to gain political mileage . " the cdu is a highly pragmatic party that does n't shy away from using the anti-foreigner card to reinforce prejudices and appeal to right-wing elements in the population , " said peter lösche , a retired professor of political science at the university of göttingen .
" it 's done it before and had success with it . " in 1999 , koch used criticism of immigration to oust a center-left administration and win the hesse state election .
he launched a successful signature campaign in which his party hit out against federal government plans to introduce dual citizenship for foreign citizens living in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu ran a notorious campaign against skilled indian software specialists in 2000 , another cdu politician , jürgen rüttgers , of north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state , unleashed a campaign against proposed " green cards " for indian software engineers .
his slogan , " kinder statt inder " or " children instead of indians " referred to a preference for home-grown it talent over skilled foreign workers .
while he failed to win that election , he did become the state 's premier in 2005 . members of the cdu 's sister bavarian party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , have often used anti-immigrant rhetoric in their speeches , most notably former bavarian premier edmund stoiber . germany is home to 15 million people of immigrant background , making up about 18 percent of the population .
most of them came as foreign " guest workers " from turkey and italy to help rebuild the country after the war and stayed on . many takers for anti-immigrant rhetoric ? some point out that koch 's populism and anti-immigrant campaigning is not out of place in hesse , home to around 6.1 million people and the city of frankfurt , one of europe 's major financial markets . " the cdu in hesse has always been a law and order party and is known for its ultra-conservative wing , " said gero neugebauer , a political scientist at berlin 's free university .
" koch 's current campaign is an obvious attempt to mobilize this hard core of its supporters who the cdu fears it might lose to far-right parties . " while far-right parties are largely successful in former communist eastern germany - the anti-immigrant npd is represented in two of five state assemblies - experts underline that xenophobic tendencies also exist among voters of mainstream political parties in the western part of the country . " hostility against foreigners and immigrants is equally widespread in western germany , too , " said elmar brähler from the university of leipzig , who carried out a study in 2006 for the friedrich ebert foundation on right-wing extremism in germany .
" the phenomenon is worst among those over the age of 60 . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 68 percent of the cdu 's members are older than 50 analysts say it 's no coincidence koch is appealing to an older generation of conservative voters who are increasingly important to his re-election bid and those of conservative premiers in other states . according to the party 's latest statistics , cdu membership has fallen from 638,000 in 1999 to 541,289 at the end of sept 2007 .
around 68 percent of the members are older than 50 , compared with 14 percent in the age group 16 to 39 . " whipping up fears about security after a brutal attack on the munich subway is a sure tactic of getting the attention of these older voters , " neugebauer said . minimum wage may be a vote-getter this time while koch 's anti-foreigner rhetoric has put further strain on his party 's uneasy grand coalition with the social democrats at the federal level , experts say chancellor angela merkel is unlikely to publicly rein in koch for fear of losing an economically and politically important state that the cdu has ruled for almost a decade . polls indicate that the spd has made huge gains in hesse and that koch is struggling to keep his absolute majority . merkel herself has talked often about the need to integrate the country 's 2.3 million muslims , most of who are of turkish origin , but says immigrants must accept german culture .
an opponent of turkey 's eu membership , merkel won thunderous applause at a recent party conference for saying mosques should not dwarf churches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say voters are more interested in getting decent wages while the outcome of the election in hesse is still open , some believe that the cdu 's tactic of using stirring fears of immigration as a vote-getter may no longer work this time . the spd 's push for a national minimum wage in an effort to dethrone koch - it 's opposed by merkel 's cdu - has wide public support and comes at a time when fears about economic uncertainty are growing , said richard stöss , a politics professor at berlin 's free university . " hesse is home to lots of industry and factories and an issue like a national minimum wage is likely to resonate far better with voters than fears of immigration , " he said . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

contergan , a sedative which contained the active ingredient thalidomide , was prescribed to pregnant women in the late 1950s , and caused their fetuses to be born with severely shortened limbs , or in some cases , no limbs at all .
around half of the 10,000 thalidomide victims worldwide were born in west germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas meyer the president of germany 's association of contergan victims , andreas meyer , says the tragedy has never been fully investigated , nor is he happy with what he says is grünenthal 's silence on the issue .
the company has never formally apologized , although in the past month , it has begun meeting with victims ' representatives seeking an improved health and financial situation for the some 2,700 thalidomide victims still living in germany .
" we want to know exactly what happened , " meyer said , adding that he was not prepared to accept an apology on its own without the appropriate compensation .
more financial aid needed , victims say thalidomide victims say a compensation fund set up in 1970 has been exhausted and that many now need extra help as arthritis and age bring pain after a lifetime of unnatural movement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's thalidomide babies were often raised and schooled apart from other children grünenthal had said that the 110 million deutsche marks -lrb- 56.3 million euros or $ 83 million at current rates -rrb- it paid into a trust in 1971 was a final settlement of all claims in germany .
the modest monthly stipends of 545 euros victims currently receive are entirely funded by the government .
among the victims ' demands is a six-fold increase in these monthly payments to an amount between 2,100 and 3,500 euros , as well as a one-time compensation payment of around 1 million euros per victim .
the victims ' representatives are planning a parliamentary campaign to make their case to both the federal government and grünenthal .
" an independent lifestyle is not possible with the current level of monthly payments , " said udo herterich of the regional thalidomide victims ' association in the state of north rhine-westphalia .
" we 're getting older , we 're suffering more from the consequences of our disabilities and we need more and more help . "
grünenthal ceo " very moved " the victims ' associations were hopeful that grünenthal would reassess its position following an initial meeting with employees last month .
grünenthal ceo sebastian wirtz described the meeting as " very moving , " and said that he and his family regretted very much the events of 50 years ago .
" even though i had n't been born at that point , as a family member of the third generation , i would like to try , together with those affected , to come to terms with the contergan tragedy , " wirtz said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from the tv drama " eine einzige tablette " -lrb- a single pill -rrb- on the weekend , various associations of german contergan victims joined forces with the international contergan alliance , made up of the national associations of great britain , spain , sweden and canada .
the british alliance has already attained monthly payments of between 2,100 and 3,500 euros for its members .

instead , it fermented inside the hungry hound 's stomach until - bingo ! - the dog was stinking drunk .
not fit to drive the clinic veterinarian said bingo had a blood-alcohol level of 1.6 per mille which , if he were n't a canine , would have also put him well past austria 's legal driving limit of 0.5 per mille .
-lrb- not to mention how hard it would be to take a decent drivers ' license photo . -rrb-
bingo 's owner took the situation in stride .

contergan , a sedative which contained the active ingredient thalidomide , was prescribed to pregnant women in the late 1950s , and caused their fetuses to be born with severely shortened limbs , or in some cases , no limbs at all .
around half of the 10,000 thalidomide victims worldwide were born in west germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas meyer the president of germany 's association of contergan victims , andreas meyer , says the tragedy has never been fully investigated , nor is he happy with what he says is grünenthal 's silence on the issue .
the company has never formally apologized , although in the past month , it has begun meeting with victims ' representatives seeking an improved health and financial situation for the some 2,700 thalidomide victims still living in germany .
" we want to know exactly what happened , " meyer said , adding that he was not prepared to accept an apology on its own without the appropriate compensation .
more financial aid needed , victims say thalidomide victims say a compensation fund set up in 1970 has been exhausted and that many now need extra help as arthritis and age bring pain after a lifetime of unnatural movement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's thalidomide babies were often raised and schooled apart from other children grünenthal had said that the 110 million deutsche marks -lrb- 56.3 million euros or $ 83 million at current rates -rrb- it paid into a trust in 1971 was a final settlement of all claims in germany .
the modest monthly stipends of 545 euros victims currently receive are entirely funded by the government .
among the victims ' demands is a six-fold increase in these monthly payments to an amount between 2,100 and 3,500 euros , as well as a one-time compensation payment of around 1 million euros per victim .
the victims ' representatives are planning a parliamentary campaign to make their case to both the federal government and grünenthal .
" an independent lifestyle is not possible with the current level of monthly payments , " said udo herterich of the regional thalidomide victims ' association in the state of north rhine-westphalia .
" we 're getting older , we 're suffering more from the consequences of our disabilities and we need more and more help . "
grünenthal ceo " very moved " the victims ' associations were hopeful that grünenthal would reassess its position following an initial meeting with employees last month .
grünenthal ceo sebastian wirtz described the meeting as " very moving , " and said that he and his family regretted very much the events of 50 years ago .
" even though i had n't been born at that point , as a family member of the third generation , i would like to try , together with those affected , to come to terms with the contergan tragedy , " wirtz said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from the tv drama " eine einzige tablette " -lrb- a single pill -rrb- on the weekend , various associations of german contergan victims joined forces with the international contergan alliance , made up of the national associations of great britain , spain , sweden and canada .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : german state elections in hesse and lower saxony german ex-minister warns against own party in key state poll immigrant groups protest against koch 's justice plans germany mulls extending voting rights to foreigners german ex-chancellor criticizes xenophobic election campaign politics -pipe- 07.01.2008 state election policies reveal extent of divide in german coalition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the state polls are seen as the starting pistol for the 2009 general election campiagn state elections this year are likely to be the catalyst for open war between the country 's ruling coalition partners .
both parties are attempting to stake out their ground ahead of a 2009 federal election . as things stand , chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- counterparts appear to be barely holding their fractious relationship together .
once the voters go to the polls in state elections this year , divisions over two key policy issues could see the brittle façade finally shatter . the wrangling over a proposed national minimum wage , championed by the spd , and a conservative-led plan to crackdown on juvenile crime are the issues likely to dominate the first elections , taking place in hessen and lower saxony in late january and in hamburg in february .
bavaria will vote in september .
the results of the state elections could indicate how the general election in 2009 could play out . the way each party makes its arguments and the results of the polls in relation to the issues may drive the current wedge between the coalition partners deeper , effectively splitting the government .
the spd have set the call for a national minimum wage at the heart of their campaign in the key state polls , much to the chagrin of the cdu . minimum wage central to spd campaign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the campaign for no wage under 7.50 euros is popular among labor unionists at the launch of the campaign , peter struck , the head of the spd 's parliamentary group , announced that the social democrats intended to harness the strong public backing for a minimum hourly wage of 7.50 euros -lrb- $ 10.77 -rrb- in the three regional races . " we will start petition drives during the state elections , " struck said in december .
" then the voters will have their say .
we will make the state elections and the general election in 2009 into a referendum on the minimum wage . " the social democrats , who have been trailing the conservatives in the polls by around 10 points for several months , argue that europe 's biggest economy must ensure that wages are high enough to keep workers above the poverty level .
germany is one of the few countries in the eu without a national minimum wage , though it does have a series of industry-specific wage agreements . many leading conservative members , the chancellor included , have reacted angrily to the spd 's stance , saying that an across-the-board minimum wage would be a job killer , driving companies to eastern europe and asia where pay is lower . merkel favors industry control on wages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor has led the opposition to the proposal at the launch of the cdu election program on saturday , the party ruled out a debate on the minimum wage , defiantly putting itself in opposition to the spd 's central election theme . merkel has said that the national minimum wage is " not the right answer " and has reiterated her support for the traditional practice of leaving unions and employers to negotiate wage levels in each industry . meanwhile , the conservatives seem intent on fighting the state elections on a law and order ticket , riling the spd in the process . the cdu leadership has called for stiffer penalties for juveniles convicted of violent crimes , proposing an increase in the maximum sentence for young people convicted of serious offences from 10 to 15 years . the party has also called for a " warning shot " period of detention for those given probation for violent crimes and the introduction of boot camps where young offenders could be sent for re-education .
under the new cdu proposals , rules for deporting foreigners convicted of serious crimes would also be eased . conservatives react to upsurge in violent crime bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violent crime has been grabbing the headlines " i think ' warning-shot arrests ' -lsb- short periods in detention -rsb- and boot camps could indeed be a sensible supplement to current laws , " merkel said .
" it could turn young people around so they do not wind up in prison . " the proposals , in line with those put forward by roland koch , the under-pressure cdu premier of hesse , who is seeking a third term of office on jan .
27 , come after a spate of violent attacks across germany . " how much are we prepared to take from a small proportion of violent youths , who frequently have a foreign background , " koch said in an interview after the attack , which has been repeatedly broadcast on television . " something has to be done , " merkel added .
" there is no point in delaying matters .
it is unacceptable that many people do not dare ride the subway at night because they are afraid of violence ... we need the feeling of personal security again in germany . " -lrb- the social democrats -rrb- can not close their eyes to the fact that 43 percent of all violent crimes in germany are committed by people who are under the age of 21 and that among them , nearly half are foreign-born youth , " she said . cdu accused of targeting foreigners bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch -lrb- l . -rrb- and interior minister volker bouffier promote a " secure life " the social democrats have accused koch and the conservatives of fuelling anti-foreigner sentiment in order to gain re-election and said existing laws were sufficient to punish violent offenders . however , spd leader kurt beck conceded that steps need to be taken to combat the upsurge in youth crime as long they involved better application of current laws instead of introducing new legislation . " this is better than taking hasty action arising solely from motives related to elections , " beck told the news magazine der spiegel . it is unlikely that any further concessions will be made by either party as the coalition partners plot their own slow and potentially bitter courses towards the 2009 general election . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

both parties are attempting to stake out their ground ahead of a 2009 federal election . as things stand , chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- counterparts appear to be barely holding their fractious relationship together .
once the voters go to the polls in state elections this year , divisions over two key policy issues could see the brittle façade finally shatter . the wrangling over a proposed national minimum wage , championed by the spd , and a conservative-led plan to crackdown on juvenile crime are the issues likely to dominate the first elections , taking place in hessen and lower saxony in late january and in hamburg in february .
bavaria will vote in september .
the results of the state elections could indicate how the general election in 2009 could play out . the way each party makes its arguments and the results of the polls in relation to the issues may drive the current wedge between the coalition partners deeper , effectively splitting the government .
the spd have set the call for a national minimum wage at the heart of their campaign in the key state polls , much to the chagrin of the cdu . minimum wage central to spd campaign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the campaign for no wage under 7.50 euros is popular among labor unionists at the launch of the campaign , peter struck , the head of the spd 's parliamentary group , announced that the social democrats intended to harness the strong public backing for a minimum hourly wage of 7.50 euros -lrb- $ 10.77 -rrb- in the three regional races . " we will start petition drives during the state elections , " struck said in december .
" then the voters will have their say .
we will make the state elections and the general election in 2009 into a referendum on the minimum wage . " the social democrats , who have been trailing the conservatives in the polls by around 10 points for several months , argue that europe 's biggest economy must ensure that wages are high enough to keep workers above the poverty level .
germany is one of the few countries in the eu without a national minimum wage , though it does have a series of industry-specific wage agreements . many leading conservative members , the chancellor included , have reacted angrily to the spd 's stance , saying that an across-the-board minimum wage would be a job killer , driving companies to eastern europe and asia where pay is lower . merkel favors industry control on wages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor has led the opposition to the proposal at the launch of the cdu election program on saturday , the party ruled out a debate on the minimum wage , defiantly putting itself in opposition to the spd 's central election theme . merkel has said that the national minimum wage is " not the right answer " and has reiterated her support for the traditional practice of leaving unions and employers to negotiate wage levels in each industry . meanwhile , the conservatives seem intent on fighting the state elections on a law and order ticket , riling the spd in the process . the cdu leadership has called for stiffer penalties for juveniles convicted of violent crimes , proposing an increase in the maximum sentence for young people convicted of serious offences from 10 to 15 years . the party has also called for a " warning shot " period of detention for those given probation for violent crimes and the introduction of boot camps where young offenders could be sent for re-education .
under the new cdu proposals , rules for deporting foreigners convicted of serious crimes would also be eased . conservatives react to upsurge in violent crime bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violent crime has been grabbing the headlines " i think ' warning-shot arrests ' -lsb- short periods in detention -rsb- and boot camps could indeed be a sensible supplement to current laws , " merkel said .
" it could turn young people around so they do not wind up in prison . " the proposals , in line with those put forward by roland koch , the under-pressure cdu premier of hesse , who is seeking a third term of office on jan .
27 , come after a spate of violent attacks across germany . " how much are we prepared to take from a small proportion of violent youths , who frequently have a foreign background , " koch said in an interview after the attack , which has been repeatedly broadcast on television .

it is to reach the auschwitz death camp in poland on may 8 . but the group claims it has fought resistance from federally owned german railway concern deutsche bahn every step of the way .
representatives are particularly angry that they have to pay the same fees as any other private train operator to use the german railway tracks , despite the company 's historic involvement in the transports . deutsche bahn acknowledged on friday , jan .
4 , that it was charging the group the same toll for track use as other private train operators .
a bahn spokesman said the company had to treat all customers equally . bahn 's historic responsibility the train of commemoration group argues that the bahn must face up to its historic responsibility as the transport provider to the nazis .
it said the tens of thousands of euros of tolls charged to the rolling exhibit were " in effect a boycott of this public commemoration . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibit is based on a similar one by nazi hunter beate klarsfeld the exhibition uses letters and biographies to show how jewish children were caught up in the nazi machinery of death and taken to the gas chambers in cattle wagons . the german citizens ' initiative behind the exhibit was formed by a group of journalists , artists , lawyers and academics , in the wake of a 2003 french exhibition organized by french nazi hunters and activists beate and serge klarsfeld .
the klarsfeld exhibit , which focused on the deportation of 11,000 jewish children via rail from france to nazi death camps , was shown in french train stations . deutsche bahn denied a request to display the french exhibit in german train stations . " that 's when we got the idea to do our own exhibit , " journalist hans-ruediger minow , spokesman for the train of commemoration project , told germany 's mitteldeutsche zeitung newspaper . no exceptions to the rule , bahn says the train of commemoration group came up with the notion of creating an exhibit that would symbolically travel through the country on the very railways that were used in the deportations .
but both deutsche bahn and the german transportation ministry , which issued the transport orders under the nazi regime , failed to show interest in the project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn is charging the project to use its rails susanne kill , corporate historian for deutsche bahn , told the mitteldeutsche zeitung that the company " is processing its nazi history in numerous projects of its own . "
she added that deutsche bahn would be bringing its own traveling exhibit to appropriate train stations . moreover , she said , " deutsche bahn ca n't allow free use of the rails in individual cases . " earnings could go to charity according to german law , anyone is allowed to use the railways and train stations - as long as they meet certain standards , and can pay the costs . minow is now trying to drum up support for his cause .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibit is based on a similar one by nazi hunter beate klarsfeld the exhibition uses letters and biographies to show how jewish children were caught up in the nazi machinery of death and taken to the gas chambers in cattle wagons . the german citizens ' initiative behind the exhibit was formed by a group of journalists , artists , lawyers and academics , in the wake of a 2003 french exhibition organized by french nazi hunters and activists beate and serge klarsfeld .
the klarsfeld exhibit , which focused on the deportation of 11,000 jewish children via rail from france to nazi death camps , was shown in french train stations . deutsche bahn denied a request to display the french exhibit in german train stations . " that 's when we got the idea to do our own exhibit , " journalist hans-ruediger minow , spokesman for the train of commemoration project , told germany 's mitteldeutsche zeitung newspaper . no exceptions to the rule , bahn says the train of commemoration group came up with the notion of creating an exhibit that would symbolically travel through the country on the very railways that were used in the deportations .
but both deutsche bahn and the german transportation ministry , which issued the transport orders under the nazi regime , failed to show interest in the project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn is charging the project to use its rails susanne kill , corporate historian for deutsche bahn , told the mitteldeutsche zeitung that the company " is processing its nazi history in numerous projects of its own . "
she added that deutsche bahn would be bringing its own traveling exhibit to appropriate train stations . moreover , she said , " deutsche bahn ca n't allow free use of the rails in individual cases . " earnings could go to charity according to german law , anyone is allowed to use the railways and train stations - as long as they meet certain standards , and can pay the costs . minow is now trying to drum up support for his cause . " we expect protests in germany and internationally until deutsche bahn and the ministry of transport see reason , " he told the leftist newspaper neues deutschland on saturday . a transportation ministry spokesman told the dpa news agency that deutsche bahn was considering to donate the income from the train of commemoration in the form of a corporate charitable grant . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the hessen premier wants to defend his seat this month and so he drops his standards .
the conservative politician has chosen to follow the route of populism and has found a subject that is being widely debated at dinner tables all across the country : juvenile delinquency among foreigners in germany . the subject is not only old and is just a minor part of a larger problem : the brutalization of society .
ignoring the larger picture , koch has demanded that violent foreign youngsters be punished harder and thrown out of the country faster . he has chosen his moment well .
the festive season over christmas and the new year is traditionally slow for news .
as a result , koch has been in the headlines for days .
everyone has heard roland koch 's opinion .
his timing is perfidious . this has not been advantageous for either the debate or any possible solution to the problem . politicians on the right and the left are pulled apart in anger over which direction to take .
koch 's loud exhortations from the middle-class conservative corner have been derided by the left-wing liberals who see a darker agenda at work : hostility to foreigners . not only a foreign problem the truth is that there is evidence that foreign youngsters and those with a migration background regularly feature in violent crime statistics .
but this is not the whole story .
the problem does not come from them being foreign .
investigations show that the lives of violent german youngsters share remarkable similarities with those of culprits with migrant backgrounds . both sets of perpetrators come from disadvantaged social groups and areas .
their stories read the same : broken homes , borderline poverty , unfinished school careers , unemployment . these are the childhood and youth experiences of young delinquents , whether they are named ali , sergei or jürgen .
the main problem in juvenile delinquency in germany is a structural one , and only secondly - or thirdly - can it be regarded as a problem among foreigners or migrants . germany 's social failings must be addressed these failed lives and the inadequacies of social structure should not be used to excuse individuals of responsibility , but it must be accepted that german integration policy has failed at its most basic levels , and that education has failed in the early stage of kindergarten . these weaknesses will not be repaired by harder punishments and deportations .
the united states of america is an example of that .
the congested prisons and draconian punishments such as the death penalty in the us have not made its towns safer . one more thing points to a dishonest and opportunist attempt by roland koch to win votes through this tactical and manipulated debate : if koch and his supporters really want to push through harder and more effective punishments for the likes of " violent ali " and " thieving sergei , " then why has the hesse premier cut 700 permanent police jobs and 80 permanent justice positions during his time in office ? this dangerous game will have a familiar and sad outcome .

the 2006 leader slipped significantly in the 2007 rankings , dropping from first to seventh place behind portugal and slovenia . " the general trend is that privacy is being extinguished in country after country , " said simon davies , director of the group .

the controversial legislation calls on phone companies and internet providers to store data for up to six months and allows police to access the information with a judicial warrant .
the law also permits telephone wiretapping in certain cases . the survey noted that the legislation had been passed despite strong objections .
this week , however , over 30,000 germans including privacy activists , civil rights groups filed a historic mass lawsuit against the controversial law .
protests were held in two german cities .
activists also seek to overturn the march 2006 european union data-retention directive that required germany to pass the legislation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an activist holds up a photo of german interior minister schäuble during a protest gisela piltz , domestic affairs spokeswoman for the opposition free-market liberal fdp party , said last week the data retention law " strikes at the foundation of our constitutional state . " the authors of the study also hit out at the fact that fingerprints had been added to germany 's biometric passports starting in november 2007 , video surveillance had been expanded despite protests and there was no legal protection for privacy at the workplace despite demands for it . the storing of telecommunications data and ever increasing demands by some german politicians to expand security measures were also singled out for criticism .
germany 's role in initiating and approving the prüm agreement , which facilitates cross-border criminal investigations among seven european countries , also got the thumbs-down . germany 's data protection measures are " decaying , " the survey concluded . best and the worst greece , romania and canada had the best records of 47 countries privacy international surveyed .

both meinhof 's ex-husband kalus-heinz röhl and her daughter bettina röhl have written about meinhof and the process of disintegration of german society beginning in the spring of 1968 that led to the formation of the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- . unravelling myths bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf has been the subject of numerous books but jutta ditfurth 's biography on meinhof , released in november , disputes many of the myths that surround meinhof 's transformation from journalist to raf terrorist . in her six years researching the biography , ditfurth , a founder of the german greens party , who has since left the stage of national politics , uncovered previously unpublished material , including documents kept in archives outside of germany . " ulrike meinhof was a much more interesting , much more multi-faceted person than i used to think , " ditfurth told dw-radio .
" she was a woman who would have had a huge amount of opportunities and prospects - if only she 'd had the good fortune to have grown up somewhere other than germany . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meinhof after her arrest in june 1972 the biography also encompasses the post-war history of west germany and the politically charged climate of the 1960s and 1970s . ditfurth examines the often forgotten social conditions , such as state violence , the biased nature of german courts , the rigidity of law-making , and the terrible conditions for political prisoners that drove the raf movement , also known as the baader-meinhof gang , in what was then a flourishing west german democracy . contaminated by terrorism ? the biography is written entirely chronological and largely devoid of commentary , but critics have said that while the information used might be factual it only tells half of the story .
even meinhof 's daughter , bettina röhl , labelled the latest biography about her mother " poisonous rubbish contaminated by terrorism . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bettina röhl has written a book about her mother while ditfurth admits the book is politically biased , she said there is a big difference between writing from a left wing point of view and endorsing anarchic terrorism . " i am a leftie from a different generation and the raf was really never my cup of tea , " she said .
" i always drew a distinct line and sharply criticised their terrorist acts . " far from helping her , ditfurth said her political credentials as former leader of the german green 's left wing and her well documented opposition to the red army faction actually made researching the biography more difficult . " i was considered an outsider and was dealt with by people in certain raf circles with a lot of scepticism , " she said .
" but still i did my best to find out all the things that i had ever wanted to know . " while ditfurth is no apologist and she suggested that meinhof 's path was wrong , she also said it was wholly understandable . ditfurth is not the first to be accused of crossing the line between writing about the raf and supporting the raf – in 2002 critics said a film about raf co-founder andreas baader " glamorized the leader .

both meinhof 's ex-husband kalus-heinz röhl and her daughter bettina röhl have written about meinhof and the process of disintegration of german society beginning in the spring of 1968 that led to the formation of the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- . unravelling myths bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf has been the subject of numerous books but jutta ditfurth 's biography on meinhof , released in november , disputes many of the myths that surround meinhof 's transformation from journalist to raf terrorist . in her six years researching the biography , ditfurth , a founder of the german greens party , who has since left the stage of national politics , uncovered previously unpublished material , including documents kept in archives outside of germany . " ulrike meinhof was a much more interesting , much more multi-faceted person than i used to think , " ditfurth told dw-radio .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bettina röhl has written a book about her mother while ditfurth admits the book is politically biased , she said there is a big difference between writing from a left wing point of view and endorsing anarchic terrorism . " i am a leftie from a different generation and the raf was really never my cup of tea , " she said .
" i always drew a distinct line and sharply criticised their terrorist acts . " far from helping her , ditfurth said her political credentials as former leader of the german green 's left wing and her well documented opposition to the red army faction actually made researching the biography more difficult .

" but still i did my best to find out all the things that i had ever wanted to know .

now , it seems , it 's not only adoring crowds who rate him highly . critics and fans alike marveled at the diminutive playmaker 's all-round performance and eye for goal before the winter break as bremen charged up the league to devour bayern munich 's early season lead to leave the league finely poised in the second half run-in .
now it seems that diego 's brilliance has n't gone unnoticed by his peers .
despite being tantalized , teased and trounced by the little dynamo , diego 's fellow players have bestowed on him the accolade of being the best outfield player in the bundesliga in the first half of the season .
the bremen star 's nine goals which have made him the league 's joint top scorer - which is not bad considering he 's a midfielder and that he has some stiff competition - helped land 44.9 percent of the 275 votes in the survey by kicker magazine .
diego beat french midfielder franck ribery of bayern munich -lrb- 21.5 percent -rrb- into second place and dutch playmaker rafael van der vaart of sv hamburg -lrb- 16.8 percent -rrb- into third .
diego looks on target to repeat his 2006/2007 achievement of being voted the best player at the end of the season by his contemporaries .
bremen maestro in world 's top four bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego , here with robinho , is rated among the world 's best he also features in the " world 's best " list voted for by the bundesliga players .
diego sits joint fourth with compatriot ronaldinho of barcelona , while fellow brazilian kaka of ac milan tops the list .
barca 's argentinean genius lionel messi and manchester united winger cristiano ronaldo separate the selecao stars , in second and third respectively .
the top german star in kicker 's bundesliga poll was bayer leverkusen midfielder simon rolfes -lrb- 4.3 percent -rrb- who came in behind van der vaart in fourth place .
in a separate vote for goalkeepers , leverkusen 's rene adler was voted the best keeper with 35.8 percent of the vote , followed by hanover 's robert enke -lrb- 28 percent -rrb- and frank rost of sv hamburg -lrb- 11.4 percent -rrb- .
promotion suprise package wins coach plaudits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : becker 's karlsruhe are fighting for a european place edmund becker of promoted sc karlsruhe was named the bundesliga 's best coach of the season so far .
while their fortunes dipped a little before the break , becker 's boys have been a consistent top five team since august when many were tipping them to struggle for survival from the first whistle .
karlsruhe 's exploits earned their coach 39.4 percent of the players ' votes .
hamburg 's huub stevens -lrb- 31.7 percent -rrb- and hanover 's dieter hecking -lrb- 12 percent -rrb- were next .
it was n't only winners who got a mention in the kicker poll .
in the coaching " losers " category , arminia bielefeld 's ernst middendorp was deemed the biggest flop so far , followed by thomas doll of borussia dortmund .
the poll , published monday , kept all votes anonymous , allowing players to return to their clubs for post-break training without fear of reprisals .
merk the world 's best ref the kicker poll comes as germany 's soccer referees were also getting congratulations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus merk remains on top of the world game after his success in 2004 and 2005 , german ref markus merk was voted the world 's best by the international federation of football history & statistics .

the 2006 leader slipped significantly in the 2007 rankings , dropping from first to seventh place behind portugal and slovenia . " the general trend is that privacy is being extinguished in country after country , " said simon davies , director of the group .
" even those countries where we expected ongoing strong privacy protection , like germany and canada , are sinking into the mire . " all citizens under suspicion according to privacy international , germany 's slide reflects a trend currently underway in all democratic societies . concern over immigration and border control has moved countries to swiftly implement database , identity and fingerprinting systems often without regard to the privacy implications for their own citizens , the study said .
the trend leads to the conclusion that all citizens , regardless of legal status , are under suspicion , it said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : overzealous monitoring places all citizens under suspicion , the study said although privacy was improving in the former communist states of eastern europe , it is worsening across western europe , the report said . the survey considered such factors as legal protections , enforcement , data-sharing , the use of biometrics and prevalence of closed-circuit cameras . experts hit out at data retention law though germany has one of the strongest sets of privacy laws in the world , the survey said , the country at the same time features one of the highest rates of monitoring telecommunications in europe . germany 's implementation of an eu data retention directive , which went into effect this year , came in for particular criticism .
the controversial legislation calls on phone companies and internet providers to store data for up to six months and allows police to access the information with a judicial warrant .
the law also permits telephone wiretapping in certain cases . the survey noted that the legislation had been passed despite strong objections .
this week , however , over 30,000 germans including privacy activists , civil rights groups filed a historic mass lawsuit against the controversial law .
protests were held in two german cities .
activists also seek to overturn the march 2006 european union data-retention directive that required germany to pass the legislation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an activist holds up a photo of german interior minister schäuble during a protest gisela piltz , domestic affairs spokeswoman for the opposition free-market liberal fdp party , said last week the data retention law " strikes at the foundation of our constitutional state . " the authors of the study also hit out at the fact that fingerprints had been added to germany 's biometric passports starting in november 2007 , video surveillance had been expanded despite protests and there was no legal protection for privacy at the workplace despite demands for it . the storing of telecommunications data and ever increasing demands by some german politicians to expand security measures were also singled out for criticism .
germany 's role in initiating and approving the prüm agreement , which facilitates cross-border criminal investigations among seven european countries , also got the thumbs-down . germany 's data protection measures are " decaying , " the survey concluded . best and the worst greece , romania and canada had the best records of 47 countries privacy international surveyed .
malaysia , russia and china ranked worst , but great britain and the united states also fell into the lowest-performing group of " endemic surveillance societies .

the 2006 leader slipped significantly in the 2007 rankings , dropping from first to seventh place behind portugal and slovenia . " the general trend is that privacy is being extinguished in country after country , " said simon davies , director of the group .
" even those countries where we expected ongoing strong privacy protection , like germany and canada , are sinking into the mire . " all citizens under suspicion according to privacy international , germany 's slide reflects a trend currently underway in all democratic societies . concern over immigration and border control has moved countries to swiftly implement database , identity and fingerprinting systems often without regard to the privacy implications for their own citizens , the study said .

the controversial legislation calls on phone companies and internet providers to store data for up to six months and allows police to access the information with a judicial warrant .
the law also permits telephone wiretapping in certain cases . the survey noted that the legislation had been passed despite strong objections .
this week , however , over 30,000 germans including privacy activists , civil rights groups filed a historic mass lawsuit against the controversial law .
protests were held in two german cities .
activists also seek to overturn the march 2006 european union data-retention directive that required germany to pass the legislation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an activist holds up a photo of german interior minister schäuble during a protest gisela piltz , domestic affairs spokeswoman for the opposition free-market liberal fdp party , said last week the data retention law " strikes at the foundation of our constitutional state . " the authors of the study also hit out at the fact that fingerprints had been added to germany 's biometric passports starting in november 2007 , video surveillance had been expanded despite protests and there was no legal protection for privacy at the workplace despite demands for it . the storing of telecommunications data and ever increasing demands by some german politicians to expand security measures were also singled out for criticism .
germany 's role in initiating and approving the prüm agreement , which facilitates cross-border criminal investigations among seven european countries , also got the thumbs-down . germany 's data protection measures are " decaying , " the survey concluded . best and the worst greece , romania and canada had the best records of 47 countries privacy international surveyed .

contergan , a sedative which contained the active ingredient thalidomide , was prescribed to pregnant women in the late 1950s , and caused their fetuses to be born with severely shortened limbs , or in some cases , no limbs at all .
around half of the 10,000 thalidomide victims worldwide were born in west germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas meyer the president of germany 's association of contergan victims , andreas meyer , says the tragedy has never been fully investigated , nor is he happy with what he says is grünenthal 's silence on the issue .
the company has never formally apologized , although in the past month , it has begun meeting with victims ' representatives seeking an improved health and financial situation for the some 2,700 thalidomide victims still living in germany .
" we want to know exactly what happened , " meyer said , adding that he was not prepared to accept an apology on its own without the appropriate compensation .
more financial aid needed , victims say thalidomide victims say a compensation fund set up in 1970 has been exhausted and that many now need extra help as arthritis and age bring pain after a lifetime of unnatural movement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's thalidomide babies were often raised and schooled apart from other children grünenthal had said that the 110 million deutsche marks -lrb- 56.3 million euros or $ 83 million at current rates -rrb- it paid into a trust in 1971 was a final settlement of all claims in germany .
the modest monthly stipends of 545 euros victims currently receive are entirely funded by the government .
among the victims ' demands is a six-fold increase in these monthly payments to an amount between 2,100 and 3,500 euros , as well as a one-time compensation payment of around 1 million euros per victim .
the victims ' representatives are planning a parliamentary campaign to make their case to both the federal government and grünenthal .
" an independent lifestyle is not possible with the current level of monthly payments , " said udo herterich of the regional thalidomide victims ' association in the state of north rhine-westphalia .
" we 're getting older , we 're suffering more from the consequences of our disabilities and we need more and more help . "
grünenthal ceo " very moved " the victims ' associations were hopeful that grünenthal would reassess its position following an initial meeting with employees last month .
grünenthal ceo sebastian wirtz described the meeting as " very moving , " and said that he and his family regretted very much the events of 50 years ago .
" even though i had n't been born at that point , as a family member of the third generation , i would like to try , together with those affected , to come to terms with the contergan tragedy , " wirtz said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from the tv drama " eine einzige tablette " -lrb- a single pill -rrb- on the weekend , various associations of german contergan victims joined forces with the international contergan alliance , made up of the national associations of great britain , spain , sweden and canada .
the british alliance has already attained monthly payments of between 2,100 and 3,500 euros for its members .

the 2006 leader slipped significantly in the 2007 rankings , dropping from first to seventh place behind portugal and slovenia . " the general trend is that privacy is being extinguished in country after country , " said simon davies , director of the group .
" even those countries where we expected ongoing strong privacy protection , like germany and canada , are sinking into the mire . " all citizens under suspicion according to privacy international , germany 's slide reflects a trend currently underway in all democratic societies . concern over immigration and border control has moved countries to swiftly implement database , identity and fingerprinting systems often without regard to the privacy implications for their own citizens , the study said .
the trend leads to the conclusion that all citizens , regardless of legal status , are under suspicion , it said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : overzealous monitoring places all citizens under suspicion , the study said although privacy was improving in the former communist states of eastern europe , it is worsening across western europe , the report said . the survey considered such factors as legal protections , enforcement , data-sharing , the use of biometrics and prevalence of closed-circuit cameras . experts hit out at data retention law though germany has one of the strongest sets of privacy laws in the world , the survey said , the country at the same time features one of the highest rates of monitoring telecommunications in europe . germany 's implementation of an eu data retention directive , which went into effect this year , came in for particular criticism .
the controversial legislation calls on phone companies and internet providers to store data for up to six months and allows police to access the information with a judicial warrant .
the law also permits telephone wiretapping in certain cases . the survey noted that the legislation had been passed despite strong objections .
this week , however , over 30,000 germans including privacy activists , civil rights groups filed a historic mass lawsuit against the controversial law .
protests were held in two german cities .
activists also seek to overturn the march 2006 european union data-retention directive that required germany to pass the legislation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an activist holds up a photo of german interior minister schäuble during a protest gisela piltz , domestic affairs spokeswoman for the opposition free-market liberal fdp party , said last week the data retention law " strikes at the foundation of our constitutional state . " the authors of the study also hit out at the fact that fingerprints had been added to germany 's biometric passports starting in november 2007 , video surveillance had been expanded despite protests and there was no legal protection for privacy at the workplace despite demands for it . the storing of telecommunications data and ever increasing demands by some german politicians to expand security measures were also singled out for criticism .
germany 's role in initiating and approving the prüm agreement , which facilitates cross-border criminal investigations among seven european countries , also got the thumbs-down . germany 's data protection measures are " decaying , " the survey concluded . best and the worst greece , romania and canada had the best records of 47 countries privacy international surveyed .
malaysia , russia and china ranked worst , but great britain and the united states also fell into the lowest-performing group of " endemic surveillance societies .

it is to reach the auschwitz death camp in poland on may 8 . but the group claims it has fought resistance from federally owned german railway concern deutsche bahn every step of the way .
representatives are particularly angry that they have to pay the same fees as any other private train operator to use the german railway tracks , despite the company 's historic involvement in the transports . deutsche bahn acknowledged on friday , jan .

a bahn spokesman said the company had to treat all customers equally . bahn 's historic responsibility the train of commemoration group argues that the bahn must face up to its historic responsibility as the transport provider to the nazis .
it said the tens of thousands of euros of tolls charged to the rolling exhibit were " in effect a boycott of this public commemoration . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibit is based on a similar one by nazi hunter beate klarsfeld the exhibition uses letters and biographies to show how jewish children were caught up in the nazi machinery of death and taken to the gas chambers in cattle wagons . the german citizens ' initiative behind the exhibit was formed by a group of journalists , artists , lawyers and academics , in the wake of a 2003 french exhibition organized by french nazi hunters and activists beate and serge klarsfeld .
the klarsfeld exhibit , which focused on the deportation of 11,000 jewish children via rail from france to nazi death camps , was shown in french train stations . deutsche bahn denied a request to display the french exhibit in german train stations . " that 's when we got the idea to do our own exhibit , " journalist hans-ruediger minow , spokesman for the train of commemoration project , told germany 's mitteldeutsche zeitung newspaper . no exceptions to the rule , bahn says the train of commemoration group came up with the notion of creating an exhibit that would symbolically travel through the country on the very railways that were used in the deportations .
but both deutsche bahn and the german transportation ministry , which issued the transport orders under the nazi regime , failed to show interest in the project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn is charging the project to use its rails susanne kill , corporate historian for deutsche bahn , told the mitteldeutsche zeitung that the company " is processing its nazi history in numerous projects of its own . "
she added that deutsche bahn would be bringing its own traveling exhibit to appropriate train stations . moreover , she said , " deutsche bahn ca n't allow free use of the rails in individual cases . " earnings could go to charity according to german law , anyone is allowed to use the railways and train stations - as long as they meet certain standards , and can pay the costs . minow is now trying to drum up support for his cause . " we expect protests in germany and internationally until deutsche bahn and the ministry of transport see reason , " he told the leftist newspaper neues deutschland on saturday . a transportation ministry spokesman told the dpa news agency that deutsche bahn was considering to donate the income from the train of commemoration in the form of a corporate charitable grant . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibit is based on a similar one by nazi hunter beate klarsfeld the exhibition uses letters and biographies to show how jewish children were caught up in the nazi machinery of death and taken to the gas chambers in cattle wagons . the german citizens ' initiative behind the exhibit was formed by a group of journalists , artists , lawyers and academics , in the wake of a 2003 french exhibition organized by french nazi hunters and activists beate and serge klarsfeld .
the klarsfeld exhibit , which focused on the deportation of 11,000 jewish children via rail from france to nazi death camps , was shown in french train stations . deutsche bahn denied a request to display the french exhibit in german train stations . " that 's when we got the idea to do our own exhibit , " journalist hans-ruediger minow , spokesman for the train of commemoration project , told germany 's mitteldeutsche zeitung newspaper . no exceptions to the rule , bahn says the train of commemoration group came up with the notion of creating an exhibit that would symbolically travel through the country on the very railways that were used in the deportations .
but both deutsche bahn and the german transportation ministry , which issued the transport orders under the nazi regime , failed to show interest in the project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn is charging the project to use its rails susanne kill , corporate historian for deutsche bahn , told the mitteldeutsche zeitung that the company " is processing its nazi history in numerous projects of its own . "
she added that deutsche bahn would be bringing its own traveling exhibit to appropriate train stations . moreover , she said , " deutsche bahn ca n't allow free use of the rails in individual cases . " earnings could go to charity according to german law , anyone is allowed to use the railways and train stations - as long as they meet certain standards , and can pay the costs . minow is now trying to drum up support for his cause . " we expect protests in germany and internationally until deutsche bahn and the ministry of transport see reason , " he told the leftist newspaper neues deutschland on saturday . a transportation ministry spokesman told the dpa news agency that deutsche bahn was considering to donate the income from the train of commemoration in the form of a corporate charitable grant . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . i agree that the us system of electing a president may not be perfect and can put too much emphasis how a person conducts himself / herself rather than an ability to run a country , but i still prefer it over the german system -lrb- i was born and raised in germany -rrb- .

but one ingredient on which everyone with a pounding head and churning stomach agrees is the hair of the dog . but what if the drunken party animal is a dog ?
a three-year-old , 40 kilogram -lrb- 88 lb -rrb- labrador retriever named bingo , to be exact ?
that question recently arose in austria , after a hunter in the mountain town of bad goisern realized his trusty pet could barely stay on its feet .
he rushed the dog to the vet , complaining that along with all the bobbing and weaving , the animal 's breath " smelled more like a beer garden than a doghouse . "
fermentation follies had bingo gone on a binge-o ?
perhaps in an effort to forget his name-o ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in holland , they make non-alchoholic beer for dogs oh , no .
the hunter 's liquor stocks were all accounted for .
what was missing , though , was a half a kilo -lrb- 1 lb . -rrb- of freshly prepared bread dough , which never quite made it from the rising board into the oven .
instead , it fermented inside the hungry hound 's stomach until - bingo ! - the dog was stinking drunk .
not fit to drive the clinic veterinarian said bingo had a blood-alcohol level of 1.6 per mille which , if he were n't a canine , would have also put him well past austria 's legal driving limit of 0.5 per mille .
-lrb- not to mention how hard it would be to take a decent drivers ' license photo . -rrb-
bingo 's owner took the situation in stride .
" some catty people say hunters are often drunk , " he said .
" in my case , it 's the dog . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheney often broke into song after a few bread rolls which leaves one to wonder about the incident , some two years ago , in which us vice president dick cheney accidentally mistook his hunting buddy for a quail and fired a round of birdshot into his chest .
the big news was cheney 's late-day admission that he had drunk a beer at lunch prior to the incident .
next time , investigators may want to probe just how many dinner rolls the veep downs with his barbecue . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : german state elections in hesse and lower saxony german ex-minister warns against own party in key state poll immigrant groups protest against koch 's justice plans germany mulls extending voting rights to foreigners german ex-chancellor criticizes xenophobic election campaign politics -pipe- 07.01.2008 state election policies reveal extent of divide in german coalition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the state polls are seen as the starting pistol for the 2009 general election campiagn state elections this year are likely to be the catalyst for open war between the country 's ruling coalition partners .
both parties are attempting to stake out their ground ahead of a 2009 federal election . as things stand , chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- counterparts appear to be barely holding their fractious relationship together .
once the voters go to the polls in state elections this year , divisions over two key policy issues could see the brittle façade finally shatter . the wrangling over a proposed national minimum wage , championed by the spd , and a conservative-led plan to crackdown on juvenile crime are the issues likely to dominate the first elections , taking place in hessen and lower saxony in late january and in hamburg in february .
bavaria will vote in september .
the results of the state elections could indicate how the general election in 2009 could play out . the way each party makes its arguments and the results of the polls in relation to the issues may drive the current wedge between the coalition partners deeper , effectively splitting the government .
the spd have set the call for a national minimum wage at the heart of their campaign in the key state polls , much to the chagrin of the cdu . minimum wage central to spd campaign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the campaign for no wage under 7.50 euros is popular among labor unionists at the launch of the campaign , peter struck , the head of the spd 's parliamentary group , announced that the social democrats intended to harness the strong public backing for a minimum hourly wage of 7.50 euros -lrb- $ 10.77 -rrb- in the three regional races . " we will start petition drives during the state elections , " struck said in december .
" then the voters will have their say .
we will make the state elections and the general election in 2009 into a referendum on the minimum wage . " the social democrats , who have been trailing the conservatives in the polls by around 10 points for several months , argue that europe 's biggest economy must ensure that wages are high enough to keep workers above the poverty level .
germany is one of the few countries in the eu without a national minimum wage , though it does have a series of industry-specific wage agreements . many leading conservative members , the chancellor included , have reacted angrily to the spd 's stance , saying that an across-the-board minimum wage would be a job killer , driving companies to eastern europe and asia where pay is lower . merkel favors industry control on wages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor has led the opposition to the proposal at the launch of the cdu election program on saturday , the party ruled out a debate on the minimum wage , defiantly putting itself in opposition to the spd 's central election theme . merkel has said that the national minimum wage is " not the right answer " and has reiterated her support for the traditional practice of leaving unions and employers to negotiate wage levels in each industry . meanwhile , the conservatives seem intent on fighting the state elections on a law and order ticket , riling the spd in the process . the cdu leadership has called for stiffer penalties for juveniles convicted of violent crimes , proposing an increase in the maximum sentence for young people convicted of serious offences from 10 to 15 years . the party has also called for a " warning shot " period of detention for those given probation for violent crimes and the introduction of boot camps where young offenders could be sent for re-education .
under the new cdu proposals , rules for deporting foreigners convicted of serious crimes would also be eased . conservatives react to upsurge in violent crime bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violent crime has been grabbing the headlines " i think ' warning-shot arrests ' -lsb- short periods in detention -rsb- and boot camps could indeed be a sensible supplement to current laws , " merkel said .
" it could turn young people around so they do not wind up in prison . " the proposals , in line with those put forward by roland koch , the under-pressure cdu premier of hesse , who is seeking a third term of office on jan .

but one ingredient on which everyone with a pounding head and churning stomach agrees is the hair of the dog . but what if the drunken party animal is a dog ?
a three-year-old , 40 kilogram -lrb- 88 lb -rrb- labrador retriever named bingo , to be exact ?
that question recently arose in austria , after a hunter in the mountain town of bad goisern realized his trusty pet could barely stay on its feet .
he rushed the dog to the vet , complaining that along with all the bobbing and weaving , the animal 's breath " smelled more like a beer garden than a doghouse . "
fermentation follies had bingo gone on a binge-o ?
perhaps in an effort to forget his name-o ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in holland , they make non-alchoholic beer for dogs oh , no .
the hunter 's liquor stocks were all accounted for .
what was missing , though , was a half a kilo -lrb- 1 lb . -rrb- of freshly prepared bread dough , which never quite made it from the rising board into the oven .
instead , it fermented inside the hungry hound 's stomach until - bingo ! - the dog was stinking drunk .
not fit to drive the clinic veterinarian said bingo had a blood-alcohol level of 1.6 per mille which , if he were n't a canine , would have also put him well past austria 's legal driving limit of 0.5 per mille .
-lrb- not to mention how hard it would be to take a decent drivers ' license photo . -rrb-
bingo 's owner took the situation in stride .
" some catty people say hunters are often drunk , " he said .
" in my case , it 's the dog . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheney often broke into song after a few bread rolls which leaves one to wonder about the incident , some two years ago , in which us vice president dick cheney accidentally mistook his hunting buddy for a quail and fired a round of birdshot into his chest .
the big news was cheney 's late-day admission that he had drunk a beer at lunch prior to the incident .
next time , investigators may want to probe just how many dinner rolls the veep downs with his barbecue . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 2006 leader slipped significantly in the 2007 rankings , dropping from first to seventh place behind portugal and slovenia . " the general trend is that privacy is being extinguished in country after country , " said simon davies , director of the group .
" even those countries where we expected ongoing strong privacy protection , like germany and canada , are sinking into the mire . " all citizens under suspicion according to privacy international , germany 's slide reflects a trend currently underway in all democratic societies . concern over immigration and border control has moved countries to swiftly implement database , identity and fingerprinting systems often without regard to the privacy implications for their own citizens , the study said .
the trend leads to the conclusion that all citizens , regardless of legal status , are under suspicion , it said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : overzealous monitoring places all citizens under suspicion , the study said although privacy was improving in the former communist states of eastern europe , it is worsening across western europe , the report said . the survey considered such factors as legal protections , enforcement , data-sharing , the use of biometrics and prevalence of closed-circuit cameras . experts hit out at data retention law though germany has one of the strongest sets of privacy laws in the world , the survey said , the country at the same time features one of the highest rates of monitoring telecommunications in europe . germany 's implementation of an eu data retention directive , which went into effect this year , came in for particular criticism .
the controversial legislation calls on phone companies and internet providers to store data for up to six months and allows police to access the information with a judicial warrant .
the law also permits telephone wiretapping in certain cases . the survey noted that the legislation had been passed despite strong objections .
this week , however , over 30,000 germans including privacy activists , civil rights groups filed a historic mass lawsuit against the controversial law .
protests were held in two german cities .
activists also seek to overturn the march 2006 european union data-retention directive that required germany to pass the legislation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an activist holds up a photo of german interior minister schäuble during a protest gisela piltz , domestic affairs spokeswoman for the opposition free-market liberal fdp party , said last week the data retention law " strikes at the foundation of our constitutional state . " the authors of the study also hit out at the fact that fingerprints had been added to germany 's biometric passports starting in november 2007 , video surveillance had been expanded despite protests and there was no legal protection for privacy at the workplace despite demands for it . the storing of telecommunications data and ever increasing demands by some german politicians to expand security measures were also singled out for criticism .
germany 's role in initiating and approving the prüm agreement , which facilitates cross-border criminal investigations among seven european countries , also got the thumbs-down . germany 's data protection measures are " decaying , " the survey concluded . best and the worst greece , romania and canada had the best records of 47 countries privacy international surveyed .

both meinhof 's ex-husband kalus-heinz röhl and her daughter bettina röhl have written about meinhof and the process of disintegration of german society beginning in the spring of 1968 that led to the formation of the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- . unravelling myths bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf has been the subject of numerous books but jutta ditfurth 's biography on meinhof , released in november , disputes many of the myths that surround meinhof 's transformation from journalist to raf terrorist . in her six years researching the biography , ditfurth , a founder of the german greens party , who has since left the stage of national politics , uncovered previously unpublished material , including documents kept in archives outside of germany . " ulrike meinhof was a much more interesting , much more multi-faceted person than i used to think , " ditfurth told dw-radio .
" she was a woman who would have had a huge amount of opportunities and prospects - if only she 'd had the good fortune to have grown up somewhere other than germany . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meinhof after her arrest in june 1972 the biography also encompasses the post-war history of west germany and the politically charged climate of the 1960s and 1970s . ditfurth examines the often forgotten social conditions , such as state violence , the biased nature of german courts , the rigidity of law-making , and the terrible conditions for political prisoners that drove the raf movement , also known as the baader-meinhof gang , in what was then a flourishing west german democracy . contaminated by terrorism ? the biography is written entirely chronological and largely devoid of commentary , but critics have said that while the information used might be factual it only tells half of the story .

" i always drew a distinct line and sharply criticised their terrorist acts . " far from helping her , ditfurth said her political credentials as former leader of the german green 's left wing and her well documented opposition to the red army faction actually made researching the biography more difficult .

" but still i did my best to find out all the things that i had ever wanted to know .

contergan , a sedative which contained the active ingredient thalidomide , was prescribed to pregnant women in the late 1950s , and caused their fetuses to be born with severely shortened limbs , or in some cases , no limbs at all .
around half of the 10,000 thalidomide victims worldwide were born in west germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas meyer the president of germany 's association of contergan victims , andreas meyer , says the tragedy has never been fully investigated , nor is he happy with what he says is grünenthal 's silence on the issue .
the company has never formally apologized , although in the past month , it has begun meeting with victims ' representatives seeking an improved health and financial situation for the some 2,700 thalidomide victims still living in germany .
" we want to know exactly what happened , " meyer said , adding that he was not prepared to accept an apology on its own without the appropriate compensation .
more financial aid needed , victims say thalidomide victims say a compensation fund set up in 1970 has been exhausted and that many now need extra help as arthritis and age bring pain after a lifetime of unnatural movement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's thalidomide babies were often raised and schooled apart from other children grünenthal had said that the 110 million deutsche marks -lrb- 56.3 million euros or $ 83 million at current rates -rrb- it paid into a trust in 1971 was a final settlement of all claims in germany .
the modest monthly stipends of 545 euros victims currently receive are entirely funded by the government .
among the victims ' demands is a six-fold increase in these monthly payments to an amount between 2,100 and 3,500 euros , as well as a one-time compensation payment of around 1 million euros per victim .
the victims ' representatives are planning a parliamentary campaign to make their case to both the federal government and grünenthal .
" an independent lifestyle is not possible with the current level of monthly payments , " said udo herterich of the regional thalidomide victims ' association in the state of north rhine-westphalia .
" we 're getting older , we 're suffering more from the consequences of our disabilities and we need more and more help . "
grünenthal ceo " very moved " the victims ' associations were hopeful that grünenthal would reassess its position following an initial meeting with employees last month .
grünenthal ceo sebastian wirtz described the meeting as " very moving , " and said that he and his family regretted very much the events of 50 years ago .
" even though i had n't been born at that point , as a family member of the third generation , i would like to try , together with those affected , to come to terms with the contergan tragedy , " wirtz said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from the tv drama " eine einzige tablette " -lrb- a single pill -rrb- on the weekend , various associations of german contergan victims joined forces with the international contergan alliance , made up of the national associations of great britain , spain , sweden and canada .
the british alliance has already attained monthly payments of between 2,100 and 3,500 euros for its members .

now , it seems , it 's not only adoring crowds who rate him highly . critics and fans alike marveled at the diminutive playmaker 's all-round performance and eye for goal before the winter break as bremen charged up the league to devour bayern munich 's early season lead to leave the league finely poised in the second half run-in .
now it seems that diego 's brilliance has n't gone unnoticed by his peers .
despite being tantalized , teased and trounced by the little dynamo , diego 's fellow players have bestowed on him the accolade of being the best outfield player in the bundesliga in the first half of the season .
the bremen star 's nine goals which have made him the league 's joint top scorer - which is not bad considering he 's a midfielder and that he has some stiff competition - helped land 44.9 percent of the 275 votes in the survey by kicker magazine .
diego beat french midfielder franck ribery of bayern munich -lrb- 21.5 percent -rrb- into second place and dutch playmaker rafael van der vaart of sv hamburg -lrb- 16.8 percent -rrb- into third .
diego looks on target to repeat his 2006/2007 achievement of being voted the best player at the end of the season by his contemporaries .
bremen maestro in world 's top four bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego , here with robinho , is rated among the world 's best he also features in the " world 's best " list voted for by the bundesliga players .
diego sits joint fourth with compatriot ronaldinho of barcelona , while fellow brazilian kaka of ac milan tops the list .
barca 's argentinean genius lionel messi and manchester united winger cristiano ronaldo separate the selecao stars , in second and third respectively .
the top german star in kicker 's bundesliga poll was bayer leverkusen midfielder simon rolfes -lrb- 4.3 percent -rrb- who came in behind van der vaart in fourth place .
in a separate vote for goalkeepers , leverkusen 's rene adler was voted the best keeper with 35.8 percent of the vote , followed by hanover 's robert enke -lrb- 28 percent -rrb- and frank rost of sv hamburg -lrb- 11.4 percent -rrb- .
promotion suprise package wins coach plaudits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : becker 's karlsruhe are fighting for a european place edmund becker of promoted sc karlsruhe was named the bundesliga 's best coach of the season so far .
while their fortunes dipped a little before the break , becker 's boys have been a consistent top five team since august when many were tipping them to struggle for survival from the first whistle .
karlsruhe 's exploits earned their coach 39.4 percent of the players ' votes .
hamburg 's huub stevens -lrb- 31.7 percent -rrb- and hanover 's dieter hecking -lrb- 12 percent -rrb- were next .
it was n't only winners who got a mention in the kicker poll .
in the coaching " losers " category , arminia bielefeld 's ernst middendorp was deemed the biggest flop so far , followed by thomas doll of borussia dortmund .
the poll , published monday , kept all votes anonymous , allowing players to return to their clubs for post-break training without fear of reprisals .
merk the world 's best ref the kicker poll comes as germany 's soccer referees were also getting congratulations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus merk remains on top of the world game after his success in 2004 and 2005 , german ref markus merk was voted the world 's best by the international federation of football history & statistics .
compatriot herbert fandel was second and slovakia 's lubos michel third .
merk officiated at the world cup in japan and korea in 2002 and germany in 2006 .
he also reffed the euro 2004 final between greece and portugal , along with 2003 champions league final .
he is also a six-time bundesliga referee of the year winner and one of the most respected officials in the game . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

contergan , a sedative which contained the active ingredient thalidomide , was prescribed to pregnant women in the late 1950s , and caused their fetuses to be born with severely shortened limbs , or in some cases , no limbs at all .
around half of the 10,000 thalidomide victims worldwide were born in west germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas meyer the president of germany 's association of contergan victims , andreas meyer , says the tragedy has never been fully investigated , nor is he happy with what he says is grünenthal 's silence on the issue .
the company has never formally apologized , although in the past month , it has begun meeting with victims ' representatives seeking an improved health and financial situation for the some 2,700 thalidomide victims still living in germany .
" we want to know exactly what happened , " meyer said , adding that he was not prepared to accept an apology on its own without the appropriate compensation .
more financial aid needed , victims say thalidomide victims say a compensation fund set up in 1970 has been exhausted and that many now need extra help as arthritis and age bring pain after a lifetime of unnatural movement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's thalidomide babies were often raised and schooled apart from other children grünenthal had said that the 110 million deutsche marks -lrb- 56.3 million euros or $ 83 million at current rates -rrb- it paid into a trust in 1971 was a final settlement of all claims in germany .
the modest monthly stipends of 545 euros victims currently receive are entirely funded by the government .
among the victims ' demands is a six-fold increase in these monthly payments to an amount between 2,100 and 3,500 euros , as well as a one-time compensation payment of around 1 million euros per victim .
the victims ' representatives are planning a parliamentary campaign to make their case to both the federal government and grünenthal .
" an independent lifestyle is not possible with the current level of monthly payments , " said udo herterich of the regional thalidomide victims ' association in the state of north rhine-westphalia .
" we 're getting older , we 're suffering more from the consequences of our disabilities and we need more and more help . "
grünenthal ceo " very moved " the victims ' associations were hopeful that grünenthal would reassess its position following an initial meeting with employees last month .
grünenthal ceo sebastian wirtz described the meeting as " very moving , " and said that he and his family regretted very much the events of 50 years ago .
" even though i had n't been born at that point , as a family member of the third generation , i would like to try , together with those affected , to come to terms with the contergan tragedy , " wirtz said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from the tv drama " eine einzige tablette " -lrb- a single pill -rrb- on the weekend , various associations of german contergan victims joined forces with the international contergan alliance , made up of the national associations of great britain , spain , sweden and canada .

the modest monthly stipends of 545 euros victims currently receive are entirely funded by the government .
among the victims ' demands is a six-fold increase in these monthly payments to an amount between 2,100 and 3,500 euros , as well as a one-time compensation payment of around 1 million euros per victim .
the victims ' representatives are planning a parliamentary campaign to make their case to both the federal government and grünenthal .
" an independent lifestyle is not possible with the current level of monthly payments , " said udo herterich of the regional thalidomide victims ' association in the state of north rhine-westphalia .
" we 're getting older , we 're suffering more from the consequences of our disabilities and we need more and more help . "
grünenthal ceo " very moved " the victims ' associations were hopeful that grünenthal would reassess its position following an initial meeting with employees last month .
grünenthal ceo sebastian wirtz described the meeting as " very moving , " and said that he and his family regretted very much the events of 50 years ago .
" even though i had n't been born at that point , as a family member of the third generation , i would like to try , together with those affected , to come to terms with the contergan tragedy , " wirtz said .

the 2006 leader slipped significantly in the 2007 rankings , dropping from first to seventh place behind portugal and slovenia . " the general trend is that privacy is being extinguished in country after country , " said simon davies , director of the group .
" even those countries where we expected ongoing strong privacy protection , like germany and canada , are sinking into the mire . " all citizens under suspicion according to privacy international , germany 's slide reflects a trend currently underway in all democratic societies . concern over immigration and border control has moved countries to swiftly implement database , identity and fingerprinting systems often without regard to the privacy implications for their own citizens , the study said .
the trend leads to the conclusion that all citizens , regardless of legal status , are under suspicion , it said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : overzealous monitoring places all citizens under suspicion , the study said although privacy was improving in the former communist states of eastern europe , it is worsening across western europe , the report said . the survey considered such factors as legal protections , enforcement , data-sharing , the use of biometrics and prevalence of closed-circuit cameras . experts hit out at data retention law though germany has one of the strongest sets of privacy laws in the world , the survey said , the country at the same time features one of the highest rates of monitoring telecommunications in europe . germany 's implementation of an eu data retention directive , which went into effect this year , came in for particular criticism .
the controversial legislation calls on phone companies and internet providers to store data for up to six months and allows police to access the information with a judicial warrant .
the law also permits telephone wiretapping in certain cases . the survey noted that the legislation had been passed despite strong objections .
this week , however , over 30,000 germans including privacy activists , civil rights groups filed a historic mass lawsuit against the controversial law .
protests were held in two german cities .
activists also seek to overturn the march 2006 european union data-retention directive that required germany to pass the legislation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an activist holds up a photo of german interior minister schäuble during a protest gisela piltz , domestic affairs spokeswoman for the opposition free-market liberal fdp party , said last week the data retention law " strikes at the foundation of our constitutional state . " the authors of the study also hit out at the fact that fingerprints had been added to germany 's biometric passports starting in november 2007 , video surveillance had been expanded despite protests and there was no legal protection for privacy at the workplace despite demands for it . the storing of telecommunications data and ever increasing demands by some german politicians to expand security measures were also singled out for criticism .
germany 's role in initiating and approving the prüm agreement , which facilitates cross-border criminal investigations among seven european countries , also got the thumbs-down . germany 's data protection measures are " decaying , " the survey concluded . best and the worst greece , romania and canada had the best records of 47 countries privacy international surveyed .

the hessen premier wants to defend his seat this month and so he drops his standards .
the conservative politician has chosen to follow the route of populism and has found a subject that is being widely debated at dinner tables all across the country : juvenile delinquency among foreigners in germany . the subject is not only old and is just a minor part of a larger problem : the brutalization of society .
ignoring the larger picture , koch has demanded that violent foreign youngsters be punished harder and thrown out of the country faster . he has chosen his moment well .
the festive season over christmas and the new year is traditionally slow for news .
as a result , koch has been in the headlines for days .
everyone has heard roland koch 's opinion .
his timing is perfidious . this has not been advantageous for either the debate or any possible solution to the problem . politicians on the right and the left are pulled apart in anger over which direction to take .
koch 's loud exhortations from the middle-class conservative corner have been derided by the left-wing liberals who see a darker agenda at work : hostility to foreigners . not only a foreign problem the truth is that there is evidence that foreign youngsters and those with a migration background regularly feature in violent crime statistics .
but this is not the whole story .
the problem does not come from them being foreign .
investigations show that the lives of violent german youngsters share remarkable similarities with those of culprits with migrant backgrounds . both sets of perpetrators come from disadvantaged social groups and areas .
their stories read the same : broken homes , borderline poverty , unfinished school careers , unemployment . these are the childhood and youth experiences of young delinquents , whether they are named ali , sergei or jürgen .
the main problem in juvenile delinquency in germany is a structural one , and only secondly - or thirdly - can it be regarded as a problem among foreigners or migrants . germany 's social failings must be addressed these failed lives and the inadequacies of social structure should not be used to excuse individuals of responsibility , but it must be accepted that german integration policy has failed at its most basic levels , and that education has failed in the early stage of kindergarten . these weaknesses will not be repaired by harder punishments and deportations .
the united states of america is an example of that .
the congested prisons and draconian punishments such as the death penalty in the us have not made its towns safer . one more thing points to a dishonest and opportunist attempt by roland koch to win votes through this tactical and manipulated debate : if koch and his supporters really want to push through harder and more effective punishments for the likes of " violent ali " and " thieving sergei , " then why has the hesse premier cut 700 permanent police jobs and 80 permanent justice positions during his time in office ? this dangerous game will have a familiar and sad outcome .

the hessen premier wants to defend his seat this month and so he drops his standards .
the conservative politician has chosen to follow the route of populism and has found a subject that is being widely debated at dinner tables all across the country : juvenile delinquency among foreigners in germany . the subject is not only old and is just a minor part of a larger problem : the brutalization of society .
ignoring the larger picture , koch has demanded that violent foreign youngsters be punished harder and thrown out of the country faster . he has chosen his moment well .
the festive season over christmas and the new year is traditionally slow for news .
as a result , koch has been in the headlines for days .
everyone has heard roland koch 's opinion .
his timing is perfidious . this has not been advantageous for either the debate or any possible solution to the problem . politicians on the right and the left are pulled apart in anger over which direction to take .
koch 's loud exhortations from the middle-class conservative corner have been derided by the left-wing liberals who see a darker agenda at work : hostility to foreigners . not only a foreign problem the truth is that there is evidence that foreign youngsters and those with a migration background regularly feature in violent crime statistics .
but this is not the whole story .
the problem does not come from them being foreign .
investigations show that the lives of violent german youngsters share remarkable similarities with those of culprits with migrant backgrounds . both sets of perpetrators come from disadvantaged social groups and areas .
their stories read the same : broken homes , borderline poverty , unfinished school careers , unemployment . these are the childhood and youth experiences of young delinquents , whether they are named ali , sergei or jürgen .
the main problem in juvenile delinquency in germany is a structural one , and only secondly - or thirdly - can it be regarded as a problem among foreigners or migrants . germany 's social failings must be addressed these failed lives and the inadequacies of social structure should not be used to excuse individuals of responsibility , but it must be accepted that german integration policy has failed at its most basic levels , and that education has failed in the early stage of kindergarten . these weaknesses will not be repaired by harder punishments and deportations .
the united states of america is an example of that .
the congested prisons and draconian punishments such as the death penalty in the us have not made its towns safer . one more thing points to a dishonest and opportunist attempt by roland koch to win votes through this tactical and manipulated debate : if koch and his supporters really want to push through harder and more effective punishments for the likes of " violent ali " and " thieving sergei , " then why has the hesse premier cut 700 permanent police jobs and 80 permanent justice positions during his time in office ? this dangerous game will have a familiar and sad outcome .

it is to reach the auschwitz death camp in poland on may 8 . but the group claims it has fought resistance from federally owned german railway concern deutsche bahn every step of the way .
representatives are particularly angry that they have to pay the same fees as any other private train operator to use the german railway tracks , despite the company 's historic involvement in the transports . deutsche bahn acknowledged on friday , jan .
4 , that it was charging the group the same toll for track use as other private train operators .
a bahn spokesman said the company had to treat all customers equally . bahn 's historic responsibility the train of commemoration group argues that the bahn must face up to its historic responsibility as the transport provider to the nazis .
it said the tens of thousands of euros of tolls charged to the rolling exhibit were " in effect a boycott of this public commemoration . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibit is based on a similar one by nazi hunter beate klarsfeld the exhibition uses letters and biographies to show how jewish children were caught up in the nazi machinery of death and taken to the gas chambers in cattle wagons . the german citizens ' initiative behind the exhibit was formed by a group of journalists , artists , lawyers and academics , in the wake of a 2003 french exhibition organized by french nazi hunters and activists beate and serge klarsfeld .
the klarsfeld exhibit , which focused on the deportation of 11,000 jewish children via rail from france to nazi death camps , was shown in french train stations . deutsche bahn denied a request to display the french exhibit in german train stations . " that 's when we got the idea to do our own exhibit , " journalist hans-ruediger minow , spokesman for the train of commemoration project , told germany 's mitteldeutsche zeitung newspaper . no exceptions to the rule , bahn says the train of commemoration group came up with the notion of creating an exhibit that would symbolically travel through the country on the very railways that were used in the deportations .
but both deutsche bahn and the german transportation ministry , which issued the transport orders under the nazi regime , failed to show interest in the project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn is charging the project to use its rails susanne kill , corporate historian for deutsche bahn , told the mitteldeutsche zeitung that the company " is processing its nazi history in numerous projects of its own . "
she added that deutsche bahn would be bringing its own traveling exhibit to appropriate train stations . moreover , she said , " deutsche bahn ca n't allow free use of the rails in individual cases . " earnings could go to charity according to german law , anyone is allowed to use the railways and train stations - as long as they meet certain standards , and can pay the costs . minow is now trying to drum up support for his cause . " we expect protests in germany and internationally until deutsche bahn and the ministry of transport see reason , " he told the leftist newspaper neues deutschland on saturday . a transportation ministry spokesman told the dpa news agency that deutsche bahn was considering to donate the income from the train of commemoration in the form of a corporate charitable grant . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is to reach the auschwitz death camp in poland on may 8 . but the group claims it has fought resistance from federally owned german railway concern deutsche bahn every step of the way .
representatives are particularly angry that they have to pay the same fees as any other private train operator to use the german railway tracks , despite the company 's historic involvement in the transports . deutsche bahn acknowledged on friday , jan .
4 , that it was charging the group the same toll for track use as other private train operators .
a bahn spokesman said the company had to treat all customers equally . bahn 's historic responsibility the train of commemoration group argues that the bahn must face up to its historic responsibility as the transport provider to the nazis .
it said the tens of thousands of euros of tolls charged to the rolling exhibit were " in effect a boycott of this public commemoration . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibit is based on a similar one by nazi hunter beate klarsfeld the exhibition uses letters and biographies to show how jewish children were caught up in the nazi machinery of death and taken to the gas chambers in cattle wagons . the german citizens ' initiative behind the exhibit was formed by a group of journalists , artists , lawyers and academics , in the wake of a 2003 french exhibition organized by french nazi hunters and activists beate and serge klarsfeld .
the klarsfeld exhibit , which focused on the deportation of 11,000 jewish children via rail from france to nazi death camps , was shown in french train stations . deutsche bahn denied a request to display the french exhibit in german train stations . " that 's when we got the idea to do our own exhibit , " journalist hans-ruediger minow , spokesman for the train of commemoration project , told germany 's mitteldeutsche zeitung newspaper . no exceptions to the rule , bahn says the train of commemoration group came up with the notion of creating an exhibit that would symbolically travel through the country on the very railways that were used in the deportations .
but both deutsche bahn and the german transportation ministry , which issued the transport orders under the nazi regime , failed to show interest in the project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn is charging the project to use its rails susanne kill , corporate historian for deutsche bahn , told the mitteldeutsche zeitung that the company " is processing its nazi history in numerous projects of its own . "
she added that deutsche bahn would be bringing its own traveling exhibit to appropriate train stations . moreover , she said , " deutsche bahn ca n't allow free use of the rails in individual cases . " earnings could go to charity according to german law , anyone is allowed to use the railways and train stations - as long as they meet certain standards , and can pay the costs . minow is now trying to drum up support for his cause . " we expect protests in germany and internationally until deutsche bahn and the ministry of transport see reason , " he told the leftist newspaper neues deutschland on saturday . a transportation ministry spokesman told the dpa news agency that deutsche bahn was considering to donate the income from the train of commemoration in the form of a corporate charitable grant . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 2006 leader slipped significantly in the 2007 rankings , dropping from first to seventh place behind portugal and slovenia . " the general trend is that privacy is being extinguished in country after country , " said simon davies , director of the group .
" even those countries where we expected ongoing strong privacy protection , like germany and canada , are sinking into the mire . " all citizens under suspicion according to privacy international , germany 's slide reflects a trend currently underway in all democratic societies . concern over immigration and border control has moved countries to swiftly implement database , identity and fingerprinting systems often without regard to the privacy implications for their own citizens , the study said .
the trend leads to the conclusion that all citizens , regardless of legal status , are under suspicion , it said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : overzealous monitoring places all citizens under suspicion , the study said although privacy was improving in the former communist states of eastern europe , it is worsening across western europe , the report said . the survey considered such factors as legal protections , enforcement , data-sharing , the use of biometrics and prevalence of closed-circuit cameras . experts hit out at data retention law though germany has one of the strongest sets of privacy laws in the world , the survey said , the country at the same time features one of the highest rates of monitoring telecommunications in europe . germany 's implementation of an eu data retention directive , which went into effect this year , came in for particular criticism .
the controversial legislation calls on phone companies and internet providers to store data for up to six months and allows police to access the information with a judicial warrant .
the law also permits telephone wiretapping in certain cases . the survey noted that the legislation had been passed despite strong objections .
this week , however , over 30,000 germans including privacy activists , civil rights groups filed a historic mass lawsuit against the controversial law .
protests were held in two german cities .
activists also seek to overturn the march 2006 european union data-retention directive that required germany to pass the legislation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an activist holds up a photo of german interior minister schäuble during a protest gisela piltz , domestic affairs spokeswoman for the opposition free-market liberal fdp party , said last week the data retention law " strikes at the foundation of our constitutional state . " the authors of the study also hit out at the fact that fingerprints had been added to germany 's biometric passports starting in november 2007 , video surveillance had been expanded despite protests and there was no legal protection for privacy at the workplace despite demands for it . the storing of telecommunications data and ever increasing demands by some german politicians to expand security measures were also singled out for criticism .
germany 's role in initiating and approving the prüm agreement , which facilitates cross-border criminal investigations among seven european countries , also got the thumbs-down . germany 's data protection measures are " decaying , " the survey concluded . best and the worst greece , romania and canada had the best records of 47 countries privacy international surveyed .

the 2006 leader slipped significantly in the 2007 rankings , dropping from first to seventh place behind portugal and slovenia . " the general trend is that privacy is being extinguished in country after country , " said simon davies , director of the group .
" even those countries where we expected ongoing strong privacy protection , like germany and canada , are sinking into the mire . " all citizens under suspicion according to privacy international , germany 's slide reflects a trend currently underway in all democratic societies . concern over immigration and border control has moved countries to swiftly implement database , identity and fingerprinting systems often without regard to the privacy implications for their own citizens , the study said .
the trend leads to the conclusion that all citizens , regardless of legal status , are under suspicion , it said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : overzealous monitoring places all citizens under suspicion , the study said although privacy was improving in the former communist states of eastern europe , it is worsening across western europe , the report said . the survey considered such factors as legal protections , enforcement , data-sharing , the use of biometrics and prevalence of closed-circuit cameras . experts hit out at data retention law though germany has one of the strongest sets of privacy laws in the world , the survey said , the country at the same time features one of the highest rates of monitoring telecommunications in europe . germany 's implementation of an eu data retention directive , which went into effect this year , came in for particular criticism .
the controversial legislation calls on phone companies and internet providers to store data for up to six months and allows police to access the information with a judicial warrant .
the law also permits telephone wiretapping in certain cases . the survey noted that the legislation had been passed despite strong objections .
this week , however , over 30,000 germans including privacy activists , civil rights groups filed a historic mass lawsuit against the controversial law .
protests were held in two german cities .
activists also seek to overturn the march 2006 european union data-retention directive that required germany to pass the legislation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an activist holds up a photo of german interior minister schäuble during a protest gisela piltz , domestic affairs spokeswoman for the opposition free-market liberal fdp party , said last week the data retention law " strikes at the foundation of our constitutional state . " the authors of the study also hit out at the fact that fingerprints had been added to germany 's biometric passports starting in november 2007 , video surveillance had been expanded despite protests and there was no legal protection for privacy at the workplace despite demands for it . the storing of telecommunications data and ever increasing demands by some german politicians to expand security measures were also singled out for criticism .
germany 's role in initiating and approving the prüm agreement , which facilitates cross-border criminal investigations among seven european countries , also got the thumbs-down . germany 's data protection measures are " decaying , " the survey concluded . best and the worst greece , romania and canada had the best records of 47 countries privacy international surveyed .

both meinhof 's ex-husband kalus-heinz röhl and her daughter bettina röhl have written about meinhof and the process of disintegration of german society beginning in the spring of 1968 that led to the formation of the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- . unravelling myths bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf has been the subject of numerous books but jutta ditfurth 's biography on meinhof , released in november , disputes many of the myths that surround meinhof 's transformation from journalist to raf terrorist . in her six years researching the biography , ditfurth , a founder of the german greens party , who has since left the stage of national politics , uncovered previously unpublished material , including documents kept in archives outside of germany . " ulrike meinhof was a much more interesting , much more multi-faceted person than i used to think , " ditfurth told dw-radio .
" she was a woman who would have had a huge amount of opportunities and prospects - if only she 'd had the good fortune to have grown up somewhere other than germany . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meinhof after her arrest in june 1972 the biography also encompasses the post-war history of west germany and the politically charged climate of the 1960s and 1970s . ditfurth examines the often forgotten social conditions , such as state violence , the biased nature of german courts , the rigidity of law-making , and the terrible conditions for political prisoners that drove the raf movement , also known as the baader-meinhof gang , in what was then a flourishing west german democracy . contaminated by terrorism ? the biography is written entirely chronological and largely devoid of commentary , but critics have said that while the information used might be factual it only tells half of the story .
even meinhof 's daughter , bettina röhl , labelled the latest biography about her mother " poisonous rubbish contaminated by terrorism . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bettina röhl has written a book about her mother while ditfurth admits the book is politically biased , she said there is a big difference between writing from a left wing point of view and endorsing anarchic terrorism . " i am a leftie from a different generation and the raf was really never my cup of tea , " she said .
" i always drew a distinct line and sharply criticised their terrorist acts . " far from helping her , ditfurth said her political credentials as former leader of the german green 's left wing and her well documented opposition to the red army faction actually made researching the biography more difficult . " i was considered an outsider and was dealt with by people in certain raf circles with a lot of scepticism , " she said .
" but still i did my best to find out all the things that i had ever wanted to know . " while ditfurth is no apologist and she suggested that meinhof 's path was wrong , she also said it was wholly understandable . ditfurth is not the first to be accused of crossing the line between writing about the raf and supporting the raf – in 2002 critics said a film about raf co-founder andreas baader " glamorized the leader .

it is to reach the auschwitz death camp in poland on may 8 . but the group claims it has fought resistance from federally owned german railway concern deutsche bahn every step of the way .
representatives are particularly angry that they have to pay the same fees as any other private train operator to use the german railway tracks , despite the company 's historic involvement in the transports . deutsche bahn acknowledged on friday , jan .
4 , that it was charging the group the same toll for track use as other private train operators .
a bahn spokesman said the company had to treat all customers equally . bahn 's historic responsibility the train of commemoration group argues that the bahn must face up to its historic responsibility as the transport provider to the nazis .
it said the tens of thousands of euros of tolls charged to the rolling exhibit were " in effect a boycott of this public commemoration . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibit is based on a similar one by nazi hunter beate klarsfeld the exhibition uses letters and biographies to show how jewish children were caught up in the nazi machinery of death and taken to the gas chambers in cattle wagons . the german citizens ' initiative behind the exhibit was formed by a group of journalists , artists , lawyers and academics , in the wake of a 2003 french exhibition organized by french nazi hunters and activists beate and serge klarsfeld .
the klarsfeld exhibit , which focused on the deportation of 11,000 jewish children via rail from france to nazi death camps , was shown in french train stations . deutsche bahn denied a request to display the french exhibit in german train stations . " that 's when we got the idea to do our own exhibit , " journalist hans-ruediger minow , spokesman for the train of commemoration project , told germany 's mitteldeutsche zeitung newspaper . no exceptions to the rule , bahn says the train of commemoration group came up with the notion of creating an exhibit that would symbolically travel through the country on the very railways that were used in the deportations .
but both deutsche bahn and the german transportation ministry , which issued the transport orders under the nazi regime , failed to show interest in the project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn is charging the project to use its rails susanne kill , corporate historian for deutsche bahn , told the mitteldeutsche zeitung that the company " is processing its nazi history in numerous projects of its own . "
she added that deutsche bahn would be bringing its own traveling exhibit to appropriate train stations . moreover , she said , " deutsche bahn ca n't allow free use of the rails in individual cases . " earnings could go to charity according to german law , anyone is allowed to use the railways and train stations - as long as they meet certain standards , and can pay the costs . minow is now trying to drum up support for his cause . " we expect protests in germany and internationally until deutsche bahn and the ministry of transport see reason , " he told the leftist newspaper neues deutschland on saturday . a transportation ministry spokesman told the dpa news agency that deutsche bahn was considering to donate the income from the train of commemoration in the form of a corporate charitable grant . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is to reach the auschwitz death camp in poland on may 8 . but the group claims it has fought resistance from federally owned german railway concern deutsche bahn every step of the way .
representatives are particularly angry that they have to pay the same fees as any other private train operator to use the german railway tracks , despite the company 's historic involvement in the transports . deutsche bahn acknowledged on friday , jan .

a bahn spokesman said the company had to treat all customers equally . bahn 's historic responsibility the train of commemoration group argues that the bahn must face up to its historic responsibility as the transport provider to the nazis .
it said the tens of thousands of euros of tolls charged to the rolling exhibit were " in effect a boycott of this public commemoration .

" that 's when we got the idea to do our own exhibit , " journalist hans-ruediger minow , spokesman for the train of commemoration project , told germany 's mitteldeutsche zeitung newspaper . no exceptions to the rule , bahn says the train of commemoration group came up with the notion of creating an exhibit that would symbolically travel through the country on the very railways that were used in the deportations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : tackling youth crime german conservatives want crackdown on youth crime politicians call for tougher laws against young offenders conservative cdu turns youth crime debate into election issue german plan to criminalize teen sex put on back burner politics -pipe- 07.01.2008 squeezed in state poll , german politician pulls out old tricks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we have too many criminal young foreigners , " koch has said a senior figure in chancellor merkel 's conservative party has focused his re-election campaign in a regional poll on crime , in particular offenses by foreigners .
it 's not the first time the party has used such tactics . seeking a third consecutive term as leader of the prosperous western german state of hesse , roland koch has made immigration the centerpiece of his campaign , stirring memories of a similar election bid almost a decade ago . facing a strong challenge from his social democratic challenger who is focusing on demands for a national minimum wage , koch has seized on a recent violent attack on a german pensioner by two young immigrants on a munich subway train to call for the deportation of " criminal foreigners " and urge an end to " multicultural " coddling of immigrants . the attack , which left the 76-year-old victim with a fractured skull , was captured on close circuit cameras and aired for days on german television . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch is no stranger to controversy " how much are we prepared to take from a small proportion of violent youths , who frequently have a foreign background ? "
koch , once a rising star but now struggling , told mass circulation tabloid bild .
" we have spent too long showing a strange sociological understanding for groups that consciously commit violence as ethnic minorities . " koch 's comments on young immigrant criminals follow a proposal last month for a ban on students wearing the all-encompassing burqa in schools even though there was no reported incident of it . playing with fire while koch 's comments have sparked an outcry among left-wing politicians and immigrant groups and fuelled a heated debate on juvenile crime , political observers point out that it 's not the first time the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- has used anti-immigrant rhetoric to gain political mileage . " the cdu is a highly pragmatic party that does n't shy away from using the anti-foreigner card to reinforce prejudices and appeal to right-wing elements in the population , " said peter lösche , a retired professor of political science at the university of göttingen .
" it 's done it before and had success with it . " in 1999 , koch used criticism of immigration to oust a center-left administration and win the hesse state election .
he launched a successful signature campaign in which his party hit out against federal government plans to introduce dual citizenship for foreign citizens living in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu ran a notorious campaign against skilled indian software specialists in 2000 , another cdu politician , jürgen rüttgers , of north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state , unleashed a campaign against proposed " green cards " for indian software engineers .
his slogan , " kinder statt inder " or " children instead of indians " referred to a preference for home-grown it talent over skilled foreign workers .
while he failed to win that election , he did become the state 's premier in 2005 . members of the cdu 's sister bavarian party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , have often used anti-immigrant rhetoric in their speeches , most notably former bavarian premier edmund stoiber . germany is home to 15 million people of immigrant background , making up about 18 percent of the population .
most of them came as foreign " guest workers " from turkey and italy to help rebuild the country after the war and stayed on . many takers for anti-immigrant rhetoric ? some point out that koch 's populism and anti-immigrant campaigning is not out of place in hesse , home to around 6.1 million people and the city of frankfurt , one of europe 's major financial markets . " the cdu in hesse has always been a law and order party and is known for its ultra-conservative wing , " said gero neugebauer , a political scientist at berlin 's free university .
" koch 's current campaign is an obvious attempt to mobilize this hard core of its supporters who the cdu fears it might lose to far-right parties . " while far-right parties are largely successful in former communist eastern germany - the anti-immigrant npd is represented in two of five state assemblies - experts underline that xenophobic tendencies also exist among voters of mainstream political parties in the western part of the country . " hostility against foreigners and immigrants is equally widespread in western germany , too , " said elmar brähler from the university of leipzig , who carried out a study in 2006 for the friedrich ebert foundation on right-wing extremism in germany .
" the phenomenon is worst among those over the age of 60 . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 68 percent of the cdu 's members are older than 50 analysts say it 's no coincidence koch is appealing to an older generation of conservative voters who are increasingly important to his re-election bid and those of conservative premiers in other states . according to the party 's latest statistics , cdu membership has fallen from 638,000 in 1999 to 541,289 at the end of sept 2007 .
around 68 percent of the members are older than 50 , compared with 14 percent in the age group 16 to 39 . " whipping up fears about security after a brutal attack on the munich subway is a sure tactic of getting the attention of these older voters , " neugebauer said . minimum wage may be a vote-getter this time while koch 's anti-foreigner rhetoric has put further strain on his party 's uneasy grand coalition with the social democrats at the federal level , experts say chancellor angela merkel is unlikely to publicly rein in koch for fear of losing an economically and politically important state that the cdu has ruled for almost a decade . polls indicate that the spd has made huge gains in hesse and that koch is struggling to keep his absolute majority . merkel herself has talked often about the need to integrate the country 's 2.3 million muslims , most of who are of turkish origin , but says immigrants must accept german culture .
an opponent of turkey 's eu membership , merkel won thunderous applause at a recent party conference for saying mosques should not dwarf churches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say voters are more interested in getting decent wages while the outcome of the election in hesse is still open , some believe that the cdu 's tactic of using stirring fears of immigration as a vote-getter may no longer work this time . the spd 's push for a national minimum wage in an effort to dethrone koch - it 's opposed by merkel 's cdu - has wide public support and comes at a time when fears about economic uncertainty are growing , said richard stöss , a politics professor at berlin 's free university .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : tackling youth crime german conservatives want crackdown on youth crime politicians call for tougher laws against young offenders conservative cdu turns youth crime debate into election issue german plan to criminalize teen sex put on back burner politics -pipe- 07.01.2008 squeezed in state poll , german politician pulls out old tricks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we have too many criminal young foreigners , " koch has said a senior figure in chancellor merkel 's conservative party has focused his re-election campaign in a regional poll on crime , in particular offenses by foreigners .
it 's not the first time the party has used such tactics . seeking a third consecutive term as leader of the prosperous western german state of hesse , roland koch has made immigration the centerpiece of his campaign , stirring memories of a similar election bid almost a decade ago . facing a strong challenge from his social democratic challenger who is focusing on demands for a national minimum wage , koch has seized on a recent violent attack on a german pensioner by two young immigrants on a munich subway train to call for the deportation of " criminal foreigners " and urge an end to " multicultural " coddling of immigrants . the attack , which left the 76-year-old victim with a fractured skull , was captured on close circuit cameras and aired for days on german television . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch is no stranger to controversy " how much are we prepared to take from a small proportion of violent youths , who frequently have a foreign background ? "
koch , once a rising star but now struggling , told mass circulation tabloid bild .
" we have spent too long showing a strange sociological understanding for groups that consciously commit violence as ethnic minorities . " koch 's comments on young immigrant criminals follow a proposal last month for a ban on students wearing the all-encompassing burqa in schools even though there was no reported incident of it . playing with fire while koch 's comments have sparked an outcry among left-wing politicians and immigrant groups and fuelled a heated debate on juvenile crime , political observers point out that it 's not the first time the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- has used anti-immigrant rhetoric to gain political mileage . " the cdu is a highly pragmatic party that does n't shy away from using the anti-foreigner card to reinforce prejudices and appeal to right-wing elements in the population , " said peter lösche , a retired professor of political science at the university of göttingen .
" it 's done it before and had success with it . " in 1999 , koch used criticism of immigration to oust a center-left administration and win the hesse state election .
he launched a successful signature campaign in which his party hit out against federal government plans to introduce dual citizenship for foreign citizens living in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu ran a notorious campaign against skilled indian software specialists in 2000 , another cdu politician , jürgen rüttgers , of north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state , unleashed a campaign against proposed " green cards " for indian software engineers .
his slogan , " kinder statt inder " or " children instead of indians " referred to a preference for home-grown it talent over skilled foreign workers .
while he failed to win that election , he did become the state 's premier in 2005 . members of the cdu 's sister bavarian party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , have often used anti-immigrant rhetoric in their speeches , most notably former bavarian premier edmund stoiber . germany is home to 15 million people of immigrant background , making up about 18 percent of the population .
most of them came as foreign " guest workers " from turkey and italy to help rebuild the country after the war and stayed on . many takers for anti-immigrant rhetoric ? some point out that koch 's populism and anti-immigrant campaigning is not out of place in hesse , home to around 6.1 million people and the city of frankfurt , one of europe 's major financial markets . " the cdu in hesse has always been a law and order party and is known for its ultra-conservative wing , " said gero neugebauer , a political scientist at berlin 's free university .
" koch 's current campaign is an obvious attempt to mobilize this hard core of its supporters who the cdu fears it might lose to far-right parties . " while far-right parties are largely successful in former communist eastern germany - the anti-immigrant npd is represented in two of five state assemblies - experts underline that xenophobic tendencies also exist among voters of mainstream political parties in the western part of the country . " hostility against foreigners and immigrants is equally widespread in western germany , too , " said elmar brähler from the university of leipzig , who carried out a study in 2006 for the friedrich ebert foundation on right-wing extremism in germany .
" the phenomenon is worst among those over the age of 60 . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 68 percent of the cdu 's members are older than 50 analysts say it 's no coincidence koch is appealing to an older generation of conservative voters who are increasingly important to his re-election bid and those of conservative premiers in other states . according to the party 's latest statistics , cdu membership has fallen from 638,000 in 1999 to 541,289 at the end of sept 2007 .
around 68 percent of the members are older than 50 , compared with 14 percent in the age group 16 to 39 . " whipping up fears about security after a brutal attack on the munich subway is a sure tactic of getting the attention of these older voters , " neugebauer said . minimum wage may be a vote-getter this time while koch 's anti-foreigner rhetoric has put further strain on his party 's uneasy grand coalition with the social democrats at the federal level , experts say chancellor angela merkel is unlikely to publicly rein in koch for fear of losing an economically and politically important state that the cdu has ruled for almost a decade . polls indicate that the spd has made huge gains in hesse and that koch is struggling to keep his absolute majority . merkel herself has talked often about the need to integrate the country 's 2.3 million muslims , most of who are of turkish origin , but says immigrants must accept german culture .
an opponent of turkey 's eu membership , merkel won thunderous applause at a recent party conference for saying mosques should not dwarf churches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say voters are more interested in getting decent wages while the outcome of the election in hesse is still open , some believe that the cdu 's tactic of using stirring fears of immigration as a vote-getter may no longer work this time . the spd 's push for a national minimum wage in an effort to dethrone koch - it 's opposed by merkel 's cdu - has wide public support and comes at a time when fears about economic uncertainty are growing , said richard stöss , a politics professor at berlin 's free university . " hesse is home to lots of industry and factories and an issue like a national minimum wage is likely to resonate far better with voters than fears of immigration , " he said . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in karlsruhe on thursday , a baby girl was found dead in a similar baby hatch ; officials say she had likely died before being left there .
in both cases , there are no clues as to the identity of the parents .
baby hatches have existed in germany since the 19th century in the hope of preventing infanticide by giving desperate mothers a safe place to leave their unwanted babies .
but they have always been controversial , mainly because it is illegal to give birth anonymously in germany .
critics of the hatches say they help women circumvent the law .
but voices on the other side of the debate say that anonymous births will take place no matter what the law says , and that it is better to provide mothers who feel compelled to give birth in secret an anonymous drop-off point for their babies .
calls to legalize anonymous births now , the two incidents in hanover and karlsruhe are rekindling the anonymous birth debate .
both government and protestant church officials in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg have renewed calls for legalizing anonymous births , which would give pregnant women the option of delivering in a hospital without stating their name .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : legalizing anonymous birth could save the lives of as many as 50 babies a year , experts say the state of baden-württemberg has long been a proponent of legal anonymous births in germany and , together with the state of bavaria , has drawn up draft legislation .
but while the draft has frequently been up for discussion , it has never received the necessary majority from all the committees involved , according to a spokesperson from the state justice ministry .
according to statistics from the regional government in stuttgart , 40 to 50 babies are born in secret without medical assistance each year nationwide , and less than half survive .
having the option of giving birth anonymously in a hospital would reduce the risks for both mother and child , proponents argue .
officials discuss how to help desperate moms in the eastern german state of lower saxony , social minister mechthild ross-luttmann said she intends to talk with those organizations that sponsor baby hatches about ways to improve the service .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could hatches be part of a support concept for pregnant women in need ?
" perhaps there 's a need for improvement at some of the hatches , " she told german news agency dpa , adding that signs with instructions in several languages would be a sensible addition .
a spokeswoman from the free-market liberal free democratic party 's parliamentary group said that the cases in hanover and karlsruhe should not result in criticism of baby hatches .
instead , they should inspire more discussion of how to give such services a legal framework , and how best to help desperate mothers-to-be .

contergan , a sedative which contained the active ingredient thalidomide , was prescribed to pregnant women in the late 1950s , and caused their fetuses to be born with severely shortened limbs , or in some cases , no limbs at all .
around half of the 10,000 thalidomide victims worldwide were born in west germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas meyer the president of germany 's association of contergan victims , andreas meyer , says the tragedy has never been fully investigated , nor is he happy with what he says is grünenthal 's silence on the issue .
the company has never formally apologized , although in the past month , it has begun meeting with victims ' representatives seeking an improved health and financial situation for the some 2,700 thalidomide victims still living in germany .

contergan , a sedative which contained the active ingredient thalidomide , was prescribed to pregnant women in the late 1950s , and caused their fetuses to be born with severely shortened limbs , or in some cases , no limbs at all .
around half of the 10,000 thalidomide victims worldwide were born in west germany .

the company has never formally apologized , although in the past month , it has begun meeting with victims ' representatives seeking an improved health and financial situation for the some 2,700 thalidomide victims still living in germany .

the hessen premier wants to defend his seat this month and so he drops his standards .
the conservative politician has chosen to follow the route of populism and has found a subject that is being widely debated at dinner tables all across the country : juvenile delinquency among foreigners in germany . the subject is not only old and is just a minor part of a larger problem : the brutalization of society .
ignoring the larger picture , koch has demanded that violent foreign youngsters be punished harder and thrown out of the country faster . he has chosen his moment well .
the festive season over christmas and the new year is traditionally slow for news .
as a result , koch has been in the headlines for days .
everyone has heard roland koch 's opinion .
his timing is perfidious . this has not been advantageous for either the debate or any possible solution to the problem . politicians on the right and the left are pulled apart in anger over which direction to take .
koch 's loud exhortations from the middle-class conservative corner have been derided by the left-wing liberals who see a darker agenda at work : hostility to foreigners . not only a foreign problem the truth is that there is evidence that foreign youngsters and those with a migration background regularly feature in violent crime statistics .
but this is not the whole story .
the problem does not come from them being foreign .
investigations show that the lives of violent german youngsters share remarkable similarities with those of culprits with migrant backgrounds . both sets of perpetrators come from disadvantaged social groups and areas .
their stories read the same : broken homes , borderline poverty , unfinished school careers , unemployment . these are the childhood and youth experiences of young delinquents , whether they are named ali , sergei or jürgen .
the main problem in juvenile delinquency in germany is a structural one , and only secondly - or thirdly - can it be regarded as a problem among foreigners or migrants . germany 's social failings must be addressed these failed lives and the inadequacies of social structure should not be used to excuse individuals of responsibility , but it must be accepted that german integration policy has failed at its most basic levels , and that education has failed in the early stage of kindergarten . these weaknesses will not be repaired by harder punishments and deportations .
the united states of america is an example of that .
the congested prisons and draconian punishments such as the death penalty in the us have not made its towns safer . one more thing points to a dishonest and opportunist attempt by roland koch to win votes through this tactical and manipulated debate : if koch and his supporters really want to push through harder and more effective punishments for the likes of " violent ali " and " thieving sergei , " then why has the hesse premier cut 700 permanent police jobs and 80 permanent justice positions during his time in office ? this dangerous game will have a familiar and sad outcome .

more financial aid needed , victims say thalidomide victims say a compensation fund set up in 1970 has been exhausted and that many now need extra help as arthritis and age bring pain after a lifetime of unnatural movement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's thalidomide babies were often raised and schooled apart from other children grünenthal had said that the 110 million deutsche marks -lrb- 56.3 million euros or $ 83 million at current rates -rrb- it paid into a trust in 1971 was a final settlement of all claims in germany .
the modest monthly stipends of 545 euros victims currently receive are entirely funded by the government .
among the victims ' demands is a six-fold increase in these monthly payments to an amount between 2,100 and 3,500 euros , as well as a one-time compensation payment of around 1 million euros per victim .
the victims ' representatives are planning a parliamentary campaign to make their case to both the federal government and grünenthal .
" an independent lifestyle is not possible with the current level of monthly payments , " said udo herterich of the regional thalidomide victims ' association in the state of north rhine-westphalia .
" we 're getting older , we 're suffering more from the consequences of our disabilities and we need more and more help . "
grünenthal ceo " very moved " the victims ' associations were hopeful that grünenthal would reassess its position following an initial meeting with employees last month .
grünenthal ceo sebastian wirtz described the meeting as " very moving , " and said that he and his family regretted very much the events of 50 years ago .
" even though i had n't been born at that point , as a family member of the third generation , i would like to try , together with those affected , to come to terms with the contergan tragedy , " wirtz said .

the british alliance has already attained monthly payments of between 2,100 and 3,500 euros for its members .

now , it seems , it 's not only adoring crowds who rate him highly . critics and fans alike marveled at the diminutive playmaker 's all-round performance and eye for goal before the winter break as bremen charged up the league to devour bayern munich 's early season lead to leave the league finely poised in the second half run-in .
now it seems that diego 's brilliance has n't gone unnoticed by his peers .
despite being tantalized , teased and trounced by the little dynamo , diego 's fellow players have bestowed on him the accolade of being the best outfield player in the bundesliga in the first half of the season .
the bremen star 's nine goals which have made him the league 's joint top scorer - which is not bad considering he 's a midfielder and that he has some stiff competition - helped land 44.9 percent of the 275 votes in the survey by kicker magazine .
diego beat french midfielder franck ribery of bayern munich -lrb- 21.5 percent -rrb- into second place and dutch playmaker rafael van der vaart of sv hamburg -lrb- 16.8 percent -rrb- into third .
diego looks on target to repeat his 2006/2007 achievement of being voted the best player at the end of the season by his contemporaries .
bremen maestro in world 's top four bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego , here with robinho , is rated among the world 's best he also features in the " world 's best " list voted for by the bundesliga players .
diego sits joint fourth with compatriot ronaldinho of barcelona , while fellow brazilian kaka of ac milan tops the list .
barca 's argentinean genius lionel messi and manchester united winger cristiano ronaldo separate the selecao stars , in second and third respectively .
the top german star in kicker 's bundesliga poll was bayer leverkusen midfielder simon rolfes -lrb- 4.3 percent -rrb- who came in behind van der vaart in fourth place .
in a separate vote for goalkeepers , leverkusen 's rene adler was voted the best keeper with 35.8 percent of the vote , followed by hanover 's robert enke -lrb- 28 percent -rrb- and frank rost of sv hamburg -lrb- 11.4 percent -rrb- .
promotion suprise package wins coach plaudits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : becker 's karlsruhe are fighting for a european place edmund becker of promoted sc karlsruhe was named the bundesliga 's best coach of the season so far .
while their fortunes dipped a little before the break , becker 's boys have been a consistent top five team since august when many were tipping them to struggle for survival from the first whistle .
karlsruhe 's exploits earned their coach 39.4 percent of the players ' votes .
hamburg 's huub stevens -lrb- 31.7 percent -rrb- and hanover 's dieter hecking -lrb- 12 percent -rrb- were next .
it was n't only winners who got a mention in the kicker poll .

it is to reach the auschwitz death camp in poland on may 8 . but the group claims it has fought resistance from federally owned german railway concern deutsche bahn every step of the way .
representatives are particularly angry that they have to pay the same fees as any other private train operator to use the german railway tracks , despite the company 's historic involvement in the transports . deutsche bahn acknowledged on friday , jan .
4 , that it was charging the group the same toll for track use as other private train operators .
a bahn spokesman said the company had to treat all customers equally . bahn 's historic responsibility the train of commemoration group argues that the bahn must face up to its historic responsibility as the transport provider to the nazis .
it said the tens of thousands of euros of tolls charged to the rolling exhibit were " in effect a boycott of this public commemoration . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibit is based on a similar one by nazi hunter beate klarsfeld the exhibition uses letters and biographies to show how jewish children were caught up in the nazi machinery of death and taken to the gas chambers in cattle wagons . the german citizens ' initiative behind the exhibit was formed by a group of journalists , artists , lawyers and academics , in the wake of a 2003 french exhibition organized by french nazi hunters and activists beate and serge klarsfeld .
the klarsfeld exhibit , which focused on the deportation of 11,000 jewish children via rail from france to nazi death camps , was shown in french train stations . deutsche bahn denied a request to display the french exhibit in german train stations . " that 's when we got the idea to do our own exhibit , " journalist hans-ruediger minow , spokesman for the train of commemoration project , told germany 's mitteldeutsche zeitung newspaper . no exceptions to the rule , bahn says the train of commemoration group came up with the notion of creating an exhibit that would symbolically travel through the country on the very railways that were used in the deportations .
but both deutsche bahn and the german transportation ministry , which issued the transport orders under the nazi regime , failed to show interest in the project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn is charging the project to use its rails susanne kill , corporate historian for deutsche bahn , told the mitteldeutsche zeitung that the company " is processing its nazi history in numerous projects of its own . "
she added that deutsche bahn would be bringing its own traveling exhibit to appropriate train stations . moreover , she said , " deutsche bahn ca n't allow free use of the rails in individual cases . " earnings could go to charity according to german law , anyone is allowed to use the railways and train stations - as long as they meet certain standards , and can pay the costs . minow is now trying to drum up support for his cause . " we expect protests in germany and internationally until deutsche bahn and the ministry of transport see reason , " he told the leftist newspaper neues deutschland on saturday . a transportation ministry spokesman told the dpa news agency that deutsche bahn was considering to donate the income from the train of commemoration in the form of a corporate charitable grant . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

both meinhof 's ex-husband kalus-heinz röhl and her daughter bettina röhl have written about meinhof and the process of disintegration of german society beginning in the spring of 1968 that led to the formation of the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- . unravelling myths bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf has been the subject of numerous books but jutta ditfurth 's biography on meinhof , released in november , disputes many of the myths that surround meinhof 's transformation from journalist to raf terrorist . in her six years researching the biography , ditfurth , a founder of the german greens party , who has since left the stage of national politics , uncovered previously unpublished material , including documents kept in archives outside of germany . " ulrike meinhof was a much more interesting , much more multi-faceted person than i used to think , " ditfurth told dw-radio .
" she was a woman who would have had a huge amount of opportunities and prospects - if only she 'd had the good fortune to have grown up somewhere other than germany . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meinhof after her arrest in june 1972 the biography also encompasses the post-war history of west germany and the politically charged climate of the 1960s and 1970s . ditfurth examines the often forgotten social conditions , such as state violence , the biased nature of german courts , the rigidity of law-making , and the terrible conditions for political prisoners that drove the raf movement , also known as the baader-meinhof gang , in what was then a flourishing west german democracy . contaminated by terrorism ? the biography is written entirely chronological and largely devoid of commentary , but critics have said that while the information used might be factual it only tells half of the story .
even meinhof 's daughter , bettina röhl , labelled the latest biography about her mother " poisonous rubbish contaminated by terrorism . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bettina röhl has written a book about her mother while ditfurth admits the book is politically biased , she said there is a big difference between writing from a left wing point of view and endorsing anarchic terrorism . " i am a leftie from a different generation and the raf was really never my cup of tea , " she said .
" i always drew a distinct line and sharply criticised their terrorist acts . " far from helping her , ditfurth said her political credentials as former leader of the german green 's left wing and her well documented opposition to the red army faction actually made researching the biography more difficult . " i was considered an outsider and was dealt with by people in certain raf circles with a lot of scepticism , " she said .
" but still i did my best to find out all the things that i had ever wanted to know . " while ditfurth is no apologist and she suggested that meinhof 's path was wrong , she also said it was wholly understandable . ditfurth is not the first to be accused of crossing the line between writing about the raf and supporting the raf – in 2002 critics said a film about raf co-founder andreas baader " glamorized the leader .

the 2006 leader slipped significantly in the 2007 rankings , dropping from first to seventh place behind portugal and slovenia . " the general trend is that privacy is being extinguished in country after country , " said simon davies , director of the group .
" even those countries where we expected ongoing strong privacy protection , like germany and canada , are sinking into the mire . " all citizens under suspicion according to privacy international , germany 's slide reflects a trend currently underway in all democratic societies . concern over immigration and border control has moved countries to swiftly implement database , identity and fingerprinting systems often without regard to the privacy implications for their own citizens , the study said .
the trend leads to the conclusion that all citizens , regardless of legal status , are under suspicion , it said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : overzealous monitoring places all citizens under suspicion , the study said although privacy was improving in the former communist states of eastern europe , it is worsening across western europe , the report said . the survey considered such factors as legal protections , enforcement , data-sharing , the use of biometrics and prevalence of closed-circuit cameras . experts hit out at data retention law though germany has one of the strongest sets of privacy laws in the world , the survey said , the country at the same time features one of the highest rates of monitoring telecommunications in europe . germany 's implementation of an eu data retention directive , which went into effect this year , came in for particular criticism .
the controversial legislation calls on phone companies and internet providers to store data for up to six months and allows police to access the information with a judicial warrant .
the law also permits telephone wiretapping in certain cases . the survey noted that the legislation had been passed despite strong objections .
this week , however , over 30,000 germans including privacy activists , civil rights groups filed a historic mass lawsuit against the controversial law .
protests were held in two german cities .
activists also seek to overturn the march 2006 european union data-retention directive that required germany to pass the legislation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an activist holds up a photo of german interior minister schäuble during a protest gisela piltz , domestic affairs spokeswoman for the opposition free-market liberal fdp party , said last week the data retention law " strikes at the foundation of our constitutional state . " the authors of the study also hit out at the fact that fingerprints had been added to germany 's biometric passports starting in november 2007 , video surveillance had been expanded despite protests and there was no legal protection for privacy at the workplace despite demands for it . the storing of telecommunications data and ever increasing demands by some german politicians to expand security measures were also singled out for criticism .
germany 's role in initiating and approving the prüm agreement , which facilitates cross-border criminal investigations among seven european countries , also got the thumbs-down . germany 's data protection measures are " decaying , " the survey concluded . best and the worst greece , romania and canada had the best records of 47 countries privacy international surveyed .
malaysia , russia and china ranked worst , but great britain and the united states also fell into the lowest-performing group of " endemic surveillance societies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : tackling youth crime german conservatives want crackdown on youth crime politicians call for tougher laws against young offenders conservative cdu turns youth crime debate into election issue german plan to criminalize teen sex put on back burner politics -pipe- 07.01.2008 squeezed in state poll , german politician pulls out old tricks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we have too many criminal young foreigners , " koch has said a senior figure in chancellor merkel 's conservative party has focused his re-election campaign in a regional poll on crime , in particular offenses by foreigners .
it 's not the first time the party has used such tactics . seeking a third consecutive term as leader of the prosperous western german state of hesse , roland koch has made immigration the centerpiece of his campaign , stirring memories of a similar election bid almost a decade ago . facing a strong challenge from his social democratic challenger who is focusing on demands for a national minimum wage , koch has seized on a recent violent attack on a german pensioner by two young immigrants on a munich subway train to call for the deportation of " criminal foreigners " and urge an end to " multicultural " coddling of immigrants . the attack , which left the 76-year-old victim with a fractured skull , was captured on close circuit cameras and aired for days on german television . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch is no stranger to controversy " how much are we prepared to take from a small proportion of violent youths , who frequently have a foreign background ? "
koch , once a rising star but now struggling , told mass circulation tabloid bild .
" we have spent too long showing a strange sociological understanding for groups that consciously commit violence as ethnic minorities . " koch 's comments on young immigrant criminals follow a proposal last month for a ban on students wearing the all-encompassing burqa in schools even though there was no reported incident of it . playing with fire while koch 's comments have sparked an outcry among left-wing politicians and immigrant groups and fuelled a heated debate on juvenile crime , political observers point out that it 's not the first time the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- has used anti-immigrant rhetoric to gain political mileage . " the cdu is a highly pragmatic party that does n't shy away from using the anti-foreigner card to reinforce prejudices and appeal to right-wing elements in the population , " said peter lösche , a retired professor of political science at the university of göttingen .
" it 's done it before and had success with it . " in 1999 , koch used criticism of immigration to oust a center-left administration and win the hesse state election .
he launched a successful signature campaign in which his party hit out against federal government plans to introduce dual citizenship for foreign citizens living in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu ran a notorious campaign against skilled indian software specialists in 2000 , another cdu politician , jürgen rüttgers , of north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state , unleashed a campaign against proposed " green cards " for indian software engineers .
his slogan , " kinder statt inder " or " children instead of indians " referred to a preference for home-grown it talent over skilled foreign workers .
while he failed to win that election , he did become the state 's premier in 2005 . members of the cdu 's sister bavarian party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , have often used anti-immigrant rhetoric in their speeches , most notably former bavarian premier edmund stoiber . germany is home to 15 million people of immigrant background , making up about 18 percent of the population .
most of them came as foreign " guest workers " from turkey and italy to help rebuild the country after the war and stayed on . many takers for anti-immigrant rhetoric ? some point out that koch 's populism and anti-immigrant campaigning is not out of place in hesse , home to around 6.1 million people and the city of frankfurt , one of europe 's major financial markets . " the cdu in hesse has always been a law and order party and is known for its ultra-conservative wing , " said gero neugebauer , a political scientist at berlin 's free university .
" koch 's current campaign is an obvious attempt to mobilize this hard core of its supporters who the cdu fears it might lose to far-right parties . " while far-right parties are largely successful in former communist eastern germany - the anti-immigrant npd is represented in two of five state assemblies - experts underline that xenophobic tendencies also exist among voters of mainstream political parties in the western part of the country . " hostility against foreigners and immigrants is equally widespread in western germany , too , " said elmar brähler from the university of leipzig , who carried out a study in 2006 for the friedrich ebert foundation on right-wing extremism in germany .
" the phenomenon is worst among those over the age of 60 . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 68 percent of the cdu 's members are older than 50 analysts say it 's no coincidence koch is appealing to an older generation of conservative voters who are increasingly important to his re-election bid and those of conservative premiers in other states . according to the party 's latest statistics , cdu membership has fallen from 638,000 in 1999 to 541,289 at the end of sept 2007 .
around 68 percent of the members are older than 50 , compared with 14 percent in the age group 16 to 39 . " whipping up fears about security after a brutal attack on the munich subway is a sure tactic of getting the attention of these older voters , " neugebauer said . minimum wage may be a vote-getter this time while koch 's anti-foreigner rhetoric has put further strain on his party 's uneasy grand coalition with the social democrats at the federal level , experts say chancellor angela merkel is unlikely to publicly rein in koch for fear of losing an economically and politically important state that the cdu has ruled for almost a decade . polls indicate that the spd has made huge gains in hesse and that koch is struggling to keep his absolute majority . merkel herself has talked often about the need to integrate the country 's 2.3 million muslims , most of who are of turkish origin , but says immigrants must accept german culture .
an opponent of turkey 's eu membership , merkel won thunderous applause at a recent party conference for saying mosques should not dwarf churches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say voters are more interested in getting decent wages while the outcome of the election in hesse is still open , some believe that the cdu 's tactic of using stirring fears of immigration as a vote-getter may no longer work this time . the spd 's push for a national minimum wage in an effort to dethrone koch - it 's opposed by merkel 's cdu - has wide public support and comes at a time when fears about economic uncertainty are growing , said richard stöss , a politics professor at berlin 's free university . " hesse is home to lots of industry and factories and an issue like a national minimum wage is likely to resonate far better with voters than fears of immigration , " he said . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's not the first time the party has used such tactics . seeking a third consecutive term as leader of the prosperous western german state of hesse , roland koch has made immigration the centerpiece of his campaign , stirring memories of a similar election bid almost a decade ago . facing a strong challenge from his social democratic challenger who is focusing on demands for a national minimum wage , koch has seized on a recent violent attack on a german pensioner by two young immigrants on a munich subway train to call for the deportation of " criminal foreigners " and urge an end to " multicultural " coddling of immigrants . the attack , which left the 76-year-old victim with a fractured skull , was captured on close circuit cameras and aired for days on german television . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch is no stranger to controversy " how much are we prepared to take from a small proportion of violent youths , who frequently have a foreign background ? "
koch , once a rising star but now struggling , told mass circulation tabloid bild .
" we have spent too long showing a strange sociological understanding for groups that consciously commit violence as ethnic minorities . " koch 's comments on young immigrant criminals follow a proposal last month for a ban on students wearing the all-encompassing burqa in schools even though there was no reported incident of it . playing with fire while koch 's comments have sparked an outcry among left-wing politicians and immigrant groups and fuelled a heated debate on juvenile crime , political observers point out that it 's not the first time the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- has used anti-immigrant rhetoric to gain political mileage . " the cdu is a highly pragmatic party that does n't shy away from using the anti-foreigner card to reinforce prejudices and appeal to right-wing elements in the population , " said peter lösche , a retired professor of political science at the university of göttingen .
" it 's done it before and had success with it . " in 1999 , koch used criticism of immigration to oust a center-left administration and win the hesse state election .
he launched a successful signature campaign in which his party hit out against federal government plans to introduce dual citizenship for foreign citizens living in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu ran a notorious campaign against skilled indian software specialists in 2000 , another cdu politician , jürgen rüttgers , of north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state , unleashed a campaign against proposed " green cards " for indian software engineers .
his slogan , " kinder statt inder " or " children instead of indians " referred to a preference for home-grown it talent over skilled foreign workers .
while he failed to win that election , he did become the state 's premier in 2005 . members of the cdu 's sister bavarian party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , have often used anti-immigrant rhetoric in their speeches , most notably former bavarian premier edmund stoiber . germany is home to 15 million people of immigrant background , making up about 18 percent of the population .
most of them came as foreign " guest workers " from turkey and italy to help rebuild the country after the war and stayed on . many takers for anti-immigrant rhetoric ? some point out that koch 's populism and anti-immigrant campaigning is not out of place in hesse , home to around 6.1 million people and the city of frankfurt , one of europe 's major financial markets . " the cdu in hesse has always been a law and order party and is known for its ultra-conservative wing , " said gero neugebauer , a political scientist at berlin 's free university .
" koch 's current campaign is an obvious attempt to mobilize this hard core of its supporters who the cdu fears it might lose to far-right parties . " while far-right parties are largely successful in former communist eastern germany - the anti-immigrant npd is represented in two of five state assemblies - experts underline that xenophobic tendencies also exist among voters of mainstream political parties in the western part of the country . " hostility against foreigners and immigrants is equally widespread in western germany , too , " said elmar brähler from the university of leipzig , who carried out a study in 2006 for the friedrich ebert foundation on right-wing extremism in germany .
" the phenomenon is worst among those over the age of 60 . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 68 percent of the cdu 's members are older than 50 analysts say it 's no coincidence koch is appealing to an older generation of conservative voters who are increasingly important to his re-election bid and those of conservative premiers in other states . according to the party 's latest statistics , cdu membership has fallen from 638,000 in 1999 to 541,289 at the end of sept 2007 .
around 68 percent of the members are older than 50 , compared with 14 percent in the age group 16 to 39 . " whipping up fears about security after a brutal attack on the munich subway is a sure tactic of getting the attention of these older voters , " neugebauer said . minimum wage may be a vote-getter this time while koch 's anti-foreigner rhetoric has put further strain on his party 's uneasy grand coalition with the social democrats at the federal level , experts say chancellor angela merkel is unlikely to publicly rein in koch for fear of losing an economically and politically important state that the cdu has ruled for almost a decade . polls indicate that the spd has made huge gains in hesse and that koch is struggling to keep his absolute majority . merkel herself has talked often about the need to integrate the country 's 2.3 million muslims , most of who are of turkish origin , but says immigrants must accept german culture .
an opponent of turkey 's eu membership , merkel won thunderous applause at a recent party conference for saying mosques should not dwarf churches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say voters are more interested in getting decent wages while the outcome of the election in hesse is still open , some believe that the cdu 's tactic of using stirring fears of immigration as a vote-getter may no longer work this time . the spd 's push for a national minimum wage in an effort to dethrone koch - it 's opposed by merkel 's cdu - has wide public support and comes at a time when fears about economic uncertainty are growing , said richard stöss , a politics professor at berlin 's free university . " hesse is home to lots of industry and factories and an issue like a national minimum wage is likely to resonate far better with voters than fears of immigration , " he said . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the hessen premier wants to defend his seat this month and so he drops his standards .
the conservative politician has chosen to follow the route of populism and has found a subject that is being widely debated at dinner tables all across the country : juvenile delinquency among foreigners in germany . the subject is not only old and is just a minor part of a larger problem : the brutalization of society .
ignoring the larger picture , koch has demanded that violent foreign youngsters be punished harder and thrown out of the country faster . he has chosen his moment well .
the festive season over christmas and the new year is traditionally slow for news .
as a result , koch has been in the headlines for days .
everyone has heard roland koch 's opinion .
his timing is perfidious . this has not been advantageous for either the debate or any possible solution to the problem . politicians on the right and the left are pulled apart in anger over which direction to take .
koch 's loud exhortations from the middle-class conservative corner have been derided by the left-wing liberals who see a darker agenda at work : hostility to foreigners . not only a foreign problem the truth is that there is evidence that foreign youngsters and those with a migration background regularly feature in violent crime statistics .
but this is not the whole story .
the problem does not come from them being foreign .
investigations show that the lives of violent german youngsters share remarkable similarities with those of culprits with migrant backgrounds . both sets of perpetrators come from disadvantaged social groups and areas .
their stories read the same : broken homes , borderline poverty , unfinished school careers , unemployment . these are the childhood and youth experiences of young delinquents , whether they are named ali , sergei or jürgen .
the main problem in juvenile delinquency in germany is a structural one , and only secondly - or thirdly - can it be regarded as a problem among foreigners or migrants . germany 's social failings must be addressed these failed lives and the inadequacies of social structure should not be used to excuse individuals of responsibility , but it must be accepted that german integration policy has failed at its most basic levels , and that education has failed in the early stage of kindergarten . these weaknesses will not be repaired by harder punishments and deportations .
the united states of america is an example of that .
the congested prisons and draconian punishments such as the death penalty in the us have not made its towns safer . one more thing points to a dishonest and opportunist attempt by roland koch to win votes through this tactical and manipulated debate : if koch and his supporters really want to push through harder and more effective punishments for the likes of " violent ali " and " thieving sergei , " then why has the hesse premier cut 700 permanent police jobs and 80 permanent justice positions during his time in office ? this dangerous game will have a familiar and sad outcome .
come the day after the hessen election on january 27 , the problem will disappear from public debate - unsolved . volker wagener works at deutsche welle 's central news desk -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the hessen premier wants to defend his seat this month and so he drops his standards .
the conservative politician has chosen to follow the route of populism and has found a subject that is being widely debated at dinner tables all across the country : juvenile delinquency among foreigners in germany . the subject is not only old and is just a minor part of a larger problem : the brutalization of society .
ignoring the larger picture , koch has demanded that violent foreign youngsters be punished harder and thrown out of the country faster . he has chosen his moment well .
the festive season over christmas and the new year is traditionally slow for news .
as a result , koch has been in the headlines for days .
everyone has heard roland koch 's opinion .
his timing is perfidious . this has not been advantageous for either the debate or any possible solution to the problem . politicians on the right and the left are pulled apart in anger over which direction to take .
koch 's loud exhortations from the middle-class conservative corner have been derided by the left-wing liberals who see a darker agenda at work : hostility to foreigners . not only a foreign problem the truth is that there is evidence that foreign youngsters and those with a migration background regularly feature in violent crime statistics .
but this is not the whole story .
the problem does not come from them being foreign .
investigations show that the lives of violent german youngsters share remarkable similarities with those of culprits with migrant backgrounds . both sets of perpetrators come from disadvantaged social groups and areas .
their stories read the same : broken homes , borderline poverty , unfinished school careers , unemployment . these are the childhood and youth experiences of young delinquents , whether they are named ali , sergei or jürgen .
the main problem in juvenile delinquency in germany is a structural one , and only secondly - or thirdly - can it be regarded as a problem among foreigners or migrants . germany 's social failings must be addressed these failed lives and the inadequacies of social structure should not be used to excuse individuals of responsibility , but it must be accepted that german integration policy has failed at its most basic levels , and that education has failed in the early stage of kindergarten . these weaknesses will not be repaired by harder punishments and deportations .
the united states of america is an example of that .
the congested prisons and draconian punishments such as the death penalty in the us have not made its towns safer . one more thing points to a dishonest and opportunist attempt by roland koch to win votes through this tactical and manipulated debate : if koch and his supporters really want to push through harder and more effective punishments for the likes of " violent ali " and " thieving sergei , " then why has the hesse premier cut 700 permanent police jobs and 80 permanent justice positions during his time in office ? this dangerous game will have a familiar and sad outcome .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : german state elections in hesse and lower saxony german ex-minister warns against own party in key state poll immigrant groups protest against koch 's justice plans germany mulls extending voting rights to foreigners german ex-chancellor criticizes xenophobic election campaign politics -pipe- 07.01.2008 state election policies reveal extent of divide in german coalition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the state polls are seen as the starting pistol for the 2009 general election campiagn state elections this year are likely to be the catalyst for open war between the country 's ruling coalition partners .
both parties are attempting to stake out their ground ahead of a 2009 federal election . as things stand , chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- counterparts appear to be barely holding their fractious relationship together .
once the voters go to the polls in state elections this year , divisions over two key policy issues could see the brittle façade finally shatter . the wrangling over a proposed national minimum wage , championed by the spd , and a conservative-led plan to crackdown on juvenile crime are the issues likely to dominate the first elections , taking place in hessen and lower saxony in late january and in hamburg in february .
bavaria will vote in september .
the results of the state elections could indicate how the general election in 2009 could play out . the way each party makes its arguments and the results of the polls in relation to the issues may drive the current wedge between the coalition partners deeper , effectively splitting the government .
the spd have set the call for a national minimum wage at the heart of their campaign in the key state polls , much to the chagrin of the cdu . minimum wage central to spd campaign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the campaign for no wage under 7.50 euros is popular among labor unionists at the launch of the campaign , peter struck , the head of the spd 's parliamentary group , announced that the social democrats intended to harness the strong public backing for a minimum hourly wage of 7.50 euros -lrb- $ 10.77 -rrb- in the three regional races . " we will start petition drives during the state elections , " struck said in december .
" then the voters will have their say .
we will make the state elections and the general election in 2009 into a referendum on the minimum wage . " the social democrats , who have been trailing the conservatives in the polls by around 10 points for several months , argue that europe 's biggest economy must ensure that wages are high enough to keep workers above the poverty level .
germany is one of the few countries in the eu without a national minimum wage , though it does have a series of industry-specific wage agreements . many leading conservative members , the chancellor included , have reacted angrily to the spd 's stance , saying that an across-the-board minimum wage would be a job killer , driving companies to eastern europe and asia where pay is lower . merkel favors industry control on wages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor has led the opposition to the proposal at the launch of the cdu election program on saturday , the party ruled out a debate on the minimum wage , defiantly putting itself in opposition to the spd 's central election theme . merkel has said that the national minimum wage is " not the right answer " and has reiterated her support for the traditional practice of leaving unions and employers to negotiate wage levels in each industry . meanwhile , the conservatives seem intent on fighting the state elections on a law and order ticket , riling the spd in the process . the cdu leadership has called for stiffer penalties for juveniles convicted of violent crimes , proposing an increase in the maximum sentence for young people convicted of serious offences from 10 to 15 years . the party has also called for a " warning shot " period of detention for those given probation for violent crimes and the introduction of boot camps where young offenders could be sent for re-education .
under the new cdu proposals , rules for deporting foreigners convicted of serious crimes would also be eased . conservatives react to upsurge in violent crime bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violent crime has been grabbing the headlines " i think ' warning-shot arrests ' -lsb- short periods in detention -rsb- and boot camps could indeed be a sensible supplement to current laws , " merkel said .
" it could turn young people around so they do not wind up in prison . " the proposals , in line with those put forward by roland koch , the under-pressure cdu premier of hesse , who is seeking a third term of office on jan .
27 , come after a spate of violent attacks across germany . " how much are we prepared to take from a small proportion of violent youths , who frequently have a foreign background , " koch said in an interview after the attack , which has been repeatedly broadcast on television . " something has to be done , " merkel added .
" there is no point in delaying matters .
it is unacceptable that many people do not dare ride the subway at night because they are afraid of violence ... we need the feeling of personal security again in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : tackling youth crime squeezed in state poll , german politician pulls out old tricks conservative cdu turns youth crime debate into election issue german conservatives want crackdown on youth crime politicians call for tougher laws against young offenders opinion -pipe- 07.01.2008 opinion : populist electioneering damaging german crime debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche welle 's volker wagener believes hessen premier roland koch 's demand for radical changes in juvenile criminal law is nothing more than a populist attempt to win favor as he faces a tough re-election campaign . roland koch knows how elections are won .
the hessen premier wants to defend his seat this month and so he drops his standards .
the conservative politician has chosen to follow the route of populism and has found a subject that is being widely debated at dinner tables all across the country : juvenile delinquency among foreigners in germany . the subject is not only old and is just a minor part of a larger problem : the brutalization of society .
ignoring the larger picture , koch has demanded that violent foreign youngsters be punished harder and thrown out of the country faster . he has chosen his moment well .
the festive season over christmas and the new year is traditionally slow for news .
as a result , koch has been in the headlines for days .
everyone has heard roland koch 's opinion .
his timing is perfidious . this has not been advantageous for either the debate or any possible solution to the problem . politicians on the right and the left are pulled apart in anger over which direction to take .
koch 's loud exhortations from the middle-class conservative corner have been derided by the left-wing liberals who see a darker agenda at work : hostility to foreigners . not only a foreign problem the truth is that there is evidence that foreign youngsters and those with a migration background regularly feature in violent crime statistics .
but this is not the whole story .
the problem does not come from them being foreign .
investigations show that the lives of violent german youngsters share remarkable similarities with those of culprits with migrant backgrounds . both sets of perpetrators come from disadvantaged social groups and areas .
their stories read the same : broken homes , borderline poverty , unfinished school careers , unemployment . these are the childhood and youth experiences of young delinquents , whether they are named ali , sergei or jürgen .
the main problem in juvenile delinquency in germany is a structural one , and only secondly - or thirdly - can it be regarded as a problem among foreigners or migrants . germany 's social failings must be addressed these failed lives and the inadequacies of social structure should not be used to excuse individuals of responsibility , but it must be accepted that german integration policy has failed at its most basic levels , and that education has failed in the early stage of kindergarten . these weaknesses will not be repaired by harder punishments and deportations .
the united states of america is an example of that .
the congested prisons and draconian punishments such as the death penalty in the us have not made its towns safer . one more thing points to a dishonest and opportunist attempt by roland koch to win votes through this tactical and manipulated debate : if koch and his supporters really want to push through harder and more effective punishments for the likes of " violent ali " and " thieving sergei , " then why has the hesse premier cut 700 permanent police jobs and 80 permanent justice positions during his time in office ? this dangerous game will have a familiar and sad outcome .
come the day after the hessen election on january 27 , the problem will disappear from public debate - unsolved . volker wagener works at deutsche welle 's central news desk -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but one ingredient on which everyone with a pounding head and churning stomach agrees is the hair of the dog . but what if the drunken party animal is a dog ?
a three-year-old , 40 kilogram -lrb- 88 lb -rrb- labrador retriever named bingo , to be exact ?
that question recently arose in austria , after a hunter in the mountain town of bad goisern realized his trusty pet could barely stay on its feet .
he rushed the dog to the vet , complaining that along with all the bobbing and weaving , the animal 's breath " smelled more like a beer garden than a doghouse . "
fermentation follies had bingo gone on a binge-o ?
perhaps in an effort to forget his name-o ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in holland , they make non-alchoholic beer for dogs oh , no .
the hunter 's liquor stocks were all accounted for .
what was missing , though , was a half a kilo -lrb- 1 lb . -rrb- of freshly prepared bread dough , which never quite made it from the rising board into the oven .
instead , it fermented inside the hungry hound 's stomach until - bingo ! - the dog was stinking drunk .
not fit to drive the clinic veterinarian said bingo had a blood-alcohol level of 1.6 per mille which , if he were n't a canine , would have also put him well past austria 's legal driving limit of 0.5 per mille .
-lrb- not to mention how hard it would be to take a decent drivers ' license photo . -rrb-
bingo 's owner took the situation in stride .
" some catty people say hunters are often drunk , " he said .
" in my case , it 's the dog . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheney often broke into song after a few bread rolls which leaves one to wonder about the incident , some two years ago , in which us vice president dick cheney accidentally mistook his hunting buddy for a quail and fired a round of birdshot into his chest .
the big news was cheney 's late-day admission that he had drunk a beer at lunch prior to the incident .

yet the german elite seem to find no end of problems with the american political system .
after the primary win by the first african-american candidate in us history , you trot out german college professors who criticize the process itself and they ignore the substance of what just took place .
when i last visited berlin , berliners could not wait to sit me down and tell me everything that was wrong with america .
i did not respond similarly because i was , after all , a guest in their country and it would not be appropriate for me to start criticizing .

in light of the recent caucuses in the us state of iowa , europeans have no right to criticize the american election process , said readers . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . i agree that the us system of electing a president may not be perfect and can put too much emphasis how a person conducts himself / herself rather than an ability to run a country , but i still prefer it over the german system -lrb- i was born and raised in germany -rrb- .
i assume mr. unger knows that the us is a republic and not a democracy , much less a parliamentary democracy - and thanks for that .
he really thinks a party is better at selecting leaders than the people ?
all of my german friends are disillusioned with the party system because they feel they are not in the loop and have no input at all .
here i can visit with my representative or staff person and tell them what i think about legislation .
for better or for worse , our representatives listen to the input from their constituents .
i e-mail on a regular basis with my representative in the florida legislature .
as far as i am concerned , europe can keep its parliamentary democracies . - marga e.doerr , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us system does n't work in other cultures , said a reader when do you think a german with a kenyan father and a middle name of hussein will stir the hearts of say bavarian farmers ?
it will come - the war in iraq is unsustainable , breaking the country 's back , the dollar is diving and we are violating our principles of democracy .
people are thinking for the first time that the next generation will have it worse and what is the use ?
the most important thing for us is to change from the path of tyranny , ruinous war and torture - and the change will come .
we will take our country back .
we have had good luck in the past and we could use european help .
next time germany has a problem , let us rub something in your eye to make you feel worse instead of giving you hope ! - robert friedman , us many americans think we should make changes to our elections , especially in how they are financed .
but any place that has free speech , including europe , is subject to the concept of political propaganda being funded by what in the united states are called " political action committees . "
even if campaign financing were reformed to only public financing in the us those who want to influence the voters will always be able to disseminate information / propaganda to the public in proportion to their funding .
and sometimes the funding is massive .
one thing not mentioned in this article is that in the iowa caucuses the republican winner was one of the least funded candidates thus far , as was the second place democratic candidate .

both meinhof 's ex-husband kalus-heinz röhl and her daughter bettina röhl have written about meinhof and the process of disintegration of german society beginning in the spring of 1968 that led to the formation of the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- . unravelling myths bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf has been the subject of numerous books but jutta ditfurth 's biography on meinhof , released in november , disputes many of the myths that surround meinhof 's transformation from journalist to raf terrorist . in her six years researching the biography , ditfurth , a founder of the german greens party , who has since left the stage of national politics , uncovered previously unpublished material , including documents kept in archives outside of germany . " ulrike meinhof was a much more interesting , much more multi-faceted person than i used to think , " ditfurth told dw-radio .
" she was a woman who would have had a huge amount of opportunities and prospects - if only she 'd had the good fortune to have grown up somewhere other than germany . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meinhof after her arrest in june 1972 the biography also encompasses the post-war history of west germany and the politically charged climate of the 1960s and 1970s . ditfurth examines the often forgotten social conditions , such as state violence , the biased nature of german courts , the rigidity of law-making , and the terrible conditions for political prisoners that drove the raf movement , also known as the baader-meinhof gang , in what was then a flourishing west german democracy . contaminated by terrorism ? the biography is written entirely chronological and largely devoid of commentary , but critics have said that while the information used might be factual it only tells half of the story .
even meinhof 's daughter , bettina röhl , labelled the latest biography about her mother " poisonous rubbish contaminated by terrorism . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bettina röhl has written a book about her mother while ditfurth admits the book is politically biased , she said there is a big difference between writing from a left wing point of view and endorsing anarchic terrorism . " i am a leftie from a different generation and the raf was really never my cup of tea , " she said .
" i always drew a distinct line and sharply criticised their terrorist acts . " far from helping her , ditfurth said her political credentials as former leader of the german green 's left wing and her well documented opposition to the red army faction actually made researching the biography more difficult . " i was considered an outsider and was dealt with by people in certain raf circles with a lot of scepticism , " she said .
" but still i did my best to find out all the things that i had ever wanted to know . " while ditfurth is no apologist and she suggested that meinhof 's path was wrong , she also said it was wholly understandable . ditfurth is not the first to be accused of crossing the line between writing about the raf and supporting the raf – in 2002 critics said a film about raf co-founder andreas baader " glamorized the leader .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : german state elections in hesse and lower saxony german ex-minister warns against own party in key state poll immigrant groups protest against koch 's justice plans germany mulls extending voting rights to foreigners german ex-chancellor criticizes xenophobic election campaign politics -pipe- 07.01.2008 state election policies reveal extent of divide in german coalition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the state polls are seen as the starting pistol for the 2009 general election campiagn state elections this year are likely to be the catalyst for open war between the country 's ruling coalition partners .
both parties are attempting to stake out their ground ahead of a 2009 federal election . as things stand , chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- counterparts appear to be barely holding their fractious relationship together .
once the voters go to the polls in state elections this year , divisions over two key policy issues could see the brittle façade finally shatter . the wrangling over a proposed national minimum wage , championed by the spd , and a conservative-led plan to crackdown on juvenile crime are the issues likely to dominate the first elections , taking place in hessen and lower saxony in late january and in hamburg in february .
bavaria will vote in september .
the results of the state elections could indicate how the general election in 2009 could play out . the way each party makes its arguments and the results of the polls in relation to the issues may drive the current wedge between the coalition partners deeper , effectively splitting the government .
the spd have set the call for a national minimum wage at the heart of their campaign in the key state polls , much to the chagrin of the cdu . minimum wage central to spd campaign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the campaign for no wage under 7.50 euros is popular among labor unionists at the launch of the campaign , peter struck , the head of the spd 's parliamentary group , announced that the social democrats intended to harness the strong public backing for a minimum hourly wage of 7.50 euros -lrb- $ 10.77 -rrb- in the three regional races . " we will start petition drives during the state elections , " struck said in december .
" then the voters will have their say .
we will make the state elections and the general election in 2009 into a referendum on the minimum wage . " the social democrats , who have been trailing the conservatives in the polls by around 10 points for several months , argue that europe 's biggest economy must ensure that wages are high enough to keep workers above the poverty level .
germany is one of the few countries in the eu without a national minimum wage , though it does have a series of industry-specific wage agreements . many leading conservative members , the chancellor included , have reacted angrily to the spd 's stance , saying that an across-the-board minimum wage would be a job killer , driving companies to eastern europe and asia where pay is lower . merkel favors industry control on wages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor has led the opposition to the proposal at the launch of the cdu election program on saturday , the party ruled out a debate on the minimum wage , defiantly putting itself in opposition to the spd 's central election theme . merkel has said that the national minimum wage is " not the right answer " and has reiterated her support for the traditional practice of leaving unions and employers to negotiate wage levels in each industry . meanwhile , the conservatives seem intent on fighting the state elections on a law and order ticket , riling the spd in the process . the cdu leadership has called for stiffer penalties for juveniles convicted of violent crimes , proposing an increase in the maximum sentence for young people convicted of serious offences from 10 to 15 years . the party has also called for a " warning shot " period of detention for those given probation for violent crimes and the introduction of boot camps where young offenders could be sent for re-education .
under the new cdu proposals , rules for deporting foreigners convicted of serious crimes would also be eased . conservatives react to upsurge in violent crime bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violent crime has been grabbing the headlines " i think ' warning-shot arrests ' -lsb- short periods in detention -rsb- and boot camps could indeed be a sensible supplement to current laws , " merkel said .
" it could turn young people around so they do not wind up in prison . " the proposals , in line with those put forward by roland koch , the under-pressure cdu premier of hesse , who is seeking a third term of office on jan .
27 , come after a spate of violent attacks across germany . " how much are we prepared to take from a small proportion of violent youths , who frequently have a foreign background , " koch said in an interview after the attack , which has been repeatedly broadcast on television . " something has to be done , " merkel added .
" there is no point in delaying matters .
it is unacceptable that many people do not dare ride the subway at night because they are afraid of violence ... we need the feeling of personal security again in germany . " -lrb- the social democrats -rrb- can not close their eyes to the fact that 43 percent of all violent crimes in germany are committed by people who are under the age of 21 and that among them , nearly half are foreign-born youth , " she said . cdu accused of targeting foreigners bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch -lrb- l . -rrb- and interior minister volker bouffier promote a " secure life " the social democrats have accused koch and the conservatives of fuelling anti-foreigner sentiment in order to gain re-election and said existing laws were sufficient to punish violent offenders . however , spd leader kurt beck conceded that steps need to be taken to combat the upsurge in youth crime as long they involved better application of current laws instead of introducing new legislation . " this is better than taking hasty action arising solely from motives related to elections , " beck told the news magazine der spiegel . it is unlikely that any further concessions will be made by either party as the coalition partners plot their own slow and potentially bitter courses towards the 2009 general election . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

both meinhof 's ex-husband kalus-heinz röhl and her daughter bettina röhl have written about meinhof and the process of disintegration of german society beginning in the spring of 1968 that led to the formation of the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- . unravelling myths bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf has been the subject of numerous books but jutta ditfurth 's biography on meinhof , released in november , disputes many of the myths that surround meinhof 's transformation from journalist to raf terrorist . in her six years researching the biography , ditfurth , a founder of the german greens party , who has since left the stage of national politics , uncovered previously unpublished material , including documents kept in archives outside of germany . " ulrike meinhof was a much more interesting , much more multi-faceted person than i used to think , " ditfurth told dw-radio .
" she was a woman who would have had a huge amount of opportunities and prospects - if only she 'd had the good fortune to have grown up somewhere other than germany . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meinhof after her arrest in june 1972 the biography also encompasses the post-war history of west germany and the politically charged climate of the 1960s and 1970s . ditfurth examines the often forgotten social conditions , such as state violence , the biased nature of german courts , the rigidity of law-making , and the terrible conditions for political prisoners that drove the raf movement , also known as the baader-meinhof gang , in what was then a flourishing west german democracy . contaminated by terrorism ? the biography is written entirely chronological and largely devoid of commentary , but critics have said that while the information used might be factual it only tells half of the story .
even meinhof 's daughter , bettina röhl , labelled the latest biography about her mother " poisonous rubbish contaminated by terrorism . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bettina röhl has written a book about her mother while ditfurth admits the book is politically biased , she said there is a big difference between writing from a left wing point of view and endorsing anarchic terrorism . " i am a leftie from a different generation and the raf was really never my cup of tea , " she said .
" i always drew a distinct line and sharply criticised their terrorist acts . " far from helping her , ditfurth said her political credentials as former leader of the german green 's left wing and her well documented opposition to the red army faction actually made researching the biography more difficult . " i was considered an outsider and was dealt with by people in certain raf circles with a lot of scepticism , " she said .
" but still i did my best to find out all the things that i had ever wanted to know . " while ditfurth is no apologist and she suggested that meinhof 's path was wrong , she also said it was wholly understandable . ditfurth is not the first to be accused of crossing the line between writing about the raf and supporting the raf – in 2002 critics said a film about raf co-founder andreas baader " glamorized the leader .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : tackling youth crime german conservatives want crackdown on youth crime politicians call for tougher laws against young offenders conservative cdu turns youth crime debate into election issue german plan to criminalize teen sex put on back burner politics -pipe- 07.01.2008 squeezed in state poll , german politician pulls out old tricks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we have too many criminal young foreigners , " koch has said a senior figure in chancellor merkel 's conservative party has focused his re-election campaign in a regional poll on crime , in particular offenses by foreigners .
it 's not the first time the party has used such tactics . seeking a third consecutive term as leader of the prosperous western german state of hesse , roland koch has made immigration the centerpiece of his campaign , stirring memories of a similar election bid almost a decade ago . facing a strong challenge from his social democratic challenger who is focusing on demands for a national minimum wage , koch has seized on a recent violent attack on a german pensioner by two young immigrants on a munich subway train to call for the deportation of " criminal foreigners " and urge an end to " multicultural " coddling of immigrants . the attack , which left the 76-year-old victim with a fractured skull , was captured on close circuit cameras and aired for days on german television . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch is no stranger to controversy " how much are we prepared to take from a small proportion of violent youths , who frequently have a foreign background ? "
koch , once a rising star but now struggling , told mass circulation tabloid bild .
" we have spent too long showing a strange sociological understanding for groups that consciously commit violence as ethnic minorities . " koch 's comments on young immigrant criminals follow a proposal last month for a ban on students wearing the all-encompassing burqa in schools even though there was no reported incident of it . playing with fire while koch 's comments have sparked an outcry among left-wing politicians and immigrant groups and fuelled a heated debate on juvenile crime , political observers point out that it 's not the first time the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- has used anti-immigrant rhetoric to gain political mileage . " the cdu is a highly pragmatic party that does n't shy away from using the anti-foreigner card to reinforce prejudices and appeal to right-wing elements in the population , " said peter lösche , a retired professor of political science at the university of göttingen .
" it 's done it before and had success with it . " in 1999 , koch used criticism of immigration to oust a center-left administration and win the hesse state election .
he launched a successful signature campaign in which his party hit out against federal government plans to introduce dual citizenship for foreign citizens living in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu ran a notorious campaign against skilled indian software specialists in 2000 , another cdu politician , jürgen rüttgers , of north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state , unleashed a campaign against proposed " green cards " for indian software engineers .
his slogan , " kinder statt inder " or " children instead of indians " referred to a preference for home-grown it talent over skilled foreign workers .
while he failed to win that election , he did become the state 's premier in 2005 . members of the cdu 's sister bavarian party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , have often used anti-immigrant rhetoric in their speeches , most notably former bavarian premier edmund stoiber . germany is home to 15 million people of immigrant background , making up about 18 percent of the population .
most of them came as foreign " guest workers " from turkey and italy to help rebuild the country after the war and stayed on . many takers for anti-immigrant rhetoric ? some point out that koch 's populism and anti-immigrant campaigning is not out of place in hesse , home to around 6.1 million people and the city of frankfurt , one of europe 's major financial markets . " the cdu in hesse has always been a law and order party and is known for its ultra-conservative wing , " said gero neugebauer , a political scientist at berlin 's free university .
" koch 's current campaign is an obvious attempt to mobilize this hard core of its supporters who the cdu fears it might lose to far-right parties . " while far-right parties are largely successful in former communist eastern germany - the anti-immigrant npd is represented in two of five state assemblies - experts underline that xenophobic tendencies also exist among voters of mainstream political parties in the western part of the country . " hostility against foreigners and immigrants is equally widespread in western germany , too , " said elmar brähler from the university of leipzig , who carried out a study in 2006 for the friedrich ebert foundation on right-wing extremism in germany .
" the phenomenon is worst among those over the age of 60 . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 68 percent of the cdu 's members are older than 50 analysts say it 's no coincidence koch is appealing to an older generation of conservative voters who are increasingly important to his re-election bid and those of conservative premiers in other states . according to the party 's latest statistics , cdu membership has fallen from 638,000 in 1999 to 541,289 at the end of sept 2007 .
around 68 percent of the members are older than 50 , compared with 14 percent in the age group 16 to 39 . " whipping up fears about security after a brutal attack on the munich subway is a sure tactic of getting the attention of these older voters , " neugebauer said . minimum wage may be a vote-getter this time while koch 's anti-foreigner rhetoric has put further strain on his party 's uneasy grand coalition with the social democrats at the federal level , experts say chancellor angela merkel is unlikely to publicly rein in koch for fear of losing an economically and politically important state that the cdu has ruled for almost a decade . polls indicate that the spd has made huge gains in hesse and that koch is struggling to keep his absolute majority . merkel herself has talked often about the need to integrate the country 's 2.3 million muslims , most of who are of turkish origin , but says immigrants must accept german culture .
an opponent of turkey 's eu membership , merkel won thunderous applause at a recent party conference for saying mosques should not dwarf churches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say voters are more interested in getting decent wages while the outcome of the election in hesse is still open , some believe that the cdu 's tactic of using stirring fears of immigration as a vote-getter may no longer work this time . the spd 's push for a national minimum wage in an effort to dethrone koch - it 's opposed by merkel 's cdu - has wide public support and comes at a time when fears about economic uncertainty are growing , said richard stöss , a politics professor at berlin 's free university . " hesse is home to lots of industry and factories and an issue like a national minimum wage is likely to resonate far better with voters than fears of immigration , " he said . sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's not the first time the party has used such tactics . seeking a third consecutive term as leader of the prosperous western german state of hesse , roland koch has made immigration the centerpiece of his campaign , stirring memories of a similar election bid almost a decade ago . facing a strong challenge from his social democratic challenger who is focusing on demands for a national minimum wage , koch has seized on a recent violent attack on a german pensioner by two young immigrants on a munich subway train to call for the deportation of " criminal foreigners " and urge an end to " multicultural " coddling of immigrants . the attack , which left the 76-year-old victim with a fractured skull , was captured on close circuit cameras and aired for days on german television . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch is no stranger to controversy " how much are we prepared to take from a small proportion of violent youths , who frequently have a foreign background ? "
koch , once a rising star but now struggling , told mass circulation tabloid bild .
" we have spent too long showing a strange sociological understanding for groups that consciously commit violence as ethnic minorities . " koch 's comments on young immigrant criminals follow a proposal last month for a ban on students wearing the all-encompassing burqa in schools even though there was no reported incident of it . playing with fire while koch 's comments have sparked an outcry among left-wing politicians and immigrant groups and fuelled a heated debate on juvenile crime , political observers point out that it 's not the first time the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- has used anti-immigrant rhetoric to gain political mileage . " the cdu is a highly pragmatic party that does n't shy away from using the anti-foreigner card to reinforce prejudices and appeal to right-wing elements in the population , " said peter lösche , a retired professor of political science at the university of göttingen .
" it 's done it before and had success with it . " in 1999 , koch used criticism of immigration to oust a center-left administration and win the hesse state election .
he launched a successful signature campaign in which his party hit out against federal government plans to introduce dual citizenship for foreign citizens living in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cdu ran a notorious campaign against skilled indian software specialists in 2000 , another cdu politician , jürgen rüttgers , of north rhine-westphalia , germany 's most populous state , unleashed a campaign against proposed " green cards " for indian software engineers .
his slogan , " kinder statt inder " or " children instead of indians " referred to a preference for home-grown it talent over skilled foreign workers .
while he failed to win that election , he did become the state 's premier in 2005 . members of the cdu 's sister bavarian party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , have often used anti-immigrant rhetoric in their speeches , most notably former bavarian premier edmund stoiber . germany is home to 15 million people of immigrant background , making up about 18 percent of the population .
most of them came as foreign " guest workers " from turkey and italy to help rebuild the country after the war and stayed on . many takers for anti-immigrant rhetoric ? some point out that koch 's populism and anti-immigrant campaigning is not out of place in hesse , home to around 6.1 million people and the city of frankfurt , one of europe 's major financial markets . " the cdu in hesse has always been a law and order party and is known for its ultra-conservative wing , " said gero neugebauer , a political scientist at berlin 's free university .
" koch 's current campaign is an obvious attempt to mobilize this hard core of its supporters who the cdu fears it might lose to far-right parties . " while far-right parties are largely successful in former communist eastern germany - the anti-immigrant npd is represented in two of five state assemblies - experts underline that xenophobic tendencies also exist among voters of mainstream political parties in the western part of the country . " hostility against foreigners and immigrants is equally widespread in western germany , too , " said elmar brähler from the university of leipzig , who carried out a study in 2006 for the friedrich ebert foundation on right-wing extremism in germany .
" the phenomenon is worst among those over the age of 60 . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : around 68 percent of the cdu 's members are older than 50 analysts say it 's no coincidence koch is appealing to an older generation of conservative voters who are increasingly important to his re-election bid and those of conservative premiers in other states . according to the party 's latest statistics , cdu membership has fallen from 638,000 in 1999 to 541,289 at the end of sept 2007 .
around 68 percent of the members are older than 50 , compared with 14 percent in the age group 16 to 39 . " whipping up fears about security after a brutal attack on the munich subway is a sure tactic of getting the attention of these older voters , " neugebauer said . minimum wage may be a vote-getter this time while koch 's anti-foreigner rhetoric has put further strain on his party 's uneasy grand coalition with the social democrats at the federal level , experts say chancellor angela merkel is unlikely to publicly rein in koch for fear of losing an economically and politically important state that the cdu has ruled for almost a decade . polls indicate that the spd has made huge gains in hesse and that koch is struggling to keep his absolute majority . merkel herself has talked often about the need to integrate the country 's 2.3 million muslims , most of who are of turkish origin , but says immigrants must accept german culture .
an opponent of turkey 's eu membership , merkel won thunderous applause at a recent party conference for saying mosques should not dwarf churches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some say voters are more interested in getting decent wages while the outcome of the election in hesse is still open , some believe that the cdu 's tactic of using stirring fears of immigration as a vote-getter may no longer work this time . the spd 's push for a national minimum wage in an effort to dethrone koch - it 's opposed by merkel 's cdu - has wide public support and comes at a time when fears about economic uncertainty are growing , said richard stöss , a politics professor at berlin 's free university .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de holocaust -pipe- 07.01.2008 holocaust memorial group angry over rail company charges großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : margot kleinberger , who lived through the holocaust , visited the exhibit in frankfurt organizers of a rolling exhibit that highlights the role of the german transport system in the holocaust have complained of a lack of support from germany 's largest national railway company . the citizens ' action group that created the train of commemoration , a vintage steam locomotive hauling two carriages containing pictures of child holocaust victims , has begun touring german cities since early november .
it is to reach the auschwitz death camp in poland on may 8 . but the group claims it has fought resistance from federally owned german railway concern deutsche bahn every step of the way .
representatives are particularly angry that they have to pay the same fees as any other private train operator to use the german railway tracks , despite the company 's historic involvement in the transports . deutsche bahn acknowledged on friday , jan .
4 , that it was charging the group the same toll for track use as other private train operators .
a bahn spokesman said the company had to treat all customers equally . bahn 's historic responsibility the train of commemoration group argues that the bahn must face up to its historic responsibility as the transport provider to the nazis .
it said the tens of thousands of euros of tolls charged to the rolling exhibit were " in effect a boycott of this public commemoration . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibit is based on a similar one by nazi hunter beate klarsfeld the exhibition uses letters and biographies to show how jewish children were caught up in the nazi machinery of death and taken to the gas chambers in cattle wagons . the german citizens ' initiative behind the exhibit was formed by a group of journalists , artists , lawyers and academics , in the wake of a 2003 french exhibition organized by french nazi hunters and activists beate and serge klarsfeld .
the klarsfeld exhibit , which focused on the deportation of 11,000 jewish children via rail from france to nazi death camps , was shown in french train stations . deutsche bahn denied a request to display the french exhibit in german train stations . " that 's when we got the idea to do our own exhibit , " journalist hans-ruediger minow , spokesman for the train of commemoration project , told germany 's mitteldeutsche zeitung newspaper . no exceptions to the rule , bahn says the train of commemoration group came up with the notion of creating an exhibit that would symbolically travel through the country on the very railways that were used in the deportations .

contergan , a sedative which contained the active ingredient thalidomide , was prescribed to pregnant women in the late 1950s , and caused their fetuses to be born with severely shortened limbs , or in some cases , no limbs at all .
around half of the 10,000 thalidomide victims worldwide were born in west germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas meyer the president of germany 's association of contergan victims , andreas meyer , says the tragedy has never been fully investigated , nor is he happy with what he says is grünenthal 's silence on the issue .
the company has never formally apologized , although in the past month , it has begun meeting with victims ' representatives seeking an improved health and financial situation for the some 2,700 thalidomide victims still living in germany .
" we want to know exactly what happened , " meyer said , adding that he was not prepared to accept an apology on its own without the appropriate compensation .
more financial aid needed , victims say thalidomide victims say a compensation fund set up in 1970 has been exhausted and that many now need extra help as arthritis and age bring pain after a lifetime of unnatural movement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's thalidomide babies were often raised and schooled apart from other children grünenthal had said that the 110 million deutsche marks -lrb- 56.3 million euros or $ 83 million at current rates -rrb- it paid into a trust in 1971 was a final settlement of all claims in germany .
the modest monthly stipends of 545 euros victims currently receive are entirely funded by the government .
among the victims ' demands is a six-fold increase in these monthly payments to an amount between 2,100 and 3,500 euros , as well as a one-time compensation payment of around 1 million euros per victim .
the victims ' representatives are planning a parliamentary campaign to make their case to both the federal government and grünenthal .
" an independent lifestyle is not possible with the current level of monthly payments , " said udo herterich of the regional thalidomide victims ' association in the state of north rhine-westphalia .
" we 're getting older , we 're suffering more from the consequences of our disabilities and we need more and more help . "
grünenthal ceo " very moved " the victims ' associations were hopeful that grünenthal would reassess its position following an initial meeting with employees last month .
grünenthal ceo sebastian wirtz described the meeting as " very moving , " and said that he and his family regretted very much the events of 50 years ago .
" even though i had n't been born at that point , as a family member of the third generation , i would like to try , together with those affected , to come to terms with the contergan tragedy , " wirtz said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from the tv drama " eine einzige tablette " -lrb- a single pill -rrb- on the weekend , various associations of german contergan victims joined forces with the international contergan alliance , made up of the national associations of great britain , spain , sweden and canada .
the british alliance has already attained monthly payments of between 2,100 and 3,500 euros for its members .

in light of the recent caucuses in the us state of iowa , europeans have no right to criticize the american election process , said readers . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . i agree that the us system of electing a president may not be perfect and can put too much emphasis how a person conducts himself / herself rather than an ability to run a country , but i still prefer it over the german system -lrb- i was born and raised in germany -rrb- .
i assume mr. unger knows that the us is a republic and not a democracy , much less a parliamentary democracy - and thanks for that .
he really thinks a party is better at selecting leaders than the people ?
all of my german friends are disillusioned with the party system because they feel they are not in the loop and have no input at all .
here i can visit with my representative or staff person and tell them what i think about legislation .
for better or for worse , our representatives listen to the input from their constituents .
i e-mail on a regular basis with my representative in the florida legislature .
as far as i am concerned , europe can keep its parliamentary democracies . - marga e.doerr , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us system does n't work in other cultures , said a reader when do you think a german with a kenyan father and a middle name of hussein will stir the hearts of say bavarian farmers ?
it will come - the war in iraq is unsustainable , breaking the country 's back , the dollar is diving and we are violating our principles of democracy .
people are thinking for the first time that the next generation will have it worse and what is the use ?
the most important thing for us is to change from the path of tyranny , ruinous war and torture - and the change will come .
we will take our country back .
we have had good luck in the past and we could use european help .
next time germany has a problem , let us rub something in your eye to make you feel worse instead of giving you hope ! - robert friedman , us many americans think we should make changes to our elections , especially in how they are financed .
but any place that has free speech , including europe , is subject to the concept of political propaganda being funded by what in the united states are called " political action committees . "
even if campaign financing were reformed to only public financing in the us those who want to influence the voters will always be able to disseminate information / propaganda to the public in proportion to their funding .
and sometimes the funding is massive .
one thing not mentioned in this article is that in the iowa caucuses the republican winner was one of the least funded candidates thus far , as was the second place democratic candidate .
indeed , the democratic winner brought record numbers of young people -lrb- under age 25 -rrb- into the political process for the first time .
messages won iowa .
" establishment " candidates on both sides were rebuked .
by far , this is the story from iowa that is worth noting . - bryan beyer , us unfortunately , you have decided to completely ignore the historical significance of barack obama 's success in favor of criticizing the us election system .
maybe you will follow up with a more socially relevant discussion if obama wins in new hampshire .
regarding the us system , it is uniquely ours , only works for us , and has largely not been transferable to other cultures .
we are americans and not europeans and our system was set up specifically rejecting anything european . - kathleen johnson , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton is not one of the candidates with a modest campaign budget no surprise here : europeans critical of the united states .
this is just another example of europe holding itself above the us .
add your " displeasure " of our political system to the never ending list .
we are so tired of hearing how superior europe is to the us that we have stopped listening and caring what you think . - e.h. day , us i have never read an article in the american press criticizing the arcane political practices in germany .
policy criticisms , yes .
we never criticized schröder 's bad hair dye when there was room for criticism .
yet the german elite seem to find no end of problems with the american political system .
after the primary win by the first african-american candidate in us history , you trot out german college professors who criticize the process itself and they ignore the substance of what just took place .
when i last visited berlin , berliners could not wait to sit me down and tell me everything that was wrong with america .
i did not respond similarly because i was , after all , a guest in their country and it would not be appropriate for me to start criticizing .
but it seems that berliners have no qualms about criticizing and complaining about a guest 's home country . - john alus , us compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

contergan , a sedative which contained the active ingredient thalidomide , was prescribed to pregnant women in the late 1950s , and caused their fetuses to be born with severely shortened limbs , or in some cases , no limbs at all .
around half of the 10,000 thalidomide victims worldwide were born in west germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas meyer the president of germany 's association of contergan victims , andreas meyer , says the tragedy has never been fully investigated , nor is he happy with what he says is grünenthal 's silence on the issue .
the company has never formally apologized , although in the past month , it has begun meeting with victims ' representatives seeking an improved health and financial situation for the some 2,700 thalidomide victims still living in germany .
" we want to know exactly what happened , " meyer said , adding that he was not prepared to accept an apology on its own without the appropriate compensation .
more financial aid needed , victims say thalidomide victims say a compensation fund set up in 1970 has been exhausted and that many now need extra help as arthritis and age bring pain after a lifetime of unnatural movement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's thalidomide babies were often raised and schooled apart from other children grünenthal had said that the 110 million deutsche marks -lrb- 56.3 million euros or $ 83 million at current rates -rrb- it paid into a trust in 1971 was a final settlement of all claims in germany .
the modest monthly stipends of 545 euros victims currently receive are entirely funded by the government .
among the victims ' demands is a six-fold increase in these monthly payments to an amount between 2,100 and 3,500 euros , as well as a one-time compensation payment of around 1 million euros per victim .
the victims ' representatives are planning a parliamentary campaign to make their case to both the federal government and grünenthal .
" an independent lifestyle is not possible with the current level of monthly payments , " said udo herterich of the regional thalidomide victims ' association in the state of north rhine-westphalia .
" we 're getting older , we 're suffering more from the consequences of our disabilities and we need more and more help . "
grünenthal ceo " very moved " the victims ' associations were hopeful that grünenthal would reassess its position following an initial meeting with employees last month .
grünenthal ceo sebastian wirtz described the meeting as " very moving , " and said that he and his family regretted very much the events of 50 years ago .
" even though i had n't been born at that point , as a family member of the third generation , i would like to try , together with those affected , to come to terms with the contergan tragedy , " wirtz said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from the tv drama " eine einzige tablette " -lrb- a single pill -rrb- on the weekend , various associations of german contergan victims joined forces with the international contergan alliance , made up of the national associations of great britain , spain , sweden and canada .
the british alliance has already attained monthly payments of between 2,100 and 3,500 euros for its members .
the thalidomide dispute again made headlines in germany following a two-part television drama that aired in november about parents who struggle for justice after their daughter is born with only one leg and shortened arms . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

contergan , a sedative which contained the active ingredient thalidomide , was prescribed to pregnant women in the late 1950s , and caused their fetuses to be born with severely shortened limbs , or in some cases , no limbs at all .
around half of the 10,000 thalidomide victims worldwide were born in west germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas meyer the president of germany 's association of contergan victims , andreas meyer , says the tragedy has never been fully investigated , nor is he happy with what he says is grünenthal 's silence on the issue .
the company has never formally apologized , although in the past month , it has begun meeting with victims ' representatives seeking an improved health and financial situation for the some 2,700 thalidomide victims still living in germany .
" we want to know exactly what happened , " meyer said , adding that he was not prepared to accept an apology on its own without the appropriate compensation .
more financial aid needed , victims say thalidomide victims say a compensation fund set up in 1970 has been exhausted and that many now need extra help as arthritis and age bring pain after a lifetime of unnatural movement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's thalidomide babies were often raised and schooled apart from other children grünenthal had said that the 110 million deutsche marks -lrb- 56.3 million euros or $ 83 million at current rates -rrb- it paid into a trust in 1971 was a final settlement of all claims in germany .
the modest monthly stipends of 545 euros victims currently receive are entirely funded by the government .
among the victims ' demands is a six-fold increase in these monthly payments to an amount between 2,100 and 3,500 euros , as well as a one-time compensation payment of around 1 million euros per victim .
the victims ' representatives are planning a parliamentary campaign to make their case to both the federal government and grünenthal .
" an independent lifestyle is not possible with the current level of monthly payments , " said udo herterich of the regional thalidomide victims ' association in the state of north rhine-westphalia .
" we 're getting older , we 're suffering more from the consequences of our disabilities and we need more and more help . "
grünenthal ceo " very moved " the victims ' associations were hopeful that grünenthal would reassess its position following an initial meeting with employees last month .

a three-year-old , 40 kilogram -lrb- 88 lb -rrb- labrador retriever named bingo , to be exact ?
that question recently arose in austria , after a hunter in the mountain town of bad goisern realized his trusty pet could barely stay on its feet .
he rushed the dog to the vet , complaining that along with all the bobbing and weaving , the animal 's breath " smelled more like a beer garden than a doghouse . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in holland , they make non-alchoholic beer for dogs oh , no .
the hunter 's liquor stocks were all accounted for .
what was missing , though , was a half a kilo -lrb- 1 lb . -rrb- of freshly prepared bread dough , which never quite made it from the rising board into the oven .
instead , it fermented inside the hungry hound 's stomach until - bingo ! - the dog was stinking drunk .
not fit to drive the clinic veterinarian said bingo had a blood-alcohol level of 1.6 per mille which , if he were n't a canine , would have also put him well past austria 's legal driving limit of 0.5 per mille .
-lrb- not to mention how hard it would be to take a decent drivers ' license photo . -rrb-

it is to reach the auschwitz death camp in poland on may 8 . but the group claims it has fought resistance from federally owned german railway concern deutsche bahn every step of the way .
representatives are particularly angry that they have to pay the same fees as any other private train operator to use the german railway tracks , despite the company 's historic involvement in the transports . deutsche bahn acknowledged on friday , jan .
4 , that it was charging the group the same toll for track use as other private train operators .
a bahn spokesman said the company had to treat all customers equally . bahn 's historic responsibility the train of commemoration group argues that the bahn must face up to its historic responsibility as the transport provider to the nazis .
it said the tens of thousands of euros of tolls charged to the rolling exhibit were " in effect a boycott of this public commemoration . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibit is based on a similar one by nazi hunter beate klarsfeld the exhibition uses letters and biographies to show how jewish children were caught up in the nazi machinery of death and taken to the gas chambers in cattle wagons . the german citizens ' initiative behind the exhibit was formed by a group of journalists , artists , lawyers and academics , in the wake of a 2003 french exhibition organized by french nazi hunters and activists beate and serge klarsfeld .
the klarsfeld exhibit , which focused on the deportation of 11,000 jewish children via rail from france to nazi death camps , was shown in french train stations . deutsche bahn denied a request to display the french exhibit in german train stations . " that 's when we got the idea to do our own exhibit , " journalist hans-ruediger minow , spokesman for the train of commemoration project , told germany 's mitteldeutsche zeitung newspaper . no exceptions to the rule , bahn says the train of commemoration group came up with the notion of creating an exhibit that would symbolically travel through the country on the very railways that were used in the deportations .
but both deutsche bahn and the german transportation ministry , which issued the transport orders under the nazi regime , failed to show interest in the project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn is charging the project to use its rails susanne kill , corporate historian for deutsche bahn , told the mitteldeutsche zeitung that the company " is processing its nazi history in numerous projects of its own . "
she added that deutsche bahn would be bringing its own traveling exhibit to appropriate train stations . moreover , she said , " deutsche bahn ca n't allow free use of the rails in individual cases . " earnings could go to charity according to german law , anyone is allowed to use the railways and train stations - as long as they meet certain standards , and can pay the costs . minow is now trying to drum up support for his cause . " we expect protests in germany and internationally until deutsche bahn and the ministry of transport see reason , " he told the leftist newspaper neues deutschland on saturday . a transportation ministry spokesman told the dpa news agency that deutsche bahn was considering to donate the income from the train of commemoration in the form of a corporate charitable grant . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : german state elections in hesse and lower saxony german ex-minister warns against own party in key state poll immigrant groups protest against koch 's justice plans germany mulls extending voting rights to foreigners german ex-chancellor criticizes xenophobic election campaign politics -pipe- 07.01.2008 state election policies reveal extent of divide in german coalition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the state polls are seen as the starting pistol for the 2009 general election campiagn state elections this year are likely to be the catalyst for open war between the country 's ruling coalition partners .
both parties are attempting to stake out their ground ahead of a 2009 federal election . as things stand , chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- counterparts appear to be barely holding their fractious relationship together .
once the voters go to the polls in state elections this year , divisions over two key policy issues could see the brittle façade finally shatter . the wrangling over a proposed national minimum wage , championed by the spd , and a conservative-led plan to crackdown on juvenile crime are the issues likely to dominate the first elections , taking place in hessen and lower saxony in late january and in hamburg in february .
bavaria will vote in september .
the results of the state elections could indicate how the general election in 2009 could play out . the way each party makes its arguments and the results of the polls in relation to the issues may drive the current wedge between the coalition partners deeper , effectively splitting the government .
the spd have set the call for a national minimum wage at the heart of their campaign in the key state polls , much to the chagrin of the cdu . minimum wage central to spd campaign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the campaign for no wage under 7.50 euros is popular among labor unionists at the launch of the campaign , peter struck , the head of the spd 's parliamentary group , announced that the social democrats intended to harness the strong public backing for a minimum hourly wage of 7.50 euros -lrb- $ 10.77 -rrb- in the three regional races . " we will start petition drives during the state elections , " struck said in december .
" then the voters will have their say .
we will make the state elections and the general election in 2009 into a referendum on the minimum wage .

in karlsruhe on thursday , a baby girl was found dead in a similar baby hatch ; officials say she had likely died before being left there .
in both cases , there are no clues as to the identity of the parents .
baby hatches have existed in germany since the 19th century in the hope of preventing infanticide by giving desperate mothers a safe place to leave their unwanted babies .
but they have always been controversial , mainly because it is illegal to give birth anonymously in germany .
critics of the hatches say they help women circumvent the law .
but voices on the other side of the debate say that anonymous births will take place no matter what the law says , and that it is better to provide mothers who feel compelled to give birth in secret an anonymous drop-off point for their babies .
calls to legalize anonymous births now , the two incidents in hanover and karlsruhe are rekindling the anonymous birth debate .
both government and protestant church officials in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg have renewed calls for legalizing anonymous births , which would give pregnant women the option of delivering in a hospital without stating their name .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : legalizing anonymous birth could save the lives of as many as 50 babies a year , experts say the state of baden-württemberg has long been a proponent of legal anonymous births in germany and , together with the state of bavaria , has drawn up draft legislation .
but while the draft has frequently been up for discussion , it has never received the necessary majority from all the committees involved , according to a spokesperson from the state justice ministry .
according to statistics from the regional government in stuttgart , 40 to 50 babies are born in secret without medical assistance each year nationwide , and less than half survive .
having the option of giving birth anonymously in a hospital would reduce the risks for both mother and child , proponents argue .
officials discuss how to help desperate moms in the eastern german state of lower saxony , social minister mechthild ross-luttmann said she intends to talk with those organizations that sponsor baby hatches about ways to improve the service .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could hatches be part of a support concept for pregnant women in need ?
" perhaps there 's a need for improvement at some of the hatches , " she told german news agency dpa , adding that signs with instructions in several languages would be a sensible addition .
a spokeswoman from the free-market liberal free democratic party 's parliamentary group said that the cases in hanover and karlsruhe should not result in criticism of baby hatches .
instead , they should inspire more discussion of how to give such services a legal framework , and how best to help desperate mothers-to-be .
hanover 's regional bishop , margot kässmann , an outspoken proponent of baby hatches , also rejected criticism of the service .
baby hatches could be " part of a broader concept to help pregnant women in need . " dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is to reach the auschwitz death camp in poland on may 8 . but the group claims it has fought resistance from federally owned german railway concern deutsche bahn every step of the way .
representatives are particularly angry that they have to pay the same fees as any other private train operator to use the german railway tracks , despite the company 's historic involvement in the transports . deutsche bahn acknowledged on friday , jan .
4 , that it was charging the group the same toll for track use as other private train operators .
a bahn spokesman said the company had to treat all customers equally . bahn 's historic responsibility the train of commemoration group argues that the bahn must face up to its historic responsibility as the transport provider to the nazis .
it said the tens of thousands of euros of tolls charged to the rolling exhibit were " in effect a boycott of this public commemoration . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibit is based on a similar one by nazi hunter beate klarsfeld the exhibition uses letters and biographies to show how jewish children were caught up in the nazi machinery of death and taken to the gas chambers in cattle wagons . the german citizens ' initiative behind the exhibit was formed by a group of journalists , artists , lawyers and academics , in the wake of a 2003 french exhibition organized by french nazi hunters and activists beate and serge klarsfeld .
the klarsfeld exhibit , which focused on the deportation of 11,000 jewish children via rail from france to nazi death camps , was shown in french train stations . deutsche bahn denied a request to display the french exhibit in german train stations . " that 's when we got the idea to do our own exhibit , " journalist hans-ruediger minow , spokesman for the train of commemoration project , told germany 's mitteldeutsche zeitung newspaper . no exceptions to the rule , bahn says the train of commemoration group came up with the notion of creating an exhibit that would symbolically travel through the country on the very railways that were used in the deportations .
but both deutsche bahn and the german transportation ministry , which issued the transport orders under the nazi regime , failed to show interest in the project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn is charging the project to use its rails susanne kill , corporate historian for deutsche bahn , told the mitteldeutsche zeitung that the company " is processing its nazi history in numerous projects of its own . "
she added that deutsche bahn would be bringing its own traveling exhibit to appropriate train stations . moreover , she said , " deutsche bahn ca n't allow free use of the rails in individual cases . " earnings could go to charity according to german law , anyone is allowed to use the railways and train stations - as long as they meet certain standards , and can pay the costs . minow is now trying to drum up support for his cause . " we expect protests in germany and internationally until deutsche bahn and the ministry of transport see reason , " he told the leftist newspaper neues deutschland on saturday . a transportation ministry spokesman told the dpa news agency that deutsche bahn was considering to donate the income from the train of commemoration in the form of a corporate charitable grant . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

both meinhof 's ex-husband kalus-heinz röhl and her daughter bettina röhl have written about meinhof and the process of disintegration of german society beginning in the spring of 1968 that led to the formation of the red army faction -lrb- raf -rrb- . unravelling myths bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the raf has been the subject of numerous books but jutta ditfurth 's biography on meinhof , released in november , disputes many of the myths that surround meinhof 's transformation from journalist to raf terrorist . in her six years researching the biography , ditfurth , a founder of the german greens party , who has since left the stage of national politics , uncovered previously unpublished material , including documents kept in archives outside of germany . " ulrike meinhof was a much more interesting , much more multi-faceted person than i used to think , " ditfurth told dw-radio .
" she was a woman who would have had a huge amount of opportunities and prospects - if only she 'd had the good fortune to have grown up somewhere other than germany . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meinhof after her arrest in june 1972 the biography also encompasses the post-war history of west germany and the politically charged climate of the 1960s and 1970s . ditfurth examines the often forgotten social conditions , such as state violence , the biased nature of german courts , the rigidity of law-making , and the terrible conditions for political prisoners that drove the raf movement , also known as the baader-meinhof gang , in what was then a flourishing west german democracy . contaminated by terrorism ? the biography is written entirely chronological and largely devoid of commentary , but critics have said that while the information used might be factual it only tells half of the story .
even meinhof 's daughter , bettina röhl , labelled the latest biography about her mother " poisonous rubbish contaminated by terrorism . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bettina röhl has written a book about her mother while ditfurth admits the book is politically biased , she said there is a big difference between writing from a left wing point of view and endorsing anarchic terrorism . " i am a leftie from a different generation and the raf was really never my cup of tea , " she said .
" i always drew a distinct line and sharply criticised their terrorist acts . " far from helping her , ditfurth said her political credentials as former leader of the german green 's left wing and her well documented opposition to the red army faction actually made researching the biography more difficult . " i was considered an outsider and was dealt with by people in certain raf circles with a lot of scepticism , " she said .
" but still i did my best to find out all the things that i had ever wanted to know . " while ditfurth is no apologist and she suggested that meinhof 's path was wrong , she also said it was wholly understandable . ditfurth is not the first to be accused of crossing the line between writing about the raf and supporting the raf – in 2002 critics said a film about raf co-founder andreas baader " glamorized the leader .

now , it seems , it 's not only adoring crowds who rate him highly . critics and fans alike marveled at the diminutive playmaker 's all-round performance and eye for goal before the winter break as bremen charged up the league to devour bayern munich 's early season lead to leave the league finely poised in the second half run-in .
now it seems that diego 's brilliance has n't gone unnoticed by his peers .
despite being tantalized , teased and trounced by the little dynamo , diego 's fellow players have bestowed on him the accolade of being the best outfield player in the bundesliga in the first half of the season .
the bremen star 's nine goals which have made him the league 's joint top scorer - which is not bad considering he 's a midfielder and that he has some stiff competition - helped land 44.9 percent of the 275 votes in the survey by kicker magazine .
diego beat french midfielder franck ribery of bayern munich -lrb- 21.5 percent -rrb- into second place and dutch playmaker rafael van der vaart of sv hamburg -lrb- 16.8 percent -rrb- into third .
diego looks on target to repeat his 2006/2007 achievement of being voted the best player at the end of the season by his contemporaries .
bremen maestro in world 's top four bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego , here with robinho , is rated among the world 's best he also features in the " world 's best " list voted for by the bundesliga players .
diego sits joint fourth with compatriot ronaldinho of barcelona , while fellow brazilian kaka of ac milan tops the list .
barca 's argentinean genius lionel messi and manchester united winger cristiano ronaldo separate the selecao stars , in second and third respectively .
the top german star in kicker 's bundesliga poll was bayer leverkusen midfielder simon rolfes -lrb- 4.3 percent -rrb- who came in behind van der vaart in fourth place .
in a separate vote for goalkeepers , leverkusen 's rene adler was voted the best keeper with 35.8 percent of the vote , followed by hanover 's robert enke -lrb- 28 percent -rrb- and frank rost of sv hamburg -lrb- 11.4 percent -rrb- .
promotion suprise package wins coach plaudits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : becker 's karlsruhe are fighting for a european place edmund becker of promoted sc karlsruhe was named the bundesliga 's best coach of the season so far .
while their fortunes dipped a little before the break , becker 's boys have been a consistent top five team since august when many were tipping them to struggle for survival from the first whistle .
karlsruhe 's exploits earned their coach 39.4 percent of the players ' votes .
hamburg 's huub stevens -lrb- 31.7 percent -rrb- and hanover 's dieter hecking -lrb- 12 percent -rrb- were next .
it was n't only winners who got a mention in the kicker poll .
in the coaching " losers " category , arminia bielefeld 's ernst middendorp was deemed the biggest flop so far , followed by thomas doll of borussia dortmund .
the poll , published monday , kept all votes anonymous , allowing players to return to their clubs for post-break training without fear of reprisals .
merk the world 's best ref the kicker poll comes as germany 's soccer referees were also getting congratulations .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : markus merk remains on top of the world game after his success in 2004 and 2005 , german ref markus merk was voted the world 's best by the international federation of football history & statistics .
compatriot herbert fandel was second and slovakia 's lubos michel third .
merk officiated at the world cup in japan and korea in 2002 and germany in 2006 .
he also reffed the euro 2004 final between greece and portugal , along with 2003 champions league final .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : german state elections in hesse and lower saxony german ex-minister warns against own party in key state poll immigrant groups protest against koch 's justice plans germany mulls extending voting rights to foreigners german ex-chancellor criticizes xenophobic election campaign politics -pipe- 07.01.2008 state election policies reveal extent of divide in german coalition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the state polls are seen as the starting pistol for the 2009 general election campiagn state elections this year are likely to be the catalyst for open war between the country 's ruling coalition partners .
both parties are attempting to stake out their ground ahead of a 2009 federal election . as things stand , chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and their social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- counterparts appear to be barely holding their fractious relationship together .
once the voters go to the polls in state elections this year , divisions over two key policy issues could see the brittle façade finally shatter . the wrangling over a proposed national minimum wage , championed by the spd , and a conservative-led plan to crackdown on juvenile crime are the issues likely to dominate the first elections , taking place in hessen and lower saxony in late january and in hamburg in february .
bavaria will vote in september .
the results of the state elections could indicate how the general election in 2009 could play out . the way each party makes its arguments and the results of the polls in relation to the issues may drive the current wedge between the coalition partners deeper , effectively splitting the government .
the spd have set the call for a national minimum wage at the heart of their campaign in the key state polls , much to the chagrin of the cdu . minimum wage central to spd campaign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the campaign for no wage under 7.50 euros is popular among labor unionists at the launch of the campaign , peter struck , the head of the spd 's parliamentary group , announced that the social democrats intended to harness the strong public backing for a minimum hourly wage of 7.50 euros -lrb- $ 10.77 -rrb- in the three regional races . " we will start petition drives during the state elections , " struck said in december .
" then the voters will have their say .
we will make the state elections and the general election in 2009 into a referendum on the minimum wage . " the social democrats , who have been trailing the conservatives in the polls by around 10 points for several months , argue that europe 's biggest economy must ensure that wages are high enough to keep workers above the poverty level .
germany is one of the few countries in the eu without a national minimum wage , though it does have a series of industry-specific wage agreements . many leading conservative members , the chancellor included , have reacted angrily to the spd 's stance , saying that an across-the-board minimum wage would be a job killer , driving companies to eastern europe and asia where pay is lower . merkel favors industry control on wages bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chancellor has led the opposition to the proposal at the launch of the cdu election program on saturday , the party ruled out a debate on the minimum wage , defiantly putting itself in opposition to the spd 's central election theme . merkel has said that the national minimum wage is " not the right answer " and has reiterated her support for the traditional practice of leaving unions and employers to negotiate wage levels in each industry . meanwhile , the conservatives seem intent on fighting the state elections on a law and order ticket , riling the spd in the process . the cdu leadership has called for stiffer penalties for juveniles convicted of violent crimes , proposing an increase in the maximum sentence for young people convicted of serious offences from 10 to 15 years . the party has also called for a " warning shot " period of detention for those given probation for violent crimes and the introduction of boot camps where young offenders could be sent for re-education .
under the new cdu proposals , rules for deporting foreigners convicted of serious crimes would also be eased . conservatives react to upsurge in violent crime bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : violent crime has been grabbing the headlines " i think ' warning-shot arrests ' -lsb- short periods in detention -rsb- and boot camps could indeed be a sensible supplement to current laws , " merkel said .
" it could turn young people around so they do not wind up in prison . " the proposals , in line with those put forward by roland koch , the under-pressure cdu premier of hesse , who is seeking a third term of office on jan .
27 , come after a spate of violent attacks across germany . " how much are we prepared to take from a small proportion of violent youths , who frequently have a foreign background , " koch said in an interview after the attack , which has been repeatedly broadcast on television . " something has to be done , " merkel added .
" there is no point in delaying matters .
it is unacceptable that many people do not dare ride the subway at night because they are afraid of violence ... we need the feeling of personal security again in germany . " -lrb- the social democrats -rrb- can not close their eyes to the fact that 43 percent of all violent crimes in germany are committed by people who are under the age of 21 and that among them , nearly half are foreign-born youth , " she said . cdu accused of targeting foreigners bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch -lrb- l . -rrb- and interior minister volker bouffier promote a " secure life " the social democrats have accused koch and the conservatives of fuelling anti-foreigner sentiment in order to gain re-election and said existing laws were sufficient to punish violent offenders . however , spd leader kurt beck conceded that steps need to be taken to combat the upsurge in youth crime as long they involved better application of current laws instead of introducing new legislation . " this is better than taking hasty action arising solely from motives related to elections , " beck told the news magazine der spiegel . it is unlikely that any further concessions will be made by either party as the coalition partners plot their own slow and potentially bitter courses towards the 2009 general election . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

contergan , a sedative which contained the active ingredient thalidomide , was prescribed to pregnant women in the late 1950s , and caused their fetuses to be born with severely shortened limbs , or in some cases , no limbs at all .
around half of the 10,000 thalidomide victims worldwide were born in west germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas meyer the president of germany 's association of contergan victims , andreas meyer , says the tragedy has never been fully investigated , nor is he happy with what he says is grünenthal 's silence on the issue .
the company has never formally apologized , although in the past month , it has begun meeting with victims ' representatives seeking an improved health and financial situation for the some 2,700 thalidomide victims still living in germany .
" we want to know exactly what happened , " meyer said , adding that he was not prepared to accept an apology on its own without the appropriate compensation .
more financial aid needed , victims say thalidomide victims say a compensation fund set up in 1970 has been exhausted and that many now need extra help as arthritis and age bring pain after a lifetime of unnatural movement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's thalidomide babies were often raised and schooled apart from other children grünenthal had said that the 110 million deutsche marks -lrb- 56.3 million euros or $ 83 million at current rates -rrb- it paid into a trust in 1971 was a final settlement of all claims in germany .
the modest monthly stipends of 545 euros victims currently receive are entirely funded by the government .
among the victims ' demands is a six-fold increase in these monthly payments to an amount between 2,100 and 3,500 euros , as well as a one-time compensation payment of around 1 million euros per victim .
the victims ' representatives are planning a parliamentary campaign to make their case to both the federal government and grünenthal .
" an independent lifestyle is not possible with the current level of monthly payments , " said udo herterich of the regional thalidomide victims ' association in the state of north rhine-westphalia .
" we 're getting older , we 're suffering more from the consequences of our disabilities and we need more and more help . "
grünenthal ceo " very moved " the victims ' associations were hopeful that grünenthal would reassess its position following an initial meeting with employees last month .
grünenthal ceo sebastian wirtz described the meeting as " very moving , " and said that he and his family regretted very much the events of 50 years ago .
" even though i had n't been born at that point , as a family member of the third generation , i would like to try , together with those affected , to come to terms with the contergan tragedy , " wirtz said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scene from the tv drama " eine einzige tablette " -lrb- a single pill -rrb- on the weekend , various associations of german contergan victims joined forces with the international contergan alliance , made up of the national associations of great britain , spain , sweden and canada .
the british alliance has already attained monthly payments of between 2,100 and 3,500 euros for its members .

in light of the recent caucuses in the us state of iowa , europeans have no right to criticize the american election process , said readers . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . i agree that the us system of electing a president may not be perfect and can put too much emphasis how a person conducts himself / herself rather than an ability to run a country , but i still prefer it over the german system -lrb- i was born and raised in germany -rrb- .
i assume mr. unger knows that the us is a republic and not a democracy , much less a parliamentary democracy - and thanks for that .
he really thinks a party is better at selecting leaders than the people ?
all of my german friends are disillusioned with the party system because they feel they are not in the loop and have no input at all .
here i can visit with my representative or staff person and tell them what i think about legislation .
for better or for worse , our representatives listen to the input from their constituents .
i e-mail on a regular basis with my representative in the florida legislature .
as far as i am concerned , europe can keep its parliamentary democracies . - marga e.doerr , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us system does n't work in other cultures , said a reader when do you think a german with a kenyan father and a middle name of hussein will stir the hearts of say bavarian farmers ?
it will come - the war in iraq is unsustainable , breaking the country 's back , the dollar is diving and we are violating our principles of democracy .
people are thinking for the first time that the next generation will have it worse and what is the use ?
the most important thing for us is to change from the path of tyranny , ruinous war and torture - and the change will come .
we will take our country back .
we have had good luck in the past and we could use european help .
next time germany has a problem , let us rub something in your eye to make you feel worse instead of giving you hope ! - robert friedman , us many americans think we should make changes to our elections , especially in how they are financed .
but any place that has free speech , including europe , is subject to the concept of political propaganda being funded by what in the united states are called " political action committees . "
even if campaign financing were reformed to only public financing in the us those who want to influence the voters will always be able to disseminate information / propaganda to the public in proportion to their funding .
and sometimes the funding is massive .
one thing not mentioned in this article is that in the iowa caucuses the republican winner was one of the least funded candidates thus far , as was the second place democratic candidate .
indeed , the democratic winner brought record numbers of young people -lrb- under age 25 -rrb- into the political process for the first time .
messages won iowa .
" establishment " candidates on both sides were rebuked .
by far , this is the story from iowa that is worth noting . - bryan beyer , us unfortunately , you have decided to completely ignore the historical significance of barack obama 's success in favor of criticizing the us election system .
maybe you will follow up with a more socially relevant discussion if obama wins in new hampshire .
regarding the us system , it is uniquely ours , only works for us , and has largely not been transferable to other cultures .
we are americans and not europeans and our system was set up specifically rejecting anything european . - kathleen johnson , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clinton is not one of the candidates with a modest campaign budget no surprise here : europeans critical of the united states .
this is just another example of europe holding itself above the us .
add your " displeasure " of our political system to the never ending list .
we are so tired of hearing how superior europe is to the us that we have stopped listening and caring what you think . - e.h. day , us i have never read an article in the american press criticizing the arcane political practices in germany .
policy criticisms , yes .
we never criticized schröder 's bad hair dye when there was room for criticism .
yet the german elite seem to find no end of problems with the american political system .
after the primary win by the first african-american candidate in us history , you trot out german college professors who criticize the process itself and they ignore the substance of what just took place .
when i last visited berlin , berliners could not wait to sit me down and tell me everything that was wrong with america .
i did not respond similarly because i was , after all , a guest in their country and it would not be appropriate for me to start criticizing .
but it seems that berliners have no qualms about criticizing and complaining about a guest 's home country . - john alus , us compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de american primary system fails to impress europeans the iowa caucuses kicked off a long , costly presidential primary season in the united states .
european experts said they find the us system to be unnecessarily drawn out , expensive and outdated .
-lrb- 04.01.2008 -rrb- readers disagree on best us presidential candidate some north american readers shared their thoughts on a recent poll that found europeans preferred hillary clinton to be the next president of the united states .
-lrb- 11.12.2007 -rrb- france and germany share skeptical friendship with us just after french president nicolas sarkozy flies out of the us , german chancellor angela merkel flies in .
both european leaders have sought to improve their ties with the us , but the trio does n't agree on everything .

in karlsruhe on thursday , a baby girl was found dead in a similar baby hatch ; officials say she had likely died before being left there .
in both cases , there are no clues as to the identity of the parents .
baby hatches have existed in germany since the 19th century in the hope of preventing infanticide by giving desperate mothers a safe place to leave their unwanted babies .
but they have always been controversial , mainly because it is illegal to give birth anonymously in germany .
critics of the hatches say they help women circumvent the law .
but voices on the other side of the debate say that anonymous births will take place no matter what the law says , and that it is better to provide mothers who feel compelled to give birth in secret an anonymous drop-off point for their babies .
calls to legalize anonymous births now , the two incidents in hanover and karlsruhe are rekindling the anonymous birth debate .
both government and protestant church officials in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg have renewed calls for legalizing anonymous births , which would give pregnant women the option of delivering in a hospital without stating their name .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : legalizing anonymous birth could save the lives of as many as 50 babies a year , experts say the state of baden-württemberg has long been a proponent of legal anonymous births in germany and , together with the state of bavaria , has drawn up draft legislation .
but while the draft has frequently been up for discussion , it has never received the necessary majority from all the committees involved , according to a spokesperson from the state justice ministry .
according to statistics from the regional government in stuttgart , 40 to 50 babies are born in secret without medical assistance each year nationwide , and less than half survive .
having the option of giving birth anonymously in a hospital would reduce the risks for both mother and child , proponents argue .
officials discuss how to help desperate moms in the eastern german state of lower saxony , social minister mechthild ross-luttmann said she intends to talk with those organizations that sponsor baby hatches about ways to improve the service .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could hatches be part of a support concept for pregnant women in need ?
" perhaps there 's a need for improvement at some of the hatches , " she told german news agency dpa , adding that signs with instructions in several languages would be a sensible addition .
a spokeswoman from the free-market liberal free democratic party 's parliamentary group said that the cases in hanover and karlsruhe should not result in criticism of baby hatches .
instead , they should inspire more discussion of how to give such services a legal framework , and how best to help desperate mothers-to-be .

in karlsruhe on thursday , a baby girl was found dead in a similar baby hatch ; officials say she had likely died before being left there .
in both cases , there are no clues as to the identity of the parents .
baby hatches have existed in germany since the 19th century in the hope of preventing infanticide by giving desperate mothers a safe place to leave their unwanted babies .
but they have always been controversial , mainly because it is illegal to give birth anonymously in germany .
critics of the hatches say they help women circumvent the law .
but voices on the other side of the debate say that anonymous births will take place no matter what the law says , and that it is better to provide mothers who feel compelled to give birth in secret an anonymous drop-off point for their babies .
calls to legalize anonymous births now , the two incidents in hanover and karlsruhe are rekindling the anonymous birth debate .
both government and protestant church officials in the southwestern state of baden-württemberg have renewed calls for legalizing anonymous births , which would give pregnant women the option of delivering in a hospital without stating their name .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : legalizing anonymous birth could save the lives of as many as 50 babies a year , experts say the state of baden-württemberg has long been a proponent of legal anonymous births in germany and , together with the state of bavaria , has drawn up draft legislation .
but while the draft has frequently been up for discussion , it has never received the necessary majority from all the committees involved , according to a spokesperson from the state justice ministry .
according to statistics from the regional government in stuttgart , 40 to 50 babies are born in secret without medical assistance each year nationwide , and less than half survive .
having the option of giving birth anonymously in a hospital would reduce the risks for both mother and child , proponents argue .
officials discuss how to help desperate moms in the eastern german state of lower saxony , social minister mechthild ross-luttmann said she intends to talk with those organizations that sponsor baby hatches about ways to improve the service .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could hatches be part of a support concept for pregnant women in need ?
" perhaps there 's a need for improvement at some of the hatches , " she told german news agency dpa , adding that signs with instructions in several languages would be a sensible addition .
a spokeswoman from the free-market liberal free democratic party 's parliamentary group said that the cases in hanover and karlsruhe should not result in criticism of baby hatches .
instead , they should inspire more discussion of how to give such services a legal framework , and how best to help desperate mothers-to-be .
hanover 's regional bishop , margot kässmann , an outspoken proponent of baby hatches , also rejected criticism of the service .

the 2006 leader slipped significantly in the 2007 rankings , dropping from first to seventh place behind portugal and slovenia . " the general trend is that privacy is being extinguished in country after country , " said simon davies , director of the group .
" even those countries where we expected ongoing strong privacy protection , like germany and canada , are sinking into the mire .

the controversial legislation calls on phone companies and internet providers to store data for up to six months and allows police to access the information with a judicial warrant .
the law also permits telephone wiretapping in certain cases . the survey noted that the legislation had been passed despite strong objections .
this week , however , over 30,000 germans including privacy activists , civil rights groups filed a historic mass lawsuit against the controversial law .
protests were held in two german cities .
activists also seek to overturn the march 2006 european union data-retention directive that required germany to pass the legislation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an activist holds up a photo of german interior minister schäuble during a protest gisela piltz , domestic affairs spokeswoman for the opposition free-market liberal fdp party , said last week the data retention law " strikes at the foundation of our constitutional state . " the authors of the study also hit out at the fact that fingerprints had been added to germany 's biometric passports starting in november 2007 , video surveillance had been expanded despite protests and there was no legal protection for privacy at the workplace despite demands for it . the storing of telecommunications data and ever increasing demands by some german politicians to expand security measures were also singled out for criticism .
germany 's role in initiating and approving the prüm agreement , which facilitates cross-border criminal investigations among seven european countries , also got the thumbs-down . germany 's data protection measures are " decaying , " the survey concluded . best and the worst greece , romania and canada had the best records of 47 countries privacy international surveyed .

but one ingredient on which everyone with a pounding head and churning stomach agrees is the hair of the dog . but what if the drunken party animal is a dog ?
a three-year-old , 40 kilogram -lrb- 88 lb -rrb- labrador retriever named bingo , to be exact ?
that question recently arose in austria , after a hunter in the mountain town of bad goisern realized his trusty pet could barely stay on its feet .
he rushed the dog to the vet , complaining that along with all the bobbing and weaving , the animal 's breath " smelled more like a beer garden than a doghouse . "
fermentation follies had bingo gone on a binge-o ?
perhaps in an effort to forget his name-o ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in holland , they make non-alchoholic beer for dogs oh , no .
the hunter 's liquor stocks were all accounted for .
what was missing , though , was a half a kilo -lrb- 1 lb . -rrb- of freshly prepared bread dough , which never quite made it from the rising board into the oven .
instead , it fermented inside the hungry hound 's stomach until - bingo ! - the dog was stinking drunk .
not fit to drive the clinic veterinarian said bingo had a blood-alcohol level of 1.6 per mille which , if he were n't a canine , would have also put him well past austria 's legal driving limit of 0.5 per mille .
-lrb- not to mention how hard it would be to take a decent drivers ' license photo . -rrb-
bingo 's owner took the situation in stride .
" some catty people say hunters are often drunk , " he said .
" in my case , it 's the dog . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheney often broke into song after a few bread rolls which leaves one to wonder about the incident , some two years ago , in which us vice president dick cheney accidentally mistook his hunting buddy for a quail and fired a round of birdshot into his chest .

a total of 84 drivers were reported for drink or drug-driving , compared with 107 for the same period last year .
a total of 23 drivers were detected in the final week of the annual festive campaign .
grampian police said despite the drop they were disappointed at catching 84 people who had taken the risk .
in the final week , 14 drivers were caught in aberdeen , five in aberdeenshire and four in moray .
' foolish enough ' they were three women aged between 23 and 26 , and 20 men aged from 18 to 64 .
among them was a 19-year-old man who , on 30 december , was stopped in elgin having crashed a car .
he was found to be nearly three times the legal limit .
reports on all the drivers will be submitted to the procurator fiscal .
sgt neil morrison said : " although the festive campaign has now drawn to a close there is still a very real likelihood of being caught drink-driving .
" i would urge anyone foolish enough to risk their licence , livelihood or personal safety by drinking and driving to think again - it 's just not worth it . "
