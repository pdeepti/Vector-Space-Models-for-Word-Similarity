deutsche welle : ms schmiel , how did you choose the motto " macht.musik " ?
ilona schmiel : the ninth symphony was of course the impetus to ask how this work can be used to represent a whole program .
and that was the reason to hold the festival under the motto " macht.musik " and to follow the path of the ninth symphony from its premiere in 1824 to today .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ilona schmiel has directed the beethovenfest since 2004 beethoven 's political commitment , this utopia - the " ode to joy " by friedrich schiller , which he set to music , is a utopia - has n't lost any of its relevance .
we are still living in an age of war , suppression , hunger and many other injustices .
back in his time - the work was completed in 1824 - beethoven probably thought things would improve .
and that alone is a reason the ninth symphony can be made a focal point .
the question of how the reception of this piece continues in 2008 has always moved me because , as far as i know , there is no other work in the world that is played so often and deliberately chosen for so many different occasions .
the piece has not only been a part of triumphs , but also of many mistakes that have been made by governments , rulers and leaders , where the symphony was totally appropriated by politics and exploited for political purposes and dictatorial statements .
relatively speaking , beethoven had a lot of contact with the powerful figures of his time , and if you look back on his work - for example the " eroica , " " wellington 's victory " or " egmont " - he often expressed himself politically through his music .
but he did so quite differently in each case .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt masur will conduct the ninth at this year 's festival the issue of how he surrounded himself with powerful figures , but at the same time also left them hanging , was a central theme in his life , i think .
and it begs the question of where beethoven 's development through the symphonies leads - past a rejection of the powers that be , to a civil society .
on the one hand it is really a path beyond the worship of powerful figures - such as napoleon - but , on the other hand , he is using the civil society , which finances the music and supports the composer .
that 's is why i think this music is still so relevant and moving today .
questions about how to deal with works of music today , how music is used , what demands are placed on it , how much it needs to align with the state to be performed on certain occasions , and how music is twisted or the text is rewritten , for example , so that it fits a particular regime - the ninth symphony has already been through all of that .
who else then has used beethoven 's music to serve their own ends ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ninth symphony has echoed both east and west goebbels always had the ninth symphony played for hitler 's birthday .
the gdr -lrb- communist east germany -rrb- chose it as their national anthem , albeit with a different text .
it has been played constantly both in the east and the west .
it has become the european anthem , and since the olympic games it has also been mentioned that mao used the symphony to motivate workers in the fields .
kamikaze pilots listened to this music - i 'm jumping through time a bit - and it was also the national anthem of rhodesia .
i think no other work has ever been so globalized .
nevertheless this human message , this commitment to human kindness has survived - and you could almost say this message is indestructible .
how would you judge beethoven 's music today ?
what is the situation with " power " and " music " ?
for me personally , the power of music is at the forefront because i 'd like to keep believing in the utopia that music can change a lot .
in 2006 , we had a guest youth orchestra from south africa , where musicians with different backgrounds performed together , for example .
music can also be a social instrument .
and this power ca n't be burned onto a cd .
the reproduction of music in a concert is something exclusive .
there you can really feel the power of music - and i do n't think you can get away from it . interview : klaus gehrke -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ninth symphony has echoed both east and west goebbels always had the ninth symphony played for hitler 's birthday .
the gdr -lrb- communist east germany -rrb- chose it as their national anthem , albeit with a different text .
it has been played constantly both in the east and the west .
it has become the european anthem , and since the olympic games it has also been mentioned that mao used the symphony to motivate workers in the fields .
kamikaze pilots listened to this music - i 'm jumping through time a bit - and it was also the national anthem of rhodesia .
i think no other work has ever been so globalized .
nevertheless this human message , this commitment to human kindness has survived - and you could almost say this message is indestructible .
how would you judge beethoven 's music today ?
what is the situation with " power " and " music " ?
for me personally , the power of music is at the forefront because i 'd like to keep believing in the utopia that music can change a lot .
in 2006 , we had a guest youth orchestra from south africa , where musicians with different backgrounds performed together , for example .
music can also be a social instrument .
and this power ca n't be burned onto a cd .
the reproduction of music in a concert is something exclusive .
there you can really feel the power of music - and i do n't think you can get away from it . interview : klaus gehrke -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" in the current crisis it became necessary to make a decision , " medvedev said in a nationally televised statement tuesday , aug .
26 .
" taking into consideration the will of the people and guided by the un charter of 1970 ... and other basic international law , i have signed a decree recognizing abkhazia and south ossetia . " it is not an easy choice , but it is the only way to protect the lives of civilians , " the president said after meeting with russia 's security chiefs . medvedev signed a second decree tuesday instructing the russian foreign ministry to establish diplomatic relations with abkhazia and south ossetia and sign partnership agreements with them . ties ice over bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : resident of gori , south ossetia , received aid after their city was devastated the move is likely to deepen the wedge in russia 's relations with the west , which views south ossetia and abkhazia as part of georgia .
russian stocks fell tuesday , with traders anticipating an increase in international tension . the world now faces new rifts , former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev was quoted as saying by itar-tass news agency tuesday . " the risk of a new schism has arisen .
there is a growing threat of global chaos , " gorbachev was quoted as saying in reaction to the crisis . german chancellor angela merkel sharply criticized the decision tuesday .
speaking on a visit to the estonian capital of tallinn , merkel said medvedev 's decision was " absolutely not acceptable " and ran " contrary to international law . " " we must by consequence react united as the european union , " merkel said . she also stressed support for stronger relations between the eu and georgia , including making it easier for georgians to obtain visas to the bloc . " georgia and ukraine will be members of nato , " the chancellor said .
russia has sharply opposed nato 's eastward expansion , and both countries ' bids were turned down by alliance leaders earlier this year .
the matter is to be reconsidered at a summit in december . merkel said , however , that dialogue between nato and russia should continue . nato secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer also rejected medvedev 's decision to recognize the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia .
he questioned whether russia was truly interested in peace and security in the caucasus region , according to a statement . " this is in direct violation of numerous un security council resolutions regarding georgia 's territorial integrity , resolutions that russia itself has endorsed , " de hoop scheffer said in a statement read out by his spokeswoman . on the eve of something bigger france , which brokered the cease-fire agreement between russia and georgia , also criticized the kremlin 's decision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the georgian offensive was compared to the murder that set off world war i " we consider this a regrettable decision and i recall our attachment to the territorial integrity of georgia , " said a spokesman for the french foreign ministry . just prior to medvedev 's announcement , the european union had expressed its opposition to recognizing the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia . russia 's nato envoy , dmitry rogozin , compared the current situation to europe in 1914 on the eve of world war i , " when , because of one terrorist , leading world powers clashed , " he told the rbk daily business newspaper .
war broke out after austro-hungarian archduke franz ferdinand was assassinated in august 1914 . but russian foreign minister sergey lavrov said russia is unlikely to be subjected to international isolation . " i do n't think we should really be afraid of isolation , " he told reporters in english .
" i do n't believe this should really be a doomsday scenario .
i believe common sense should prevail . " accusations of genocide in his statement issued tuesday , medvedev condemned georgia 's offensive to reclaim south ossetia earlier this month . " on the night of august 8th , tbilisi had a choice : -lrb- georgian president -rrb- saakashvili opted for genocide , " said the russian president .
" with this choice saakashvili wiped out all hope of a peaceful coexistence of south ossetia and abkhazia under one government . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west has largely opposed recognizing the provinces russia and georgia fought a brief but bloody war over south ossetia with russia 's army moving deep into georgia after repelling the georgian offensive . on tuesday the kremlin convened the security council at the president 's black sea residence in sochi to review a plea by russia 's parliament for recognition of the two georgian breakaway regions .
russia 's powerful prime minister vladimir putin was also in attendance . the united states , a staunch ally of georgia , rebuked russia 's parliament over the resolution monday , saying it was " deeply concerned .

" in the current crisis it became necessary to make a decision , " medvedev said in a nationally televised statement tuesday , aug .
26 .
" taking into consideration the will of the people and guided by the un charter of 1970 ... and other basic international law , i have signed a decree recognizing abkhazia and south ossetia . " it is not an easy choice , but it is the only way to protect the lives of civilians , " the president said after meeting with russia 's security chiefs . medvedev signed a second decree tuesday instructing the russian foreign ministry to establish diplomatic relations with abkhazia and south ossetia and sign partnership agreements with them . ties ice over bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : resident of gori , south ossetia , received aid after their city was devastated the move is likely to deepen the wedge in russia 's relations with the west , which views south ossetia and abkhazia as part of georgia .
russian stocks fell tuesday , with traders anticipating an increase in international tension . the world now faces new rifts , former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev was quoted as saying by itar-tass news agency tuesday . " the risk of a new schism has arisen .
there is a growing threat of global chaos , " gorbachev was quoted as saying in reaction to the crisis . german chancellor angela merkel sharply criticized the decision tuesday .
speaking on a visit to the estonian capital of tallinn , merkel said medvedev 's decision was " absolutely not acceptable " and ran " contrary to international law . " " we must by consequence react united as the european union , " merkel said . she also stressed support for stronger relations between the eu and georgia , including making it easier for georgians to obtain visas to the bloc . " georgia and ukraine will be members of nato , " the chancellor said .
russia has sharply opposed nato 's eastward expansion , and both countries ' bids were turned down by alliance leaders earlier this year .

" taking into consideration the will of the people and guided by the un charter of 1970 ... and other basic international law , i have signed a decree recognizing abkhazia and south ossetia . " it is not an easy choice , but it is the only way to protect the lives of civilians , " the president said after meeting with russia 's security chiefs . medvedev signed a second decree tuesday instructing the russian foreign ministry to establish diplomatic relations with abkhazia and south ossetia and sign partnership agreements with them . ties ice over bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : resident of gori , south ossetia , received aid after their city was devastated the move is likely to deepen the wedge in russia 's relations with the west , which views south ossetia and abkhazia as part of georgia .

experts say this sparked a chain reaction in the region , which only moscow can now halt . when the west recognized kosovo 's independence half a year ago , russia 's leaders warned that the move would open a " pandora 's box " in the caucasus .
the mountainous region 's patchwork of ethnicities and states have long been difficult to reconcile into coherent nation states .
the recent , bloody 10-day war between russia and georgia over the former soviet states ' rebel region of south ossetia is the realization of that pandora 's box scenario .
the background russia has long supported georgia 's two ethnically separatist provinces of abkhazia and south ossetia , but stopped short of recognizing their independence - until now - fearing that secessions in those provinces would provide a dangerous precedent for other minority nations within the russian federation .
nevertheless , russian lawmakers this week unanimously passed a motion urging president dmitry medvedev to recognize georgia 's rebel regions as independent - 15 years after they won de facto autonomy in a war of succession from tbilisi in the early 1990s .
by some counts , over 80 percent of the populations in the regions have been issued russian passports under an especially generous russian policy that saakashvili decried as the creeping annexation of georgian territory .
the kosovo precedent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's independence set a dangerous precedence as russian tanks rolled into south ossetia on aug .
8 to push back georgia 's offensive to re-assert control , medvedev took the national stage , invoking the army in defense of russian citizens .
in a series of interviews by dpa news agency after kosovo 's independence in february , russian analysts foresaw a military flare up , but did not predict the possibility that moscow 's policy could turn to recognizing the regions .
the threat that kosovo could stand as a secessionist precedent in the caucasus had formed the kremlin 's most vivid protest to the province 's break from its ally serbia .
but while moscow is still confronted by the problems that the kosovo precedent raises , paradoxically , the comparison has now been turned into a justification of south ossetia and abkhazia 's right to self-determination .
western leaders have labeled russia 's move to recognize georgia 's regions as hypocrisy , while russian leaders hit back with the accusation that a double standard has been applied in the case of kosovo .
the resolution passed on monday argued that by its assault on civilians tbilisi had forgone all moral right over the area , drawing a direct link between russia incursion and the justification of nato 's bombing campaign in serbia in 1998 .
appealing before russian lawmakers south ossetia 's president eduard kokoity repeated what has become a maxim : " we have more political-legal grounds than kosovo does to have our independence recognized . "
but professor yury kolosov of the moscow institute of international relations threw cold water on the much-cited " kosovo precedent . "
" there is no such thing as a ' precedent ' in international law ... and , if this is a precedent , then it 's a bad one , " kolosov , an eminent member of russia 's association of international law , told dpa .
the final say in other words , the kremlin has the last word .
while the threat of recognizing the breakaway region adds to its bargaining power with the west , analysts said it would look for ways to delay such recognition , for example , by requesting the provinces hold a new referendum .
" it seems to me that now politically it would be more favorable to leave this situation hanging , " moscow-based analyst vyacheslav nikonov , head of the politika foundation , told news agency interfax on monday .
the kremlin and its allies , meanwhile , are n't deaf to its own warnings that seizing on kosovo as a precedent could spark a " chain reaction " in the region .
legal limbo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev - the ball is in his court medvedev sought to reassure the molodovan and azeri presidents - who have similar secession worries to georgia - on monday over the respective breakaway regions of nagorno karabakh and transnistria .
south ossetia 's ultimate ambition to unite with russia 's ethnically-similar region of north ossetia is no less problematic .
russia 's ties to abkhazia , which seeks only self-determination , have traditionally been stronger , as has its economic interest in the region .
a poll by the independent levada center in the aftermath of the conflict show near half of russians - or 46 percent - say south ossetia should become part of russia .
only 4 percent of those surveyed in interviews with 2,100 adults believed the province should remain part of georgia .

"
the play on words reflects the turbulent history of the ninth symphony : its repeated exploitation by powerful figures , as well as its withstanding power to move people .
deutsche welle : ms schmiel , how did you choose the motto " macht.musik " ?
ilona schmiel : the ninth symphony was of course the impetus to ask how this work can be used to represent a whole program .
and that was the reason to hold the festival under the motto " macht.musik " and to follow the path of the ninth symphony from its premiere in 1824 to today .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ilona schmiel has directed the beethovenfest since 2004 beethoven 's political commitment , this utopia - the " ode to joy " by friedrich schiller , which he set to music , is a utopia - has n't lost any of its relevance .
we are still living in an age of war , suppression , hunger and many other injustices .
back in his time - the work was completed in 1824 - beethoven probably thought things would improve .
and that alone is a reason the ninth symphony can be made a focal point .
the question of how the reception of this piece continues in 2008 has always moved me because , as far as i know , there is no other work in the world that is played so often and deliberately chosen for so many different occasions .
the piece has not only been a part of triumphs , but also of many mistakes that have been made by governments , rulers and leaders , where the symphony was totally appropriated by politics and exploited for political purposes and dictatorial statements .
relatively speaking , beethoven had a lot of contact with the powerful figures of his time , and if you look back on his work - for example the " eroica , " " wellington 's victory " or " egmont " - he often expressed himself politically through his music .
but he did so quite differently in each case .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt masur will conduct the ninth at this year 's festival the issue of how he surrounded himself with powerful figures , but at the same time also left them hanging , was a central theme in his life , i think .
and it begs the question of where beethoven 's development through the symphonies leads - past a rejection of the powers that be , to a civil society .
on the one hand it is really a path beyond the worship of powerful figures - such as napoleon - but , on the other hand , he is using the civil society , which finances the music and supports the composer .
that 's is why i think this music is still so relevant and moving today .
questions about how to deal with works of music today , how music is used , what demands are placed on it , how much it needs to align with the state to be performed on certain occasions , and how music is twisted or the text is rewritten , for example , so that it fits a particular regime - the ninth symphony has already been through all of that .
who else then has used beethoven 's music to serve their own ends ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ninth symphony has echoed both east and west goebbels always had the ninth symphony played for hitler 's birthday .
the gdr -lrb- communist east germany -rrb- chose it as their national anthem , albeit with a different text .
it has been played constantly both in the east and the west .
it has become the european anthem , and since the olympic games it has also been mentioned that mao used the symphony to motivate workers in the fields .
kamikaze pilots listened to this music - i 'm jumping through time a bit - and it was also the national anthem of rhodesia .
i think no other work has ever been so globalized .
nevertheless this human message , this commitment to human kindness has survived - and you could almost say this message is indestructible .
how would you judge beethoven 's music today ?
what is the situation with " power " and " music " ?
for me personally , the power of music is at the forefront because i 'd like to keep believing in the utopia that music can change a lot .
in 2006 , we had a guest youth orchestra from south africa , where musicians with different backgrounds performed together , for example .
music can also be a social instrument .
and this power ca n't be burned onto a cd .
the reproduction of music in a concert is something exclusive .
there you can really feel the power of music - and i do n't think you can get away from it . interview : klaus gehrke -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

experts say this sparked a chain reaction in the region , which only moscow can now halt . when the west recognized kosovo 's independence half a year ago , russia 's leaders warned that the move would open a " pandora 's box " in the caucasus .
the mountainous region 's patchwork of ethnicities and states have long been difficult to reconcile into coherent nation states .
the recent , bloody 10-day war between russia and georgia over the former soviet states ' rebel region of south ossetia is the realization of that pandora 's box scenario .
the background russia has long supported georgia 's two ethnically separatist provinces of abkhazia and south ossetia , but stopped short of recognizing their independence - until now - fearing that secessions in those provinces would provide a dangerous precedent for other minority nations within the russian federation .
nevertheless , russian lawmakers this week unanimously passed a motion urging president dmitry medvedev to recognize georgia 's rebel regions as independent - 15 years after they won de facto autonomy in a war of succession from tbilisi in the early 1990s .
by some counts , over 80 percent of the populations in the regions have been issued russian passports under an especially generous russian policy that saakashvili decried as the creeping annexation of georgian territory .

8 to push back georgia 's offensive to re-assert control , medvedev took the national stage , invoking the army in defense of russian citizens .
in a series of interviews by dpa news agency after kosovo 's independence in february , russian analysts foresaw a military flare up , but did not predict the possibility that moscow 's policy could turn to recognizing the regions .
the threat that kosovo could stand as a secessionist precedent in the caucasus had formed the kremlin 's most vivid protest to the province 's break from its ally serbia .
but while moscow is still confronted by the problems that the kosovo precedent raises , paradoxically , the comparison has now been turned into a justification of south ossetia and abkhazia 's right to self-determination .
western leaders have labeled russia 's move to recognize georgia 's regions as hypocrisy , while russian leaders hit back with the accusation that a double standard has been applied in the case of kosovo .
the resolution passed on monday argued that by its assault on civilians tbilisi had forgone all moral right over the area , drawing a direct link between russia incursion and the justification of nato 's bombing campaign in serbia in 1998 .
appealing before russian lawmakers south ossetia 's president eduard kokoity repeated what has become a maxim : " we have more political-legal grounds than kosovo does to have our independence recognized . "
but professor yury kolosov of the moscow institute of international relations threw cold water on the much-cited " kosovo precedent . "
" there is no such thing as a ' precedent ' in international law ... and , if this is a precedent , then it 's a bad one , " kolosov , an eminent member of russia 's association of international law , told dpa .
the final say in other words , the kremlin has the last word .
while the threat of recognizing the breakaway region adds to its bargaining power with the west , analysts said it would look for ways to delay such recognition , for example , by requesting the provinces hold a new referendum .
" it seems to me that now politically it would be more favorable to leave this situation hanging , " moscow-based analyst vyacheslav nikonov , head of the politika foundation , told news agency interfax on monday .

the recent , bloody 10-day war between russia and georgia over the former soviet states ' rebel region of south ossetia is the realization of that pandora 's box scenario .
the background russia has long supported georgia 's two ethnically separatist provinces of abkhazia and south ossetia , but stopped short of recognizing their independence - until now - fearing that secessions in those provinces would provide a dangerous precedent for other minority nations within the russian federation .
nevertheless , russian lawmakers this week unanimously passed a motion urging president dmitry medvedev to recognize georgia 's rebel regions as independent - 15 years after they won de facto autonomy in a war of succession from tbilisi in the early 1990s .
by some counts , over 80 percent of the populations in the regions have been issued russian passports under an especially generous russian policy that saakashvili decried as the creeping annexation of georgian territory .
the kosovo precedent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's independence set a dangerous precedence as russian tanks rolled into south ossetia on aug .
8 to push back georgia 's offensive to re-assert control , medvedev took the national stage , invoking the army in defense of russian citizens .
in a series of interviews by dpa news agency after kosovo 's independence in february , russian analysts foresaw a military flare up , but did not predict the possibility that moscow 's policy could turn to recognizing the regions .
the threat that kosovo could stand as a secessionist precedent in the caucasus had formed the kremlin 's most vivid protest to the province 's break from its ally serbia .
but while moscow is still confronted by the problems that the kosovo precedent raises , paradoxically , the comparison has now been turned into a justification of south ossetia and abkhazia 's right to self-determination .
western leaders have labeled russia 's move to recognize georgia 's regions as hypocrisy , while russian leaders hit back with the accusation that a double standard has been applied in the case of kosovo .
the resolution passed on monday argued that by its assault on civilians tbilisi had forgone all moral right over the area , drawing a direct link between russia incursion and the justification of nato 's bombing campaign in serbia in 1998 .
appealing before russian lawmakers south ossetia 's president eduard kokoity repeated what has become a maxim : " we have more political-legal grounds than kosovo does to have our independence recognized . "
but professor yury kolosov of the moscow institute of international relations threw cold water on the much-cited " kosovo precedent . "
" there is no such thing as a ' precedent ' in international law ... and , if this is a precedent , then it 's a bad one , " kolosov , an eminent member of russia 's association of international law , told dpa .
the final say in other words , the kremlin has the last word .
while the threat of recognizing the breakaway region adds to its bargaining power with the west , analysts said it would look for ways to delay such recognition , for example , by requesting the provinces hold a new referendum .
" it seems to me that now politically it would be more favorable to leave this situation hanging , " moscow-based analyst vyacheslav nikonov , head of the politika foundation , told news agency interfax on monday .
the kremlin and its allies , meanwhile , are n't deaf to its own warnings that seizing on kosovo as a precedent could spark a " chain reaction " in the region .
legal limbo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev - the ball is in his court medvedev sought to reassure the molodovan and azeri presidents - who have similar secession worries to georgia - on monday over the respective breakaway regions of nagorno karabakh and transnistria .
south ossetia 's ultimate ambition to unite with russia 's ethnically-similar region of north ossetia is no less problematic .
russia 's ties to abkhazia , which seeks only self-determination , have traditionally been stronger , as has its economic interest in the region .
a poll by the independent levada center in the aftermath of the conflict show near half of russians - or 46 percent - say south ossetia should become part of russia .
only 4 percent of those surveyed in interviews with 2,100 adults believed the province should remain part of georgia .
but whatever the populations of the caucasus think , with the fate of both provinces of intimate interest to moscow and beyond , the situation is likely to remain - for now - in legal limbo . dpa news agency -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 26.08.2008 opinion : relations between west , russia at crossroads großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recognition of the self-proclaimed republics of south ossetia and abkhazia by russia will considerably damage ties between the west and moscow , says dw ’ s ingo mannteufel . russian president dmitry medvedev has done it : the russian federation has given diplomatic recognition to the rogue georgian republics of south ossetia and abkhazia .
with this move , russia is not only ignoring all the warnings of western governments handed out over the past few days , but is also in violation of international law by disregarding the sovereign borders of its european neighbor , georgia . of course , the russian president considers himself to be in the right , since the georgian government tried to remove the separatists ' regimes from georgian territory using force , but the kremlin is alone in this view . through this decision , russia has resorted to dangerous self isolation .
the recognition of south ossetia and abkhazia will certainly cause considerable damage to the relationship between russia and the west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel the kremlin is delusional if it assumes that the west will simply be pacified after a short while .
russia has , without a doubt , the potential to cause considerable damage to western interests : in relation to afghanistan , the iranian nuclear problem , as well as the energy supply .
but that also applies to the west . now the danger exists that both sides can come up with more problems for the other .
the west could react by allowing georgia or the ukraine to join nato , or by blocking russia ’ s wto membership .
russia could stop supporting the west in afghanistan , or could form an international gas cartel .
the ammunition on both sides is considerable . what is unfortunate is that no one is being helped by the heightening of the dispute - neither russia nor the west .
even south ossetia and abkhazia wo n't get anything through the recognition of their independence by russia , since it 's only valid in moscow . it , however , can not be assumed that nato and the eu nations will simply stop their daily dealings with russia .
all of the western governments have already made that clear in their warnings over the past few days .
western nations will find asymmetrical answers to russia acting alone and defying international principles .
here russia has clearly underestimated how much control western nations have over russian interests . at first glance the georgian conflict was rather insignificant from an american and european perspective .
however , this recent russian action will surely lead to nato and the eu consolidating and unifying their russia policies .
russia 's critics will be there to take it all in , and advocates of a moderate course will be silenced .
that is clearly visible from the reactions of both german chancellor angela merkel and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier .
germany has long belonged to the eu nations which have been firm in their cooperation with russia .
now all of that could change . ingo mannteufel is the head of deutsche welles 's russian online and radio departments -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with this move , russia is not only ignoring all the warnings of western governments handed out over the past few days , but is also in violation of international law by disregarding the sovereign borders of its european neighbor , georgia . of course , the russian president considers himself to be in the right , since the georgian government tried to remove the separatists ' regimes from georgian territory using force , but the kremlin is alone in this view . through this decision , russia has resorted to dangerous self isolation .
the recognition of south ossetia and abkhazia will certainly cause considerable damage to the relationship between russia and the west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel the kremlin is delusional if it assumes that the west will simply be pacified after a short while .
russia has , without a doubt , the potential to cause considerable damage to western interests : in relation to afghanistan , the iranian nuclear problem , as well as the energy supply .
but that also applies to the west . now the danger exists that both sides can come up with more problems for the other .
the west could react by allowing georgia or the ukraine to join nato , or by blocking russia ’ s wto membership .
russia could stop supporting the west in afghanistan , or could form an international gas cartel .
the ammunition on both sides is considerable . what is unfortunate is that no one is being helped by the heightening of the dispute - neither russia nor the west .
even south ossetia and abkhazia wo n't get anything through the recognition of their independence by russia , since it 's only valid in moscow . it , however , can not be assumed that nato and the eu nations will simply stop their daily dealings with russia .
all of the western governments have already made that clear in their warnings over the past few days .
western nations will find asymmetrical answers to russia acting alone and defying international principles .
here russia has clearly underestimated how much control western nations have over russian interests . at first glance the georgian conflict was rather insignificant from an american and european perspective .
however , this recent russian action will surely lead to nato and the eu consolidating and unifying their russia policies .
russia 's critics will be there to take it all in , and advocates of a moderate course will be silenced .
that is clearly visible from the reactions of both german chancellor angela merkel and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier .
germany has long belonged to the eu nations which have been firm in their cooperation with russia .
now all of that could change . ingo mannteufel is the head of deutsche welles 's russian online and radio departments -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

26 , by the environmental group transport and environment -lrb- t & e -rrb- . the munich-based carmaker will have to cut carbon dioxide emissions by another 19 percent by 2012 if it is to meet the european union 's target . under laws proposed by the eu 's executive , the european commission , and currently under debate , every car manufacturer which sells large numbers of vehicles in europe should be given a target for the average amount of co2 its new cars emit from 2012 .
the proposed targets are calculated according to the average weight of cars each firm sells . bad grade for german cars despite the munich manufacturer 's relative progress , t & e said that , overall , german cars - including those made by bmw , daimler and volkswagen - emitted 10 grams of carbon dioxide more than the eu average . french car manufacturers are the closest to hitting proposed european union targets for reducing their co2 emissions , said the brussels-based environmental group , while japanese makers are the furthest away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peugeot is close to the target , but moving forward slowly according to t & e 's study , based on official eu data , the peugeot-citroen group is closest to its target , needing to reduce average new car emissions by 10 percent in the next five years . at the other end of the spectrum , suzuki faces making cuts of a hefty 25 percent in its average car emissions , daimler and mazda will have to make 24-percent cuts and nissan will have to cut by 22 percent , the study said . " it is striking that three of the bottom four carmakers are japanese ...
all three did not close the gap sufficiently in 2007 and will have to speed up their efforts , " it said . heavy cars to blame while french carmakers are closer to their targets , they are making relatively slow progress : peugeot-citroen cut emissions by 0.9 percent in 2007 , while renault managed just 0.5 percent , meaning that both groups will have to step up their efforts in order to hit the target . t & e blamed the rising weight of cars for the small cuts made to emissions .
the average car gained 10 kilograms -lrb- 22 pounds -rrb- last year .
heavier cars require more fuel . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 26.08.2008 opinion : relations between west , russia at crossroads großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recognition of the self-proclaimed republics of south ossetia and abkhazia by russia will considerably damage ties between the west and moscow , says dw ’ s ingo mannteufel . russian president dmitry medvedev has done it : the russian federation has given diplomatic recognition to the rogue georgian republics of south ossetia and abkhazia .
with this move , russia is not only ignoring all the warnings of western governments handed out over the past few days , but is also in violation of international law by disregarding the sovereign borders of its european neighbor , georgia . of course , the russian president considers himself to be in the right , since the georgian government tried to remove the separatists ' regimes from georgian territory using force , but the kremlin is alone in this view . through this decision , russia has resorted to dangerous self isolation .
the recognition of south ossetia and abkhazia will certainly cause considerable damage to the relationship between russia and the west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel the kremlin is delusional if it assumes that the west will simply be pacified after a short while .
russia has , without a doubt , the potential to cause considerable damage to western interests : in relation to afghanistan , the iranian nuclear problem , as well as the energy supply .
but that also applies to the west . now the danger exists that both sides can come up with more problems for the other .
the west could react by allowing georgia or the ukraine to join nato , or by blocking russia ’ s wto membership .
russia could stop supporting the west in afghanistan , or could form an international gas cartel .
the ammunition on both sides is considerable . what is unfortunate is that no one is being helped by the heightening of the dispute - neither russia nor the west .
even south ossetia and abkhazia wo n't get anything through the recognition of their independence by russia , since it 's only valid in moscow . it , however , can not be assumed that nato and the eu nations will simply stop their daily dealings with russia .
all of the western governments have already made that clear in their warnings over the past few days .
western nations will find asymmetrical answers to russia acting alone and defying international principles .
here russia has clearly underestimated how much control western nations have over russian interests . at first glance the georgian conflict was rather insignificant from an american and european perspective .
however , this recent russian action will surely lead to nato and the eu consolidating and unifying their russia policies .
russia 's critics will be there to take it all in , and advocates of a moderate course will be silenced .

dw takes a look at the man behind the baton . masur has been a leading conductor for over four decades .
deep in concentration but in constant eye contact with the musicians while on stage , he has a way of drawing the music out of his orchestra with spare but energetic gestures . intensity , passion and energy exude from the 81-year-old when he takes up his baton . born in 1927 in silesia , now part of poland , masur studied music and conducting in leipzig but did n't finish to receive his diploma .
nevertheless , he gathered extensive experience on the stages of the former east germany , conducting and working as a vocal coach in halle , erfurt , schwerin and at the comic opera in east berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw offers live recordings of masur conducting beethoven in 1967 , at the age of 40 , masur became director of the dresden philharmonic orchestra .
three years later he returned to leipzig , which would become the most significant station in his career . spokesman for democracy as the music director of the gewandhaus orchestra in leipzig , masur quickly became one of the most celebrated conductors in east germany .
he led the ensemble on numerous tours , performing in over 900 concerts between 1970 and 1997 . as the soviet union began to crumble in the late 1980s , leipzig became a center of political protest in communist east germany .
masur made his voice heard as well , joining in the famous monday demonstrations . " our common concerns and responsibility have brought us together today , " the conductor said in front of the nikolaikirche in leipzig on a monday in 1989 . " we are affected by the developments in our city and are looking for a solution , " said masur , addressing the government .
" we urgently ask you to be prudent , so that peaceful dialogue is possible . " music for lonely people in 1991 , masur left his newly reunified country to direct the new york philharmonic , succeeding zubin mehta .
over the next 11 years , he developed a special program structure that not only appealed to new yorkers , but went over well across the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new york is full of lonely people , concluded masur he said he discovered his secret while taking a walk in the big apple .

the country 's modest jewish community is refusing to take offense . as frontman of gasolin ' , a seminal rock band which enjoyed its heyday in the 1970s , kim larsen has always been one of the bad boys of danish rock .
and like any self-respecting hellraiser , he 's vociferously anti-establishment . in the best rock ' n ' roll tradition , he 's also a die-hard smoker .
so it comes as no surprise that he does n't like the eu 's anti-smoking laws introduced in denmark one year ago , which ban smoking in public bars and restaurants . health fascists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who reads billboards anyway ?
not the type who likes being told what to do , larsen recently helped fund an advertising campaign revolving around the slogan " tillykke med rygeforbudet - gesundheit macht frei ! ! ! " the first claim means " good luck with the smoking ban " in danish , while the german slogan " health sets you free " is an obvious allusion to the nazi slogan " arbeit macht frei , " or " work sets you free , " which was placed at the entrances to a number of nazi concentration camps , such as auschwitz and dachau . " the people who introduced the smoking ban are health fascists , " larsen has been quoted as saying . he said the reference to the third reich is a valid one , because the nazis introduced a nationwide tobacco ban as part of their quest for bodily and racial purity . " hitler was the first to ban smoking , " said the one-time eurovision song contest hopeful . cause celebre bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kim larsen : too stupid to be taken seriously ?
larsen allegedly is n't the only celebrity to have donated to the " himmelbla " fund behind the campaign , whose ads are now splurged across copenhagen 's billboards . " this is not about a defense of smoking , " larsen has said .
" this is about a defense of democracy and freedom . " the country 's jewish community , for its part , is choosing to see the campaign in this context - merely a clumsy protest against government interference with individual freedoms . " it 's stupid , plain stupid , " stefan isaak , president of the danish jewish community , told dw-world.de.
" i do n't connect it with any kind of anti-semitism - it 's just plain stupidity . " explaining why larsen 's posters have gone largely ignored , he pointed out that denmark has few holocaust survivors , because most of the country 's jews left for sweden during world war ii . " feelings might be hurt , " he said .
" but the whole slogan is so idiotic ; you ca n't begin to connect it to auschwitz . " bad taste bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smokers : social pariahs arne rolighed of denmark 's leading cancer research charity is taking more offense . " it 's extremely tasteless , " he was quoted as saying in danish daily politiken . it 's not the first time this kind of parallel has been drawn .
in germany - where nazi allusions are not shrugged off as lightly as they are in denmark - one protester launched a line of t-shirts earlier this year bearing a yellow star of david along with the word " smoker . " the shirt was quickly withdrawn from the market after jewish groups objected to comparing the perceived persecution of smokers to that of the jews under the nazis . isaak is more circumspect .

a romantically glorified image : the lonely , troubled , but of course ingenious artist . first he threw a few books at his servant , then a chair without registering a trace of sympathy : " after that i had peace and quiet all day . "
and when a prince once thought two bassoons would do instead of three , he replied : " if your highness allocates instruments like that , then i do n't give a damn ! "
employees , the nobility , his publishers - they all got it dished to them .
one of his biographers called ludwig van beethoven the " bawdy genius . "
brain proprietor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there is only one beethoven " most of what we know about beethoven comes from his correspondence and his diary .
much unlike his contemporary goethe , who he did not get along very well with , beethoven was a stranger to self-stylization .
in his letters he writes about the malevolence of people and about the class restrictions which refused him contact with the women he worshipped .
he did not conduct himself as an outstanding nobleman ; he even treated friends to coarse language .
when his brother once acquired some land and signed himself as " van beethoven , land proprietor , " ludwig replied with " van beethoven , brain proprietor . "
to prince lichnowsky , one of his appreciators and patrons , he wrote : " prince , what you are , you are through chance and birth ; what i am , i am through my own labor .
there are many princes and there will continue to be thousands more , but there is only one beethoven . "
beethoven for all beethoven 's letters and diary are like a quarry from which one can extract whatever one needs .
there are sentences of his that give the impression that he had a revolutionary disposition , others that suggest he was elitist .
this ambiguity , together with his new musical aesthetic , later led to occasionally absurd attempts at exploiting his music : the 9th symphony sounded in 1937 for hitler 's birthday .
and even the news of hitler 's death was read out on the radio over the 9th symphony .
but even earlier , in the time of the weimar republic before the second world war , beethoven was politically exploited .
the right emphasized his supposed hostility towards the french and saw in him a " titanic fighting spirit . "
the left equated the revolutionary quality of his music with revolutionary politics .
that is something which later recurred in east germany : after the second world war beethoven was used by the gdr propagandists - beethoven as a fighter for world peace .
a moody artist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven did n't quite fit in to apply concrete political goals to beethoven himself is , however , totally excessive .
what he said was far too inconsistent .
for beethoven it was about finding new paths in music - new paths which he carved out dazzlingly .
beethoven was known for being business minded .
nevertheless he lived in a rundown house near vienna and hardly cared about his appearance .
to his contemporaries beethoven must have seemed completely unconventional .
beethoven remained a bachelor , he lived for music - in the morning he composed , in the afternoon he went for a walk , at lunchtime he ate heartily .
in many people 's eyes he defined the image of a brilliant but difficult artist - reinforced by the many hundreds of paintings and busts of a beethoven with wildly unkempt hair and a serious piercing glare .
beethoven 's deafness one often forgets the aspect that caused the most tragedy in his life : his deafness .
beethoven is just over 30 years old when it becomes clear that he can no longer conceal his worsening hearing .
a deaf musician ?
" my ears , they whirl and roar night and day , " he wrote .
beethoven considered suicide , withdrew himself from society .
he even wrote a farewell letter which he never sent .
in the letter is one of beethoven 's most famous sentences about himself : " oh you people who think me hostile , stubborn and misanthropic , how you wrong me .

a romantically glorified image : the lonely , troubled , but of course ingenious artist . first he threw a few books at his servant , then a chair without registering a trace of sympathy : " after that i had peace and quiet all day . "
and when a prince once thought two bassoons would do instead of three , he replied : " if your highness allocates instruments like that , then i do n't give a damn ! "
employees , the nobility , his publishers - they all got it dished to them .
one of his biographers called ludwig van beethoven the " bawdy genius . "
brain proprietor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there is only one beethoven " most of what we know about beethoven comes from his correspondence and his diary .
much unlike his contemporary goethe , who he did not get along very well with , beethoven was a stranger to self-stylization .
in his letters he writes about the malevolence of people and about the class restrictions which refused him contact with the women he worshipped .
he did not conduct himself as an outstanding nobleman ; he even treated friends to coarse language .
when his brother once acquired some land and signed himself as " van beethoven , land proprietor , " ludwig replied with " van beethoven , brain proprietor . "
to prince lichnowsky , one of his appreciators and patrons , he wrote : " prince , what you are , you are through chance and birth ; what i am , i am through my own labor .
there are many princes and there will continue to be thousands more , but there is only one beethoven . "
beethoven for all beethoven 's letters and diary are like a quarry from which one can extract whatever one needs .
there are sentences of his that give the impression that he had a revolutionary disposition , others that suggest he was elitist .
this ambiguity , together with his new musical aesthetic , later led to occasionally absurd attempts at exploiting his music : the 9th symphony sounded in 1937 for hitler 's birthday .
and even the news of hitler 's death was read out on the radio over the 9th symphony .
but even earlier , in the time of the weimar republic before the second world war , beethoven was politically exploited .
the right emphasized his supposed hostility towards the french and saw in him a " titanic fighting spirit . "
the left equated the revolutionary quality of his music with revolutionary politics .
that is something which later recurred in east germany : after the second world war beethoven was used by the gdr propagandists - beethoven as a fighter for world peace .
a moody artist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven did n't quite fit in to apply concrete political goals to beethoven himself is , however , totally excessive .
what he said was far too inconsistent .
for beethoven it was about finding new paths in music - new paths which he carved out dazzlingly .
beethoven was known for being business minded .
nevertheless he lived in a rundown house near vienna and hardly cared about his appearance .
to his contemporaries beethoven must have seemed completely unconventional .
beethoven remained a bachelor , he lived for music - in the morning he composed , in the afternoon he went for a walk , at lunchtime he ate heartily .
in many people 's eyes he defined the image of a brilliant but difficult artist - reinforced by the many hundreds of paintings and busts of a beethoven with wildly unkempt hair and a serious piercing glare .
beethoven 's deafness one often forgets the aspect that caused the most tragedy in his life : his deafness .
beethoven is just over 30 years old when it becomes clear that he can no longer conceal his worsening hearing .

" my ears , they whirl and roar night and day , " he wrote .
beethoven considered suicide , withdrew himself from society .

and like any self-respecting hellraiser , he 's vociferously anti-establishment . in the best rock ' n ' roll tradition , he 's also a die-hard smoker .
so it comes as no surprise that he does n't like the eu 's anti-smoking laws introduced in denmark one year ago , which ban smoking in public bars and restaurants . health fascists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who reads billboards anyway ?
not the type who likes being told what to do , larsen recently helped fund an advertising campaign revolving around the slogan " tillykke med rygeforbudet - gesundheit macht frei ! ! ! " the first claim means " good luck with the smoking ban " in danish , while the german slogan " health sets you free " is an obvious allusion to the nazi slogan " arbeit macht frei , " or " work sets you free , " which was placed at the entrances to a number of nazi concentration camps , such as auschwitz and dachau . " the people who introduced the smoking ban are health fascists , " larsen has been quoted as saying . he said the reference to the third reich is a valid one , because the nazis introduced a nationwide tobacco ban as part of their quest for bodily and racial purity . " hitler was the first to ban smoking , " said the one-time eurovision song contest hopeful . cause celebre bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kim larsen : too stupid to be taken seriously ?
larsen allegedly is n't the only celebrity to have donated to the " himmelbla " fund behind the campaign , whose ads are now splurged across copenhagen 's billboards . " this is not about a defense of smoking , " larsen has said .
" this is about a defense of democracy and freedom . " the country 's jewish community , for its part , is choosing to see the campaign in this context - merely a clumsy protest against government interference with individual freedoms . " it 's stupid , plain stupid , " stefan isaak , president of the danish jewish community , told dw-world.de.
" i do n't connect it with any kind of anti-semitism - it 's just plain stupidity . " explaining why larsen 's posters have gone largely ignored , he pointed out that denmark has few holocaust survivors , because most of the country 's jews left for sweden during world war ii . " feelings might be hurt , " he said .
" but the whole slogan is so idiotic ; you ca n't begin to connect it to auschwitz . " bad taste bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smokers : social pariahs arne rolighed of denmark 's leading cancer research charity is taking more offense . " it 's extremely tasteless , " he was quoted as saying in danish daily politiken . it 's not the first time this kind of parallel has been drawn .
in germany - where nazi allusions are not shrugged off as lightly as they are in denmark - one protester launched a line of t-shirts earlier this year bearing a yellow star of david along with the word " smoker . " the shirt was quickly withdrawn from the market after jewish groups objected to comparing the perceived persecution of smokers to that of the jews under the nazis . isaak is more circumspect .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de beethovenfest -pipe- 26.08.2008 beethovenfest director talks ninth symphony politics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven 's ninth symphony has been used by both left and right wing politicians beethovenfest director ilona schmiel spoke with deutsche welle about the power of beethoven 's famous ninth symphony , and why the month-long event focuses on the influential work . the motto of this year 's beethovenfest is " macht.musik , " which in german can mean both " power.music " and " make.music. "
the play on words reflects the turbulent history of the ninth symphony : its repeated exploitation by powerful figures , as well as its withstanding power to move people .
deutsche welle : ms schmiel , how did you choose the motto " macht.musik " ?
ilona schmiel : the ninth symphony was of course the impetus to ask how this work can be used to represent a whole program .
and that was the reason to hold the festival under the motto " macht.musik " and to follow the path of the ninth symphony from its premiere in 1824 to today .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ilona schmiel has directed the beethovenfest since 2004 beethoven 's political commitment , this utopia - the " ode to joy " by friedrich schiller , which he set to music , is a utopia - has n't lost any of its relevance .
we are still living in an age of war , suppression , hunger and many other injustices .
back in his time - the work was completed in 1824 - beethoven probably thought things would improve .
and that alone is a reason the ninth symphony can be made a focal point .
the question of how the reception of this piece continues in 2008 has always moved me because , as far as i know , there is no other work in the world that is played so often and deliberately chosen for so many different occasions .
the piece has not only been a part of triumphs , but also of many mistakes that have been made by governments , rulers and leaders , where the symphony was totally appropriated by politics and exploited for political purposes and dictatorial statements .
relatively speaking , beethoven had a lot of contact with the powerful figures of his time , and if you look back on his work - for example the " eroica , " " wellington 's victory " or " egmont " - he often expressed himself politically through his music .
but he did so quite differently in each case .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt masur will conduct the ninth at this year 's festival the issue of how he surrounded himself with powerful figures , but at the same time also left them hanging , was a central theme in his life , i think .
and it begs the question of where beethoven 's development through the symphonies leads - past a rejection of the powers that be , to a civil society .
on the one hand it is really a path beyond the worship of powerful figures - such as napoleon - but , on the other hand , he is using the civil society , which finances the music and supports the composer .
that 's is why i think this music is still so relevant and moving today .
questions about how to deal with works of music today , how music is used , what demands are placed on it , how much it needs to align with the state to be performed on certain occasions , and how music is twisted or the text is rewritten , for example , so that it fits a particular regime - the ninth symphony has already been through all of that .
who else then has used beethoven 's music to serve their own ends ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ninth symphony has echoed both east and west goebbels always had the ninth symphony played for hitler 's birthday .
the gdr -lrb- communist east germany -rrb- chose it as their national anthem , albeit with a different text .
it has been played constantly both in the east and the west .
it has become the european anthem , and since the olympic games it has also been mentioned that mao used the symphony to motivate workers in the fields .
kamikaze pilots listened to this music - i 'm jumping through time a bit - and it was also the national anthem of rhodesia .
i think no other work has ever been so globalized .
nevertheless this human message , this commitment to human kindness has survived - and you could almost say this message is indestructible .
how would you judge beethoven 's music today ?
what is the situation with " power " and " music " ?
for me personally , the power of music is at the forefront because i 'd like to keep believing in the utopia that music can change a lot .
in 2006 , we had a guest youth orchestra from south africa , where musicians with different backgrounds performed together , for example .
music can also be a social instrument .
and this power ca n't be burned onto a cd .
the reproduction of music in a concert is something exclusive .
there you can really feel the power of music - and i do n't think you can get away from it . interview : klaus gehrke -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de beethovenfest -pipe- 26.08.2008 beethovenfest director talks ninth symphony politics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven 's ninth symphony has been used by both left and right wing politicians beethovenfest director ilona schmiel spoke with deutsche welle about the power of beethoven 's famous ninth symphony , and why the month-long event focuses on the influential work . the motto of this year 's beethovenfest is " macht.musik , " which in german can mean both " power.music " and " make.music. "
the play on words reflects the turbulent history of the ninth symphony : its repeated exploitation by powerful figures , as well as its withstanding power to move people .
deutsche welle : ms schmiel , how did you choose the motto " macht.musik " ?
ilona schmiel : the ninth symphony was of course the impetus to ask how this work can be used to represent a whole program .
and that was the reason to hold the festival under the motto " macht.musik " and to follow the path of the ninth symphony from its premiere in 1824 to today .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ilona schmiel has directed the beethovenfest since 2004 beethoven 's political commitment , this utopia - the " ode to joy " by friedrich schiller , which he set to music , is a utopia - has n't lost any of its relevance .
we are still living in an age of war , suppression , hunger and many other injustices .
back in his time - the work was completed in 1824 - beethoven probably thought things would improve .
and that alone is a reason the ninth symphony can be made a focal point .
the question of how the reception of this piece continues in 2008 has always moved me because , as far as i know , there is no other work in the world that is played so often and deliberately chosen for so many different occasions .
the piece has not only been a part of triumphs , but also of many mistakes that have been made by governments , rulers and leaders , where the symphony was totally appropriated by politics and exploited for political purposes and dictatorial statements .
relatively speaking , beethoven had a lot of contact with the powerful figures of his time , and if you look back on his work - for example the " eroica , " " wellington 's victory " or " egmont " - he often expressed himself politically through his music .
but he did so quite differently in each case .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt masur will conduct the ninth at this year 's festival the issue of how he surrounded himself with powerful figures , but at the same time also left them hanging , was a central theme in his life , i think .
and it begs the question of where beethoven 's development through the symphonies leads - past a rejection of the powers that be , to a civil society .
on the one hand it is really a path beyond the worship of powerful figures - such as napoleon - but , on the other hand , he is using the civil society , which finances the music and supports the composer .
that 's is why i think this music is still so relevant and moving today .
questions about how to deal with works of music today , how music is used , what demands are placed on it , how much it needs to align with the state to be performed on certain occasions , and how music is twisted or the text is rewritten , for example , so that it fits a particular regime - the ninth symphony has already been through all of that .
who else then has used beethoven 's music to serve their own ends ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ninth symphony has echoed both east and west goebbels always had the ninth symphony played for hitler 's birthday .
the gdr -lrb- communist east germany -rrb- chose it as their national anthem , albeit with a different text .
it has been played constantly both in the east and the west .
it has become the european anthem , and since the olympic games it has also been mentioned that mao used the symphony to motivate workers in the fields .
kamikaze pilots listened to this music - i 'm jumping through time a bit - and it was also the national anthem of rhodesia .
i think no other work has ever been so globalized .
nevertheless this human message , this commitment to human kindness has survived - and you could almost say this message is indestructible .
how would you judge beethoven 's music today ?
what is the situation with " power " and " music " ?
for me personally , the power of music is at the forefront because i 'd like to keep believing in the utopia that music can change a lot .
in 2006 , we had a guest youth orchestra from south africa , where musicians with different backgrounds performed together , for example .
music can also be a social instrument .
and this power ca n't be burned onto a cd .
the reproduction of music in a concert is something exclusive .
there you can really feel the power of music - and i do n't think you can get away from it . interview : klaus gehrke -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 26.08.2008 danish rockstar uses nazi slogan to protest smoking ban großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking bans are the creations of " health fascists , " larson has said a pro-smoking campaign launched in denmark by one of the country 's best-known rockstars features a notorious nazi slogan .
the country 's modest jewish community is refusing to take offense . as frontman of gasolin ' , a seminal rock band which enjoyed its heyday in the 1970s , kim larsen has always been one of the bad boys of danish rock .
and like any self-respecting hellraiser , he 's vociferously anti-establishment . in the best rock ' n ' roll tradition , he 's also a die-hard smoker .
so it comes as no surprise that he does n't like the eu 's anti-smoking laws introduced in denmark one year ago , which ban smoking in public bars and restaurants . health fascists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who reads billboards anyway ?
not the type who likes being told what to do , larsen recently helped fund an advertising campaign revolving around the slogan " tillykke med rygeforbudet - gesundheit macht frei ! ! ! " the first claim means " good luck with the smoking ban " in danish , while the german slogan " health sets you free " is an obvious allusion to the nazi slogan " arbeit macht frei , " or " work sets you free , " which was placed at the entrances to a number of nazi concentration camps , such as auschwitz and dachau . " the people who introduced the smoking ban are health fascists , " larsen has been quoted as saying . he said the reference to the third reich is a valid one , because the nazis introduced a nationwide tobacco ban as part of their quest for bodily and racial purity . " hitler was the first to ban smoking , " said the one-time eurovision song contest hopeful . cause celebre bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kim larsen : too stupid to be taken seriously ?
larsen allegedly is n't the only celebrity to have donated to the " himmelbla " fund behind the campaign , whose ads are now splurged across copenhagen 's billboards . " this is not about a defense of smoking , " larsen has said .
" this is about a defense of democracy and freedom . " the country 's jewish community , for its part , is choosing to see the campaign in this context - merely a clumsy protest against government interference with individual freedoms . " it 's stupid , plain stupid , " stefan isaak , president of the danish jewish community , told dw-world.de.
" i do n't connect it with any kind of anti-semitism - it 's just plain stupidity . " explaining why larsen 's posters have gone largely ignored , he pointed out that denmark has few holocaust survivors , because most of the country 's jews left for sweden during world war ii . " feelings might be hurt , " he said .
" but the whole slogan is so idiotic ; you ca n't begin to connect it to auschwitz . " bad taste bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smokers : social pariahs arne rolighed of denmark 's leading cancer research charity is taking more offense . " it 's extremely tasteless , " he was quoted as saying in danish daily politiken . it 's not the first time this kind of parallel has been drawn .

the country 's modest jewish community is refusing to take offense . as frontman of gasolin ' , a seminal rock band which enjoyed its heyday in the 1970s , kim larsen has always been one of the bad boys of danish rock .
and like any self-respecting hellraiser , he 's vociferously anti-establishment . in the best rock ' n ' roll tradition , he 's also a die-hard smoker .
so it comes as no surprise that he does n't like the eu 's anti-smoking laws introduced in denmark one year ago , which ban smoking in public bars and restaurants . health fascists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who reads billboards anyway ?
not the type who likes being told what to do , larsen recently helped fund an advertising campaign revolving around the slogan " tillykke med rygeforbudet - gesundheit macht frei ! ! ! " the first claim means " good luck with the smoking ban " in danish , while the german slogan " health sets you free " is an obvious allusion to the nazi slogan " arbeit macht frei , " or " work sets you free , " which was placed at the entrances to a number of nazi concentration camps , such as auschwitz and dachau . " the people who introduced the smoking ban are health fascists , " larsen has been quoted as saying . he said the reference to the third reich is a valid one , because the nazis introduced a nationwide tobacco ban as part of their quest for bodily and racial purity . " hitler was the first to ban smoking , " said the one-time eurovision song contest hopeful . cause celebre bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kim larsen : too stupid to be taken seriously ?
larsen allegedly is n't the only celebrity to have donated to the " himmelbla " fund behind the campaign , whose ads are now splurged across copenhagen 's billboards . " this is not about a defense of smoking , " larsen has said .
" this is about a defense of democracy and freedom . " the country 's jewish community , for its part , is choosing to see the campaign in this context - merely a clumsy protest against government interference with individual freedoms . " it 's stupid , plain stupid , " stefan isaak , president of the danish jewish community , told dw-world.de.
" i do n't connect it with any kind of anti-semitism - it 's just plain stupidity . " explaining why larsen 's posters have gone largely ignored , he pointed out that denmark has few holocaust survivors , because most of the country 's jews left for sweden during world war ii . " feelings might be hurt , " he said .
" but the whole slogan is so idiotic ; you ca n't begin to connect it to auschwitz . " bad taste bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smokers : social pariahs arne rolighed of denmark 's leading cancer research charity is taking more offense .

the country 's modest jewish community is refusing to take offense . as frontman of gasolin ' , a seminal rock band which enjoyed its heyday in the 1970s , kim larsen has always been one of the bad boys of danish rock .
and like any self-respecting hellraiser , he 's vociferously anti-establishment . in the best rock ' n ' roll tradition , he 's also a die-hard smoker .
so it comes as no surprise that he does n't like the eu 's anti-smoking laws introduced in denmark one year ago , which ban smoking in public bars and restaurants . health fascists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who reads billboards anyway ?
not the type who likes being told what to do , larsen recently helped fund an advertising campaign revolving around the slogan " tillykke med rygeforbudet - gesundheit macht frei ! ! ! " the first claim means " good luck with the smoking ban " in danish , while the german slogan " health sets you free " is an obvious allusion to the nazi slogan " arbeit macht frei , " or " work sets you free , " which was placed at the entrances to a number of nazi concentration camps , such as auschwitz and dachau . " the people who introduced the smoking ban are health fascists , " larsen has been quoted as saying . he said the reference to the third reich is a valid one , because the nazis introduced a nationwide tobacco ban as part of their quest for bodily and racial purity . " hitler was the first to ban smoking , " said the one-time eurovision song contest hopeful . cause celebre bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kim larsen : too stupid to be taken seriously ?
larsen allegedly is n't the only celebrity to have donated to the " himmelbla " fund behind the campaign , whose ads are now splurged across copenhagen 's billboards . " this is not about a defense of smoking , " larsen has said .
" this is about a defense of democracy and freedom . " the country 's jewish community , for its part , is choosing to see the campaign in this context - merely a clumsy protest against government interference with individual freedoms . " it 's stupid , plain stupid , " stefan isaak , president of the danish jewish community , told dw-world.de.
" i do n't connect it with any kind of anti-semitism - it 's just plain stupidity . " explaining why larsen 's posters have gone largely ignored , he pointed out that denmark has few holocaust survivors , because most of the country 's jews left for sweden during world war ii . " feelings might be hurt , " he said .
" but the whole slogan is so idiotic ; you ca n't begin to connect it to auschwitz . " bad taste bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smokers : social pariahs arne rolighed of denmark 's leading cancer research charity is taking more offense . " it 's extremely tasteless , " he was quoted as saying in danish daily politiken . it 's not the first time this kind of parallel has been drawn .
in germany - where nazi allusions are not shrugged off as lightly as they are in denmark - one protester launched a line of t-shirts earlier this year bearing a yellow star of david along with the word " smoker . " the shirt was quickly withdrawn from the market after jewish groups objected to comparing the perceived persecution of smokers to that of the jews under the nazis . isaak is more circumspect .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de beethovenfest -pipe- 26.08.2008 beethovenfest director talks ninth symphony politics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven 's ninth symphony has been used by both left and right wing politicians beethovenfest director ilona schmiel spoke with deutsche welle about the power of beethoven 's famous ninth symphony , and why the month-long event focuses on the influential work . the motto of this year 's beethovenfest is " macht.musik , " which in german can mean both " power.music " and " make.music. "
the play on words reflects the turbulent history of the ninth symphony : its repeated exploitation by powerful figures , as well as its withstanding power to move people .
deutsche welle : ms schmiel , how did you choose the motto " macht.musik " ?
ilona schmiel : the ninth symphony was of course the impetus to ask how this work can be used to represent a whole program .
and that was the reason to hold the festival under the motto " macht.musik " and to follow the path of the ninth symphony from its premiere in 1824 to today .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ilona schmiel has directed the beethovenfest since 2004 beethoven 's political commitment , this utopia - the " ode to joy " by friedrich schiller , which he set to music , is a utopia - has n't lost any of its relevance .
we are still living in an age of war , suppression , hunger and many other injustices .
back in his time - the work was completed in 1824 - beethoven probably thought things would improve .
and that alone is a reason the ninth symphony can be made a focal point .
the question of how the reception of this piece continues in 2008 has always moved me because , as far as i know , there is no other work in the world that is played so often and deliberately chosen for so many different occasions .
the piece has not only been a part of triumphs , but also of many mistakes that have been made by governments , rulers and leaders , where the symphony was totally appropriated by politics and exploited for political purposes and dictatorial statements .
relatively speaking , beethoven had a lot of contact with the powerful figures of his time , and if you look back on his work - for example the " eroica , " " wellington 's victory " or " egmont " - he often expressed himself politically through his music .
but he did so quite differently in each case .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt masur will conduct the ninth at this year 's festival the issue of how he surrounded himself with powerful figures , but at the same time also left them hanging , was a central theme in his life , i think .
and it begs the question of where beethoven 's development through the symphonies leads - past a rejection of the powers that be , to a civil society .
on the one hand it is really a path beyond the worship of powerful figures - such as napoleon - but , on the other hand , he is using the civil society , which finances the music and supports the composer .
that 's is why i think this music is still so relevant and moving today .
questions about how to deal with works of music today , how music is used , what demands are placed on it , how much it needs to align with the state to be performed on certain occasions , and how music is twisted or the text is rewritten , for example , so that it fits a particular regime - the ninth symphony has already been through all of that .
who else then has used beethoven 's music to serve their own ends ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ninth symphony has echoed both east and west goebbels always had the ninth symphony played for hitler 's birthday .
the gdr -lrb- communist east germany -rrb- chose it as their national anthem , albeit with a different text .
it has been played constantly both in the east and the west .
it has become the european anthem , and since the olympic games it has also been mentioned that mao used the symphony to motivate workers in the fields .
kamikaze pilots listened to this music - i 'm jumping through time a bit - and it was also the national anthem of rhodesia .
i think no other work has ever been so globalized .
nevertheless this human message , this commitment to human kindness has survived - and you could almost say this message is indestructible .
how would you judge beethoven 's music today ?
what is the situation with " power " and " music " ?
for me personally , the power of music is at the forefront because i 'd like to keep believing in the utopia that music can change a lot .
in 2006 , we had a guest youth orchestra from south africa , where musicians with different backgrounds performed together , for example .
music can also be a social instrument .
and this power ca n't be burned onto a cd .
the reproduction of music in a concert is something exclusive .
there you can really feel the power of music - and i do n't think you can get away from it . interview : klaus gehrke -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
the play on words reflects the turbulent history of the ninth symphony : its repeated exploitation by powerful figures , as well as its withstanding power to move people .
deutsche welle : ms schmiel , how did you choose the motto " macht.musik " ?
ilona schmiel : the ninth symphony was of course the impetus to ask how this work can be used to represent a whole program .
and that was the reason to hold the festival under the motto " macht.musik " and to follow the path of the ninth symphony from its premiere in 1824 to today .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ilona schmiel has directed the beethovenfest since 2004 beethoven 's political commitment , this utopia - the " ode to joy " by friedrich schiller , which he set to music , is a utopia - has n't lost any of its relevance .
we are still living in an age of war , suppression , hunger and many other injustices .
back in his time - the work was completed in 1824 - beethoven probably thought things would improve .
and that alone is a reason the ninth symphony can be made a focal point .
the question of how the reception of this piece continues in 2008 has always moved me because , as far as i know , there is no other work in the world that is played so often and deliberately chosen for so many different occasions .
the piece has not only been a part of triumphs , but also of many mistakes that have been made by governments , rulers and leaders , where the symphony was totally appropriated by politics and exploited for political purposes and dictatorial statements .
relatively speaking , beethoven had a lot of contact with the powerful figures of his time , and if you look back on his work - for example the " eroica , " " wellington 's victory " or " egmont " - he often expressed himself politically through his music .
but he did so quite differently in each case .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt masur will conduct the ninth at this year 's festival the issue of how he surrounded himself with powerful figures , but at the same time also left them hanging , was a central theme in his life , i think .
and it begs the question of where beethoven 's development through the symphonies leads - past a rejection of the powers that be , to a civil society .
on the one hand it is really a path beyond the worship of powerful figures - such as napoleon - but , on the other hand , he is using the civil society , which finances the music and supports the composer .
that 's is why i think this music is still so relevant and moving today .
questions about how to deal with works of music today , how music is used , what demands are placed on it , how much it needs to align with the state to be performed on certain occasions , and how music is twisted or the text is rewritten , for example , so that it fits a particular regime - the ninth symphony has already been through all of that .
who else then has used beethoven 's music to serve their own ends ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ninth symphony has echoed both east and west goebbels always had the ninth symphony played for hitler 's birthday .
the gdr -lrb- communist east germany -rrb- chose it as their national anthem , albeit with a different text .
it has been played constantly both in the east and the west .
it has become the european anthem , and since the olympic games it has also been mentioned that mao used the symphony to motivate workers in the fields .
kamikaze pilots listened to this music - i 'm jumping through time a bit - and it was also the national anthem of rhodesia .
i think no other work has ever been so globalized .
nevertheless this human message , this commitment to human kindness has survived - and you could almost say this message is indestructible .
how would you judge beethoven 's music today ?
what is the situation with " power " and " music " ?
for me personally , the power of music is at the forefront because i 'd like to keep believing in the utopia that music can change a lot .
in 2006 , we had a guest youth orchestra from south africa , where musicians with different backgrounds performed together , for example .
music can also be a social instrument .
and this power ca n't be burned onto a cd .
the reproduction of music in a concert is something exclusive .
there you can really feel the power of music - and i do n't think you can get away from it . interview : klaus gehrke -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

relatively speaking , beethoven had a lot of contact with the powerful figures of his time , and if you look back on his work - for example the " eroica , " " wellington 's victory " or " egmont " - he often expressed himself politically through his music .
but he did so quite differently in each case .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt masur will conduct the ninth at this year 's festival the issue of how he surrounded himself with powerful figures , but at the same time also left them hanging , was a central theme in his life , i think .
and it begs the question of where beethoven 's development through the symphonies leads - past a rejection of the powers that be , to a civil society .
on the one hand it is really a path beyond the worship of powerful figures - such as napoleon - but , on the other hand , he is using the civil society , which finances the music and supports the composer .
that 's is why i think this music is still so relevant and moving today .
questions about how to deal with works of music today , how music is used , what demands are placed on it , how much it needs to align with the state to be performed on certain occasions , and how music is twisted or the text is rewritten , for example , so that it fits a particular regime - the ninth symphony has already been through all of that .
who else then has used beethoven 's music to serve their own ends ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ninth symphony has echoed both east and west goebbels always had the ninth symphony played for hitler 's birthday .
the gdr -lrb- communist east germany -rrb- chose it as their national anthem , albeit with a different text .
it has been played constantly both in the east and the west .
it has become the european anthem , and since the olympic games it has also been mentioned that mao used the symphony to motivate workers in the fields .
kamikaze pilots listened to this music - i 'm jumping through time a bit - and it was also the national anthem of rhodesia .
i think no other work has ever been so globalized .
nevertheless this human message , this commitment to human kindness has survived - and you could almost say this message is indestructible .
how would you judge beethoven 's music today ?
what is the situation with " power " and " music " ?
for me personally , the power of music is at the forefront because i 'd like to keep believing in the utopia that music can change a lot .
in 2006 , we had a guest youth orchestra from south africa , where musicians with different backgrounds performed together , for example .
music can also be a social instrument .
and this power ca n't be burned onto a cd .
the reproduction of music in a concert is something exclusive .
there you can really feel the power of music - and i do n't think you can get away from it . interview : klaus gehrke -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a romantically glorified image : the lonely , troubled , but of course ingenious artist . first he threw a few books at his servant , then a chair without registering a trace of sympathy : " after that i had peace and quiet all day . "
and when a prince once thought two bassoons would do instead of three , he replied : " if your highness allocates instruments like that , then i do n't give a damn ! "
employees , the nobility , his publishers - they all got it dished to them .
one of his biographers called ludwig van beethoven the " bawdy genius . "
brain proprietor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there is only one beethoven " most of what we know about beethoven comes from his correspondence and his diary .
much unlike his contemporary goethe , who he did not get along very well with , beethoven was a stranger to self-stylization .
in his letters he writes about the malevolence of people and about the class restrictions which refused him contact with the women he worshipped .
he did not conduct himself as an outstanding nobleman ; he even treated friends to coarse language .
when his brother once acquired some land and signed himself as " van beethoven , land proprietor , " ludwig replied with " van beethoven , brain proprietor . "
to prince lichnowsky , one of his appreciators and patrons , he wrote : " prince , what you are , you are through chance and birth ; what i am , i am through my own labor .
there are many princes and there will continue to be thousands more , but there is only one beethoven . "
beethoven for all beethoven 's letters and diary are like a quarry from which one can extract whatever one needs .
there are sentences of his that give the impression that he had a revolutionary disposition , others that suggest he was elitist .
this ambiguity , together with his new musical aesthetic , later led to occasionally absurd attempts at exploiting his music : the 9th symphony sounded in 1937 for hitler 's birthday .
and even the news of hitler 's death was read out on the radio over the 9th symphony .
but even earlier , in the time of the weimar republic before the second world war , beethoven was politically exploited .
the right emphasized his supposed hostility towards the french and saw in him a " titanic fighting spirit . "
the left equated the revolutionary quality of his music with revolutionary politics .
that is something which later recurred in east germany : after the second world war beethoven was used by the gdr propagandists - beethoven as a fighter for world peace .
a moody artist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven did n't quite fit in to apply concrete political goals to beethoven himself is , however , totally excessive .
what he said was far too inconsistent .
for beethoven it was about finding new paths in music - new paths which he carved out dazzlingly .
beethoven was known for being business minded .
nevertheless he lived in a rundown house near vienna and hardly cared about his appearance .
to his contemporaries beethoven must have seemed completely unconventional .
beethoven remained a bachelor , he lived for music - in the morning he composed , in the afternoon he went for a walk , at lunchtime he ate heartily .
in many people 's eyes he defined the image of a brilliant but difficult artist - reinforced by the many hundreds of paintings and busts of a beethoven with wildly unkempt hair and a serious piercing glare .
beethoven 's deafness one often forgets the aspect that caused the most tragedy in his life : his deafness .
beethoven is just over 30 years old when it becomes clear that he can no longer conceal his worsening hearing .
a deaf musician ?
" my ears , they whirl and roar night and day , " he wrote .
beethoven considered suicide , withdrew himself from society .
he even wrote a farewell letter which he never sent .
in the letter is one of beethoven 's most famous sentences about himself : " oh you people who think me hostile , stubborn and misanthropic , how you wrong me .

a romantically glorified image : the lonely , troubled , but of course ingenious artist . first he threw a few books at his servant , then a chair without registering a trace of sympathy : " after that i had peace and quiet all day . "
and when a prince once thought two bassoons would do instead of three , he replied : " if your highness allocates instruments like that , then i do n't give a damn ! "
employees , the nobility , his publishers - they all got it dished to them .
one of his biographers called ludwig van beethoven the " bawdy genius . "
brain proprietor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there is only one beethoven " most of what we know about beethoven comes from his correspondence and his diary .
much unlike his contemporary goethe , who he did not get along very well with , beethoven was a stranger to self-stylization .
in his letters he writes about the malevolence of people and about the class restrictions which refused him contact with the women he worshipped .
he did not conduct himself as an outstanding nobleman ; he even treated friends to coarse language .
when his brother once acquired some land and signed himself as " van beethoven , land proprietor , " ludwig replied with " van beethoven , brain proprietor . "
to prince lichnowsky , one of his appreciators and patrons , he wrote : " prince , what you are , you are through chance and birth ; what i am , i am through my own labor .
there are many princes and there will continue to be thousands more , but there is only one beethoven . "
beethoven for all beethoven 's letters and diary are like a quarry from which one can extract whatever one needs .
there are sentences of his that give the impression that he had a revolutionary disposition , others that suggest he was elitist .
this ambiguity , together with his new musical aesthetic , later led to occasionally absurd attempts at exploiting his music : the 9th symphony sounded in 1937 for hitler 's birthday .
and even the news of hitler 's death was read out on the radio over the 9th symphony .
but even earlier , in the time of the weimar republic before the second world war , beethoven was politically exploited .
the right emphasized his supposed hostility towards the french and saw in him a " titanic fighting spirit . "
the left equated the revolutionary quality of his music with revolutionary politics .
that is something which later recurred in east germany : after the second world war beethoven was used by the gdr propagandists - beethoven as a fighter for world peace .
a moody artist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven did n't quite fit in to apply concrete political goals to beethoven himself is , however , totally excessive .
what he said was far too inconsistent .
for beethoven it was about finding new paths in music - new paths which he carved out dazzlingly .
beethoven was known for being business minded .
nevertheless he lived in a rundown house near vienna and hardly cared about his appearance .
to his contemporaries beethoven must have seemed completely unconventional .
beethoven remained a bachelor , he lived for music - in the morning he composed , in the afternoon he went for a walk , at lunchtime he ate heartily .
in many people 's eyes he defined the image of a brilliant but difficult artist - reinforced by the many hundreds of paintings and busts of a beethoven with wildly unkempt hair and a serious piercing glare .

nevertheless , he gathered extensive experience on the stages of the former east germany , conducting and working as a vocal coach in halle , erfurt , schwerin and at the comic opera in east berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw offers live recordings of masur conducting beethoven in 1967 , at the age of 40 , masur became director of the dresden philharmonic orchestra .
three years later he returned to leipzig , which would become the most significant station in his career . spokesman for democracy as the music director of the gewandhaus orchestra in leipzig , masur quickly became one of the most celebrated conductors in east germany .
he led the ensemble on numerous tours , performing in over 900 concerts between 1970 and 1997 . as the soviet union began to crumble in the late 1980s , leipzig became a center of political protest in communist east germany .
masur made his voice heard as well , joining in the famous monday demonstrations . " our common concerns and responsibility have brought us together today , " the conductor said in front of the nikolaikirche in leipzig on a monday in 1989 . " we are affected by the developments in our city and are looking for a solution , " said masur , addressing the government .
" we urgently ask you to be prudent , so that peaceful dialogue is possible . " music for lonely people in 1991 , masur left his newly reunified country to direct the new york philharmonic , succeeding zubin mehta .
over the next 11 years , he developed a special program structure that not only appealed to new yorkers , but went over well across the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new york is full of lonely people , concluded masur he said he discovered his secret while taking a walk in the big apple . " i found out that new york is actually full of lonely people , and i decided to make my programs so that everyone who came to the concert would feel at home , " he said . masur has since moved his workplace from the hudson river to the seine - with a layover on the thames as principal conductor of the london philharmonic orchestra from 2000 to 2007 - and now directs the orchestre national de france .
thoughts of retirement seem to be far from his mind . " i hope that i can cut back slowly , " he said .
" if i stop tomorrow , you 'll certainly be reading my obituary pretty soon because music is part of my life . " klaus gehrke -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

warsaw , in particular , wants the eu to take a hard line in eu-russia relations . by announcing the eu summit in brussels next monday , sept .
1 , sarkozy wants to say clearly to moscow that the european union is " a force which has to dealt with , " and that agreements made with him by russian president dmitry medvedev must be honored , a french diplomat told the afp news agency on monday , aug .
25 . the six-point peace plan brokered by sarkozy , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , has been criticized in some european capitals as being too vague , too moscow-friendly and organized with too little consultation . after russia failed to withdraw all its troops from georgia , a key point of the cease-fire , the french president " realized that the russians were exploiting the ambiguous margins of the text and that there was a risk of a loss of credibility for the eu and the french presidency , " european policy center analyst antonio missiroli told afp . but it wo n't be easy , at the hastily-arranged summit which sarkozy announced sunday , to obtain european consensus on the future of relations with russia , he added . polish objections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk has led europe 's pro-georgian camp poland , as well as other eastern european nations that fell under the former soviet union 's direct sphere of influence , wants to convince the 27-member eu not to cut moscow any special deals after its military intervention in georgia this month . " i spoke with -lrb- germany 's -rrb- chancellor merkel this morning to make the european position uniform , harder and categorical concerning russia in the context of the crisis in the caucasus , " premier donald tusk told reporters . the differences among eu nations on how to handle russia were already highlighted earlier this month .
pro-georgia leaders of poland , estonia , lithuania and latvia traveled to tbilisi with the message that the french-brokered peace plan did not provide sufficient protection for georgia . meanwhile , france , germany , italy and spain lead the faction of eu member who do not want to see relations with moscow completely frozen due to russia 's importance as a trading partner and its international role as a veto-power at the united nations security council . chance for change ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is a key energy supplier to the european union but tusk said he would not rule out the possibility of some nations that want to keep communication with russia open could be convinced to change their tact at the summit . " i spoke with president sarkozy a few days ago and he did not hide that russia 's behavior is beginning to be irritating to a certain degree and will require the eu to make firm decisions , " tusk said . it was only last month that talks on a new strategic accord between russia and the eu got properly under way after being long-blocked by polish and lithuanian objections .
that , analysts say , is why there is a lot at stake as far as europe-russia relations are concerned . " i do n't see the possibility of introducing sanctions against russia if the situation remains the way it is today , " said cristina gallach , spokeswoman for eu foreign policy chief javier solana . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

experts say this sparked a chain reaction in the region , which only moscow can now halt . when the west recognized kosovo 's independence half a year ago , russia 's leaders warned that the move would open a " pandora 's box " in the caucasus .
the mountainous region 's patchwork of ethnicities and states have long been difficult to reconcile into coherent nation states .
the recent , bloody 10-day war between russia and georgia over the former soviet states ' rebel region of south ossetia is the realization of that pandora 's box scenario .
the background russia has long supported georgia 's two ethnically separatist provinces of abkhazia and south ossetia , but stopped short of recognizing their independence - until now - fearing that secessions in those provinces would provide a dangerous precedent for other minority nations within the russian federation .
nevertheless , russian lawmakers this week unanimously passed a motion urging president dmitry medvedev to recognize georgia 's rebel regions as independent - 15 years after they won de facto autonomy in a war of succession from tbilisi in the early 1990s .
by some counts , over 80 percent of the populations in the regions have been issued russian passports under an especially generous russian policy that saakashvili decried as the creeping annexation of georgian territory .
the kosovo precedent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's independence set a dangerous precedence as russian tanks rolled into south ossetia on aug .
8 to push back georgia 's offensive to re-assert control , medvedev took the national stage , invoking the army in defense of russian citizens .
in a series of interviews by dpa news agency after kosovo 's independence in february , russian analysts foresaw a military flare up , but did not predict the possibility that moscow 's policy could turn to recognizing the regions .
the threat that kosovo could stand as a secessionist precedent in the caucasus had formed the kremlin 's most vivid protest to the province 's break from its ally serbia .
but while moscow is still confronted by the problems that the kosovo precedent raises , paradoxically , the comparison has now been turned into a justification of south ossetia and abkhazia 's right to self-determination .
western leaders have labeled russia 's move to recognize georgia 's regions as hypocrisy , while russian leaders hit back with the accusation that a double standard has been applied in the case of kosovo .
the resolution passed on monday argued that by its assault on civilians tbilisi had forgone all moral right over the area , drawing a direct link between russia incursion and the justification of nato 's bombing campaign in serbia in 1998 .
appealing before russian lawmakers south ossetia 's president eduard kokoity repeated what has become a maxim : " we have more political-legal grounds than kosovo does to have our independence recognized . "
but professor yury kolosov of the moscow institute of international relations threw cold water on the much-cited " kosovo precedent . "
" there is no such thing as a ' precedent ' in international law ... and , if this is a precedent , then it 's a bad one , " kolosov , an eminent member of russia 's association of international law , told dpa .
the final say in other words , the kremlin has the last word .
while the threat of recognizing the breakaway region adds to its bargaining power with the west , analysts said it would look for ways to delay such recognition , for example , by requesting the provinces hold a new referendum .
" it seems to me that now politically it would be more favorable to leave this situation hanging , " moscow-based analyst vyacheslav nikonov , head of the politika foundation , told news agency interfax on monday .
the kremlin and its allies , meanwhile , are n't deaf to its own warnings that seizing on kosovo as a precedent could spark a " chain reaction " in the region .

south ossetia 's ultimate ambition to unite with russia 's ethnically-similar region of north ossetia is no less problematic .
russia 's ties to abkhazia , which seeks only self-determination , have traditionally been stronger , as has its economic interest in the region .
a poll by the independent levada center in the aftermath of the conflict show near half of russians - or 46 percent - say south ossetia should become part of russia .
only 4 percent of those surveyed in interviews with 2,100 adults believed the province should remain part of georgia .

experts say this sparked a chain reaction in the region , which only moscow can now halt . when the west recognized kosovo 's independence half a year ago , russia 's leaders warned that the move would open a " pandora 's box " in the caucasus .
the mountainous region 's patchwork of ethnicities and states have long been difficult to reconcile into coherent nation states .
the recent , bloody 10-day war between russia and georgia over the former soviet states ' rebel region of south ossetia is the realization of that pandora 's box scenario .
the background russia has long supported georgia 's two ethnically separatist provinces of abkhazia and south ossetia , but stopped short of recognizing their independence - until now - fearing that secessions in those provinces would provide a dangerous precedent for other minority nations within the russian federation .
nevertheless , russian lawmakers this week unanimously passed a motion urging president dmitry medvedev to recognize georgia 's rebel regions as independent - 15 years after they won de facto autonomy in a war of succession from tbilisi in the early 1990s .
by some counts , over 80 percent of the populations in the regions have been issued russian passports under an especially generous russian policy that saakashvili decried as the creeping annexation of georgian territory .
the kosovo precedent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's independence set a dangerous precedence as russian tanks rolled into south ossetia on aug .
8 to push back georgia 's offensive to re-assert control , medvedev took the national stage , invoking the army in defense of russian citizens .
in a series of interviews by dpa news agency after kosovo 's independence in february , russian analysts foresaw a military flare up , but did not predict the possibility that moscow 's policy could turn to recognizing the regions .
the threat that kosovo could stand as a secessionist precedent in the caucasus had formed the kremlin 's most vivid protest to the province 's break from its ally serbia .
but while moscow is still confronted by the problems that the kosovo precedent raises , paradoxically , the comparison has now been turned into a justification of south ossetia and abkhazia 's right to self-determination .
western leaders have labeled russia 's move to recognize georgia 's regions as hypocrisy , while russian leaders hit back with the accusation that a double standard has been applied in the case of kosovo .
the resolution passed on monday argued that by its assault on civilians tbilisi had forgone all moral right over the area , drawing a direct link between russia incursion and the justification of nato 's bombing campaign in serbia in 1998 .
appealing before russian lawmakers south ossetia 's president eduard kokoity repeated what has become a maxim : " we have more political-legal grounds than kosovo does to have our independence recognized . "
but professor yury kolosov of the moscow institute of international relations threw cold water on the much-cited " kosovo precedent . "
" there is no such thing as a ' precedent ' in international law ... and , if this is a precedent , then it 's a bad one , " kolosov , an eminent member of russia 's association of international law , told dpa .
the final say in other words , the kremlin has the last word .
while the threat of recognizing the breakaway region adds to its bargaining power with the west , analysts said it would look for ways to delay such recognition , for example , by requesting the provinces hold a new referendum .
" it seems to me that now politically it would be more favorable to leave this situation hanging , " moscow-based analyst vyacheslav nikonov , head of the politika foundation , told news agency interfax on monday .
the kremlin and its allies , meanwhile , are n't deaf to its own warnings that seizing on kosovo as a precedent could spark a " chain reaction " in the region .

26 , by the environmental group transport and environment -lrb- t & e -rrb- . the munich-based carmaker will have to cut carbon dioxide emissions by another 19 percent by 2012 if it is to meet the european union 's target . under laws proposed by the eu 's executive , the european commission , and currently under debate , every car manufacturer which sells large numbers of vehicles in europe should be given a target for the average amount of co2 its new cars emit from 2012 .
the proposed targets are calculated according to the average weight of cars each firm sells . bad grade for german cars despite the munich manufacturer 's relative progress , t & e said that , overall , german cars - including those made by bmw , daimler and volkswagen - emitted 10 grams of carbon dioxide more than the eu average . french car manufacturers are the closest to hitting proposed european union targets for reducing their co2 emissions , said the brussels-based environmental group , while japanese makers are the furthest away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peugeot is close to the target , but moving forward slowly according to t & e 's study , based on official eu data , the peugeot-citroen group is closest to its target , needing to reduce average new car emissions by 10 percent in the next five years . at the other end of the spectrum , suzuki faces making cuts of a hefty 25 percent in its average car emissions , daimler and mazda will have to make 24-percent cuts and nissan will have to cut by 22 percent , the study said . " it is striking that three of the bottom four carmakers are japanese ...
all three did not close the gap sufficiently in 2007 and will have to speed up their efforts , " it said . heavy cars to blame while french carmakers are closer to their targets , they are making relatively slow progress : peugeot-citroen cut emissions by 0.9 percent in 2007 , while renault managed just 0.5 percent , meaning that both groups will have to step up their efforts in order to hit the target . t & e blamed the rising weight of cars for the small cuts made to emissions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de beethovenfest -pipe- 26.08.2008 beethovenfest director talks ninth symphony politics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven 's ninth symphony has been used by both left and right wing politicians beethovenfest director ilona schmiel spoke with deutsche welle about the power of beethoven 's famous ninth symphony , and why the month-long event focuses on the influential work . the motto of this year 's beethovenfest is " macht.musik , " which in german can mean both " power.music " and " make.music. "
the play on words reflects the turbulent history of the ninth symphony : its repeated exploitation by powerful figures , as well as its withstanding power to move people .
deutsche welle : ms schmiel , how did you choose the motto " macht.musik " ?
ilona schmiel : the ninth symphony was of course the impetus to ask how this work can be used to represent a whole program .
and that was the reason to hold the festival under the motto " macht.musik " and to follow the path of the ninth symphony from its premiere in 1824 to today .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ilona schmiel has directed the beethovenfest since 2004 beethoven 's political commitment , this utopia - the " ode to joy " by friedrich schiller , which he set to music , is a utopia - has n't lost any of its relevance .
we are still living in an age of war , suppression , hunger and many other injustices .
back in his time - the work was completed in 1824 - beethoven probably thought things would improve .
and that alone is a reason the ninth symphony can be made a focal point .
the question of how the reception of this piece continues in 2008 has always moved me because , as far as i know , there is no other work in the world that is played so often and deliberately chosen for so many different occasions .
the piece has not only been a part of triumphs , but also of many mistakes that have been made by governments , rulers and leaders , where the symphony was totally appropriated by politics and exploited for political purposes and dictatorial statements .
relatively speaking , beethoven had a lot of contact with the powerful figures of his time , and if you look back on his work - for example the " eroica , " " wellington 's victory " or " egmont " - he often expressed himself politically through his music .
but he did so quite differently in each case .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt masur will conduct the ninth at this year 's festival the issue of how he surrounded himself with powerful figures , but at the same time also left them hanging , was a central theme in his life , i think .
and it begs the question of where beethoven 's development through the symphonies leads - past a rejection of the powers that be , to a civil society .
on the one hand it is really a path beyond the worship of powerful figures - such as napoleon - but , on the other hand , he is using the civil society , which finances the music and supports the composer .
that 's is why i think this music is still so relevant and moving today .
questions about how to deal with works of music today , how music is used , what demands are placed on it , how much it needs to align with the state to be performed on certain occasions , and how music is twisted or the text is rewritten , for example , so that it fits a particular regime - the ninth symphony has already been through all of that .
who else then has used beethoven 's music to serve their own ends ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ninth symphony has echoed both east and west goebbels always had the ninth symphony played for hitler 's birthday .
the gdr -lrb- communist east germany -rrb- chose it as their national anthem , albeit with a different text .
it has been played constantly both in the east and the west .
it has become the european anthem , and since the olympic games it has also been mentioned that mao used the symphony to motivate workers in the fields .
kamikaze pilots listened to this music - i 'm jumping through time a bit - and it was also the national anthem of rhodesia .
i think no other work has ever been so globalized .
nevertheless this human message , this commitment to human kindness has survived - and you could almost say this message is indestructible .
how would you judge beethoven 's music today ?
what is the situation with " power " and " music " ?
for me personally , the power of music is at the forefront because i 'd like to keep believing in the utopia that music can change a lot .
in 2006 , we had a guest youth orchestra from south africa , where musicians with different backgrounds performed together , for example .
music can also be a social instrument .
and this power ca n't be burned onto a cd .
the reproduction of music in a concert is something exclusive .
there you can really feel the power of music - and i do n't think you can get away from it . interview : klaus gehrke -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

26 , by the environmental group transport and environment -lrb- t & e -rrb- . the munich-based carmaker will have to cut carbon dioxide emissions by another 19 percent by 2012 if it is to meet the european union 's target . under laws proposed by the eu 's executive , the european commission , and currently under debate , every car manufacturer which sells large numbers of vehicles in europe should be given a target for the average amount of co2 its new cars emit from 2012 .
the proposed targets are calculated according to the average weight of cars each firm sells . bad grade for german cars despite the munich manufacturer 's relative progress , t & e said that , overall , german cars - including those made by bmw , daimler and volkswagen - emitted 10 grams of carbon dioxide more than the eu average . french car manufacturers are the closest to hitting proposed european union targets for reducing their co2 emissions , said the brussels-based environmental group , while japanese makers are the furthest away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peugeot is close to the target , but moving forward slowly according to t & e 's study , based on official eu data , the peugeot-citroen group is closest to its target , needing to reduce average new car emissions by 10 percent in the next five years . at the other end of the spectrum , suzuki faces making cuts of a hefty 25 percent in its average car emissions , daimler and mazda will have to make 24-percent cuts and nissan will have to cut by 22 percent , the study said . " it is striking that three of the bottom four carmakers are japanese ...
all three did not close the gap sufficiently in 2007 and will have to speed up their efforts , " it said . heavy cars to blame while french carmakers are closer to their targets , they are making relatively slow progress : peugeot-citroen cut emissions by 0.9 percent in 2007 , while renault managed just 0.5 percent , meaning that both groups will have to step up their efforts in order to hit the target . t & e blamed the rising weight of cars for the small cuts made to emissions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 26.08.2008 opinion : relations between west , russia at crossroads großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recognition of the self-proclaimed republics of south ossetia and abkhazia by russia will considerably damage ties between the west and moscow , says dw ’ s ingo mannteufel . russian president dmitry medvedev has done it : the russian federation has given diplomatic recognition to the rogue georgian republics of south ossetia and abkhazia .
with this move , russia is not only ignoring all the warnings of western governments handed out over the past few days , but is also in violation of international law by disregarding the sovereign borders of its european neighbor , georgia . of course , the russian president considers himself to be in the right , since the georgian government tried to remove the separatists ' regimes from georgian territory using force , but the kremlin is alone in this view . through this decision , russia has resorted to dangerous self isolation .
the recognition of south ossetia and abkhazia will certainly cause considerable damage to the relationship between russia and the west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel the kremlin is delusional if it assumes that the west will simply be pacified after a short while .
russia has , without a doubt , the potential to cause considerable damage to western interests : in relation to afghanistan , the iranian nuclear problem , as well as the energy supply .
but that also applies to the west . now the danger exists that both sides can come up with more problems for the other .
the west could react by allowing georgia or the ukraine to join nato , or by blocking russia ’ s wto membership .
russia could stop supporting the west in afghanistan , or could form an international gas cartel .
the ammunition on both sides is considerable . what is unfortunate is that no one is being helped by the heightening of the dispute - neither russia nor the west .
even south ossetia and abkhazia wo n't get anything through the recognition of their independence by russia , since it 's only valid in moscow . it , however , can not be assumed that nato and the eu nations will simply stop their daily dealings with russia .
all of the western governments have already made that clear in their warnings over the past few days .
western nations will find asymmetrical answers to russia acting alone and defying international principles .
here russia has clearly underestimated how much control western nations have over russian interests . at first glance the georgian conflict was rather insignificant from an american and european perspective .
however , this recent russian action will surely lead to nato and the eu consolidating and unifying their russia policies .
russia 's critics will be there to take it all in , and advocates of a moderate course will be silenced .
that is clearly visible from the reactions of both german chancellor angela merkel and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier .
germany has long belonged to the eu nations which have been firm in their cooperation with russia .
now all of that could change . ingo mannteufel is the head of deutsche welles 's russian online and radio departments -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the country 's modest jewish community is refusing to take offense . as frontman of gasolin ' , a seminal rock band which enjoyed its heyday in the 1970s , kim larsen has always been one of the bad boys of danish rock .
and like any self-respecting hellraiser , he 's vociferously anti-establishment . in the best rock ' n ' roll tradition , he 's also a die-hard smoker .

not the type who likes being told what to do , larsen recently helped fund an advertising campaign revolving around the slogan " tillykke med rygeforbudet - gesundheit macht frei ! ! ! " the first claim means " good luck with the smoking ban " in danish , while the german slogan " health sets you free " is an obvious allusion to the nazi slogan " arbeit macht frei , " or " work sets you free , " which was placed at the entrances to a number of nazi concentration camps , such as auschwitz and dachau . " the people who introduced the smoking ban are health fascists , " larsen has been quoted as saying . he said the reference to the third reich is a valid one , because the nazis introduced a nationwide tobacco ban as part of their quest for bodily and racial purity .

" this is about a defense of democracy and freedom . " the country 's jewish community , for its part , is choosing to see the campaign in this context - merely a clumsy protest against government interference with individual freedoms . " it 's stupid , plain stupid , " stefan isaak , president of the danish jewish community , told dw-world.de.
" i do n't connect it with any kind of anti-semitism - it 's just plain stupidity . " explaining why larsen 's posters have gone largely ignored , he pointed out that denmark has few holocaust survivors , because most of the country 's jews left for sweden during world war ii .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 26.08.2008 opinion : relations between west , russia at crossroads großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recognition of the self-proclaimed republics of south ossetia and abkhazia by russia will considerably damage ties between the west and moscow , says dw ’ s ingo mannteufel . russian president dmitry medvedev has done it : the russian federation has given diplomatic recognition to the rogue georgian republics of south ossetia and abkhazia .
with this move , russia is not only ignoring all the warnings of western governments handed out over the past few days , but is also in violation of international law by disregarding the sovereign borders of its european neighbor , georgia . of course , the russian president considers himself to be in the right , since the georgian government tried to remove the separatists ' regimes from georgian territory using force , but the kremlin is alone in this view . through this decision , russia has resorted to dangerous self isolation .
the recognition of south ossetia and abkhazia will certainly cause considerable damage to the relationship between russia and the west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel the kremlin is delusional if it assumes that the west will simply be pacified after a short while .
russia has , without a doubt , the potential to cause considerable damage to western interests : in relation to afghanistan , the iranian nuclear problem , as well as the energy supply .
but that also applies to the west . now the danger exists that both sides can come up with more problems for the other .
the west could react by allowing georgia or the ukraine to join nato , or by blocking russia ’ s wto membership .
russia could stop supporting the west in afghanistan , or could form an international gas cartel .
the ammunition on both sides is considerable . what is unfortunate is that no one is being helped by the heightening of the dispute - neither russia nor the west .
even south ossetia and abkhazia wo n't get anything through the recognition of their independence by russia , since it 's only valid in moscow . it , however , can not be assumed that nato and the eu nations will simply stop their daily dealings with russia .
all of the western governments have already made that clear in their warnings over the past few days .
western nations will find asymmetrical answers to russia acting alone and defying international principles .
here russia has clearly underestimated how much control western nations have over russian interests . at first glance the georgian conflict was rather insignificant from an american and european perspective .
however , this recent russian action will surely lead to nato and the eu consolidating and unifying their russia policies .
russia 's critics will be there to take it all in , and advocates of a moderate course will be silenced .
that is clearly visible from the reactions of both german chancellor angela merkel and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier .
germany has long belonged to the eu nations which have been firm in their cooperation with russia .
now all of that could change . ingo mannteufel is the head of deutsche welles 's russian online and radio departments -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de russia recognizes breakaway georgian provinces russian president dmitry medvedev has signed a decree recognizing the independence of georgia 's rebel regions abkhazia and south ossetia , despite pressure from the west to honor georgia 's territorial integrity .

" in the current crisis it became necessary to make a decision , " medvedev said in a nationally televised statement tuesday , aug .
26 .
" taking into consideration the will of the people and guided by the un charter of 1970 ... and other basic international law , i have signed a decree recognizing abkhazia and south ossetia . " it is not an easy choice , but it is the only way to protect the lives of civilians , " the president said after meeting with russia 's security chiefs . medvedev signed a second decree tuesday instructing the russian foreign ministry to establish diplomatic relations with abkhazia and south ossetia and sign partnership agreements with them . ties ice over bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : resident of gori , south ossetia , received aid after their city was devastated the move is likely to deepen the wedge in russia 's relations with the west , which views south ossetia and abkhazia as part of georgia .
russian stocks fell tuesday , with traders anticipating an increase in international tension . the world now faces new rifts , former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev was quoted as saying by itar-tass news agency tuesday . " the risk of a new schism has arisen .
there is a growing threat of global chaos , " gorbachev was quoted as saying in reaction to the crisis . german chancellor angela merkel sharply criticized the decision tuesday .
speaking on a visit to the estonian capital of tallinn , merkel said medvedev 's decision was " absolutely not acceptable " and ran " contrary to international law . " " we must by consequence react united as the european union , " merkel said . she also stressed support for stronger relations between the eu and georgia , including making it easier for georgians to obtain visas to the bloc . " georgia and ukraine will be members of nato , " the chancellor said .
russia has sharply opposed nato 's eastward expansion , and both countries ' bids were turned down by alliance leaders earlier this year .
the matter is to be reconsidered at a summit in december . merkel said , however , that dialogue between nato and russia should continue . nato secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer also rejected medvedev 's decision to recognize the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia .
he questioned whether russia was truly interested in peace and security in the caucasus region , according to a statement . " this is in direct violation of numerous un security council resolutions regarding georgia 's territorial integrity , resolutions that russia itself has endorsed , " de hoop scheffer said in a statement read out by his spokeswoman . on the eve of something bigger france , which brokered the cease-fire agreement between russia and georgia , also criticized the kremlin 's decision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the georgian offensive was compared to the murder that set off world war i " we consider this a regrettable decision and i recall our attachment to the territorial integrity of georgia , " said a spokesman for the french foreign ministry . just prior to medvedev 's announcement , the european union had expressed its opposition to recognizing the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia . russia 's nato envoy , dmitry rogozin , compared the current situation to europe in 1914 on the eve of world war i , " when , because of one terrorist , leading world powers clashed , " he told the rbk daily business newspaper .
war broke out after austro-hungarian archduke franz ferdinand was assassinated in august 1914 . but russian foreign minister sergey lavrov said russia is unlikely to be subjected to international isolation . " i do n't think we should really be afraid of isolation , " he told reporters in english .
" i do n't believe this should really be a doomsday scenario .
i believe common sense should prevail . " accusations of genocide in his statement issued tuesday , medvedev condemned georgia 's offensive to reclaim south ossetia earlier this month . " on the night of august 8th , tbilisi had a choice : -lrb- georgian president -rrb- saakashvili opted for genocide , " said the russian president .
" with this choice saakashvili wiped out all hope of a peaceful coexistence of south ossetia and abkhazia under one government . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west has largely opposed recognizing the provinces russia and georgia fought a brief but bloody war over south ossetia with russia 's army moving deep into georgia after repelling the georgian offensive . on tuesday the kremlin convened the security council at the president 's black sea residence in sochi to review a plea by russia 's parliament for recognition of the two georgian breakaway regions .

dw takes a look at the man behind the baton . masur has been a leading conductor for over four decades .
deep in concentration but in constant eye contact with the musicians while on stage , he has a way of drawing the music out of his orchestra with spare but energetic gestures . intensity , passion and energy exude from the 81-year-old when he takes up his baton . born in 1927 in silesia , now part of poland , masur studied music and conducting in leipzig but did n't finish to receive his diploma .
nevertheless , he gathered extensive experience on the stages of the former east germany , conducting and working as a vocal coach in halle , erfurt , schwerin and at the comic opera in east berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw offers live recordings of masur conducting beethoven in 1967 , at the age of 40 , masur became director of the dresden philharmonic orchestra .
three years later he returned to leipzig , which would become the most significant station in his career . spokesman for democracy as the music director of the gewandhaus orchestra in leipzig , masur quickly became one of the most celebrated conductors in east germany .
he led the ensemble on numerous tours , performing in over 900 concerts between 1970 and 1997 . as the soviet union began to crumble in the late 1980s , leipzig became a center of political protest in communist east germany .
masur made his voice heard as well , joining in the famous monday demonstrations . " our common concerns and responsibility have brought us together today , " the conductor said in front of the nikolaikirche in leipzig on a monday in 1989 . " we are affected by the developments in our city and are looking for a solution , " said masur , addressing the government .
" we urgently ask you to be prudent , so that peaceful dialogue is possible . " music for lonely people in 1991 , masur left his newly reunified country to direct the new york philharmonic , succeeding zubin mehta .
over the next 11 years , he developed a special program structure that not only appealed to new yorkers , but went over well across the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new york is full of lonely people , concluded masur he said he discovered his secret while taking a walk in the big apple . " i found out that new york is actually full of lonely people , and i decided to make my programs so that everyone who came to the concert would feel at home , " he said . masur has since moved his workplace from the hudson river to the seine - with a layover on the thames as principal conductor of the london philharmonic orchestra from 2000 to 2007 - and now directs the orchestre national de france .
thoughts of retirement seem to be far from his mind . " i hope that i can cut back slowly , " he said .
" if i stop tomorrow , you 'll certainly be reading my obituary pretty soon because music is part of my life . " klaus gehrke -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw takes a look at the man behind the baton . masur has been a leading conductor for over four decades .
deep in concentration but in constant eye contact with the musicians while on stage , he has a way of drawing the music out of his orchestra with spare but energetic gestures . intensity , passion and energy exude from the 81-year-old when he takes up his baton . born in 1927 in silesia , now part of poland , masur studied music and conducting in leipzig but did n't finish to receive his diploma .
nevertheless , he gathered extensive experience on the stages of the former east germany , conducting and working as a vocal coach in halle , erfurt , schwerin and at the comic opera in east berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw offers live recordings of masur conducting beethoven in 1967 , at the age of 40 , masur became director of the dresden philharmonic orchestra .
three years later he returned to leipzig , which would become the most significant station in his career . spokesman for democracy as the music director of the gewandhaus orchestra in leipzig , masur quickly became one of the most celebrated conductors in east germany .
he led the ensemble on numerous tours , performing in over 900 concerts between 1970 and 1997 . as the soviet union began to crumble in the late 1980s , leipzig became a center of political protest in communist east germany .
masur made his voice heard as well , joining in the famous monday demonstrations . " our common concerns and responsibility have brought us together today , " the conductor said in front of the nikolaikirche in leipzig on a monday in 1989 . " we are affected by the developments in our city and are looking for a solution , " said masur , addressing the government .
" we urgently ask you to be prudent , so that peaceful dialogue is possible . " music for lonely people in 1991 , masur left his newly reunified country to direct the new york philharmonic , succeeding zubin mehta .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de georgia -pipe- 26.08.2008 analysis : opening a pandora 's box in the caucasus großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the region has been thrown into disarray the caucasus conflict was brought about at least in part by the west 's decision to recognize kosovo 's independence 6 months ago .
experts say this sparked a chain reaction in the region , which only moscow can now halt . when the west recognized kosovo 's independence half a year ago , russia 's leaders warned that the move would open a " pandora 's box " in the caucasus .
the mountainous region 's patchwork of ethnicities and states have long been difficult to reconcile into coherent nation states .
the recent , bloody 10-day war between russia and georgia over the former soviet states ' rebel region of south ossetia is the realization of that pandora 's box scenario .
the background russia has long supported georgia 's two ethnically separatist provinces of abkhazia and south ossetia , but stopped short of recognizing their independence - until now - fearing that secessions in those provinces would provide a dangerous precedent for other minority nations within the russian federation .
nevertheless , russian lawmakers this week unanimously passed a motion urging president dmitry medvedev to recognize georgia 's rebel regions as independent - 15 years after they won de facto autonomy in a war of succession from tbilisi in the early 1990s .
by some counts , over 80 percent of the populations in the regions have been issued russian passports under an especially generous russian policy that saakashvili decried as the creeping annexation of georgian territory .
the kosovo precedent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's independence set a dangerous precedence as russian tanks rolled into south ossetia on aug .
8 to push back georgia 's offensive to re-assert control , medvedev took the national stage , invoking the army in defense of russian citizens .
in a series of interviews by dpa news agency after kosovo 's independence in february , russian analysts foresaw a military flare up , but did not predict the possibility that moscow 's policy could turn to recognizing the regions .
the threat that kosovo could stand as a secessionist precedent in the caucasus had formed the kremlin 's most vivid protest to the province 's break from its ally serbia .
but while moscow is still confronted by the problems that the kosovo precedent raises , paradoxically , the comparison has now been turned into a justification of south ossetia and abkhazia 's right to self-determination .
western leaders have labeled russia 's move to recognize georgia 's regions as hypocrisy , while russian leaders hit back with the accusation that a double standard has been applied in the case of kosovo .
the resolution passed on monday argued that by its assault on civilians tbilisi had forgone all moral right over the area , drawing a direct link between russia incursion and the justification of nato 's bombing campaign in serbia in 1998 .
appealing before russian lawmakers south ossetia 's president eduard kokoity repeated what has become a maxim : " we have more political-legal grounds than kosovo does to have our independence recognized . "
but professor yury kolosov of the moscow institute of international relations threw cold water on the much-cited " kosovo precedent . "
" there is no such thing as a ' precedent ' in international law ... and , if this is a precedent , then it 's a bad one , " kolosov , an eminent member of russia 's association of international law , told dpa .
the final say in other words , the kremlin has the last word .
while the threat of recognizing the breakaway region adds to its bargaining power with the west , analysts said it would look for ways to delay such recognition , for example , by requesting the provinces hold a new referendum .
" it seems to me that now politically it would be more favorable to leave this situation hanging , " moscow-based analyst vyacheslav nikonov , head of the politika foundation , told news agency interfax on monday .
the kremlin and its allies , meanwhile , are n't deaf to its own warnings that seizing on kosovo as a precedent could spark a " chain reaction " in the region .
legal limbo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev - the ball is in his court medvedev sought to reassure the molodovan and azeri presidents - who have similar secession worries to georgia - on monday over the respective breakaway regions of nagorno karabakh and transnistria .
south ossetia 's ultimate ambition to unite with russia 's ethnically-similar region of north ossetia is no less problematic .
russia 's ties to abkhazia , which seeks only self-determination , have traditionally been stronger , as has its economic interest in the region .
a poll by the independent levada center in the aftermath of the conflict show near half of russians - or 46 percent - say south ossetia should become part of russia .
only 4 percent of those surveyed in interviews with 2,100 adults believed the province should remain part of georgia .

experts say this sparked a chain reaction in the region , which only moscow can now halt . when the west recognized kosovo 's independence half a year ago , russia 's leaders warned that the move would open a " pandora 's box " in the caucasus .
the mountainous region 's patchwork of ethnicities and states have long been difficult to reconcile into coherent nation states .
the recent , bloody 10-day war between russia and georgia over the former soviet states ' rebel region of south ossetia is the realization of that pandora 's box scenario .
the background russia has long supported georgia 's two ethnically separatist provinces of abkhazia and south ossetia , but stopped short of recognizing their independence - until now - fearing that secessions in those provinces would provide a dangerous precedent for other minority nations within the russian federation .
nevertheless , russian lawmakers this week unanimously passed a motion urging president dmitry medvedev to recognize georgia 's rebel regions as independent - 15 years after they won de facto autonomy in a war of succession from tbilisi in the early 1990s .
by some counts , over 80 percent of the populations in the regions have been issued russian passports under an especially generous russian policy that saakashvili decried as the creeping annexation of georgian territory .
the kosovo precedent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's independence set a dangerous precedence as russian tanks rolled into south ossetia on aug .
8 to push back georgia 's offensive to re-assert control , medvedev took the national stage , invoking the army in defense of russian citizens .
in a series of interviews by dpa news agency after kosovo 's independence in february , russian analysts foresaw a military flare up , but did not predict the possibility that moscow 's policy could turn to recognizing the regions .
the threat that kosovo could stand as a secessionist precedent in the caucasus had formed the kremlin 's most vivid protest to the province 's break from its ally serbia .
but while moscow is still confronted by the problems that the kosovo precedent raises , paradoxically , the comparison has now been turned into a justification of south ossetia and abkhazia 's right to self-determination .
western leaders have labeled russia 's move to recognize georgia 's regions as hypocrisy , while russian leaders hit back with the accusation that a double standard has been applied in the case of kosovo .
the resolution passed on monday argued that by its assault on civilians tbilisi had forgone all moral right over the area , drawing a direct link between russia incursion and the justification of nato 's bombing campaign in serbia in 1998 .
appealing before russian lawmakers south ossetia 's president eduard kokoity repeated what has become a maxim : " we have more political-legal grounds than kosovo does to have our independence recognized . "
but professor yury kolosov of the moscow institute of international relations threw cold water on the much-cited " kosovo precedent . "
" there is no such thing as a ' precedent ' in international law ... and , if this is a precedent , then it 's a bad one , " kolosov , an eminent member of russia 's association of international law , told dpa .
the final say in other words , the kremlin has the last word .
while the threat of recognizing the breakaway region adds to its bargaining power with the west , analysts said it would look for ways to delay such recognition , for example , by requesting the provinces hold a new referendum .
" it seems to me that now politically it would be more favorable to leave this situation hanging , " moscow-based analyst vyacheslav nikonov , head of the politika foundation , told news agency interfax on monday .
the kremlin and its allies , meanwhile , are n't deaf to its own warnings that seizing on kosovo as a precedent could spark a " chain reaction " in the region .
legal limbo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev - the ball is in his court medvedev sought to reassure the molodovan and azeri presidents - who have similar secession worries to georgia - on monday over the respective breakaway regions of nagorno karabakh and transnistria .
south ossetia 's ultimate ambition to unite with russia 's ethnically-similar region of north ossetia is no less problematic .
russia 's ties to abkhazia , which seeks only self-determination , have traditionally been stronger , as has its economic interest in the region .
a poll by the independent levada center in the aftermath of the conflict show near half of russians - or 46 percent - say south ossetia should become part of russia .
only 4 percent of those surveyed in interviews with 2,100 adults believed the province should remain part of georgia .

dw takes a look at the man behind the baton . masur has been a leading conductor for over four decades .
deep in concentration but in constant eye contact with the musicians while on stage , he has a way of drawing the music out of his orchestra with spare but energetic gestures . intensity , passion and energy exude from the 81-year-old when he takes up his baton . born in 1927 in silesia , now part of poland , masur studied music and conducting in leipzig but did n't finish to receive his diploma .
nevertheless , he gathered extensive experience on the stages of the former east germany , conducting and working as a vocal coach in halle , erfurt , schwerin and at the comic opera in east berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw offers live recordings of masur conducting beethoven in 1967 , at the age of 40 , masur became director of the dresden philharmonic orchestra .
three years later he returned to leipzig , which would become the most significant station in his career . spokesman for democracy as the music director of the gewandhaus orchestra in leipzig , masur quickly became one of the most celebrated conductors in east germany .
he led the ensemble on numerous tours , performing in over 900 concerts between 1970 and 1997 . as the soviet union began to crumble in the late 1980s , leipzig became a center of political protest in communist east germany .
masur made his voice heard as well , joining in the famous monday demonstrations . " our common concerns and responsibility have brought us together today , " the conductor said in front of the nikolaikirche in leipzig on a monday in 1989 . " we are affected by the developments in our city and are looking for a solution , " said masur , addressing the government .
" we urgently ask you to be prudent , so that peaceful dialogue is possible . " music for lonely people in 1991 , masur left his newly reunified country to direct the new york philharmonic , succeeding zubin mehta .
over the next 11 years , he developed a special program structure that not only appealed to new yorkers , but went over well across the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new york is full of lonely people , concluded masur he said he discovered his secret while taking a walk in the big apple . " i found out that new york is actually full of lonely people , and i decided to make my programs so that everyone who came to the concert would feel at home , " he said . masur has since moved his workplace from the hudson river to the seine - with a layover on the thames as principal conductor of the london philharmonic orchestra from 2000 to 2007 - and now directs the orchestre national de france .
thoughts of retirement seem to be far from his mind . " i hope that i can cut back slowly , " he said .
" if i stop tomorrow , you 'll certainly be reading my obituary pretty soon because music is part of my life . " klaus gehrke -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the first german in outer space came from a small town in saxony .
today , it 's one of the few places that still remember the communist cosmonaut . on aug .
26 , 1978 , communist east germany launched the soyuz 31 to the soviet space station salyut 6 .
on board was 41-year-old sigmund jaehn , who went down in history as " the first german cosmonaut . " jaehn 's career began in 1955 when he joined the gdr air force and became a pilot and military scientist .
between 1966 and 1970 he studied at the gagarin military air academy in monino , in the soviet union , and afterwards worked in the gdr air force administration , responsible for pilot education and flight safety . forgotten hero bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pride of east germany the 1978 flight marked a political milestone , with communist leaders pointing to its success as evidence of the eastern bloc 's technological superiority .
in september the same year , they showed their appreciation by awarding sigmund jaehn the title hero of the soviet union . but once the cold war was over , jaehn 's achievements paled somewhat .
these days , the name rings only a faint bell to most germans .
despite the huge propaganda surrounding his seven-day space mission , jaehn soon became just a footnote in history . local pride it 's a different story in his hometown of morgenroethe-rautenkranz , close to the czech border .
few locals will ever forget the town 's famous son . it is even home to a permanent exhibition of german astronautics , with one room dedicated to jaehn 's achievements . " it means a lot to all of us , " said karin schaedlich from the exhibition .
" i was 17 years old when sigmund jaehn went into space .
and when he came back i was out on the street to see him and welcome him back together with his commander valery bykovsky .
it was a great event here in rautenkranz .
even after 30 years it 's still very important for his home village . " schaedlich 's coworker romy mothes said she is keen to help young people in the region keep the jaehn legacy alive . " i think our younger generation knows who sigmund jaehn is , " she said .
" they learn about him in school .
and we have a lot of children in our exhibition and all of them know him . " putting politics in perspective bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaehn today is a frequent visitor to morgenroethe-rautenkranz the man himself drops by now and then .
at the time , he probably enjoyed the political fuss less than anyone .
although he toed the party line , his job gave him a unique perspective that helped him keep his eye on the broader picture .

"
the play on words reflects the turbulent history of the ninth symphony : its repeated exploitation by powerful figures , as well as its withstanding power to move people .
deutsche welle : ms schmiel , how did you choose the motto " macht.musik " ?
ilona schmiel : the ninth symphony was of course the impetus to ask how this work can be used to represent a whole program .
and that was the reason to hold the festival under the motto " macht.musik " and to follow the path of the ninth symphony from its premiere in 1824 to today .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ilona schmiel has directed the beethovenfest since 2004 beethoven 's political commitment , this utopia - the " ode to joy " by friedrich schiller , which he set to music , is a utopia - has n't lost any of its relevance .
we are still living in an age of war , suppression , hunger and many other injustices .
back in his time - the work was completed in 1824 - beethoven probably thought things would improve .
and that alone is a reason the ninth symphony can be made a focal point .
the question of how the reception of this piece continues in 2008 has always moved me because , as far as i know , there is no other work in the world that is played so often and deliberately chosen for so many different occasions .
the piece has not only been a part of triumphs , but also of many mistakes that have been made by governments , rulers and leaders , where the symphony was totally appropriated by politics and exploited for political purposes and dictatorial statements .
relatively speaking , beethoven had a lot of contact with the powerful figures of his time , and if you look back on his work - for example the " eroica , " " wellington 's victory " or " egmont " - he often expressed himself politically through his music .
but he did so quite differently in each case .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt masur will conduct the ninth at this year 's festival the issue of how he surrounded himself with powerful figures , but at the same time also left them hanging , was a central theme in his life , i think .
and it begs the question of where beethoven 's development through the symphonies leads - past a rejection of the powers that be , to a civil society .
on the one hand it is really a path beyond the worship of powerful figures - such as napoleon - but , on the other hand , he is using the civil society , which finances the music and supports the composer .
that 's is why i think this music is still so relevant and moving today .
questions about how to deal with works of music today , how music is used , what demands are placed on it , how much it needs to align with the state to be performed on certain occasions , and how music is twisted or the text is rewritten , for example , so that it fits a particular regime - the ninth symphony has already been through all of that .
who else then has used beethoven 's music to serve their own ends ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ninth symphony has echoed both east and west goebbels always had the ninth symphony played for hitler 's birthday .
the gdr -lrb- communist east germany -rrb- chose it as their national anthem , albeit with a different text .
it has been played constantly both in the east and the west .
it has become the european anthem , and since the olympic games it has also been mentioned that mao used the symphony to motivate workers in the fields .
kamikaze pilots listened to this music - i 'm jumping through time a bit - and it was also the national anthem of rhodesia .
i think no other work has ever been so globalized .
nevertheless this human message , this commitment to human kindness has survived - and you could almost say this message is indestructible .
how would you judge beethoven 's music today ?
what is the situation with " power " and " music " ?
for me personally , the power of music is at the forefront because i 'd like to keep believing in the utopia that music can change a lot .
in 2006 , we had a guest youth orchestra from south africa , where musicians with different backgrounds performed together , for example .
music can also be a social instrument .
and this power ca n't be burned onto a cd .
the reproduction of music in a concert is something exclusive .
there you can really feel the power of music - and i do n't think you can get away from it . interview : klaus gehrke -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with this move , russia is not only ignoring all the warnings of western governments handed out over the past few days , but is also in violation of international law by disregarding the sovereign borders of its european neighbor , georgia . of course , the russian president considers himself to be in the right , since the georgian government tried to remove the separatists ' regimes from georgian territory using force , but the kremlin is alone in this view . through this decision , russia has resorted to dangerous self isolation .
the recognition of south ossetia and abkhazia will certainly cause considerable damage to the relationship between russia and the west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel the kremlin is delusional if it assumes that the west will simply be pacified after a short while .
russia has , without a doubt , the potential to cause considerable damage to western interests : in relation to afghanistan , the iranian nuclear problem , as well as the energy supply .
but that also applies to the west . now the danger exists that both sides can come up with more problems for the other .
the west could react by allowing georgia or the ukraine to join nato , or by blocking russia ’ s wto membership .
russia could stop supporting the west in afghanistan , or could form an international gas cartel .
the ammunition on both sides is considerable . what is unfortunate is that no one is being helped by the heightening of the dispute - neither russia nor the west .
even south ossetia and abkhazia wo n't get anything through the recognition of their independence by russia , since it 's only valid in moscow . it , however , can not be assumed that nato and the eu nations will simply stop their daily dealings with russia .
all of the western governments have already made that clear in their warnings over the past few days .
western nations will find asymmetrical answers to russia acting alone and defying international principles .
here russia has clearly underestimated how much control western nations have over russian interests . at first glance the georgian conflict was rather insignificant from an american and european perspective .
however , this recent russian action will surely lead to nato and the eu consolidating and unifying their russia policies .
russia 's critics will be there to take it all in , and advocates of a moderate course will be silenced .
that is clearly visible from the reactions of both german chancellor angela merkel and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier .
germany has long belonged to the eu nations which have been firm in their cooperation with russia .
now all of that could change . ingo mannteufel is the head of deutsche welles 's russian online and radio departments -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

26 , by the environmental group transport and environment -lrb- t & e -rrb- . the munich-based carmaker will have to cut carbon dioxide emissions by another 19 percent by 2012 if it is to meet the european union 's target . under laws proposed by the eu 's executive , the european commission , and currently under debate , every car manufacturer which sells large numbers of vehicles in europe should be given a target for the average amount of co2 its new cars emit from 2012 .
the proposed targets are calculated according to the average weight of cars each firm sells . bad grade for german cars despite the munich manufacturer 's relative progress , t & e said that , overall , german cars - including those made by bmw , daimler and volkswagen - emitted 10 grams of carbon dioxide more than the eu average . french car manufacturers are the closest to hitting proposed european union targets for reducing their co2 emissions , said the brussels-based environmental group , while japanese makers are the furthest away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peugeot is close to the target , but moving forward slowly according to t & e 's study , based on official eu data , the peugeot-citroen group is closest to its target , needing to reduce average new car emissions by 10 percent in the next five years . at the other end of the spectrum , suzuki faces making cuts of a hefty 25 percent in its average car emissions , daimler and mazda will have to make 24-percent cuts and nissan will have to cut by 22 percent , the study said . " it is striking that three of the bottom four carmakers are japanese ...
all three did not close the gap sufficiently in 2007 and will have to speed up their efforts , " it said . heavy cars to blame while french carmakers are closer to their targets , they are making relatively slow progress : peugeot-citroen cut emissions by 0.9 percent in 2007 , while renault managed just 0.5 percent , meaning that both groups will have to step up their efforts in order to hit the target . t & e blamed the rising weight of cars for the small cuts made to emissions .

the country 's modest jewish community is refusing to take offense . as frontman of gasolin ' , a seminal rock band which enjoyed its heyday in the 1970s , kim larsen has always been one of the bad boys of danish rock .
and like any self-respecting hellraiser , he 's vociferously anti-establishment . in the best rock ' n ' roll tradition , he 's also a die-hard smoker .
so it comes as no surprise that he does n't like the eu 's anti-smoking laws introduced in denmark one year ago , which ban smoking in public bars and restaurants . health fascists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who reads billboards anyway ?
not the type who likes being told what to do , larsen recently helped fund an advertising campaign revolving around the slogan " tillykke med rygeforbudet - gesundheit macht frei ! ! ! " the first claim means " good luck with the smoking ban " in danish , while the german slogan " health sets you free " is an obvious allusion to the nazi slogan " arbeit macht frei , " or " work sets you free , " which was placed at the entrances to a number of nazi concentration camps , such as auschwitz and dachau . " the people who introduced the smoking ban are health fascists , " larsen has been quoted as saying . he said the reference to the third reich is a valid one , because the nazis introduced a nationwide tobacco ban as part of their quest for bodily and racial purity . " hitler was the first to ban smoking , " said the one-time eurovision song contest hopeful . cause celebre bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kim larsen : too stupid to be taken seriously ?
larsen allegedly is n't the only celebrity to have donated to the " himmelbla " fund behind the campaign , whose ads are now splurged across copenhagen 's billboards . " this is not about a defense of smoking , " larsen has said .
" this is about a defense of democracy and freedom . " the country 's jewish community , for its part , is choosing to see the campaign in this context - merely a clumsy protest against government interference with individual freedoms . " it 's stupid , plain stupid , " stefan isaak , president of the danish jewish community , told dw-world.de.
" i do n't connect it with any kind of anti-semitism - it 's just plain stupidity . " explaining why larsen 's posters have gone largely ignored , he pointed out that denmark has few holocaust survivors , because most of the country 's jews left for sweden during world war ii . " feelings might be hurt , " he said .
" but the whole slogan is so idiotic ; you ca n't begin to connect it to auschwitz . " bad taste bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smokers : social pariahs arne rolighed of denmark 's leading cancer research charity is taking more offense . " it 's extremely tasteless , " he was quoted as saying in danish daily politiken . it 's not the first time this kind of parallel has been drawn .
in germany - where nazi allusions are not shrugged off as lightly as they are in denmark - one protester launched a line of t-shirts earlier this year bearing a yellow star of david along with the word " smoker . " the shirt was quickly withdrawn from the market after jewish groups objected to comparing the perceived persecution of smokers to that of the jews under the nazis . isaak is more circumspect .

" the first claim means " good luck with the smoking ban " in danish , while the german slogan " health sets you free " is an obvious allusion to the nazi slogan " arbeit macht frei , " or " work sets you free , " which was placed at the entrances to a number of nazi concentration camps , such as auschwitz and dachau . " the people who introduced the smoking ban are health fascists , " larsen has been quoted as saying . he said the reference to the third reich is a valid one , because the nazis introduced a nationwide tobacco ban as part of their quest for bodily and racial purity . " hitler was the first to ban smoking , " said the one-time eurovision song contest hopeful . cause celebre bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kim larsen : too stupid to be taken seriously ?
larsen allegedly is n't the only celebrity to have donated to the " himmelbla " fund behind the campaign , whose ads are now splurged across copenhagen 's billboards . " this is not about a defense of smoking , " larsen has said .
" this is about a defense of democracy and freedom . " the country 's jewish community , for its part , is choosing to see the campaign in this context - merely a clumsy protest against government interference with individual freedoms . " it 's stupid , plain stupid , " stefan isaak , president of the danish jewish community , told dw-world.de.
" i do n't connect it with any kind of anti-semitism - it 's just plain stupidity . " explaining why larsen 's posters have gone largely ignored , he pointed out that denmark has few holocaust survivors , because most of the country 's jews left for sweden during world war ii . " feelings might be hurt , " he said .
" but the whole slogan is so idiotic ; you ca n't begin to connect it to auschwitz . " bad taste bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smokers : social pariahs arne rolighed of denmark 's leading cancer research charity is taking more offense . " it 's extremely tasteless , " he was quoted as saying in danish daily politiken . it 's not the first time this kind of parallel has been drawn .
in germany - where nazi allusions are not shrugged off as lightly as they are in denmark - one protester launched a line of t-shirts earlier this year bearing a yellow star of david along with the word " smoker . " the shirt was quickly withdrawn from the market after jewish groups objected to comparing the perceived persecution of smokers to that of the jews under the nazis . isaak is more circumspect . " the less said about -lsb- larsen 's campaign -rsb- , the better , " he said . jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de beethovenfest -pipe- 26.08.2008 beethovenfest director talks ninth symphony politics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven 's ninth symphony has been used by both left and right wing politicians beethovenfest director ilona schmiel spoke with deutsche welle about the power of beethoven 's famous ninth symphony , and why the month-long event focuses on the influential work . the motto of this year 's beethovenfest is " macht.musik , " which in german can mean both " power.music " and " make.music. "
the play on words reflects the turbulent history of the ninth symphony : its repeated exploitation by powerful figures , as well as its withstanding power to move people .
deutsche welle : ms schmiel , how did you choose the motto " macht.musik " ?
ilona schmiel : the ninth symphony was of course the impetus to ask how this work can be used to represent a whole program .
and that was the reason to hold the festival under the motto " macht.musik " and to follow the path of the ninth symphony from its premiere in 1824 to today .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ilona schmiel has directed the beethovenfest since 2004 beethoven 's political commitment , this utopia - the " ode to joy " by friedrich schiller , which he set to music , is a utopia - has n't lost any of its relevance .
we are still living in an age of war , suppression , hunger and many other injustices .
back in his time - the work was completed in 1824 - beethoven probably thought things would improve .
and that alone is a reason the ninth symphony can be made a focal point .
the question of how the reception of this piece continues in 2008 has always moved me because , as far as i know , there is no other work in the world that is played so often and deliberately chosen for so many different occasions .
the piece has not only been a part of triumphs , but also of many mistakes that have been made by governments , rulers and leaders , where the symphony was totally appropriated by politics and exploited for political purposes and dictatorial statements .
relatively speaking , beethoven had a lot of contact with the powerful figures of his time , and if you look back on his work - for example the " eroica , " " wellington 's victory " or " egmont " - he often expressed himself politically through his music .
but he did so quite differently in each case .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt masur will conduct the ninth at this year 's festival the issue of how he surrounded himself with powerful figures , but at the same time also left them hanging , was a central theme in his life , i think .
and it begs the question of where beethoven 's development through the symphonies leads - past a rejection of the powers that be , to a civil society .
on the one hand it is really a path beyond the worship of powerful figures - such as napoleon - but , on the other hand , he is using the civil society , which finances the music and supports the composer .
that 's is why i think this music is still so relevant and moving today .
questions about how to deal with works of music today , how music is used , what demands are placed on it , how much it needs to align with the state to be performed on certain occasions , and how music is twisted or the text is rewritten , for example , so that it fits a particular regime - the ninth symphony has already been through all of that .
who else then has used beethoven 's music to serve their own ends ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ninth symphony has echoed both east and west goebbels always had the ninth symphony played for hitler 's birthday .
the gdr -lrb- communist east germany -rrb- chose it as their national anthem , albeit with a different text .
it has been played constantly both in the east and the west .
it has become the european anthem , and since the olympic games it has also been mentioned that mao used the symphony to motivate workers in the fields .
kamikaze pilots listened to this music - i 'm jumping through time a bit - and it was also the national anthem of rhodesia .
i think no other work has ever been so globalized .
nevertheless this human message , this commitment to human kindness has survived - and you could almost say this message is indestructible .
how would you judge beethoven 's music today ?
what is the situation with " power " and " music " ?
for me personally , the power of music is at the forefront because i 'd like to keep believing in the utopia that music can change a lot .
in 2006 , we had a guest youth orchestra from south africa , where musicians with different backgrounds performed together , for example .
music can also be a social instrument .
and this power ca n't be burned onto a cd .
the reproduction of music in a concert is something exclusive .
there you can really feel the power of music - and i do n't think you can get away from it . interview : klaus gehrke -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

26 , by the environmental group transport and environment -lrb- t & e -rrb- . the munich-based carmaker will have to cut carbon dioxide emissions by another 19 percent by 2012 if it is to meet the european union 's target . under laws proposed by the eu 's executive , the european commission , and currently under debate , every car manufacturer which sells large numbers of vehicles in europe should be given a target for the average amount of co2 its new cars emit from 2012 .
the proposed targets are calculated according to the average weight of cars each firm sells . bad grade for german cars despite the munich manufacturer 's relative progress , t & e said that , overall , german cars - including those made by bmw , daimler and volkswagen - emitted 10 grams of carbon dioxide more than the eu average . french car manufacturers are the closest to hitting proposed european union targets for reducing their co2 emissions , said the brussels-based environmental group , while japanese makers are the furthest away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peugeot is close to the target , but moving forward slowly according to t & e 's study , based on official eu data , the peugeot-citroen group is closest to its target , needing to reduce average new car emissions by 10 percent in the next five years . at the other end of the spectrum , suzuki faces making cuts of a hefty 25 percent in its average car emissions , daimler and mazda will have to make 24-percent cuts and nissan will have to cut by 22 percent , the study said . " it is striking that three of the bottom four carmakers are japanese ...
all three did not close the gap sufficiently in 2007 and will have to speed up their efforts , " it said . heavy cars to blame while french carmakers are closer to their targets , they are making relatively slow progress : peugeot-citroen cut emissions by 0.9 percent in 2007 , while renault managed just 0.5 percent , meaning that both groups will have to step up their efforts in order to hit the target . t & e blamed the rising weight of cars for the small cuts made to emissions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de beethovenfest -pipe- 26.08.2008 beethovenfest director talks ninth symphony politics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven 's ninth symphony has been used by both left and right wing politicians beethovenfest director ilona schmiel spoke with deutsche welle about the power of beethoven 's famous ninth symphony , and why the month-long event focuses on the influential work . the motto of this year 's beethovenfest is " macht.musik , " which in german can mean both " power.music " and " make.music. "
the play on words reflects the turbulent history of the ninth symphony : its repeated exploitation by powerful figures , as well as its withstanding power to move people .
deutsche welle : ms schmiel , how did you choose the motto " macht.musik " ?
ilona schmiel : the ninth symphony was of course the impetus to ask how this work can be used to represent a whole program .
and that was the reason to hold the festival under the motto " macht.musik " and to follow the path of the ninth symphony from its premiere in 1824 to today .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ilona schmiel has directed the beethovenfest since 2004 beethoven 's political commitment , this utopia - the " ode to joy " by friedrich schiller , which he set to music , is a utopia - has n't lost any of its relevance .
we are still living in an age of war , suppression , hunger and many other injustices .
back in his time - the work was completed in 1824 - beethoven probably thought things would improve .
and that alone is a reason the ninth symphony can be made a focal point .
the question of how the reception of this piece continues in 2008 has always moved me because , as far as i know , there is no other work in the world that is played so often and deliberately chosen for so many different occasions .
the piece has not only been a part of triumphs , but also of many mistakes that have been made by governments , rulers and leaders , where the symphony was totally appropriated by politics and exploited for political purposes and dictatorial statements .
relatively speaking , beethoven had a lot of contact with the powerful figures of his time , and if you look back on his work - for example the " eroica , " " wellington 's victory " or " egmont " - he often expressed himself politically through his music .
but he did so quite differently in each case .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt masur will conduct the ninth at this year 's festival the issue of how he surrounded himself with powerful figures , but at the same time also left them hanging , was a central theme in his life , i think .
and it begs the question of where beethoven 's development through the symphonies leads - past a rejection of the powers that be , to a civil society .
on the one hand it is really a path beyond the worship of powerful figures - such as napoleon - but , on the other hand , he is using the civil society , which finances the music and supports the composer .
that 's is why i think this music is still so relevant and moving today .
questions about how to deal with works of music today , how music is used , what demands are placed on it , how much it needs to align with the state to be performed on certain occasions , and how music is twisted or the text is rewritten , for example , so that it fits a particular regime - the ninth symphony has already been through all of that .
who else then has used beethoven 's music to serve their own ends ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ninth symphony has echoed both east and west goebbels always had the ninth symphony played for hitler 's birthday .
the gdr -lrb- communist east germany -rrb- chose it as their national anthem , albeit with a different text .
it has been played constantly both in the east and the west .
it has become the european anthem , and since the olympic games it has also been mentioned that mao used the symphony to motivate workers in the fields .
kamikaze pilots listened to this music - i 'm jumping through time a bit - and it was also the national anthem of rhodesia .
i think no other work has ever been so globalized .
nevertheless this human message , this commitment to human kindness has survived - and you could almost say this message is indestructible .
how would you judge beethoven 's music today ?
what is the situation with " power " and " music " ?
for me personally , the power of music is at the forefront because i 'd like to keep believing in the utopia that music can change a lot .
in 2006 , we had a guest youth orchestra from south africa , where musicians with different backgrounds performed together , for example .
music can also be a social instrument .
and this power ca n't be burned onto a cd .
the reproduction of music in a concert is something exclusive .
there you can really feel the power of music - and i do n't think you can get away from it . interview : klaus gehrke -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
the play on words reflects the turbulent history of the ninth symphony : its repeated exploitation by powerful figures , as well as its withstanding power to move people .
deutsche welle : ms schmiel , how did you choose the motto " macht.musik " ?
ilona schmiel : the ninth symphony was of course the impetus to ask how this work can be used to represent a whole program .
and that was the reason to hold the festival under the motto " macht.musik " and to follow the path of the ninth symphony from its premiere in 1824 to today .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ilona schmiel has directed the beethovenfest since 2004 beethoven 's political commitment , this utopia - the " ode to joy " by friedrich schiller , which he set to music , is a utopia - has n't lost any of its relevance .
we are still living in an age of war , suppression , hunger and many other injustices .
back in his time - the work was completed in 1824 - beethoven probably thought things would improve .
and that alone is a reason the ninth symphony can be made a focal point .
the question of how the reception of this piece continues in 2008 has always moved me because , as far as i know , there is no other work in the world that is played so often and deliberately chosen for so many different occasions .
the piece has not only been a part of triumphs , but also of many mistakes that have been made by governments , rulers and leaders , where the symphony was totally appropriated by politics and exploited for political purposes and dictatorial statements .
relatively speaking , beethoven had a lot of contact with the powerful figures of his time , and if you look back on his work - for example the " eroica , " " wellington 's victory " or " egmont " - he often expressed himself politically through his music .
but he did so quite differently in each case .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt masur will conduct the ninth at this year 's festival the issue of how he surrounded himself with powerful figures , but at the same time also left them hanging , was a central theme in his life , i think .
and it begs the question of where beethoven 's development through the symphonies leads - past a rejection of the powers that be , to a civil society .
on the one hand it is really a path beyond the worship of powerful figures - such as napoleon - but , on the other hand , he is using the civil society , which finances the music and supports the composer .
that 's is why i think this music is still so relevant and moving today .
questions about how to deal with works of music today , how music is used , what demands are placed on it , how much it needs to align with the state to be performed on certain occasions , and how music is twisted or the text is rewritten , for example , so that it fits a particular regime - the ninth symphony has already been through all of that .
who else then has used beethoven 's music to serve their own ends ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ninth symphony has echoed both east and west goebbels always had the ninth symphony played for hitler 's birthday .
the gdr -lrb- communist east germany -rrb- chose it as their national anthem , albeit with a different text .
it has been played constantly both in the east and the west .
it has become the european anthem , and since the olympic games it has also been mentioned that mao used the symphony to motivate workers in the fields .
kamikaze pilots listened to this music - i 'm jumping through time a bit - and it was also the national anthem of rhodesia .
i think no other work has ever been so globalized .
nevertheless this human message , this commitment to human kindness has survived - and you could almost say this message is indestructible .
how would you judge beethoven 's music today ?
what is the situation with " power " and " music " ?
for me personally , the power of music is at the forefront because i 'd like to keep believing in the utopia that music can change a lot .
in 2006 , we had a guest youth orchestra from south africa , where musicians with different backgrounds performed together , for example .
music can also be a social instrument .
and this power ca n't be burned onto a cd .
the reproduction of music in a concert is something exclusive .
there you can really feel the power of music - and i do n't think you can get away from it . interview : klaus gehrke -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

26 , by the environmental group transport and environment -lrb- t & e -rrb- . the munich-based carmaker will have to cut carbon dioxide emissions by another 19 percent by 2012 if it is to meet the european union 's target . under laws proposed by the eu 's executive , the european commission , and currently under debate , every car manufacturer which sells large numbers of vehicles in europe should be given a target for the average amount of co2 its new cars emit from 2012 .
the proposed targets are calculated according to the average weight of cars each firm sells . bad grade for german cars despite the munich manufacturer 's relative progress , t & e said that , overall , german cars - including those made by bmw , daimler and volkswagen - emitted 10 grams of carbon dioxide more than the eu average . french car manufacturers are the closest to hitting proposed european union targets for reducing their co2 emissions , said the brussels-based environmental group , while japanese makers are the furthest away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peugeot is close to the target , but moving forward slowly according to t & e 's study , based on official eu data , the peugeot-citroen group is closest to its target , needing to reduce average new car emissions by 10 percent in the next five years . at the other end of the spectrum , suzuki faces making cuts of a hefty 25 percent in its average car emissions , daimler and mazda will have to make 24-percent cuts and nissan will have to cut by 22 percent , the study said . " it is striking that three of the bottom four carmakers are japanese ...
all three did not close the gap sufficiently in 2007 and will have to speed up their efforts , " it said . heavy cars to blame while french carmakers are closer to their targets , they are making relatively slow progress : peugeot-citroen cut emissions by 0.9 percent in 2007 , while renault managed just 0.5 percent , meaning that both groups will have to step up their efforts in order to hit the target . t & e blamed the rising weight of cars for the small cuts made to emissions .

dw takes a look at the man behind the baton . masur has been a leading conductor for over four decades .
deep in concentration but in constant eye contact with the musicians while on stage , he has a way of drawing the music out of his orchestra with spare but energetic gestures . intensity , passion and energy exude from the 81-year-old when he takes up his baton . born in 1927 in silesia , now part of poland , masur studied music and conducting in leipzig but did n't finish to receive his diploma .
nevertheless , he gathered extensive experience on the stages of the former east germany , conducting and working as a vocal coach in halle , erfurt , schwerin and at the comic opera in east berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw offers live recordings of masur conducting beethoven in 1967 , at the age of 40 , masur became director of the dresden philharmonic orchestra .
three years later he returned to leipzig , which would become the most significant station in his career . spokesman for democracy as the music director of the gewandhaus orchestra in leipzig , masur quickly became one of the most celebrated conductors in east germany .
he led the ensemble on numerous tours , performing in over 900 concerts between 1970 and 1997 . as the soviet union began to crumble in the late 1980s , leipzig became a center of political protest in communist east germany .
masur made his voice heard as well , joining in the famous monday demonstrations . " our common concerns and responsibility have brought us together today , " the conductor said in front of the nikolaikirche in leipzig on a monday in 1989 . " we are affected by the developments in our city and are looking for a solution , " said masur , addressing the government .
" we urgently ask you to be prudent , so that peaceful dialogue is possible . " music for lonely people in 1991 , masur left his newly reunified country to direct the new york philharmonic , succeeding zubin mehta .
over the next 11 years , he developed a special program structure that not only appealed to new yorkers , but went over well across the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new york is full of lonely people , concluded masur he said he discovered his secret while taking a walk in the big apple . " i found out that new york is actually full of lonely people , and i decided to make my programs so that everyone who came to the concert would feel at home , " he said . masur has since moved his workplace from the hudson river to the seine - with a layover on the thames as principal conductor of the london philharmonic orchestra from 2000 to 2007 - and now directs the orchestre national de france .
thoughts of retirement seem to be far from his mind . " i hope that i can cut back slowly , " he said .
" if i stop tomorrow , you 'll certainly be reading my obituary pretty soon because music is part of my life . " klaus gehrke -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" in the current crisis it became necessary to make a decision , " medvedev said in a nationally televised statement tuesday , aug .
26 .
" taking into consideration the will of the people and guided by the un charter of 1970 ... and other basic international law , i have signed a decree recognizing abkhazia and south ossetia . " it is not an easy choice , but it is the only way to protect the lives of civilians , " the president said after meeting with russia 's security chiefs . medvedev signed a second decree tuesday instructing the russian foreign ministry to establish diplomatic relations with abkhazia and south ossetia and sign partnership agreements with them . ties ice over bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : resident of gori , south ossetia , received aid after their city was devastated the move is likely to deepen the wedge in russia 's relations with the west , which views south ossetia and abkhazia as part of georgia .
russian stocks fell tuesday , with traders anticipating an increase in international tension . the world now faces new rifts , former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev was quoted as saying by itar-tass news agency tuesday . " the risk of a new schism has arisen .
there is a growing threat of global chaos , " gorbachev was quoted as saying in reaction to the crisis . german chancellor angela merkel sharply criticized the decision tuesday .
speaking on a visit to the estonian capital of tallinn , merkel said medvedev 's decision was " absolutely not acceptable " and ran " contrary to international law . " " we must by consequence react united as the european union , " merkel said . she also stressed support for stronger relations between the eu and georgia , including making it easier for georgians to obtain visas to the bloc . " georgia and ukraine will be members of nato , " the chancellor said .
russia has sharply opposed nato 's eastward expansion , and both countries ' bids were turned down by alliance leaders earlier this year .
the matter is to be reconsidered at a summit in december . merkel said , however , that dialogue between nato and russia should continue . nato secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer also rejected medvedev 's decision to recognize the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia .
he questioned whether russia was truly interested in peace and security in the caucasus region , according to a statement . " this is in direct violation of numerous un security council resolutions regarding georgia 's territorial integrity , resolutions that russia itself has endorsed , " de hoop scheffer said in a statement read out by his spokeswoman . on the eve of something bigger france , which brokered the cease-fire agreement between russia and georgia , also criticized the kremlin 's decision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the georgian offensive was compared to the murder that set off world war i " we consider this a regrettable decision and i recall our attachment to the territorial integrity of georgia , " said a spokesman for the french foreign ministry . just prior to medvedev 's announcement , the european union had expressed its opposition to recognizing the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia . russia 's nato envoy , dmitry rogozin , compared the current situation to europe in 1914 on the eve of world war i , " when , because of one terrorist , leading world powers clashed , " he told the rbk daily business newspaper .
war broke out after austro-hungarian archduke franz ferdinand was assassinated in august 1914 . but russian foreign minister sergey lavrov said russia is unlikely to be subjected to international isolation . " i do n't think we should really be afraid of isolation , " he told reporters in english .
" i do n't believe this should really be a doomsday scenario .
i believe common sense should prevail . " accusations of genocide in his statement issued tuesday , medvedev condemned georgia 's offensive to reclaim south ossetia earlier this month . " on the night of august 8th , tbilisi had a choice : -lrb- georgian president -rrb- saakashvili opted for genocide , " said the russian president .

with this move , russia is not only ignoring all the warnings of western governments handed out over the past few days , but is also in violation of international law by disregarding the sovereign borders of its european neighbor , georgia . of course , the russian president considers himself to be in the right , since the georgian government tried to remove the separatists ' regimes from georgian territory using force , but the kremlin is alone in this view . through this decision , russia has resorted to dangerous self isolation .

" in the current crisis it became necessary to make a decision , " medvedev said in a nationally televised statement tuesday , aug .
26 .
" taking into consideration the will of the people and guided by the un charter of 1970 ... and other basic international law , i have signed a decree recognizing abkhazia and south ossetia . " it is not an easy choice , but it is the only way to protect the lives of civilians , " the president said after meeting with russia 's security chiefs . medvedev signed a second decree tuesday instructing the russian foreign ministry to establish diplomatic relations with abkhazia and south ossetia and sign partnership agreements with them . ties ice over bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : resident of gori , south ossetia , received aid after their city was devastated the move is likely to deepen the wedge in russia 's relations with the west , which views south ossetia and abkhazia as part of georgia .
russian stocks fell tuesday , with traders anticipating an increase in international tension . the world now faces new rifts , former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev was quoted as saying by itar-tass news agency tuesday . " the risk of a new schism has arisen .
there is a growing threat of global chaos , " gorbachev was quoted as saying in reaction to the crisis . german chancellor angela merkel sharply criticized the decision tuesday .
speaking on a visit to the estonian capital of tallinn , merkel said medvedev 's decision was " absolutely not acceptable " and ran " contrary to international law . " " we must by consequence react united as the european union , " merkel said . she also stressed support for stronger relations between the eu and georgia , including making it easier for georgians to obtain visas to the bloc . " georgia and ukraine will be members of nato , " the chancellor said .
russia has sharply opposed nato 's eastward expansion , and both countries ' bids were turned down by alliance leaders earlier this year .
the matter is to be reconsidered at a summit in december . merkel said , however , that dialogue between nato and russia should continue . nato secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer also rejected medvedev 's decision to recognize the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia .
he questioned whether russia was truly interested in peace and security in the caucasus region , according to a statement . " this is in direct violation of numerous un security council resolutions regarding georgia 's territorial integrity , resolutions that russia itself has endorsed , " de hoop scheffer said in a statement read out by his spokeswoman . on the eve of something bigger france , which brokered the cease-fire agreement between russia and georgia , also criticized the kremlin 's decision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the georgian offensive was compared to the murder that set off world war i " we consider this a regrettable decision and i recall our attachment to the territorial integrity of georgia , " said a spokesman for the french foreign ministry . just prior to medvedev 's announcement , the european union had expressed its opposition to recognizing the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia . russia 's nato envoy , dmitry rogozin , compared the current situation to europe in 1914 on the eve of world war i , " when , because of one terrorist , leading world powers clashed , " he told the rbk daily business newspaper .
war broke out after austro-hungarian archduke franz ferdinand was assassinated in august 1914 . but russian foreign minister sergey lavrov said russia is unlikely to be subjected to international isolation . " i do n't think we should really be afraid of isolation , " he told reporters in english .
" i do n't believe this should really be a doomsday scenario .
i believe common sense should prevail . " accusations of genocide in his statement issued tuesday , medvedev condemned georgia 's offensive to reclaim south ossetia earlier this month . " on the night of august 8th , tbilisi had a choice : -lrb- georgian president -rrb- saakashvili opted for genocide , " said the russian president .

dw takes a look at the man behind the baton . masur has been a leading conductor for over four decades .
deep in concentration but in constant eye contact with the musicians while on stage , he has a way of drawing the music out of his orchestra with spare but energetic gestures . intensity , passion and energy exude from the 81-year-old when he takes up his baton . born in 1927 in silesia , now part of poland , masur studied music and conducting in leipzig but did n't finish to receive his diploma .
nevertheless , he gathered extensive experience on the stages of the former east germany , conducting and working as a vocal coach in halle , erfurt , schwerin and at the comic opera in east berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw offers live recordings of masur conducting beethoven in 1967 , at the age of 40 , masur became director of the dresden philharmonic orchestra .

" we urgently ask you to be prudent , so that peaceful dialogue is possible . " music for lonely people in 1991 , masur left his newly reunified country to direct the new york philharmonic , succeeding zubin mehta .
over the next 11 years , he developed a special program structure that not only appealed to new yorkers , but went over well across the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new york is full of lonely people , concluded masur he said he discovered his secret while taking a walk in the big apple .

with this move , russia is not only ignoring all the warnings of western governments handed out over the past few days , but is also in violation of international law by disregarding the sovereign borders of its european neighbor , georgia . of course , the russian president considers himself to be in the right , since the georgian government tried to remove the separatists ' regimes from georgian territory using force , but the kremlin is alone in this view . through this decision , russia has resorted to dangerous self isolation .
the recognition of south ossetia and abkhazia will certainly cause considerable damage to the relationship between russia and the west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel the kremlin is delusional if it assumes that the west will simply be pacified after a short while .
russia has , without a doubt , the potential to cause considerable damage to western interests : in relation to afghanistan , the iranian nuclear problem , as well as the energy supply .
but that also applies to the west . now the danger exists that both sides can come up with more problems for the other .
the west could react by allowing georgia or the ukraine to join nato , or by blocking russia ’ s wto membership .
russia could stop supporting the west in afghanistan , or could form an international gas cartel .
the ammunition on both sides is considerable . what is unfortunate is that no one is being helped by the heightening of the dispute - neither russia nor the west .
even south ossetia and abkhazia wo n't get anything through the recognition of their independence by russia , since it 's only valid in moscow . it , however , can not be assumed that nato and the eu nations will simply stop their daily dealings with russia .
all of the western governments have already made that clear in their warnings over the past few days .
western nations will find asymmetrical answers to russia acting alone and defying international principles .
here russia has clearly underestimated how much control western nations have over russian interests . at first glance the georgian conflict was rather insignificant from an american and european perspective .
however , this recent russian action will surely lead to nato and the eu consolidating and unifying their russia policies .
russia 's critics will be there to take it all in , and advocates of a moderate course will be silenced .
that is clearly visible from the reactions of both german chancellor angela merkel and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier .
germany has long belonged to the eu nations which have been firm in their cooperation with russia .
now all of that could change . ingo mannteufel is the head of deutsche welles 's russian online and radio departments -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

26 , by the environmental group transport and environment -lrb- t & e -rrb- . the munich-based carmaker will have to cut carbon dioxide emissions by another 19 percent by 2012 if it is to meet the european union 's target . under laws proposed by the eu 's executive , the european commission , and currently under debate , every car manufacturer which sells large numbers of vehicles in europe should be given a target for the average amount of co2 its new cars emit from 2012 .
the proposed targets are calculated according to the average weight of cars each firm sells . bad grade for german cars despite the munich manufacturer 's relative progress , t & e said that , overall , german cars - including those made by bmw , daimler and volkswagen - emitted 10 grams of carbon dioxide more than the eu average . french car manufacturers are the closest to hitting proposed european union targets for reducing their co2 emissions , said the brussels-based environmental group , while japanese makers are the furthest away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peugeot is close to the target , but moving forward slowly according to t & e 's study , based on official eu data , the peugeot-citroen group is closest to its target , needing to reduce average new car emissions by 10 percent in the next five years . at the other end of the spectrum , suzuki faces making cuts of a hefty 25 percent in its average car emissions , daimler and mazda will have to make 24-percent cuts and nissan will have to cut by 22 percent , the study said . " it is striking that three of the bottom four carmakers are japanese ...
all three did not close the gap sufficiently in 2007 and will have to speed up their efforts , " it said . heavy cars to blame while french carmakers are closer to their targets , they are making relatively slow progress : peugeot-citroen cut emissions by 0.9 percent in 2007 , while renault managed just 0.5 percent , meaning that both groups will have to step up their efforts in order to hit the target . t & e blamed the rising weight of cars for the small cuts made to emissions .

that , analysts say , is why there is a lot at stake as far as europe-russia relations are concerned .

warsaw , in particular , wants the eu to take a hard line in eu-russia relations . by announcing the eu summit in brussels next monday , sept .
1 , sarkozy wants to say clearly to moscow that the european union is " a force which has to dealt with , " and that agreements made with him by russian president dmitry medvedev must be honored , a french diplomat told the afp news agency on monday , aug .
25 . the six-point peace plan brokered by sarkozy , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , has been criticized in some european capitals as being too vague , too moscow-friendly and organized with too little consultation . after russia failed to withdraw all its troops from georgia , a key point of the cease-fire , the french president " realized that the russians were exploiting the ambiguous margins of the text and that there was a risk of a loss of credibility for the eu and the french presidency , " european policy center analyst antonio missiroli told afp . but it wo n't be easy , at the hastily-arranged summit which sarkozy announced sunday , to obtain european consensus on the future of relations with russia , he added . polish objections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk has led europe 's pro-georgian camp poland , as well as other eastern european nations that fell under the former soviet union 's direct sphere of influence , wants to convince the 27-member eu not to cut moscow any special deals after its military intervention in georgia this month . " i spoke with -lrb- germany 's -rrb- chancellor merkel this morning to make the european position uniform , harder and categorical concerning russia in the context of the crisis in the caucasus , " premier donald tusk told reporters . the differences among eu nations on how to handle russia were already highlighted earlier this month .
pro-georgia leaders of poland , estonia , lithuania and latvia traveled to tbilisi with the message that the french-brokered peace plan did not provide sufficient protection for georgia . meanwhile , france , germany , italy and spain lead the faction of eu member who do not want to see relations with moscow completely frozen due to russia 's importance as a trading partner and its international role as a veto-power at the united nations security council . chance for change ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is a key energy supplier to the european union but tusk said he would not rule out the possibility of some nations that want to keep communication with russia open could be convinced to change their tact at the summit . " i spoke with president sarkozy a few days ago and he did not hide that russia 's behavior is beginning to be irritating to a certain degree and will require the eu to make firm decisions , " tusk said . it was only last month that talks on a new strategic accord between russia and the eu got properly under way after being long-blocked by polish and lithuanian objections .
that , analysts say , is why there is a lot at stake as far as europe-russia relations are concerned . " i do n't see the possibility of introducing sanctions against russia if the situation remains the way it is today , " said cristina gallach , spokeswoman for eu foreign policy chief javier solana . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the first german in outer space came from a small town in saxony .
today , it 's one of the few places that still remember the communist cosmonaut . on aug .
26 , 1978 , communist east germany launched the soyuz 31 to the soviet space station salyut 6 .
on board was 41-year-old sigmund jaehn , who went down in history as " the first german cosmonaut . " jaehn 's career began in 1955 when he joined the gdr air force and became a pilot and military scientist .
between 1966 and 1970 he studied at the gagarin military air academy in monino , in the soviet union , and afterwards worked in the gdr air force administration , responsible for pilot education and flight safety . forgotten hero bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pride of east germany the 1978 flight marked a political milestone , with communist leaders pointing to its success as evidence of the eastern bloc 's technological superiority .
in september the same year , they showed their appreciation by awarding sigmund jaehn the title hero of the soviet union . but once the cold war was over , jaehn 's achievements paled somewhat .
these days , the name rings only a faint bell to most germans .
despite the huge propaganda surrounding his seven-day space mission , jaehn soon became just a footnote in history . local pride it 's a different story in his hometown of morgenroethe-rautenkranz , close to the czech border .
few locals will ever forget the town 's famous son . it is even home to a permanent exhibition of german astronautics , with one room dedicated to jaehn 's achievements . " it means a lot to all of us , " said karin schaedlich from the exhibition .
" i was 17 years old when sigmund jaehn went into space .
and when he came back i was out on the street to see him and welcome him back together with his commander valery bykovsky .
it was a great event here in rautenkranz .
even after 30 years it 's still very important for his home village . " schaedlich 's coworker romy mothes said she is keen to help young people in the region keep the jaehn legacy alive . " i think our younger generation knows who sigmund jaehn is , " she said .
" they learn about him in school .
and we have a lot of children in our exhibition and all of them know him . " putting politics in perspective bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaehn today is a frequent visitor to morgenroethe-rautenkranz the man himself drops by now and then .
at the time , he probably enjoyed the political fuss less than anyone .
although he toed the party line , his job gave him a unique perspective that helped him keep his eye on the broader picture . " in the spacecraft we travel at 8 kilometers per second , and it takes less than a minute to pass our small country , " the communist hero once said . hardy graupner -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 26.08.2008 danish rockstar uses nazi slogan to protest smoking ban großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking bans are the creations of " health fascists , " larson has said a pro-smoking campaign launched in denmark by one of the country 's best-known rockstars features a notorious nazi slogan .
the country 's modest jewish community is refusing to take offense . as frontman of gasolin ' , a seminal rock band which enjoyed its heyday in the 1970s , kim larsen has always been one of the bad boys of danish rock .
and like any self-respecting hellraiser , he 's vociferously anti-establishment . in the best rock ' n ' roll tradition , he 's also a die-hard smoker .
so it comes as no surprise that he does n't like the eu 's anti-smoking laws introduced in denmark one year ago , which ban smoking in public bars and restaurants . health fascists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who reads billboards anyway ?
not the type who likes being told what to do , larsen recently helped fund an advertising campaign revolving around the slogan " tillykke med rygeforbudet - gesundheit macht frei ! ! ! " the first claim means " good luck with the smoking ban " in danish , while the german slogan " health sets you free " is an obvious allusion to the nazi slogan " arbeit macht frei , " or " work sets you free , " which was placed at the entrances to a number of nazi concentration camps , such as auschwitz and dachau . " the people who introduced the smoking ban are health fascists , " larsen has been quoted as saying . he said the reference to the third reich is a valid one , because the nazis introduced a nationwide tobacco ban as part of their quest for bodily and racial purity . " hitler was the first to ban smoking , " said the one-time eurovision song contest hopeful . cause celebre bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kim larsen : too stupid to be taken seriously ?
larsen allegedly is n't the only celebrity to have donated to the " himmelbla " fund behind the campaign , whose ads are now splurged across copenhagen 's billboards . " this is not about a defense of smoking , " larsen has said .
" this is about a defense of democracy and freedom . " the country 's jewish community , for its part , is choosing to see the campaign in this context - merely a clumsy protest against government interference with individual freedoms . " it 's stupid , plain stupid , " stefan isaak , president of the danish jewish community , told dw-world.de.
" i do n't connect it with any kind of anti-semitism - it 's just plain stupidity . " explaining why larsen 's posters have gone largely ignored , he pointed out that denmark has few holocaust survivors , because most of the country 's jews left for sweden during world war ii . " feelings might be hurt , " he said .
" but the whole slogan is so idiotic ; you ca n't begin to connect it to auschwitz . " bad taste bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smokers : social pariahs arne rolighed of denmark 's leading cancer research charity is taking more offense . " it 's extremely tasteless , " he was quoted as saying in danish daily politiken . it 's not the first time this kind of parallel has been drawn .
in germany - where nazi allusions are not shrugged off as lightly as they are in denmark - one protester launched a line of t-shirts earlier this year bearing a yellow star of david along with the word " smoker . " the shirt was quickly withdrawn from the market after jewish groups objected to comparing the perceived persecution of smokers to that of the jews under the nazis . isaak is more circumspect . " the less said about -lsb- larsen 's campaign -rsb- , the better , " he said . jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the country 's modest jewish community is refusing to take offense . as frontman of gasolin ' , a seminal rock band which enjoyed its heyday in the 1970s , kim larsen has always been one of the bad boys of danish rock .
and like any self-respecting hellraiser , he 's vociferously anti-establishment . in the best rock ' n ' roll tradition , he 's also a die-hard smoker .
so it comes as no surprise that he does n't like the eu 's anti-smoking laws introduced in denmark one year ago , which ban smoking in public bars and restaurants . health fascists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who reads billboards anyway ?
not the type who likes being told what to do , larsen recently helped fund an advertising campaign revolving around the slogan " tillykke med rygeforbudet - gesundheit macht frei ! ! ! " the first claim means " good luck with the smoking ban " in danish , while the german slogan " health sets you free " is an obvious allusion to the nazi slogan " arbeit macht frei , " or " work sets you free , " which was placed at the entrances to a number of nazi concentration camps , such as auschwitz and dachau . " the people who introduced the smoking ban are health fascists , " larsen has been quoted as saying . he said the reference to the third reich is a valid one , because the nazis introduced a nationwide tobacco ban as part of their quest for bodily and racial purity . " hitler was the first to ban smoking , " said the one-time eurovision song contest hopeful . cause celebre bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kim larsen : too stupid to be taken seriously ?
larsen allegedly is n't the only celebrity to have donated to the " himmelbla " fund behind the campaign , whose ads are now splurged across copenhagen 's billboards . " this is not about a defense of smoking , " larsen has said .
" this is about a defense of democracy and freedom . " the country 's jewish community , for its part , is choosing to see the campaign in this context - merely a clumsy protest against government interference with individual freedoms . " it 's stupid , plain stupid , " stefan isaak , president of the danish jewish community , told dw-world.de.
" i do n't connect it with any kind of anti-semitism - it 's just plain stupidity . " explaining why larsen 's posters have gone largely ignored , he pointed out that denmark has few holocaust survivors , because most of the country 's jews left for sweden during world war ii .

" but the whole slogan is so idiotic ; you ca n't begin to connect it to auschwitz .

in germany - where nazi allusions are not shrugged off as lightly as they are in denmark - one protester launched a line of t-shirts earlier this year bearing a yellow star of david along with the word " smoker .

dw takes a look at the man behind the baton . masur has been a leading conductor for over four decades .
deep in concentration but in constant eye contact with the musicians while on stage , he has a way of drawing the music out of his orchestra with spare but energetic gestures . intensity , passion and energy exude from the 81-year-old when he takes up his baton . born in 1927 in silesia , now part of poland , masur studied music and conducting in leipzig but did n't finish to receive his diploma .
nevertheless , he gathered extensive experience on the stages of the former east germany , conducting and working as a vocal coach in halle , erfurt , schwerin and at the comic opera in east berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw offers live recordings of masur conducting beethoven in 1967 , at the age of 40 , masur became director of the dresden philharmonic orchestra .
three years later he returned to leipzig , which would become the most significant station in his career . spokesman for democracy as the music director of the gewandhaus orchestra in leipzig , masur quickly became one of the most celebrated conductors in east germany .
he led the ensemble on numerous tours , performing in over 900 concerts between 1970 and 1997 . as the soviet union began to crumble in the late 1980s , leipzig became a center of political protest in communist east germany .
masur made his voice heard as well , joining in the famous monday demonstrations . " our common concerns and responsibility have brought us together today , " the conductor said in front of the nikolaikirche in leipzig on a monday in 1989 . " we are affected by the developments in our city and are looking for a solution , " said masur , addressing the government .
" we urgently ask you to be prudent , so that peaceful dialogue is possible . " music for lonely people in 1991 , masur left his newly reunified country to direct the new york philharmonic , succeeding zubin mehta .
over the next 11 years , he developed a special program structure that not only appealed to new yorkers , but went over well across the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new york is full of lonely people , concluded masur he said he discovered his secret while taking a walk in the big apple . " i found out that new york is actually full of lonely people , and i decided to make my programs so that everyone who came to the concert would feel at home , " he said . masur has since moved his workplace from the hudson river to the seine - with a layover on the thames as principal conductor of the london philharmonic orchestra from 2000 to 2007 - and now directs the orchestre national de france .
thoughts of retirement seem to be far from his mind . " i hope that i can cut back slowly , " he said .
" if i stop tomorrow , you 'll certainly be reading my obituary pretty soon because music is part of my life . " klaus gehrke -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to georgian accounts , this began after russian forces were already moving from north ossetia towards south ossetia through the roki tunnel . august 8 : saakashvili orders a general military mobilization of georgia 's regular and reserve forces .
he calls on russia to stay out of the conflict .

the move draws international criticism . august 20 : russia announces a freeze to cooperation with nato .

a romantically glorified image : the lonely , troubled , but of course ingenious artist . first he threw a few books at his servant , then a chair without registering a trace of sympathy : " after that i had peace and quiet all day . "
and when a prince once thought two bassoons would do instead of three , he replied : " if your highness allocates instruments like that , then i do n't give a damn ! "
employees , the nobility , his publishers - they all got it dished to them .
one of his biographers called ludwig van beethoven the " bawdy genius . "
brain proprietor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there is only one beethoven " most of what we know about beethoven comes from his correspondence and his diary .
much unlike his contemporary goethe , who he did not get along very well with , beethoven was a stranger to self-stylization .
in his letters he writes about the malevolence of people and about the class restrictions which refused him contact with the women he worshipped .
he did not conduct himself as an outstanding nobleman ; he even treated friends to coarse language .
when his brother once acquired some land and signed himself as " van beethoven , land proprietor , " ludwig replied with " van beethoven , brain proprietor . "
to prince lichnowsky , one of his appreciators and patrons , he wrote : " prince , what you are , you are through chance and birth ; what i am , i am through my own labor .
there are many princes and there will continue to be thousands more , but there is only one beethoven . "
beethoven for all beethoven 's letters and diary are like a quarry from which one can extract whatever one needs .
there are sentences of his that give the impression that he had a revolutionary disposition , others that suggest he was elitist .
this ambiguity , together with his new musical aesthetic , later led to occasionally absurd attempts at exploiting his music : the 9th symphony sounded in 1937 for hitler 's birthday .
and even the news of hitler 's death was read out on the radio over the 9th symphony .
but even earlier , in the time of the weimar republic before the second world war , beethoven was politically exploited .
the right emphasized his supposed hostility towards the french and saw in him a " titanic fighting spirit . "
the left equated the revolutionary quality of his music with revolutionary politics .
that is something which later recurred in east germany : after the second world war beethoven was used by the gdr propagandists - beethoven as a fighter for world peace .
a moody artist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven did n't quite fit in to apply concrete political goals to beethoven himself is , however , totally excessive .
what he said was far too inconsistent .
for beethoven it was about finding new paths in music - new paths which he carved out dazzlingly .
beethoven was known for being business minded .
nevertheless he lived in a rundown house near vienna and hardly cared about his appearance .
to his contemporaries beethoven must have seemed completely unconventional .
beethoven remained a bachelor , he lived for music - in the morning he composed , in the afternoon he went for a walk , at lunchtime he ate heartily .
in many people 's eyes he defined the image of a brilliant but difficult artist - reinforced by the many hundreds of paintings and busts of a beethoven with wildly unkempt hair and a serious piercing glare .
beethoven 's deafness one often forgets the aspect that caused the most tragedy in his life : his deafness .
beethoven is just over 30 years old when it becomes clear that he can no longer conceal his worsening hearing .
a deaf musician ?
" my ears , they whirl and roar night and day , " he wrote .
beethoven considered suicide , withdrew himself from society .
he even wrote a farewell letter which he never sent .
in the letter is one of beethoven 's most famous sentences about himself : " oh you people who think me hostile , stubborn and misanthropic , how you wrong me .

warsaw , in particular , wants the eu to take a hard line in eu-russia relations . by announcing the eu summit in brussels next monday , sept .
1 , sarkozy wants to say clearly to moscow that the european union is " a force which has to dealt with , " and that agreements made with him by russian president dmitry medvedev must be honored , a french diplomat told the afp news agency on monday , aug .
25 . the six-point peace plan brokered by sarkozy , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , has been criticized in some european capitals as being too vague , too moscow-friendly and organized with too little consultation . after russia failed to withdraw all its troops from georgia , a key point of the cease-fire , the french president " realized that the russians were exploiting the ambiguous margins of the text and that there was a risk of a loss of credibility for the eu and the french presidency , " european policy center analyst antonio missiroli told afp . but it wo n't be easy , at the hastily-arranged summit which sarkozy announced sunday , to obtain european consensus on the future of relations with russia , he added . polish objections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk has led europe 's pro-georgian camp poland , as well as other eastern european nations that fell under the former soviet union 's direct sphere of influence , wants to convince the 27-member eu not to cut moscow any special deals after its military intervention in georgia this month . " i spoke with -lrb- germany 's -rrb- chancellor merkel this morning to make the european position uniform , harder and categorical concerning russia in the context of the crisis in the caucasus , " premier donald tusk told reporters . the differences among eu nations on how to handle russia were already highlighted earlier this month .
pro-georgia leaders of poland , estonia , lithuania and latvia traveled to tbilisi with the message that the french-brokered peace plan did not provide sufficient protection for georgia . meanwhile , france , germany , italy and spain lead the faction of eu member who do not want to see relations with moscow completely frozen due to russia 's importance as a trading partner and its international role as a veto-power at the united nations security council . chance for change ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is a key energy supplier to the european union but tusk said he would not rule out the possibility of some nations that want to keep communication with russia open could be convinced to change their tact at the summit . " i spoke with president sarkozy a few days ago and he did not hide that russia 's behavior is beginning to be irritating to a certain degree and will require the eu to make firm decisions , " tusk said . it was only last month that talks on a new strategic accord between russia and the eu got properly under way after being long-blocked by polish and lithuanian objections .
that , analysts say , is why there is a lot at stake as far as europe-russia relations are concerned . " i do n't see the possibility of introducing sanctions against russia if the situation remains the way it is today , " said cristina gallach , spokeswoman for eu foreign policy chief javier solana . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

pro-georgia leaders of poland , estonia , lithuania and latvia traveled to tbilisi with the message that the french-brokered peace plan did not provide sufficient protection for georgia . meanwhile , france , germany , italy and spain lead the faction of eu member who do not want to see relations with moscow completely frozen due to russia 's importance as a trading partner and its international role as a veto-power at the united nations security council . chance for change ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is a key energy supplier to the european union but tusk said he would not rule out the possibility of some nations that want to keep communication with russia open could be convinced to change their tact at the summit . " i spoke with president sarkozy a few days ago and he did not hide that russia 's behavior is beginning to be irritating to a certain degree and will require the eu to make firm decisions , " tusk said . it was only last month that talks on a new strategic accord between russia and the eu got properly under way after being long-blocked by polish and lithuanian objections .
that , analysts say , is why there is a lot at stake as far as europe-russia relations are concerned . " i do n't see the possibility of introducing sanctions against russia if the situation remains the way it is today , " said cristina gallach , spokeswoman for eu foreign policy chief javier solana . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
the play on words reflects the turbulent history of the ninth symphony : its repeated exploitation by powerful figures , as well as its withstanding power to move people .
deutsche welle : ms schmiel , how did you choose the motto " macht.musik " ?
ilona schmiel : the ninth symphony was of course the impetus to ask how this work can be used to represent a whole program .
and that was the reason to hold the festival under the motto " macht.musik " and to follow the path of the ninth symphony from its premiere in 1824 to today .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ilona schmiel has directed the beethovenfest since 2004 beethoven 's political commitment , this utopia - the " ode to joy " by friedrich schiller , which he set to music , is a utopia - has n't lost any of its relevance .
we are still living in an age of war , suppression , hunger and many other injustices .
back in his time - the work was completed in 1824 - beethoven probably thought things would improve .
and that alone is a reason the ninth symphony can be made a focal point .
the question of how the reception of this piece continues in 2008 has always moved me because , as far as i know , there is no other work in the world that is played so often and deliberately chosen for so many different occasions .
the piece has not only been a part of triumphs , but also of many mistakes that have been made by governments , rulers and leaders , where the symphony was totally appropriated by politics and exploited for political purposes and dictatorial statements .
relatively speaking , beethoven had a lot of contact with the powerful figures of his time , and if you look back on his work - for example the " eroica , " " wellington 's victory " or " egmont " - he often expressed himself politically through his music .
but he did so quite differently in each case .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt masur will conduct the ninth at this year 's festival the issue of how he surrounded himself with powerful figures , but at the same time also left them hanging , was a central theme in his life , i think .
and it begs the question of where beethoven 's development through the symphonies leads - past a rejection of the powers that be , to a civil society .
on the one hand it is really a path beyond the worship of powerful figures - such as napoleon - but , on the other hand , he is using the civil society , which finances the music and supports the composer .
that 's is why i think this music is still so relevant and moving today .
questions about how to deal with works of music today , how music is used , what demands are placed on it , how much it needs to align with the state to be performed on certain occasions , and how music is twisted or the text is rewritten , for example , so that it fits a particular regime - the ninth symphony has already been through all of that .
who else then has used beethoven 's music to serve their own ends ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ninth symphony has echoed both east and west goebbels always had the ninth symphony played for hitler 's birthday .
the gdr -lrb- communist east germany -rrb- chose it as their national anthem , albeit with a different text .
it has been played constantly both in the east and the west .
it has become the european anthem , and since the olympic games it has also been mentioned that mao used the symphony to motivate workers in the fields .
kamikaze pilots listened to this music - i 'm jumping through time a bit - and it was also the national anthem of rhodesia .
i think no other work has ever been so globalized .
nevertheless this human message , this commitment to human kindness has survived - and you could almost say this message is indestructible .
how would you judge beethoven 's music today ?
what is the situation with " power " and " music " ?
for me personally , the power of music is at the forefront because i 'd like to keep believing in the utopia that music can change a lot .
in 2006 , we had a guest youth orchestra from south africa , where musicians with different backgrounds performed together , for example .
music can also be a social instrument .
and this power ca n't be burned onto a cd .
the reproduction of music in a concert is something exclusive .
there you can really feel the power of music - and i do n't think you can get away from it . interview : klaus gehrke -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 26.08.2008 danish rockstar uses nazi slogan to protest smoking ban großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking bans are the creations of " health fascists , " larson has said a pro-smoking campaign launched in denmark by one of the country 's best-known rockstars features a notorious nazi slogan .
the country 's modest jewish community is refusing to take offense . as frontman of gasolin ' , a seminal rock band which enjoyed its heyday in the 1970s , kim larsen has always been one of the bad boys of danish rock .
and like any self-respecting hellraiser , he 's vociferously anti-establishment . in the best rock ' n ' roll tradition , he 's also a die-hard smoker .
so it comes as no surprise that he does n't like the eu 's anti-smoking laws introduced in denmark one year ago , which ban smoking in public bars and restaurants . health fascists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who reads billboards anyway ?
not the type who likes being told what to do , larsen recently helped fund an advertising campaign revolving around the slogan " tillykke med rygeforbudet - gesundheit macht frei ! ! ! " the first claim means " good luck with the smoking ban " in danish , while the german slogan " health sets you free " is an obvious allusion to the nazi slogan " arbeit macht frei , " or " work sets you free , " which was placed at the entrances to a number of nazi concentration camps , such as auschwitz and dachau . " the people who introduced the smoking ban are health fascists , " larsen has been quoted as saying . he said the reference to the third reich is a valid one , because the nazis introduced a nationwide tobacco ban as part of their quest for bodily and racial purity . " hitler was the first to ban smoking , " said the one-time eurovision song contest hopeful . cause celebre bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kim larsen : too stupid to be taken seriously ?
larsen allegedly is n't the only celebrity to have donated to the " himmelbla " fund behind the campaign , whose ads are now splurged across copenhagen 's billboards . " this is not about a defense of smoking , " larsen has said .
" this is about a defense of democracy and freedom . " the country 's jewish community , for its part , is choosing to see the campaign in this context - merely a clumsy protest against government interference with individual freedoms . " it 's stupid , plain stupid , " stefan isaak , president of the danish jewish community , told dw-world.de.
" i do n't connect it with any kind of anti-semitism - it 's just plain stupidity . " explaining why larsen 's posters have gone largely ignored , he pointed out that denmark has few holocaust survivors , because most of the country 's jews left for sweden during world war ii . " feelings might be hurt , " he said .
" but the whole slogan is so idiotic ; you ca n't begin to connect it to auschwitz . " bad taste bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smokers : social pariahs arne rolighed of denmark 's leading cancer research charity is taking more offense . " it 's extremely tasteless , " he was quoted as saying in danish daily politiken . it 's not the first time this kind of parallel has been drawn .
in germany - where nazi allusions are not shrugged off as lightly as they are in denmark - one protester launched a line of t-shirts earlier this year bearing a yellow star of david along with the word " smoker . " the shirt was quickly withdrawn from the market after jewish groups objected to comparing the perceived persecution of smokers to that of the jews under the nazis . isaak is more circumspect . " the less said about -lsb- larsen 's campaign -rsb- , the better , " he said . jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de beethovenfest -pipe- 26.08.2008 beethovenfest director talks ninth symphony politics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven 's ninth symphony has been used by both left and right wing politicians beethovenfest director ilona schmiel spoke with deutsche welle about the power of beethoven 's famous ninth symphony , and why the month-long event focuses on the influential work . the motto of this year 's beethovenfest is " macht.musik , " which in german can mean both " power.music " and " make.music. "
the play on words reflects the turbulent history of the ninth symphony : its repeated exploitation by powerful figures , as well as its withstanding power to move people .
deutsche welle : ms schmiel , how did you choose the motto " macht.musik " ?
ilona schmiel : the ninth symphony was of course the impetus to ask how this work can be used to represent a whole program .
and that was the reason to hold the festival under the motto " macht.musik " and to follow the path of the ninth symphony from its premiere in 1824 to today .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ilona schmiel has directed the beethovenfest since 2004 beethoven 's political commitment , this utopia - the " ode to joy " by friedrich schiller , which he set to music , is a utopia - has n't lost any of its relevance .
we are still living in an age of war , suppression , hunger and many other injustices .
back in his time - the work was completed in 1824 - beethoven probably thought things would improve .
and that alone is a reason the ninth symphony can be made a focal point .
the question of how the reception of this piece continues in 2008 has always moved me because , as far as i know , there is no other work in the world that is played so often and deliberately chosen for so many different occasions .
the piece has not only been a part of triumphs , but also of many mistakes that have been made by governments , rulers and leaders , where the symphony was totally appropriated by politics and exploited for political purposes and dictatorial statements .
relatively speaking , beethoven had a lot of contact with the powerful figures of his time , and if you look back on his work - for example the " eroica , " " wellington 's victory " or " egmont " - he often expressed himself politically through his music .
but he did so quite differently in each case .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt masur will conduct the ninth at this year 's festival the issue of how he surrounded himself with powerful figures , but at the same time also left them hanging , was a central theme in his life , i think .
and it begs the question of where beethoven 's development through the symphonies leads - past a rejection of the powers that be , to a civil society .
on the one hand it is really a path beyond the worship of powerful figures - such as napoleon - but , on the other hand , he is using the civil society , which finances the music and supports the composer .
that 's is why i think this music is still so relevant and moving today .
questions about how to deal with works of music today , how music is used , what demands are placed on it , how much it needs to align with the state to be performed on certain occasions , and how music is twisted or the text is rewritten , for example , so that it fits a particular regime - the ninth symphony has already been through all of that .
who else then has used beethoven 's music to serve their own ends ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ninth symphony has echoed both east and west goebbels always had the ninth symphony played for hitler 's birthday .
the gdr -lrb- communist east germany -rrb- chose it as their national anthem , albeit with a different text .
it has been played constantly both in the east and the west .
it has become the european anthem , and since the olympic games it has also been mentioned that mao used the symphony to motivate workers in the fields .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de beethovenfest -pipe- 26.08.2008 beethovenfest director talks ninth symphony politics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven 's ninth symphony has been used by both left and right wing politicians beethovenfest director ilona schmiel spoke with deutsche welle about the power of beethoven 's famous ninth symphony , and why the month-long event focuses on the influential work . the motto of this year 's beethovenfest is " macht.musik , " which in german can mean both " power.music " and " make.music. "
the play on words reflects the turbulent history of the ninth symphony : its repeated exploitation by powerful figures , as well as its withstanding power to move people .
deutsche welle : ms schmiel , how did you choose the motto " macht.musik " ?
ilona schmiel : the ninth symphony was of course the impetus to ask how this work can be used to represent a whole program .
and that was the reason to hold the festival under the motto " macht.musik " and to follow the path of the ninth symphony from its premiere in 1824 to today .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ilona schmiel has directed the beethovenfest since 2004 beethoven 's political commitment , this utopia - the " ode to joy " by friedrich schiller , which he set to music , is a utopia - has n't lost any of its relevance .
we are still living in an age of war , suppression , hunger and many other injustices .
back in his time - the work was completed in 1824 - beethoven probably thought things would improve .
and that alone is a reason the ninth symphony can be made a focal point .
the question of how the reception of this piece continues in 2008 has always moved me because , as far as i know , there is no other work in the world that is played so often and deliberately chosen for so many different occasions .
the piece has not only been a part of triumphs , but also of many mistakes that have been made by governments , rulers and leaders , where the symphony was totally appropriated by politics and exploited for political purposes and dictatorial statements .
relatively speaking , beethoven had a lot of contact with the powerful figures of his time , and if you look back on his work - for example the " eroica , " " wellington 's victory " or " egmont " - he often expressed himself politically through his music .
but he did so quite differently in each case .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt masur will conduct the ninth at this year 's festival the issue of how he surrounded himself with powerful figures , but at the same time also left them hanging , was a central theme in his life , i think .
and it begs the question of where beethoven 's development through the symphonies leads - past a rejection of the powers that be , to a civil society .
on the one hand it is really a path beyond the worship of powerful figures - such as napoleon - but , on the other hand , he is using the civil society , which finances the music and supports the composer .
that 's is why i think this music is still so relevant and moving today .
questions about how to deal with works of music today , how music is used , what demands are placed on it , how much it needs to align with the state to be performed on certain occasions , and how music is twisted or the text is rewritten , for example , so that it fits a particular regime - the ninth symphony has already been through all of that .
who else then has used beethoven 's music to serve their own ends ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ninth symphony has echoed both east and west goebbels always had the ninth symphony played for hitler 's birthday .
the gdr -lrb- communist east germany -rrb- chose it as their national anthem , albeit with a different text .
it has been played constantly both in the east and the west .
it has become the european anthem , and since the olympic games it has also been mentioned that mao used the symphony to motivate workers in the fields .
kamikaze pilots listened to this music - i 'm jumping through time a bit - and it was also the national anthem of rhodesia .
i think no other work has ever been so globalized .
nevertheless this human message , this commitment to human kindness has survived - and you could almost say this message is indestructible .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de georgia -pipe- 26.08.2008 analysis : opening a pandora 's box in the caucasus großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the region has been thrown into disarray the caucasus conflict was brought about at least in part by the west 's decision to recognize kosovo 's independence 6 months ago .
experts say this sparked a chain reaction in the region , which only moscow can now halt . when the west recognized kosovo 's independence half a year ago , russia 's leaders warned that the move would open a " pandora 's box " in the caucasus .
the mountainous region 's patchwork of ethnicities and states have long been difficult to reconcile into coherent nation states .
the recent , bloody 10-day war between russia and georgia over the former soviet states ' rebel region of south ossetia is the realization of that pandora 's box scenario .
the background russia has long supported georgia 's two ethnically separatist provinces of abkhazia and south ossetia , but stopped short of recognizing their independence - until now - fearing that secessions in those provinces would provide a dangerous precedent for other minority nations within the russian federation .
nevertheless , russian lawmakers this week unanimously passed a motion urging president dmitry medvedev to recognize georgia 's rebel regions as independent - 15 years after they won de facto autonomy in a war of succession from tbilisi in the early 1990s .
by some counts , over 80 percent of the populations in the regions have been issued russian passports under an especially generous russian policy that saakashvili decried as the creeping annexation of georgian territory .
the kosovo precedent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's independence set a dangerous precedence as russian tanks rolled into south ossetia on aug .
8 to push back georgia 's offensive to re-assert control , medvedev took the national stage , invoking the army in defense of russian citizens .
in a series of interviews by dpa news agency after kosovo 's independence in february , russian analysts foresaw a military flare up , but did not predict the possibility that moscow 's policy could turn to recognizing the regions .
the threat that kosovo could stand as a secessionist precedent in the caucasus had formed the kremlin 's most vivid protest to the province 's break from its ally serbia .
but while moscow is still confronted by the problems that the kosovo precedent raises , paradoxically , the comparison has now been turned into a justification of south ossetia and abkhazia 's right to self-determination .
western leaders have labeled russia 's move to recognize georgia 's regions as hypocrisy , while russian leaders hit back with the accusation that a double standard has been applied in the case of kosovo .
the resolution passed on monday argued that by its assault on civilians tbilisi had forgone all moral right over the area , drawing a direct link between russia incursion and the justification of nato 's bombing campaign in serbia in 1998 .
appealing before russian lawmakers south ossetia 's president eduard kokoity repeated what has become a maxim : " we have more political-legal grounds than kosovo does to have our independence recognized . "
but professor yury kolosov of the moscow institute of international relations threw cold water on the much-cited " kosovo precedent . "
" there is no such thing as a ' precedent ' in international law ... and , if this is a precedent , then it 's a bad one , " kolosov , an eminent member of russia 's association of international law , told dpa .
the final say in other words , the kremlin has the last word .
while the threat of recognizing the breakaway region adds to its bargaining power with the west , analysts said it would look for ways to delay such recognition , for example , by requesting the provinces hold a new referendum .
" it seems to me that now politically it would be more favorable to leave this situation hanging , " moscow-based analyst vyacheslav nikonov , head of the politika foundation , told news agency interfax on monday .
the kremlin and its allies , meanwhile , are n't deaf to its own warnings that seizing on kosovo as a precedent could spark a " chain reaction " in the region .
legal limbo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev - the ball is in his court medvedev sought to reassure the molodovan and azeri presidents - who have similar secession worries to georgia - on monday over the respective breakaway regions of nagorno karabakh and transnistria .
south ossetia 's ultimate ambition to unite with russia 's ethnically-similar region of north ossetia is no less problematic .
russia 's ties to abkhazia , which seeks only self-determination , have traditionally been stronger , as has its economic interest in the region .
a poll by the independent levada center in the aftermath of the conflict show near half of russians - or 46 percent - say south ossetia should become part of russia .
only 4 percent of those surveyed in interviews with 2,100 adults believed the province should remain part of georgia .
but whatever the populations of the caucasus think , with the fate of both provinces of intimate interest to moscow and beyond , the situation is likely to remain - for now - in legal limbo . dpa news agency -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

experts say this sparked a chain reaction in the region , which only moscow can now halt . when the west recognized kosovo 's independence half a year ago , russia 's leaders warned that the move would open a " pandora 's box " in the caucasus .
the mountainous region 's patchwork of ethnicities and states have long been difficult to reconcile into coherent nation states .
the recent , bloody 10-day war between russia and georgia over the former soviet states ' rebel region of south ossetia is the realization of that pandora 's box scenario .
the background russia has long supported georgia 's two ethnically separatist provinces of abkhazia and south ossetia , but stopped short of recognizing their independence - until now - fearing that secessions in those provinces would provide a dangerous precedent for other minority nations within the russian federation .
nevertheless , russian lawmakers this week unanimously passed a motion urging president dmitry medvedev to recognize georgia 's rebel regions as independent - 15 years after they won de facto autonomy in a war of succession from tbilisi in the early 1990s .
by some counts , over 80 percent of the populations in the regions have been issued russian passports under an especially generous russian policy that saakashvili decried as the creeping annexation of georgian territory .
the kosovo precedent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's independence set a dangerous precedence as russian tanks rolled into south ossetia on aug .
8 to push back georgia 's offensive to re-assert control , medvedev took the national stage , invoking the army in defense of russian citizens .
in a series of interviews by dpa news agency after kosovo 's independence in february , russian analysts foresaw a military flare up , but did not predict the possibility that moscow 's policy could turn to recognizing the regions .
the threat that kosovo could stand as a secessionist precedent in the caucasus had formed the kremlin 's most vivid protest to the province 's break from its ally serbia .
but while moscow is still confronted by the problems that the kosovo precedent raises , paradoxically , the comparison has now been turned into a justification of south ossetia and abkhazia 's right to self-determination .
western leaders have labeled russia 's move to recognize georgia 's regions as hypocrisy , while russian leaders hit back with the accusation that a double standard has been applied in the case of kosovo .
the resolution passed on monday argued that by its assault on civilians tbilisi had forgone all moral right over the area , drawing a direct link between russia incursion and the justification of nato 's bombing campaign in serbia in 1998 .
appealing before russian lawmakers south ossetia 's president eduard kokoity repeated what has become a maxim : " we have more political-legal grounds than kosovo does to have our independence recognized . "
but professor yury kolosov of the moscow institute of international relations threw cold water on the much-cited " kosovo precedent . "
" there is no such thing as a ' precedent ' in international law ... and , if this is a precedent , then it 's a bad one , " kolosov , an eminent member of russia 's association of international law , told dpa .
the final say in other words , the kremlin has the last word .
while the threat of recognizing the breakaway region adds to its bargaining power with the west , analysts said it would look for ways to delay such recognition , for example , by requesting the provinces hold a new referendum .
" it seems to me that now politically it would be more favorable to leave this situation hanging , " moscow-based analyst vyacheslav nikonov , head of the politika foundation , told news agency interfax on monday .
the kremlin and its allies , meanwhile , are n't deaf to its own warnings that seizing on kosovo as a precedent could spark a " chain reaction " in the region .
legal limbo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev - the ball is in his court medvedev sought to reassure the molodovan and azeri presidents - who have similar secession worries to georgia - on monday over the respective breakaway regions of nagorno karabakh and transnistria .
south ossetia 's ultimate ambition to unite with russia 's ethnically-similar region of north ossetia is no less problematic .
russia 's ties to abkhazia , which seeks only self-determination , have traditionally been stronger , as has its economic interest in the region .
a poll by the independent levada center in the aftermath of the conflict show near half of russians - or 46 percent - say south ossetia should become part of russia .
only 4 percent of those surveyed in interviews with 2,100 adults believed the province should remain part of georgia .
but whatever the populations of the caucasus think , with the fate of both provinces of intimate interest to moscow and beyond , the situation is likely to remain - for now - in legal limbo . dpa news agency -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" in the current crisis it became necessary to make a decision , " medvedev said in a nationally televised statement tuesday , aug .
26 .
" taking into consideration the will of the people and guided by the un charter of 1970 ... and other basic international law , i have signed a decree recognizing abkhazia and south ossetia . " it is not an easy choice , but it is the only way to protect the lives of civilians , " the president said after meeting with russia 's security chiefs . medvedev signed a second decree tuesday instructing the russian foreign ministry to establish diplomatic relations with abkhazia and south ossetia and sign partnership agreements with them . ties ice over bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : resident of gori , south ossetia , received aid after their city was devastated the move is likely to deepen the wedge in russia 's relations with the west , which views south ossetia and abkhazia as part of georgia .
russian stocks fell tuesday , with traders anticipating an increase in international tension . the world now faces new rifts , former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev was quoted as saying by itar-tass news agency tuesday . " the risk of a new schism has arisen .
there is a growing threat of global chaos , " gorbachev was quoted as saying in reaction to the crisis . german chancellor angela merkel sharply criticized the decision tuesday .
speaking on a visit to the estonian capital of tallinn , merkel said medvedev 's decision was " absolutely not acceptable " and ran " contrary to international law . " " we must by consequence react united as the european union , " merkel said . she also stressed support for stronger relations between the eu and georgia , including making it easier for georgians to obtain visas to the bloc . " georgia and ukraine will be members of nato , " the chancellor said .
russia has sharply opposed nato 's eastward expansion , and both countries ' bids were turned down by alliance leaders earlier this year .
the matter is to be reconsidered at a summit in december . merkel said , however , that dialogue between nato and russia should continue . nato secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer also rejected medvedev 's decision to recognize the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia .
he questioned whether russia was truly interested in peace and security in the caucasus region , according to a statement . " this is in direct violation of numerous un security council resolutions regarding georgia 's territorial integrity , resolutions that russia itself has endorsed , " de hoop scheffer said in a statement read out by his spokeswoman . on the eve of something bigger france , which brokered the cease-fire agreement between russia and georgia , also criticized the kremlin 's decision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the georgian offensive was compared to the murder that set off world war i " we consider this a regrettable decision and i recall our attachment to the territorial integrity of georgia , " said a spokesman for the french foreign ministry . just prior to medvedev 's announcement , the european union had expressed its opposition to recognizing the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia . russia 's nato envoy , dmitry rogozin , compared the current situation to europe in 1914 on the eve of world war i , " when , because of one terrorist , leading world powers clashed , " he told the rbk daily business newspaper .
war broke out after austro-hungarian archduke franz ferdinand was assassinated in august 1914 . but russian foreign minister sergey lavrov said russia is unlikely to be subjected to international isolation . " i do n't think we should really be afraid of isolation , " he told reporters in english .
" i do n't believe this should really be a doomsday scenario .
i believe common sense should prevail . " accusations of genocide in his statement issued tuesday , medvedev condemned georgia 's offensive to reclaim south ossetia earlier this month . " on the night of august 8th , tbilisi had a choice : -lrb- georgian president -rrb- saakashvili opted for genocide , " said the russian president .
" with this choice saakashvili wiped out all hope of a peaceful coexistence of south ossetia and abkhazia under one government . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west has largely opposed recognizing the provinces russia and georgia fought a brief but bloody war over south ossetia with russia 's army moving deep into georgia after repelling the georgian offensive . on tuesday the kremlin convened the security council at the president 's black sea residence in sochi to review a plea by russia 's parliament for recognition of the two georgian breakaway regions .
russia 's powerful prime minister vladimir putin was also in attendance . the united states , a staunch ally of georgia , rebuked russia 's parliament over the resolution monday , saying it was " deeply concerned . " the european union , which has been critical of russia 's military involvement in georgia , has called for a special summit on sept .

experts say this sparked a chain reaction in the region , which only moscow can now halt . when the west recognized kosovo 's independence half a year ago , russia 's leaders warned that the move would open a " pandora 's box " in the caucasus .
the mountainous region 's patchwork of ethnicities and states have long been difficult to reconcile into coherent nation states .
the recent , bloody 10-day war between russia and georgia over the former soviet states ' rebel region of south ossetia is the realization of that pandora 's box scenario .
the background russia has long supported georgia 's two ethnically separatist provinces of abkhazia and south ossetia , but stopped short of recognizing their independence - until now - fearing that secessions in those provinces would provide a dangerous precedent for other minority nations within the russian federation .
nevertheless , russian lawmakers this week unanimously passed a motion urging president dmitry medvedev to recognize georgia 's rebel regions as independent - 15 years after they won de facto autonomy in a war of succession from tbilisi in the early 1990s .
by some counts , over 80 percent of the populations in the regions have been issued russian passports under an especially generous russian policy that saakashvili decried as the creeping annexation of georgian territory .
the kosovo precedent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's independence set a dangerous precedence as russian tanks rolled into south ossetia on aug .
8 to push back georgia 's offensive to re-assert control , medvedev took the national stage , invoking the army in defense of russian citizens .
in a series of interviews by dpa news agency after kosovo 's independence in february , russian analysts foresaw a military flare up , but did not predict the possibility that moscow 's policy could turn to recognizing the regions .
the threat that kosovo could stand as a secessionist precedent in the caucasus had formed the kremlin 's most vivid protest to the province 's break from its ally serbia .
but while moscow is still confronted by the problems that the kosovo precedent raises , paradoxically , the comparison has now been turned into a justification of south ossetia and abkhazia 's right to self-determination .
western leaders have labeled russia 's move to recognize georgia 's regions as hypocrisy , while russian leaders hit back with the accusation that a double standard has been applied in the case of kosovo .
the resolution passed on monday argued that by its assault on civilians tbilisi had forgone all moral right over the area , drawing a direct link between russia incursion and the justification of nato 's bombing campaign in serbia in 1998 .

experts say this sparked a chain reaction in the region , which only moscow can now halt . when the west recognized kosovo 's independence half a year ago , russia 's leaders warned that the move would open a " pandora 's box " in the caucasus .
the mountainous region 's patchwork of ethnicities and states have long been difficult to reconcile into coherent nation states .
the recent , bloody 10-day war between russia and georgia over the former soviet states ' rebel region of south ossetia is the realization of that pandora 's box scenario .
the background russia has long supported georgia 's two ethnically separatist provinces of abkhazia and south ossetia , but stopped short of recognizing their independence - until now - fearing that secessions in those provinces would provide a dangerous precedent for other minority nations within the russian federation .
nevertheless , russian lawmakers this week unanimously passed a motion urging president dmitry medvedev to recognize georgia 's rebel regions as independent - 15 years after they won de facto autonomy in a war of succession from tbilisi in the early 1990s .
by some counts , over 80 percent of the populations in the regions have been issued russian passports under an especially generous russian policy that saakashvili decried as the creeping annexation of georgian territory .
the kosovo precedent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's independence set a dangerous precedence as russian tanks rolled into south ossetia on aug .
8 to push back georgia 's offensive to re-assert control , medvedev took the national stage , invoking the army in defense of russian citizens .
in a series of interviews by dpa news agency after kosovo 's independence in february , russian analysts foresaw a military flare up , but did not predict the possibility that moscow 's policy could turn to recognizing the regions .
the threat that kosovo could stand as a secessionist precedent in the caucasus had formed the kremlin 's most vivid protest to the province 's break from its ally serbia .
but while moscow is still confronted by the problems that the kosovo precedent raises , paradoxically , the comparison has now been turned into a justification of south ossetia and abkhazia 's right to self-determination .
western leaders have labeled russia 's move to recognize georgia 's regions as hypocrisy , while russian leaders hit back with the accusation that a double standard has been applied in the case of kosovo .
the resolution passed on monday argued that by its assault on civilians tbilisi had forgone all moral right over the area , drawing a direct link between russia incursion and the justification of nato 's bombing campaign in serbia in 1998 .
appealing before russian lawmakers south ossetia 's president eduard kokoity repeated what has become a maxim : " we have more political-legal grounds than kosovo does to have our independence recognized . "

"
the play on words reflects the turbulent history of the ninth symphony : its repeated exploitation by powerful figures , as well as its withstanding power to move people .
deutsche welle : ms schmiel , how did you choose the motto " macht.musik " ?
ilona schmiel : the ninth symphony was of course the impetus to ask how this work can be used to represent a whole program .
and that was the reason to hold the festival under the motto " macht.musik " and to follow the path of the ninth symphony from its premiere in 1824 to today .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ilona schmiel has directed the beethovenfest since 2004 beethoven 's political commitment , this utopia - the " ode to joy " by friedrich schiller , which he set to music , is a utopia - has n't lost any of its relevance .
we are still living in an age of war , suppression , hunger and many other injustices .
back in his time - the work was completed in 1824 - beethoven probably thought things would improve .
and that alone is a reason the ninth symphony can be made a focal point .
the question of how the reception of this piece continues in 2008 has always moved me because , as far as i know , there is no other work in the world that is played so often and deliberately chosen for so many different occasions .
the piece has not only been a part of triumphs , but also of many mistakes that have been made by governments , rulers and leaders , where the symphony was totally appropriated by politics and exploited for political purposes and dictatorial statements .
relatively speaking , beethoven had a lot of contact with the powerful figures of his time , and if you look back on his work - for example the " eroica , " " wellington 's victory " or " egmont " - he often expressed himself politically through his music .
but he did so quite differently in each case .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt masur will conduct the ninth at this year 's festival the issue of how he surrounded himself with powerful figures , but at the same time also left them hanging , was a central theme in his life , i think .
and it begs the question of where beethoven 's development through the symphonies leads - past a rejection of the powers that be , to a civil society .
on the one hand it is really a path beyond the worship of powerful figures - such as napoleon - but , on the other hand , he is using the civil society , which finances the music and supports the composer .
that 's is why i think this music is still so relevant and moving today .
questions about how to deal with works of music today , how music is used , what demands are placed on it , how much it needs to align with the state to be performed on certain occasions , and how music is twisted or the text is rewritten , for example , so that it fits a particular regime - the ninth symphony has already been through all of that .
who else then has used beethoven 's music to serve their own ends ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ninth symphony has echoed both east and west goebbels always had the ninth symphony played for hitler 's birthday .
the gdr -lrb- communist east germany -rrb- chose it as their national anthem , albeit with a different text .
it has been played constantly both in the east and the west .
it has become the european anthem , and since the olympic games it has also been mentioned that mao used the symphony to motivate workers in the fields .
kamikaze pilots listened to this music - i 'm jumping through time a bit - and it was also the national anthem of rhodesia .
i think no other work has ever been so globalized .
nevertheless this human message , this commitment to human kindness has survived - and you could almost say this message is indestructible .
how would you judge beethoven 's music today ?
what is the situation with " power " and " music " ?
for me personally , the power of music is at the forefront because i 'd like to keep believing in the utopia that music can change a lot .
in 2006 , we had a guest youth orchestra from south africa , where musicians with different backgrounds performed together , for example .
music can also be a social instrument .
and this power ca n't be burned onto a cd .
the reproduction of music in a concert is something exclusive .
there you can really feel the power of music - and i do n't think you can get away from it . interview : klaus gehrke -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 26.08.2008 danish rockstar uses nazi slogan to protest smoking ban großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking bans are the creations of " health fascists , " larson has said a pro-smoking campaign launched in denmark by one of the country 's best-known rockstars features a notorious nazi slogan .
the country 's modest jewish community is refusing to take offense . as frontman of gasolin ' , a seminal rock band which enjoyed its heyday in the 1970s , kim larsen has always been one of the bad boys of danish rock .
and like any self-respecting hellraiser , he 's vociferously anti-establishment . in the best rock ' n ' roll tradition , he 's also a die-hard smoker .
so it comes as no surprise that he does n't like the eu 's anti-smoking laws introduced in denmark one year ago , which ban smoking in public bars and restaurants . health fascists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who reads billboards anyway ?
not the type who likes being told what to do , larsen recently helped fund an advertising campaign revolving around the slogan " tillykke med rygeforbudet - gesundheit macht frei ! ! ! " the first claim means " good luck with the smoking ban " in danish , while the german slogan " health sets you free " is an obvious allusion to the nazi slogan " arbeit macht frei , " or " work sets you free , " which was placed at the entrances to a number of nazi concentration camps , such as auschwitz and dachau . " the people who introduced the smoking ban are health fascists , " larsen has been quoted as saying . he said the reference to the third reich is a valid one , because the nazis introduced a nationwide tobacco ban as part of their quest for bodily and racial purity . " hitler was the first to ban smoking , " said the one-time eurovision song contest hopeful . cause celebre bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kim larsen : too stupid to be taken seriously ?
larsen allegedly is n't the only celebrity to have donated to the " himmelbla " fund behind the campaign , whose ads are now splurged across copenhagen 's billboards . " this is not about a defense of smoking , " larsen has said .
" this is about a defense of democracy and freedom . " the country 's jewish community , for its part , is choosing to see the campaign in this context - merely a clumsy protest against government interference with individual freedoms .

" i do n't connect it with any kind of anti-semitism - it 's just plain stupidity .

in germany - where nazi allusions are not shrugged off as lightly as they are in denmark - one protester launched a line of t-shirts earlier this year bearing a yellow star of david along with the word " smoker .

the first german in outer space came from a small town in saxony .
today , it 's one of the few places that still remember the communist cosmonaut . on aug .
26 , 1978 , communist east germany launched the soyuz 31 to the soviet space station salyut 6 .
on board was 41-year-old sigmund jaehn , who went down in history as " the first german cosmonaut . " jaehn 's career began in 1955 when he joined the gdr air force and became a pilot and military scientist .
between 1966 and 1970 he studied at the gagarin military air academy in monino , in the soviet union , and afterwards worked in the gdr air force administration , responsible for pilot education and flight safety . forgotten hero bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pride of east germany the 1978 flight marked a political milestone , with communist leaders pointing to its success as evidence of the eastern bloc 's technological superiority .
in september the same year , they showed their appreciation by awarding sigmund jaehn the title hero of the soviet union . but once the cold war was over , jaehn 's achievements paled somewhat .
these days , the name rings only a faint bell to most germans .
despite the huge propaganda surrounding his seven-day space mission , jaehn soon became just a footnote in history . local pride it 's a different story in his hometown of morgenroethe-rautenkranz , close to the czech border .
few locals will ever forget the town 's famous son . it is even home to a permanent exhibition of german astronautics , with one room dedicated to jaehn 's achievements . " it means a lot to all of us , " said karin schaedlich from the exhibition .
" i was 17 years old when sigmund jaehn went into space .
and when he came back i was out on the street to see him and welcome him back together with his commander valery bykovsky .
it was a great event here in rautenkranz .
even after 30 years it 's still very important for his home village . " schaedlich 's coworker romy mothes said she is keen to help young people in the region keep the jaehn legacy alive . " i think our younger generation knows who sigmund jaehn is , " she said .
" they learn about him in school .
and we have a lot of children in our exhibition and all of them know him . " putting politics in perspective bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaehn today is a frequent visitor to morgenroethe-rautenkranz the man himself drops by now and then .
at the time , he probably enjoyed the political fuss less than anyone .
although he toed the party line , his job gave him a unique perspective that helped him keep his eye on the broader picture . " in the spacecraft we travel at 8 kilometers per second , and it takes less than a minute to pass our small country , " the communist hero once said . hardy graupner -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 26.08.2008 danish rockstar uses nazi slogan to protest smoking ban großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking bans are the creations of " health fascists , " larson has said a pro-smoking campaign launched in denmark by one of the country 's best-known rockstars features a notorious nazi slogan .
the country 's modest jewish community is refusing to take offense . as frontman of gasolin ' , a seminal rock band which enjoyed its heyday in the 1970s , kim larsen has always been one of the bad boys of danish rock .
and like any self-respecting hellraiser , he 's vociferously anti-establishment . in the best rock ' n ' roll tradition , he 's also a die-hard smoker .
so it comes as no surprise that he does n't like the eu 's anti-smoking laws introduced in denmark one year ago , which ban smoking in public bars and restaurants . health fascists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who reads billboards anyway ?
not the type who likes being told what to do , larsen recently helped fund an advertising campaign revolving around the slogan " tillykke med rygeforbudet - gesundheit macht frei ! ! ! " the first claim means " good luck with the smoking ban " in danish , while the german slogan " health sets you free " is an obvious allusion to the nazi slogan " arbeit macht frei , " or " work sets you free , " which was placed at the entrances to a number of nazi concentration camps , such as auschwitz and dachau . " the people who introduced the smoking ban are health fascists , " larsen has been quoted as saying . he said the reference to the third reich is a valid one , because the nazis introduced a nationwide tobacco ban as part of their quest for bodily and racial purity . " hitler was the first to ban smoking , " said the one-time eurovision song contest hopeful . cause celebre bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kim larsen : too stupid to be taken seriously ?
larsen allegedly is n't the only celebrity to have donated to the " himmelbla " fund behind the campaign , whose ads are now splurged across copenhagen 's billboards . " this is not about a defense of smoking , " larsen has said .
" this is about a defense of democracy and freedom . " the country 's jewish community , for its part , is choosing to see the campaign in this context - merely a clumsy protest against government interference with individual freedoms . " it 's stupid , plain stupid , " stefan isaak , president of the danish jewish community , told dw-world.de.
" i do n't connect it with any kind of anti-semitism - it 's just plain stupidity . " explaining why larsen 's posters have gone largely ignored , he pointed out that denmark has few holocaust survivors , because most of the country 's jews left for sweden during world war ii .

" in the current crisis it became necessary to make a decision , " medvedev said in a nationally televised statement tuesday , aug .
26 .
" taking into consideration the will of the people and guided by the un charter of 1970 ... and other basic international law , i have signed a decree recognizing abkhazia and south ossetia . " it is not an easy choice , but it is the only way to protect the lives of civilians , " the president said after meeting with russia 's security chiefs . medvedev signed a second decree tuesday instructing the russian foreign ministry to establish diplomatic relations with abkhazia and south ossetia and sign partnership agreements with them . ties ice over bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : resident of gori , south ossetia , received aid after their city was devastated the move is likely to deepen the wedge in russia 's relations with the west , which views south ossetia and abkhazia as part of georgia .
russian stocks fell tuesday , with traders anticipating an increase in international tension . the world now faces new rifts , former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev was quoted as saying by itar-tass news agency tuesday . " the risk of a new schism has arisen .
there is a growing threat of global chaos , " gorbachev was quoted as saying in reaction to the crisis . german chancellor angela merkel sharply criticized the decision tuesday .
speaking on a visit to the estonian capital of tallinn , merkel said medvedev 's decision was " absolutely not acceptable " and ran " contrary to international law . " " we must by consequence react united as the european union , " merkel said . she also stressed support for stronger relations between the eu and georgia , including making it easier for georgians to obtain visas to the bloc . " georgia and ukraine will be members of nato , " the chancellor said .
russia has sharply opposed nato 's eastward expansion , and both countries ' bids were turned down by alliance leaders earlier this year .
the matter is to be reconsidered at a summit in december . merkel said , however , that dialogue between nato and russia should continue . nato secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer also rejected medvedev 's decision to recognize the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia .
he questioned whether russia was truly interested in peace and security in the caucasus region , according to a statement . " this is in direct violation of numerous un security council resolutions regarding georgia 's territorial integrity , resolutions that russia itself has endorsed , " de hoop scheffer said in a statement read out by his spokeswoman . on the eve of something bigger france , which brokered the cease-fire agreement between russia and georgia , also criticized the kremlin 's decision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the georgian offensive was compared to the murder that set off world war i " we consider this a regrettable decision and i recall our attachment to the territorial integrity of georgia , " said a spokesman for the french foreign ministry . just prior to medvedev 's announcement , the european union had expressed its opposition to recognizing the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia . russia 's nato envoy , dmitry rogozin , compared the current situation to europe in 1914 on the eve of world war i , " when , because of one terrorist , leading world powers clashed , " he told the rbk daily business newspaper .
war broke out after austro-hungarian archduke franz ferdinand was assassinated in august 1914 . but russian foreign minister sergey lavrov said russia is unlikely to be subjected to international isolation . " i do n't think we should really be afraid of isolation , " he told reporters in english .
" i do n't believe this should really be a doomsday scenario .
i believe common sense should prevail . " accusations of genocide in his statement issued tuesday , medvedev condemned georgia 's offensive to reclaim south ossetia earlier this month . " on the night of august 8th , tbilisi had a choice : -lrb- georgian president -rrb- saakashvili opted for genocide , " said the russian president .
" with this choice saakashvili wiped out all hope of a peaceful coexistence of south ossetia and abkhazia under one government . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west has largely opposed recognizing the provinces russia and georgia fought a brief but bloody war over south ossetia with russia 's army moving deep into georgia after repelling the georgian offensive . on tuesday the kremlin convened the security council at the president 's black sea residence in sochi to review a plea by russia 's parliament for recognition of the two georgian breakaway regions .
russia 's powerful prime minister vladimir putin was also in attendance . the united states , a staunch ally of georgia , rebuked russia 's parliament over the resolution monday , saying it was " deeply concerned .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de georgia -pipe- 26.08.2008 analysis : opening a pandora 's box in the caucasus großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the region has been thrown into disarray the caucasus conflict was brought about at least in part by the west 's decision to recognize kosovo 's independence 6 months ago .
experts say this sparked a chain reaction in the region , which only moscow can now halt . when the west recognized kosovo 's independence half a year ago , russia 's leaders warned that the move would open a " pandora 's box " in the caucasus .
the mountainous region 's patchwork of ethnicities and states have long been difficult to reconcile into coherent nation states .
the recent , bloody 10-day war between russia and georgia over the former soviet states ' rebel region of south ossetia is the realization of that pandora 's box scenario .
the background russia has long supported georgia 's two ethnically separatist provinces of abkhazia and south ossetia , but stopped short of recognizing their independence - until now - fearing that secessions in those provinces would provide a dangerous precedent for other minority nations within the russian federation .
nevertheless , russian lawmakers this week unanimously passed a motion urging president dmitry medvedev to recognize georgia 's rebel regions as independent - 15 years after they won de facto autonomy in a war of succession from tbilisi in the early 1990s .
by some counts , over 80 percent of the populations in the regions have been issued russian passports under an especially generous russian policy that saakashvili decried as the creeping annexation of georgian territory .
the kosovo precedent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's independence set a dangerous precedence as russian tanks rolled into south ossetia on aug .
8 to push back georgia 's offensive to re-assert control , medvedev took the national stage , invoking the army in defense of russian citizens .
in a series of interviews by dpa news agency after kosovo 's independence in february , russian analysts foresaw a military flare up , but did not predict the possibility that moscow 's policy could turn to recognizing the regions .
the threat that kosovo could stand as a secessionist precedent in the caucasus had formed the kremlin 's most vivid protest to the province 's break from its ally serbia .
but while moscow is still confronted by the problems that the kosovo precedent raises , paradoxically , the comparison has now been turned into a justification of south ossetia and abkhazia 's right to self-determination .
western leaders have labeled russia 's move to recognize georgia 's regions as hypocrisy , while russian leaders hit back with the accusation that a double standard has been applied in the case of kosovo .
the resolution passed on monday argued that by its assault on civilians tbilisi had forgone all moral right over the area , drawing a direct link between russia incursion and the justification of nato 's bombing campaign in serbia in 1998 .
appealing before russian lawmakers south ossetia 's president eduard kokoity repeated what has become a maxim : " we have more political-legal grounds than kosovo does to have our independence recognized . "
but professor yury kolosov of the moscow institute of international relations threw cold water on the much-cited " kosovo precedent . "
" there is no such thing as a ' precedent ' in international law ... and , if this is a precedent , then it 's a bad one , " kolosov , an eminent member of russia 's association of international law , told dpa .
the final say in other words , the kremlin has the last word .
while the threat of recognizing the breakaway region adds to its bargaining power with the west , analysts said it would look for ways to delay such recognition , for example , by requesting the provinces hold a new referendum .
" it seems to me that now politically it would be more favorable to leave this situation hanging , " moscow-based analyst vyacheslav nikonov , head of the politika foundation , told news agency interfax on monday .
the kremlin and its allies , meanwhile , are n't deaf to its own warnings that seizing on kosovo as a precedent could spark a " chain reaction " in the region .
legal limbo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev - the ball is in his court medvedev sought to reassure the molodovan and azeri presidents - who have similar secession worries to georgia - on monday over the respective breakaway regions of nagorno karabakh and transnistria .
south ossetia 's ultimate ambition to unite with russia 's ethnically-similar region of north ossetia is no less problematic .
russia 's ties to abkhazia , which seeks only self-determination , have traditionally been stronger , as has its economic interest in the region .
a poll by the independent levada center in the aftermath of the conflict show near half of russians - or 46 percent - say south ossetia should become part of russia .
only 4 percent of those surveyed in interviews with 2,100 adults believed the province should remain part of georgia .

employees , the nobility , his publishers - they all got it dished to them .
one of his biographers called ludwig van beethoven the " bawdy genius . "
brain proprietor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there is only one beethoven " most of what we know about beethoven comes from his correspondence and his diary .
much unlike his contemporary goethe , who he did not get along very well with , beethoven was a stranger to self-stylization .
in his letters he writes about the malevolence of people and about the class restrictions which refused him contact with the women he worshipped .
he did not conduct himself as an outstanding nobleman ; he even treated friends to coarse language .
when his brother once acquired some land and signed himself as " van beethoven , land proprietor , " ludwig replied with " van beethoven , brain proprietor . "
to prince lichnowsky , one of his appreciators and patrons , he wrote : " prince , what you are , you are through chance and birth ; what i am , i am through my own labor .

but even earlier , in the time of the weimar republic before the second world war , beethoven was politically exploited .
the right emphasized his supposed hostility towards the french and saw in him a " titanic fighting spirit . "

beethoven was known for being business minded .
nevertheless he lived in a rundown house near vienna and hardly cared about his appearance .
to his contemporaries beethoven must have seemed completely unconventional .
beethoven remained a bachelor , he lived for music - in the morning he composed , in the afternoon he went for a walk , at lunchtime he ate heartily .
in many people 's eyes he defined the image of a brilliant but difficult artist - reinforced by the many hundreds of paintings and busts of a beethoven with wildly unkempt hair and a serious piercing glare .

1 , sarkozy wants to say clearly to moscow that the european union is " a force which has to dealt with , " and that agreements made with him by russian president dmitry medvedev must be honored , a french diplomat told the afp news agency on monday , aug .
25 . the six-point peace plan brokered by sarkozy , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , has been criticized in some european capitals as being too vague , too moscow-friendly and organized with too little consultation . after russia failed to withdraw all its troops from georgia , a key point of the cease-fire , the french president " realized that the russians were exploiting the ambiguous margins of the text and that there was a risk of a loss of credibility for the eu and the french presidency , " european policy center analyst antonio missiroli told afp . but it wo n't be easy , at the hastily-arranged summit which sarkozy announced sunday , to obtain european consensus on the future of relations with russia , he added . polish objections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk has led europe 's pro-georgian camp poland , as well as other eastern european nations that fell under the former soviet union 's direct sphere of influence , wants to convince the 27-member eu not to cut moscow any special deals after its military intervention in georgia this month . " i spoke with -lrb- germany 's -rrb- chancellor merkel this morning to make the european position uniform , harder and categorical concerning russia in the context of the crisis in the caucasus , " premier donald tusk told reporters . the differences among eu nations on how to handle russia were already highlighted earlier this month .
pro-georgia leaders of poland , estonia , lithuania and latvia traveled to tbilisi with the message that the french-brokered peace plan did not provide sufficient protection for georgia . meanwhile , france , germany , italy and spain lead the faction of eu member who do not want to see relations with moscow completely frozen due to russia 's importance as a trading partner and its international role as a veto-power at the united nations security council . chance for change ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is a key energy supplier to the european union but tusk said he would not rule out the possibility of some nations that want to keep communication with russia open could be convinced to change their tact at the summit . " i spoke with president sarkozy a few days ago and he did not hide that russia 's behavior is beginning to be irritating to a certain degree and will require the eu to make firm decisions , " tusk said . it was only last month that talks on a new strategic accord between russia and the eu got properly under way after being long-blocked by polish and lithuanian objections .
that , analysts say , is why there is a lot at stake as far as europe-russia relations are concerned . " i do n't see the possibility of introducing sanctions against russia if the situation remains the way it is today , " said cristina gallach , spokeswoman for eu foreign policy chief javier solana . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the first german in outer space came from a small town in saxony .
today , it 's one of the few places that still remember the communist cosmonaut . on aug .
26 , 1978 , communist east germany launched the soyuz 31 to the soviet space station salyut 6 .
on board was 41-year-old sigmund jaehn , who went down in history as " the first german cosmonaut . " jaehn 's career began in 1955 when he joined the gdr air force and became a pilot and military scientist .
between 1966 and 1970 he studied at the gagarin military air academy in monino , in the soviet union , and afterwards worked in the gdr air force administration , responsible for pilot education and flight safety . forgotten hero bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pride of east germany the 1978 flight marked a political milestone , with communist leaders pointing to its success as evidence of the eastern bloc 's technological superiority .
in september the same year , they showed their appreciation by awarding sigmund jaehn the title hero of the soviet union . but once the cold war was over , jaehn 's achievements paled somewhat .
these days , the name rings only a faint bell to most germans .
despite the huge propaganda surrounding his seven-day space mission , jaehn soon became just a footnote in history . local pride it 's a different story in his hometown of morgenroethe-rautenkranz , close to the czech border .
few locals will ever forget the town 's famous son . it is even home to a permanent exhibition of german astronautics , with one room dedicated to jaehn 's achievements . " it means a lot to all of us , " said karin schaedlich from the exhibition .
" i was 17 years old when sigmund jaehn went into space .
and when he came back i was out on the street to see him and welcome him back together with his commander valery bykovsky .
it was a great event here in rautenkranz .
even after 30 years it 's still very important for his home village . " schaedlich 's coworker romy mothes said she is keen to help young people in the region keep the jaehn legacy alive . " i think our younger generation knows who sigmund jaehn is , " she said .
" they learn about him in school .
and we have a lot of children in our exhibition and all of them know him . " putting politics in perspective bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaehn today is a frequent visitor to morgenroethe-rautenkranz the man himself drops by now and then .
at the time , he probably enjoyed the political fuss less than anyone .
although he toed the party line , his job gave him a unique perspective that helped him keep his eye on the broader picture . " in the spacecraft we travel at 8 kilometers per second , and it takes less than a minute to pass our small country , " the communist hero once said . hardy graupner -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 26.08.2008 danish rockstar uses nazi slogan to protest smoking ban großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking bans are the creations of " health fascists , " larson has said a pro-smoking campaign launched in denmark by one of the country 's best-known rockstars features a notorious nazi slogan .
the country 's modest jewish community is refusing to take offense . as frontman of gasolin ' , a seminal rock band which enjoyed its heyday in the 1970s , kim larsen has always been one of the bad boys of danish rock .
and like any self-respecting hellraiser , he 's vociferously anti-establishment . in the best rock ' n ' roll tradition , he 's also a die-hard smoker .
so it comes as no surprise that he does n't like the eu 's anti-smoking laws introduced in denmark one year ago , which ban smoking in public bars and restaurants . health fascists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who reads billboards anyway ?
not the type who likes being told what to do , larsen recently helped fund an advertising campaign revolving around the slogan " tillykke med rygeforbudet - gesundheit macht frei ! ! ! " the first claim means " good luck with the smoking ban " in danish , while the german slogan " health sets you free " is an obvious allusion to the nazi slogan " arbeit macht frei , " or " work sets you free , " which was placed at the entrances to a number of nazi concentration camps , such as auschwitz and dachau . " the people who introduced the smoking ban are health fascists , " larsen has been quoted as saying . he said the reference to the third reich is a valid one , because the nazis introduced a nationwide tobacco ban as part of their quest for bodily and racial purity . " hitler was the first to ban smoking , " said the one-time eurovision song contest hopeful . cause celebre bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kim larsen : too stupid to be taken seriously ?
larsen allegedly is n't the only celebrity to have donated to the " himmelbla " fund behind the campaign , whose ads are now splurged across copenhagen 's billboards . " this is not about a defense of smoking , " larsen has said .
" this is about a defense of democracy and freedom . " the country 's jewish community , for its part , is choosing to see the campaign in this context - merely a clumsy protest against government interference with individual freedoms . " it 's stupid , plain stupid , " stefan isaak , president of the danish jewish community , told dw-world.de.
" i do n't connect it with any kind of anti-semitism - it 's just plain stupidity . " explaining why larsen 's posters have gone largely ignored , he pointed out that denmark has few holocaust survivors , because most of the country 's jews left for sweden during world war ii . " feelings might be hurt , " he said .
" but the whole slogan is so idiotic ; you ca n't begin to connect it to auschwitz . " bad taste bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smokers : social pariahs arne rolighed of denmark 's leading cancer research charity is taking more offense . " it 's extremely tasteless , " he was quoted as saying in danish daily politiken . it 's not the first time this kind of parallel has been drawn .
in germany - where nazi allusions are not shrugged off as lightly as they are in denmark - one protester launched a line of t-shirts earlier this year bearing a yellow star of david along with the word " smoker . " the shirt was quickly withdrawn from the market after jewish groups objected to comparing the perceived persecution of smokers to that of the jews under the nazis . isaak is more circumspect . " the less said about -lsb- larsen 's campaign -rsb- , the better , " he said . jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

26 . the nuremberg-based gfk group said in the report that its forward-looking german consumer confidence index fell from 2.1 points in august to 1.9 in september as surging inflation and on-going economic uncertainty dampened the mood in the nation 's households . based on a survey of 7,000 german executives , the july ifo report could set the stage for the release this week of a batch of major economic sentiment surveys highlighting the brittle economic mood taking shape across europe . falling euro , oil prices boost economy however , like the ifo index , which is drawn up by the munich-based ifo economic institute , the surveys are gained support from the fall in both the euro and oil prices following record highs . already the drop in the euro and energy prices has helped to ease some of the pressures facing europe 's biggest economy , with german investor confidence posting a surprise rebound in august , a key indicator released this month showed . drawn up by the mannheim-based center for european economic research , the zew index rose 8.4 points to minus 55.5 points this month despite signs of slackening global growth and volatile financial markets . analysts had predicted that the index , which measures expectations six months down the track , would fall to minus 62 points in august . state budget in the black also on tuesday , the federal statistical office reported a budget surplus of 6.7 billion euros for the first half of this year , up from 4.2 billion euros last year .

warsaw , in particular , wants the eu to take a hard line in eu-russia relations . by announcing the eu summit in brussels next monday , sept .
1 , sarkozy wants to say clearly to moscow that the european union is " a force which has to dealt with , " and that agreements made with him by russian president dmitry medvedev must be honored , a french diplomat told the afp news agency on monday , aug .
25 . the six-point peace plan brokered by sarkozy , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , has been criticized in some european capitals as being too vague , too moscow-friendly and organized with too little consultation . after russia failed to withdraw all its troops from georgia , a key point of the cease-fire , the french president " realized that the russians were exploiting the ambiguous margins of the text and that there was a risk of a loss of credibility for the eu and the french presidency , " european policy center analyst antonio missiroli told afp . but it wo n't be easy , at the hastily-arranged summit which sarkozy announced sunday , to obtain european consensus on the future of relations with russia , he added . polish objections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk has led europe 's pro-georgian camp poland , as well as other eastern european nations that fell under the former soviet union 's direct sphere of influence , wants to convince the 27-member eu not to cut moscow any special deals after its military intervention in georgia this month . " i spoke with -lrb- germany 's -rrb- chancellor merkel this morning to make the european position uniform , harder and categorical concerning russia in the context of the crisis in the caucasus , " premier donald tusk told reporters . the differences among eu nations on how to handle russia were already highlighted earlier this month .
pro-georgia leaders of poland , estonia , lithuania and latvia traveled to tbilisi with the message that the french-brokered peace plan did not provide sufficient protection for georgia . meanwhile , france , germany , italy and spain lead the faction of eu member who do not want to see relations with moscow completely frozen due to russia 's importance as a trading partner and its international role as a veto-power at the united nations security council . chance for change ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is a key energy supplier to the european union but tusk said he would not rule out the possibility of some nations that want to keep communication with russia open could be convinced to change their tact at the summit . " i spoke with president sarkozy a few days ago and he did not hide that russia 's behavior is beginning to be irritating to a certain degree and will require the eu to make firm decisions , " tusk said . it was only last month that talks on a new strategic accord between russia and the eu got properly under way after being long-blocked by polish and lithuanian objections .
that , analysts say , is why there is a lot at stake as far as europe-russia relations are concerned . " i do n't see the possibility of introducing sanctions against russia if the situation remains the way it is today , " said cristina gallach , spokeswoman for eu foreign policy chief javier solana . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

26 , by the environmental group transport and environment -lrb- t & e -rrb- . the munich-based carmaker will have to cut carbon dioxide emissions by another 19 percent by 2012 if it is to meet the european union 's target . under laws proposed by the eu 's executive , the european commission , and currently under debate , every car manufacturer which sells large numbers of vehicles in europe should be given a target for the average amount of co2 its new cars emit from 2012 .
the proposed targets are calculated according to the average weight of cars each firm sells . bad grade for german cars despite the munich manufacturer 's relative progress , t & e said that , overall , german cars - including those made by bmw , daimler and volkswagen - emitted 10 grams of carbon dioxide more than the eu average . french car manufacturers are the closest to hitting proposed european union targets for reducing their co2 emissions , said the brussels-based environmental group , while japanese makers are the furthest away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peugeot is close to the target , but moving forward slowly according to t & e 's study , based on official eu data , the peugeot-citroen group is closest to its target , needing to reduce average new car emissions by 10 percent in the next five years . at the other end of the spectrum , suzuki faces making cuts of a hefty 25 percent in its average car emissions , daimler and mazda will have to make 24-percent cuts and nissan will have to cut by 22 percent , the study said . " it is striking that three of the bottom four carmakers are japanese ...
all three did not close the gap sufficiently in 2007 and will have to speed up their efforts , " it said . heavy cars to blame while french carmakers are closer to their targets , they are making relatively slow progress : peugeot-citroen cut emissions by 0.9 percent in 2007 , while renault managed just 0.5 percent , meaning that both groups will have to step up their efforts in order to hit the target . t & e blamed the rising weight of cars for the small cuts made to emissions .

26 , by the environmental group transport and environment -lrb- t & e -rrb- . the munich-based carmaker will have to cut carbon dioxide emissions by another 19 percent by 2012 if it is to meet the european union 's target . under laws proposed by the eu 's executive , the european commission , and currently under debate , every car manufacturer which sells large numbers of vehicles in europe should be given a target for the average amount of co2 its new cars emit from 2012 .
the proposed targets are calculated according to the average weight of cars each firm sells . bad grade for german cars despite the munich manufacturer 's relative progress , t & e said that , overall , german cars - including those made by bmw , daimler and volkswagen - emitted 10 grams of carbon dioxide more than the eu average . french car manufacturers are the closest to hitting proposed european union targets for reducing their co2 emissions , said the brussels-based environmental group , while japanese makers are the furthest away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peugeot is close to the target , but moving forward slowly according to t & e 's study , based on official eu data , the peugeot-citroen group is closest to its target , needing to reduce average new car emissions by 10 percent in the next five years . at the other end of the spectrum , suzuki faces making cuts of a hefty 25 percent in its average car emissions , daimler and mazda will have to make 24-percent cuts and nissan will have to cut by 22 percent , the study said . " it is striking that three of the bottom four carmakers are japanese ...
all three did not close the gap sufficiently in 2007 and will have to speed up their efforts , " it said . heavy cars to blame while french carmakers are closer to their targets , they are making relatively slow progress : peugeot-citroen cut emissions by 0.9 percent in 2007 , while renault managed just 0.5 percent , meaning that both groups will have to step up their efforts in order to hit the target . t & e blamed the rising weight of cars for the small cuts made to emissions .

" in the current crisis it became necessary to make a decision , " medvedev said in a nationally televised statement tuesday , aug .
26 .
" taking into consideration the will of the people and guided by the un charter of 1970 ... and other basic international law , i have signed a decree recognizing abkhazia and south ossetia . " it is not an easy choice , but it is the only way to protect the lives of civilians , " the president said after meeting with russia 's security chiefs . medvedev signed a second decree tuesday instructing the russian foreign ministry to establish diplomatic relations with abkhazia and south ossetia and sign partnership agreements with them . ties ice over bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : resident of gori , south ossetia , received aid after their city was devastated the move is likely to deepen the wedge in russia 's relations with the west , which views south ossetia and abkhazia as part of georgia .
russian stocks fell tuesday , with traders anticipating an increase in international tension . the world now faces new rifts , former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev was quoted as saying by itar-tass news agency tuesday . " the risk of a new schism has arisen .
there is a growing threat of global chaos , " gorbachev was quoted as saying in reaction to the crisis . german chancellor angela merkel sharply criticized the decision tuesday .
speaking on a visit to the estonian capital of tallinn , merkel said medvedev 's decision was " absolutely not acceptable " and ran " contrary to international law . " " we must by consequence react united as the european union , " merkel said . she also stressed support for stronger relations between the eu and georgia , including making it easier for georgians to obtain visas to the bloc . " georgia and ukraine will be members of nato , " the chancellor said .
russia has sharply opposed nato 's eastward expansion , and both countries ' bids were turned down by alliance leaders earlier this year .
the matter is to be reconsidered at a summit in december . merkel said , however , that dialogue between nato and russia should continue . nato secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer also rejected medvedev 's decision to recognize the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia .
he questioned whether russia was truly interested in peace and security in the caucasus region , according to a statement . " this is in direct violation of numerous un security council resolutions regarding georgia 's territorial integrity , resolutions that russia itself has endorsed , " de hoop scheffer said in a statement read out by his spokeswoman . on the eve of something bigger france , which brokered the cease-fire agreement between russia and georgia , also criticized the kremlin 's decision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the georgian offensive was compared to the murder that set off world war i " we consider this a regrettable decision and i recall our attachment to the territorial integrity of georgia , " said a spokesman for the french foreign ministry . just prior to medvedev 's announcement , the european union had expressed its opposition to recognizing the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia . russia 's nato envoy , dmitry rogozin , compared the current situation to europe in 1914 on the eve of world war i , " when , because of one terrorist , leading world powers clashed , " he told the rbk daily business newspaper .
war broke out after austro-hungarian archduke franz ferdinand was assassinated in august 1914 . but russian foreign minister sergey lavrov said russia is unlikely to be subjected to international isolation . " i do n't think we should really be afraid of isolation , " he told reporters in english .
" i do n't believe this should really be a doomsday scenario .
i believe common sense should prevail . " accusations of genocide in his statement issued tuesday , medvedev condemned georgia 's offensive to reclaim south ossetia earlier this month . " on the night of august 8th , tbilisi had a choice : -lrb- georgian president -rrb- saakashvili opted for genocide , " said the russian president .
" with this choice saakashvili wiped out all hope of a peaceful coexistence of south ossetia and abkhazia under one government . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west has largely opposed recognizing the provinces russia and georgia fought a brief but bloody war over south ossetia with russia 's army moving deep into georgia after repelling the georgian offensive . on tuesday the kremlin convened the security council at the president 's black sea residence in sochi to review a plea by russia 's parliament for recognition of the two georgian breakaway regions .
russia 's powerful prime minister vladimir putin was also in attendance . the united states , a staunch ally of georgia , rebuked russia 's parliament over the resolution monday , saying it was " deeply concerned . " the european union , which has been critical of russia 's military involvement in georgia , has called for a special summit on sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de beethovenfest -pipe- 26.08.2008 beethovenfest director talks ninth symphony politics großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven 's ninth symphony has been used by both left and right wing politicians beethovenfest director ilona schmiel spoke with deutsche welle about the power of beethoven 's famous ninth symphony , and why the month-long event focuses on the influential work . the motto of this year 's beethovenfest is " macht.musik , " which in german can mean both " power.music " and " make.music. "
the play on words reflects the turbulent history of the ninth symphony : its repeated exploitation by powerful figures , as well as its withstanding power to move people .
deutsche welle : ms schmiel , how did you choose the motto " macht.musik " ?
ilona schmiel : the ninth symphony was of course the impetus to ask how this work can be used to represent a whole program .
and that was the reason to hold the festival under the motto " macht.musik " and to follow the path of the ninth symphony from its premiere in 1824 to today .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ilona schmiel has directed the beethovenfest since 2004 beethoven 's political commitment , this utopia - the " ode to joy " by friedrich schiller , which he set to music , is a utopia - has n't lost any of its relevance .
we are still living in an age of war , suppression , hunger and many other injustices .
back in his time - the work was completed in 1824 - beethoven probably thought things would improve .
and that alone is a reason the ninth symphony can be made a focal point .
the question of how the reception of this piece continues in 2008 has always moved me because , as far as i know , there is no other work in the world that is played so often and deliberately chosen for so many different occasions .
the piece has not only been a part of triumphs , but also of many mistakes that have been made by governments , rulers and leaders , where the symphony was totally appropriated by politics and exploited for political purposes and dictatorial statements .
relatively speaking , beethoven had a lot of contact with the powerful figures of his time , and if you look back on his work - for example the " eroica , " " wellington 's victory " or " egmont " - he often expressed himself politically through his music .
but he did so quite differently in each case .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt masur will conduct the ninth at this year 's festival the issue of how he surrounded himself with powerful figures , but at the same time also left them hanging , was a central theme in his life , i think .
and it begs the question of where beethoven 's development through the symphonies leads - past a rejection of the powers that be , to a civil society .
on the one hand it is really a path beyond the worship of powerful figures - such as napoleon - but , on the other hand , he is using the civil society , which finances the music and supports the composer .
that 's is why i think this music is still so relevant and moving today .
questions about how to deal with works of music today , how music is used , what demands are placed on it , how much it needs to align with the state to be performed on certain occasions , and how music is twisted or the text is rewritten , for example , so that it fits a particular regime - the ninth symphony has already been through all of that .
who else then has used beethoven 's music to serve their own ends ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ninth symphony has echoed both east and west goebbels always had the ninth symphony played for hitler 's birthday .
the gdr -lrb- communist east germany -rrb- chose it as their national anthem , albeit with a different text .
it has been played constantly both in the east and the west .
it has become the european anthem , and since the olympic games it has also been mentioned that mao used the symphony to motivate workers in the fields .
kamikaze pilots listened to this music - i 'm jumping through time a bit - and it was also the national anthem of rhodesia .
i think no other work has ever been so globalized .
nevertheless this human message , this commitment to human kindness has survived - and you could almost say this message is indestructible .
how would you judge beethoven 's music today ?
what is the situation with " power " and " music " ?
for me personally , the power of music is at the forefront because i 'd like to keep believing in the utopia that music can change a lot .
in 2006 , we had a guest youth orchestra from south africa , where musicians with different backgrounds performed together , for example .
music can also be a social instrument .
and this power ca n't be burned onto a cd .
the reproduction of music in a concert is something exclusive .
there you can really feel the power of music - and i do n't think you can get away from it . interview : klaus gehrke -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw takes a look at the man behind the baton . masur has been a leading conductor for over four decades .
deep in concentration but in constant eye contact with the musicians while on stage , he has a way of drawing the music out of his orchestra with spare but energetic gestures . intensity , passion and energy exude from the 81-year-old when he takes up his baton . born in 1927 in silesia , now part of poland , masur studied music and conducting in leipzig but did n't finish to receive his diploma .
nevertheless , he gathered extensive experience on the stages of the former east germany , conducting and working as a vocal coach in halle , erfurt , schwerin and at the comic opera in east berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw offers live recordings of masur conducting beethoven in 1967 , at the age of 40 , masur became director of the dresden philharmonic orchestra .
three years later he returned to leipzig , which would become the most significant station in his career . spokesman for democracy as the music director of the gewandhaus orchestra in leipzig , masur quickly became one of the most celebrated conductors in east germany .
he led the ensemble on numerous tours , performing in over 900 concerts between 1970 and 1997 . as the soviet union began to crumble in the late 1980s , leipzig became a center of political protest in communist east germany .
masur made his voice heard as well , joining in the famous monday demonstrations . " our common concerns and responsibility have brought us together today , " the conductor said in front of the nikolaikirche in leipzig on a monday in 1989 . " we are affected by the developments in our city and are looking for a solution , " said masur , addressing the government .
" we urgently ask you to be prudent , so that peaceful dialogue is possible . " music for lonely people in 1991 , masur left his newly reunified country to direct the new york philharmonic , succeeding zubin mehta .
over the next 11 years , he developed a special program structure that not only appealed to new yorkers , but went over well across the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new york is full of lonely people , concluded masur he said he discovered his secret while taking a walk in the big apple . " i found out that new york is actually full of lonely people , and i decided to make my programs so that everyone who came to the concert would feel at home , " he said . masur has since moved his workplace from the hudson river to the seine - with a layover on the thames as principal conductor of the london philharmonic orchestra from 2000 to 2007 - and now directs the orchestre national de france .
thoughts of retirement seem to be far from his mind . " i hope that i can cut back slowly , " he said .
" if i stop tomorrow , you 'll certainly be reading my obituary pretty soon because music is part of my life . " klaus gehrke -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the first german in outer space came from a small town in saxony .
today , it 's one of the few places that still remember the communist cosmonaut . on aug .
26 , 1978 , communist east germany launched the soyuz 31 to the soviet space station salyut 6 .
on board was 41-year-old sigmund jaehn , who went down in history as " the first german cosmonaut . " jaehn 's career began in 1955 when he joined the gdr air force and became a pilot and military scientist .
between 1966 and 1970 he studied at the gagarin military air academy in monino , in the soviet union , and afterwards worked in the gdr air force administration , responsible for pilot education and flight safety . forgotten hero bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pride of east germany the 1978 flight marked a political milestone , with communist leaders pointing to its success as evidence of the eastern bloc 's technological superiority .
in september the same year , they showed their appreciation by awarding sigmund jaehn the title hero of the soviet union . but once the cold war was over , jaehn 's achievements paled somewhat .
these days , the name rings only a faint bell to most germans .
despite the huge propaganda surrounding his seven-day space mission , jaehn soon became just a footnote in history . local pride it 's a different story in his hometown of morgenroethe-rautenkranz , close to the czech border .
few locals will ever forget the town 's famous son . it is even home to a permanent exhibition of german astronautics , with one room dedicated to jaehn 's achievements . " it means a lot to all of us , " said karin schaedlich from the exhibition .
" i was 17 years old when sigmund jaehn went into space .
and when he came back i was out on the street to see him and welcome him back together with his commander valery bykovsky .
it was a great event here in rautenkranz .
even after 30 years it 's still very important for his home village . " schaedlich 's coworker romy mothes said she is keen to help young people in the region keep the jaehn legacy alive . " i think our younger generation knows who sigmund jaehn is , " she said .
" they learn about him in school .
and we have a lot of children in our exhibition and all of them know him . " putting politics in perspective bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaehn today is a frequent visitor to morgenroethe-rautenkranz the man himself drops by now and then .
at the time , he probably enjoyed the political fuss less than anyone .
although he toed the party line , his job gave him a unique perspective that helped him keep his eye on the broader picture .

" in the current crisis it became necessary to make a decision , " medvedev said in a nationally televised statement tuesday , aug .
26 .
" taking into consideration the will of the people and guided by the un charter of 1970 ... and other basic international law , i have signed a decree recognizing abkhazia and south ossetia . " it is not an easy choice , but it is the only way to protect the lives of civilians , " the president said after meeting with russia 's security chiefs . medvedev signed a second decree tuesday instructing the russian foreign ministry to establish diplomatic relations with abkhazia and south ossetia and sign partnership agreements with them . ties ice over bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : resident of gori , south ossetia , received aid after their city was devastated the move is likely to deepen the wedge in russia 's relations with the west , which views south ossetia and abkhazia as part of georgia .
russian stocks fell tuesday , with traders anticipating an increase in international tension . the world now faces new rifts , former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev was quoted as saying by itar-tass news agency tuesday . " the risk of a new schism has arisen .
there is a growing threat of global chaos , " gorbachev was quoted as saying in reaction to the crisis . german chancellor angela merkel sharply criticized the decision tuesday .
speaking on a visit to the estonian capital of tallinn , merkel said medvedev 's decision was " absolutely not acceptable " and ran " contrary to international law . " " we must by consequence react united as the european union , " merkel said . she also stressed support for stronger relations between the eu and georgia , including making it easier for georgians to obtain visas to the bloc . " georgia and ukraine will be members of nato , " the chancellor said .
russia has sharply opposed nato 's eastward expansion , and both countries ' bids were turned down by alliance leaders earlier this year .
the matter is to be reconsidered at a summit in december . merkel said , however , that dialogue between nato and russia should continue . nato secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer also rejected medvedev 's decision to recognize the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia .
he questioned whether russia was truly interested in peace and security in the caucasus region , according to a statement . " this is in direct violation of numerous un security council resolutions regarding georgia 's territorial integrity , resolutions that russia itself has endorsed , " de hoop scheffer said in a statement read out by his spokeswoman . on the eve of something bigger france , which brokered the cease-fire agreement between russia and georgia , also criticized the kremlin 's decision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the georgian offensive was compared to the murder that set off world war i " we consider this a regrettable decision and i recall our attachment to the territorial integrity of georgia , " said a spokesman for the french foreign ministry . just prior to medvedev 's announcement , the european union had expressed its opposition to recognizing the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia . russia 's nato envoy , dmitry rogozin , compared the current situation to europe in 1914 on the eve of world war i , " when , because of one terrorist , leading world powers clashed , " he told the rbk daily business newspaper .
war broke out after austro-hungarian archduke franz ferdinand was assassinated in august 1914 . but russian foreign minister sergey lavrov said russia is unlikely to be subjected to international isolation . " i do n't think we should really be afraid of isolation , " he told reporters in english .
" i do n't believe this should really be a doomsday scenario .
i believe common sense should prevail . " accusations of genocide in his statement issued tuesday , medvedev condemned georgia 's offensive to reclaim south ossetia earlier this month . " on the night of august 8th , tbilisi had a choice : -lrb- georgian president -rrb- saakashvili opted for genocide , " said the russian president .
" with this choice saakashvili wiped out all hope of a peaceful coexistence of south ossetia and abkhazia under one government . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west has largely opposed recognizing the provinces russia and georgia fought a brief but bloody war over south ossetia with russia 's army moving deep into georgia after repelling the georgian offensive . on tuesday the kremlin convened the security council at the president 's black sea residence in sochi to review a plea by russia 's parliament for recognition of the two georgian breakaway regions .
russia 's powerful prime minister vladimir putin was also in attendance . the united states , a staunch ally of georgia , rebuked russia 's parliament over the resolution monday , saying it was " deeply concerned .

a romantically glorified image : the lonely , troubled , but of course ingenious artist . first he threw a few books at his servant , then a chair without registering a trace of sympathy : " after that i had peace and quiet all day . "
and when a prince once thought two bassoons would do instead of three , he replied : " if your highness allocates instruments like that , then i do n't give a damn ! "
employees , the nobility , his publishers - they all got it dished to them .
one of his biographers called ludwig van beethoven the " bawdy genius . "
brain proprietor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there is only one beethoven " most of what we know about beethoven comes from his correspondence and his diary .
much unlike his contemporary goethe , who he did not get along very well with , beethoven was a stranger to self-stylization .
in his letters he writes about the malevolence of people and about the class restrictions which refused him contact with the women he worshipped .
he did not conduct himself as an outstanding nobleman ; he even treated friends to coarse language .
when his brother once acquired some land and signed himself as " van beethoven , land proprietor , " ludwig replied with " van beethoven , brain proprietor . "
to prince lichnowsky , one of his appreciators and patrons , he wrote : " prince , what you are , you are through chance and birth ; what i am , i am through my own labor .
there are many princes and there will continue to be thousands more , but there is only one beethoven . "
beethoven for all beethoven 's letters and diary are like a quarry from which one can extract whatever one needs .
there are sentences of his that give the impression that he had a revolutionary disposition , others that suggest he was elitist .
this ambiguity , together with his new musical aesthetic , later led to occasionally absurd attempts at exploiting his music : the 9th symphony sounded in 1937 for hitler 's birthday .
and even the news of hitler 's death was read out on the radio over the 9th symphony .
but even earlier , in the time of the weimar republic before the second world war , beethoven was politically exploited .
the right emphasized his supposed hostility towards the french and saw in him a " titanic fighting spirit . "
the left equated the revolutionary quality of his music with revolutionary politics .
that is something which later recurred in east germany : after the second world war beethoven was used by the gdr propagandists - beethoven as a fighter for world peace .
a moody artist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven did n't quite fit in to apply concrete political goals to beethoven himself is , however , totally excessive .
what he said was far too inconsistent .
for beethoven it was about finding new paths in music - new paths which he carved out dazzlingly .
beethoven was known for being business minded .
nevertheless he lived in a rundown house near vienna and hardly cared about his appearance .
to his contemporaries beethoven must have seemed completely unconventional .
beethoven remained a bachelor , he lived for music - in the morning he composed , in the afternoon he went for a walk , at lunchtime he ate heartily .
in many people 's eyes he defined the image of a brilliant but difficult artist - reinforced by the many hundreds of paintings and busts of a beethoven with wildly unkempt hair and a serious piercing glare .
beethoven 's deafness one often forgets the aspect that caused the most tragedy in his life : his deafness .
beethoven is just over 30 years old when it becomes clear that he can no longer conceal his worsening hearing .
a deaf musician ?
" my ears , they whirl and roar night and day , " he wrote .
beethoven considered suicide , withdrew himself from society .
he even wrote a farewell letter which he never sent .
in the letter is one of beethoven 's most famous sentences about himself : " oh you people who think me hostile , stubborn and misanthropic , how you wrong me .

warsaw , in particular , wants the eu to take a hard line in eu-russia relations . by announcing the eu summit in brussels next monday , sept .
1 , sarkozy wants to say clearly to moscow that the european union is " a force which has to dealt with , " and that agreements made with him by russian president dmitry medvedev must be honored , a french diplomat told the afp news agency on monday , aug .
25 . the six-point peace plan brokered by sarkozy , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , has been criticized in some european capitals as being too vague , too moscow-friendly and organized with too little consultation . after russia failed to withdraw all its troops from georgia , a key point of the cease-fire , the french president " realized that the russians were exploiting the ambiguous margins of the text and that there was a risk of a loss of credibility for the eu and the french presidency , " european policy center analyst antonio missiroli told afp . but it wo n't be easy , at the hastily-arranged summit which sarkozy announced sunday , to obtain european consensus on the future of relations with russia , he added . polish objections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk has led europe 's pro-georgian camp poland , as well as other eastern european nations that fell under the former soviet union 's direct sphere of influence , wants to convince the 27-member eu not to cut moscow any special deals after its military intervention in georgia this month . " i spoke with -lrb- germany 's -rrb- chancellor merkel this morning to make the european position uniform , harder and categorical concerning russia in the context of the crisis in the caucasus , " premier donald tusk told reporters . the differences among eu nations on how to handle russia were already highlighted earlier this month .
pro-georgia leaders of poland , estonia , lithuania and latvia traveled to tbilisi with the message that the french-brokered peace plan did not provide sufficient protection for georgia . meanwhile , france , germany , italy and spain lead the faction of eu member who do not want to see relations with moscow completely frozen due to russia 's importance as a trading partner and its international role as a veto-power at the united nations security council . chance for change ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is a key energy supplier to the european union but tusk said he would not rule out the possibility of some nations that want to keep communication with russia open could be convinced to change their tact at the summit . " i spoke with president sarkozy a few days ago and he did not hide that russia 's behavior is beginning to be irritating to a certain degree and will require the eu to make firm decisions , " tusk said . it was only last month that talks on a new strategic accord between russia and the eu got properly under way after being long-blocked by polish and lithuanian objections .
that , analysts say , is why there is a lot at stake as far as europe-russia relations are concerned . " i do n't see the possibility of introducing sanctions against russia if the situation remains the way it is today , " said cristina gallach , spokeswoman for eu foreign policy chief javier solana . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

warsaw , in particular , wants the eu to take a hard line in eu-russia relations . by announcing the eu summit in brussels next monday , sept .
1 , sarkozy wants to say clearly to moscow that the european union is " a force which has to dealt with , " and that agreements made with him by russian president dmitry medvedev must be honored , a french diplomat told the afp news agency on monday , aug .
25 . the six-point peace plan brokered by sarkozy , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , has been criticized in some european capitals as being too vague , too moscow-friendly and organized with too little consultation . after russia failed to withdraw all its troops from georgia , a key point of the cease-fire , the french president " realized that the russians were exploiting the ambiguous margins of the text and that there was a risk of a loss of credibility for the eu and the french presidency , " european policy center analyst antonio missiroli told afp . but it wo n't be easy , at the hastily-arranged summit which sarkozy announced sunday , to obtain european consensus on the future of relations with russia , he added . polish objections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk has led europe 's pro-georgian camp poland , as well as other eastern european nations that fell under the former soviet union 's direct sphere of influence , wants to convince the 27-member eu not to cut moscow any special deals after its military intervention in georgia this month . " i spoke with -lrb- germany 's -rrb- chancellor merkel this morning to make the european position uniform , harder and categorical concerning russia in the context of the crisis in the caucasus , " premier donald tusk told reporters . the differences among eu nations on how to handle russia were already highlighted earlier this month .
pro-georgia leaders of poland , estonia , lithuania and latvia traveled to tbilisi with the message that the french-brokered peace plan did not provide sufficient protection for georgia . meanwhile , france , germany , italy and spain lead the faction of eu member who do not want to see relations with moscow completely frozen due to russia 's importance as a trading partner and its international role as a veto-power at the united nations security council . chance for change ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is a key energy supplier to the european union but tusk said he would not rule out the possibility of some nations that want to keep communication with russia open could be convinced to change their tact at the summit . " i spoke with president sarkozy a few days ago and he did not hide that russia 's behavior is beginning to be irritating to a certain degree and will require the eu to make firm decisions , " tusk said . it was only last month that talks on a new strategic accord between russia and the eu got properly under way after being long-blocked by polish and lithuanian objections .
that , analysts say , is why there is a lot at stake as far as europe-russia relations are concerned . " i do n't see the possibility of introducing sanctions against russia if the situation remains the way it is today , " said cristina gallach , spokeswoman for eu foreign policy chief javier solana . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de georgia -pipe- 26.08.2008 analysis : opening a pandora 's box in the caucasus großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the region has been thrown into disarray the caucasus conflict was brought about at least in part by the west 's decision to recognize kosovo 's independence 6 months ago .
experts say this sparked a chain reaction in the region , which only moscow can now halt . when the west recognized kosovo 's independence half a year ago , russia 's leaders warned that the move would open a " pandora 's box " in the caucasus .
the mountainous region 's patchwork of ethnicities and states have long been difficult to reconcile into coherent nation states .
the recent , bloody 10-day war between russia and georgia over the former soviet states ' rebel region of south ossetia is the realization of that pandora 's box scenario .
the background russia has long supported georgia 's two ethnically separatist provinces of abkhazia and south ossetia , but stopped short of recognizing their independence - until now - fearing that secessions in those provinces would provide a dangerous precedent for other minority nations within the russian federation .
nevertheless , russian lawmakers this week unanimously passed a motion urging president dmitry medvedev to recognize georgia 's rebel regions as independent - 15 years after they won de facto autonomy in a war of succession from tbilisi in the early 1990s .
by some counts , over 80 percent of the populations in the regions have been issued russian passports under an especially generous russian policy that saakashvili decried as the creeping annexation of georgian territory .
the kosovo precedent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's independence set a dangerous precedence as russian tanks rolled into south ossetia on aug .
8 to push back georgia 's offensive to re-assert control , medvedev took the national stage , invoking the army in defense of russian citizens .
in a series of interviews by dpa news agency after kosovo 's independence in february , russian analysts foresaw a military flare up , but did not predict the possibility that moscow 's policy could turn to recognizing the regions .
the threat that kosovo could stand as a secessionist precedent in the caucasus had formed the kremlin 's most vivid protest to the province 's break from its ally serbia .
but while moscow is still confronted by the problems that the kosovo precedent raises , paradoxically , the comparison has now been turned into a justification of south ossetia and abkhazia 's right to self-determination .
western leaders have labeled russia 's move to recognize georgia 's regions as hypocrisy , while russian leaders hit back with the accusation that a double standard has been applied in the case of kosovo .
the resolution passed on monday argued that by its assault on civilians tbilisi had forgone all moral right over the area , drawing a direct link between russia incursion and the justification of nato 's bombing campaign in serbia in 1998 .
appealing before russian lawmakers south ossetia 's president eduard kokoity repeated what has become a maxim : " we have more political-legal grounds than kosovo does to have our independence recognized . "
but professor yury kolosov of the moscow institute of international relations threw cold water on the much-cited " kosovo precedent . "
" there is no such thing as a ' precedent ' in international law ... and , if this is a precedent , then it 's a bad one , " kolosov , an eminent member of russia 's association of international law , told dpa .
the final say in other words , the kremlin has the last word .
while the threat of recognizing the breakaway region adds to its bargaining power with the west , analysts said it would look for ways to delay such recognition , for example , by requesting the provinces hold a new referendum .
" it seems to me that now politically it would be more favorable to leave this situation hanging , " moscow-based analyst vyacheslav nikonov , head of the politika foundation , told news agency interfax on monday .
the kremlin and its allies , meanwhile , are n't deaf to its own warnings that seizing on kosovo as a precedent could spark a " chain reaction " in the region .
legal limbo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev - the ball is in his court medvedev sought to reassure the molodovan and azeri presidents - who have similar secession worries to georgia - on monday over the respective breakaway regions of nagorno karabakh and transnistria .
south ossetia 's ultimate ambition to unite with russia 's ethnically-similar region of north ossetia is no less problematic .
russia 's ties to abkhazia , which seeks only self-determination , have traditionally been stronger , as has its economic interest in the region .
a poll by the independent levada center in the aftermath of the conflict show near half of russians - or 46 percent - say south ossetia should become part of russia .
only 4 percent of those surveyed in interviews with 2,100 adults believed the province should remain part of georgia .
but whatever the populations of the caucasus think , with the fate of both provinces of intimate interest to moscow and beyond , the situation is likely to remain - for now - in legal limbo . dpa news agency -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with this move , russia is not only ignoring all the warnings of western governments handed out over the past few days , but is also in violation of international law by disregarding the sovereign borders of its european neighbor , georgia . of course , the russian president considers himself to be in the right , since the georgian government tried to remove the separatists ' regimes from georgian territory using force , but the kremlin is alone in this view . through this decision , russia has resorted to dangerous self isolation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 26.08.2008 danish rockstar uses nazi slogan to protest smoking ban großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking bans are the creations of " health fascists , " larson has said a pro-smoking campaign launched in denmark by one of the country 's best-known rockstars features a notorious nazi slogan .
the country 's modest jewish community is refusing to take offense . as frontman of gasolin ' , a seminal rock band which enjoyed its heyday in the 1970s , kim larsen has always been one of the bad boys of danish rock .
and like any self-respecting hellraiser , he 's vociferously anti-establishment . in the best rock ' n ' roll tradition , he 's also a die-hard smoker .
so it comes as no surprise that he does n't like the eu 's anti-smoking laws introduced in denmark one year ago , which ban smoking in public bars and restaurants . health fascists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who reads billboards anyway ?
not the type who likes being told what to do , larsen recently helped fund an advertising campaign revolving around the slogan " tillykke med rygeforbudet - gesundheit macht frei ! ! ! " the first claim means " good luck with the smoking ban " in danish , while the german slogan " health sets you free " is an obvious allusion to the nazi slogan " arbeit macht frei , " or " work sets you free , " which was placed at the entrances to a number of nazi concentration camps , such as auschwitz and dachau . " the people who introduced the smoking ban are health fascists , " larsen has been quoted as saying . he said the reference to the third reich is a valid one , because the nazis introduced a nationwide tobacco ban as part of their quest for bodily and racial purity . " hitler was the first to ban smoking , " said the one-time eurovision song contest hopeful . cause celebre bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kim larsen : too stupid to be taken seriously ?
larsen allegedly is n't the only celebrity to have donated to the " himmelbla " fund behind the campaign , whose ads are now splurged across copenhagen 's billboards . " this is not about a defense of smoking , " larsen has said .
" this is about a defense of democracy and freedom . " the country 's jewish community , for its part , is choosing to see the campaign in this context - merely a clumsy protest against government interference with individual freedoms . " it 's stupid , plain stupid , " stefan isaak , president of the danish jewish community , told dw-world.de.
" i do n't connect it with any kind of anti-semitism - it 's just plain stupidity . " explaining why larsen 's posters have gone largely ignored , he pointed out that denmark has few holocaust survivors , because most of the country 's jews left for sweden during world war ii . " feelings might be hurt , " he said .
" but the whole slogan is so idiotic ; you ca n't begin to connect it to auschwitz . " bad taste bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smokers : social pariahs arne rolighed of denmark 's leading cancer research charity is taking more offense . " it 's extremely tasteless , " he was quoted as saying in danish daily politiken . it 's not the first time this kind of parallel has been drawn .
in germany - where nazi allusions are not shrugged off as lightly as they are in denmark - one protester launched a line of t-shirts earlier this year bearing a yellow star of david along with the word " smoker . " the shirt was quickly withdrawn from the market after jewish groups objected to comparing the perceived persecution of smokers to that of the jews under the nazis . isaak is more circumspect . " the less said about -lsb- larsen 's campaign -rsb- , the better , " he said . jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
the play on words reflects the turbulent history of the ninth symphony : its repeated exploitation by powerful figures , as well as its withstanding power to move people .
deutsche welle : ms schmiel , how did you choose the motto " macht.musik " ?
ilona schmiel : the ninth symphony was of course the impetus to ask how this work can be used to represent a whole program .
and that was the reason to hold the festival under the motto " macht.musik " and to follow the path of the ninth symphony from its premiere in 1824 to today .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ilona schmiel has directed the beethovenfest since 2004 beethoven 's political commitment , this utopia - the " ode to joy " by friedrich schiller , which he set to music , is a utopia - has n't lost any of its relevance .
we are still living in an age of war , suppression , hunger and many other injustices .
back in his time - the work was completed in 1824 - beethoven probably thought things would improve .
and that alone is a reason the ninth symphony can be made a focal point .
the question of how the reception of this piece continues in 2008 has always moved me because , as far as i know , there is no other work in the world that is played so often and deliberately chosen for so many different occasions .
the piece has not only been a part of triumphs , but also of many mistakes that have been made by governments , rulers and leaders , where the symphony was totally appropriated by politics and exploited for political purposes and dictatorial statements .
relatively speaking , beethoven had a lot of contact with the powerful figures of his time , and if you look back on his work - for example the " eroica , " " wellington 's victory " or " egmont " - he often expressed himself politically through his music .
but he did so quite differently in each case .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt masur will conduct the ninth at this year 's festival the issue of how he surrounded himself with powerful figures , but at the same time also left them hanging , was a central theme in his life , i think .
and it begs the question of where beethoven 's development through the symphonies leads - past a rejection of the powers that be , to a civil society .
on the one hand it is really a path beyond the worship of powerful figures - such as napoleon - but , on the other hand , he is using the civil society , which finances the music and supports the composer .
that 's is why i think this music is still so relevant and moving today .
questions about how to deal with works of music today , how music is used , what demands are placed on it , how much it needs to align with the state to be performed on certain occasions , and how music is twisted or the text is rewritten , for example , so that it fits a particular regime - the ninth symphony has already been through all of that .
who else then has used beethoven 's music to serve their own ends ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ninth symphony has echoed both east and west goebbels always had the ninth symphony played for hitler 's birthday .
the gdr -lrb- communist east germany -rrb- chose it as their national anthem , albeit with a different text .
it has been played constantly both in the east and the west .
it has become the european anthem , and since the olympic games it has also been mentioned that mao used the symphony to motivate workers in the fields .
kamikaze pilots listened to this music - i 'm jumping through time a bit - and it was also the national anthem of rhodesia .
i think no other work has ever been so globalized .
nevertheless this human message , this commitment to human kindness has survived - and you could almost say this message is indestructible .
how would you judge beethoven 's music today ?
what is the situation with " power " and " music " ?
for me personally , the power of music is at the forefront because i 'd like to keep believing in the utopia that music can change a lot .
in 2006 , we had a guest youth orchestra from south africa , where musicians with different backgrounds performed together , for example .
music can also be a social instrument .
and this power ca n't be burned onto a cd .
the reproduction of music in a concert is something exclusive .

with this move , russia is not only ignoring all the warnings of western governments handed out over the past few days , but is also in violation of international law by disregarding the sovereign borders of its european neighbor , georgia . of course , the russian president considers himself to be in the right , since the georgian government tried to remove the separatists ' regimes from georgian territory using force , but the kremlin is alone in this view . through this decision , russia has resorted to dangerous self isolation .
the recognition of south ossetia and abkhazia will certainly cause considerable damage to the relationship between russia and the west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel the kremlin is delusional if it assumes that the west will simply be pacified after a short while .
russia has , without a doubt , the potential to cause considerable damage to western interests : in relation to afghanistan , the iranian nuclear problem , as well as the energy supply .
but that also applies to the west . now the danger exists that both sides can come up with more problems for the other .
the west could react by allowing georgia or the ukraine to join nato , or by blocking russia ’ s wto membership .
russia could stop supporting the west in afghanistan , or could form an international gas cartel .
the ammunition on both sides is considerable . what is unfortunate is that no one is being helped by the heightening of the dispute - neither russia nor the west .
even south ossetia and abkhazia wo n't get anything through the recognition of their independence by russia , since it 's only valid in moscow . it , however , can not be assumed that nato and the eu nations will simply stop their daily dealings with russia .
all of the western governments have already made that clear in their warnings over the past few days .
western nations will find asymmetrical answers to russia acting alone and defying international principles .
here russia has clearly underestimated how much control western nations have over russian interests . at first glance the georgian conflict was rather insignificant from an american and european perspective .
however , this recent russian action will surely lead to nato and the eu consolidating and unifying their russia policies .
russia 's critics will be there to take it all in , and advocates of a moderate course will be silenced .
that is clearly visible from the reactions of both german chancellor angela merkel and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier .
germany has long belonged to the eu nations which have been firm in their cooperation with russia .
now all of that could change . ingo mannteufel is the head of deutsche welles 's russian online and radio departments -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de georgia -pipe- 26.08.2008 analysis : opening a pandora 's box in the caucasus großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the region has been thrown into disarray the caucasus conflict was brought about at least in part by the west 's decision to recognize kosovo 's independence 6 months ago .
experts say this sparked a chain reaction in the region , which only moscow can now halt . when the west recognized kosovo 's independence half a year ago , russia 's leaders warned that the move would open a " pandora 's box " in the caucasus .
the mountainous region 's patchwork of ethnicities and states have long been difficult to reconcile into coherent nation states .
the recent , bloody 10-day war between russia and georgia over the former soviet states ' rebel region of south ossetia is the realization of that pandora 's box scenario .
the background russia has long supported georgia 's two ethnically separatist provinces of abkhazia and south ossetia , but stopped short of recognizing their independence - until now - fearing that secessions in those provinces would provide a dangerous precedent for other minority nations within the russian federation .
nevertheless , russian lawmakers this week unanimously passed a motion urging president dmitry medvedev to recognize georgia 's rebel regions as independent - 15 years after they won de facto autonomy in a war of succession from tbilisi in the early 1990s .
by some counts , over 80 percent of the populations in the regions have been issued russian passports under an especially generous russian policy that saakashvili decried as the creeping annexation of georgian territory .
the kosovo precedent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's independence set a dangerous precedence as russian tanks rolled into south ossetia on aug .
8 to push back georgia 's offensive to re-assert control , medvedev took the national stage , invoking the army in defense of russian citizens .
in a series of interviews by dpa news agency after kosovo 's independence in february , russian analysts foresaw a military flare up , but did not predict the possibility that moscow 's policy could turn to recognizing the regions .
the threat that kosovo could stand as a secessionist precedent in the caucasus had formed the kremlin 's most vivid protest to the province 's break from its ally serbia .
but while moscow is still confronted by the problems that the kosovo precedent raises , paradoxically , the comparison has now been turned into a justification of south ossetia and abkhazia 's right to self-determination .
western leaders have labeled russia 's move to recognize georgia 's regions as hypocrisy , while russian leaders hit back with the accusation that a double standard has been applied in the case of kosovo .
the resolution passed on monday argued that by its assault on civilians tbilisi had forgone all moral right over the area , drawing a direct link between russia incursion and the justification of nato 's bombing campaign in serbia in 1998 .
appealing before russian lawmakers south ossetia 's president eduard kokoity repeated what has become a maxim : " we have more political-legal grounds than kosovo does to have our independence recognized . "
but professor yury kolosov of the moscow institute of international relations threw cold water on the much-cited " kosovo precedent . "
" there is no such thing as a ' precedent ' in international law ... and , if this is a precedent , then it 's a bad one , " kolosov , an eminent member of russia 's association of international law , told dpa .
the final say in other words , the kremlin has the last word .
while the threat of recognizing the breakaway region adds to its bargaining power with the west , analysts said it would look for ways to delay such recognition , for example , by requesting the provinces hold a new referendum .
" it seems to me that now politically it would be more favorable to leave this situation hanging , " moscow-based analyst vyacheslav nikonov , head of the politika foundation , told news agency interfax on monday .
the kremlin and its allies , meanwhile , are n't deaf to its own warnings that seizing on kosovo as a precedent could spark a " chain reaction " in the region .
legal limbo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev - the ball is in his court medvedev sought to reassure the molodovan and azeri presidents - who have similar secession worries to georgia - on monday over the respective breakaway regions of nagorno karabakh and transnistria .
south ossetia 's ultimate ambition to unite with russia 's ethnically-similar region of north ossetia is no less problematic .
russia 's ties to abkhazia , which seeks only self-determination , have traditionally been stronger , as has its economic interest in the region .
a poll by the independent levada center in the aftermath of the conflict show near half of russians - or 46 percent - say south ossetia should become part of russia .
only 4 percent of those surveyed in interviews with 2,100 adults believed the province should remain part of georgia .
but whatever the populations of the caucasus think , with the fate of both provinces of intimate interest to moscow and beyond , the situation is likely to remain - for now - in legal limbo . dpa news agency -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the background russia has long supported georgia 's two ethnically separatist provinces of abkhazia and south ossetia , but stopped short of recognizing their independence - until now - fearing that secessions in those provinces would provide a dangerous precedent for other minority nations within the russian federation .
nevertheless , russian lawmakers this week unanimously passed a motion urging president dmitry medvedev to recognize georgia 's rebel regions as independent - 15 years after they won de facto autonomy in a war of succession from tbilisi in the early 1990s .
by some counts , over 80 percent of the populations in the regions have been issued russian passports under an especially generous russian policy that saakashvili decried as the creeping annexation of georgian territory .
the kosovo precedent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's independence set a dangerous precedence as russian tanks rolled into south ossetia on aug .
8 to push back georgia 's offensive to re-assert control , medvedev took the national stage , invoking the army in defense of russian citizens .
in a series of interviews by dpa news agency after kosovo 's independence in february , russian analysts foresaw a military flare up , but did not predict the possibility that moscow 's policy could turn to recognizing the regions .
the threat that kosovo could stand as a secessionist precedent in the caucasus had formed the kremlin 's most vivid protest to the province 's break from its ally serbia .
but while moscow is still confronted by the problems that the kosovo precedent raises , paradoxically , the comparison has now been turned into a justification of south ossetia and abkhazia 's right to self-determination .
western leaders have labeled russia 's move to recognize georgia 's regions as hypocrisy , while russian leaders hit back with the accusation that a double standard has been applied in the case of kosovo .
the resolution passed on monday argued that by its assault on civilians tbilisi had forgone all moral right over the area , drawing a direct link between russia incursion and the justification of nato 's bombing campaign in serbia in 1998 .
appealing before russian lawmakers south ossetia 's president eduard kokoity repeated what has become a maxim : " we have more political-legal grounds than kosovo does to have our independence recognized . "
but professor yury kolosov of the moscow institute of international relations threw cold water on the much-cited " kosovo precedent . "
" there is no such thing as a ' precedent ' in international law ... and , if this is a precedent , then it 's a bad one , " kolosov , an eminent member of russia 's association of international law , told dpa .
the final say in other words , the kremlin has the last word .
while the threat of recognizing the breakaway region adds to its bargaining power with the west , analysts said it would look for ways to delay such recognition , for example , by requesting the provinces hold a new referendum .
" it seems to me that now politically it would be more favorable to leave this situation hanging , " moscow-based analyst vyacheslav nikonov , head of the politika foundation , told news agency interfax on monday .
the kremlin and its allies , meanwhile , are n't deaf to its own warnings that seizing on kosovo as a precedent could spark a " chain reaction " in the region .
legal limbo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev - the ball is in his court medvedev sought to reassure the molodovan and azeri presidents - who have similar secession worries to georgia - on monday over the respective breakaway regions of nagorno karabakh and transnistria .
south ossetia 's ultimate ambition to unite with russia 's ethnically-similar region of north ossetia is no less problematic .
russia 's ties to abkhazia , which seeks only self-determination , have traditionally been stronger , as has its economic interest in the region .
a poll by the independent levada center in the aftermath of the conflict show near half of russians - or 46 percent - say south ossetia should become part of russia .
only 4 percent of those surveyed in interviews with 2,100 adults believed the province should remain part of georgia .
but whatever the populations of the caucasus think , with the fate of both provinces of intimate interest to moscow and beyond , the situation is likely to remain - for now - in legal limbo . dpa news agency -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the country 's modest jewish community is refusing to take offense . as frontman of gasolin ' , a seminal rock band which enjoyed its heyday in the 1970s , kim larsen has always been one of the bad boys of danish rock .
and like any self-respecting hellraiser , he 's vociferously anti-establishment . in the best rock ' n ' roll tradition , he 's also a die-hard smoker .
so it comes as no surprise that he does n't like the eu 's anti-smoking laws introduced in denmark one year ago , which ban smoking in public bars and restaurants . health fascists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who reads billboards anyway ?
not the type who likes being told what to do , larsen recently helped fund an advertising campaign revolving around the slogan " tillykke med rygeforbudet - gesundheit macht frei ! ! ! " the first claim means " good luck with the smoking ban " in danish , while the german slogan " health sets you free " is an obvious allusion to the nazi slogan " arbeit macht frei , " or " work sets you free , " which was placed at the entrances to a number of nazi concentration camps , such as auschwitz and dachau . " the people who introduced the smoking ban are health fascists , " larsen has been quoted as saying . he said the reference to the third reich is a valid one , because the nazis introduced a nationwide tobacco ban as part of their quest for bodily and racial purity . " hitler was the first to ban smoking , " said the one-time eurovision song contest hopeful . cause celebre bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kim larsen : too stupid to be taken seriously ?
larsen allegedly is n't the only celebrity to have donated to the " himmelbla " fund behind the campaign , whose ads are now splurged across copenhagen 's billboards . " this is not about a defense of smoking , " larsen has said .
" this is about a defense of democracy and freedom . " the country 's jewish community , for its part , is choosing to see the campaign in this context - merely a clumsy protest against government interference with individual freedoms . " it 's stupid , plain stupid , " stefan isaak , president of the danish jewish community , told dw-world.de.
" i do n't connect it with any kind of anti-semitism - it 's just plain stupidity . " explaining why larsen 's posters have gone largely ignored , he pointed out that denmark has few holocaust survivors , because most of the country 's jews left for sweden during world war ii . " feelings might be hurt , " he said .
" but the whole slogan is so idiotic ; you ca n't begin to connect it to auschwitz . " bad taste bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smokers : social pariahs arne rolighed of denmark 's leading cancer research charity is taking more offense .

in germany - where nazi allusions are not shrugged off as lightly as they are in denmark - one protester launched a line of t-shirts earlier this year bearing a yellow star of david along with the word " smoker .

"
the play on words reflects the turbulent history of the ninth symphony : its repeated exploitation by powerful figures , as well as its withstanding power to move people .
deutsche welle : ms schmiel , how did you choose the motto " macht.musik " ?
ilona schmiel : the ninth symphony was of course the impetus to ask how this work can be used to represent a whole program .
and that was the reason to hold the festival under the motto " macht.musik " and to follow the path of the ninth symphony from its premiere in 1824 to today .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ilona schmiel has directed the beethovenfest since 2004 beethoven 's political commitment , this utopia - the " ode to joy " by friedrich schiller , which he set to music , is a utopia - has n't lost any of its relevance .
we are still living in an age of war , suppression , hunger and many other injustices .
back in his time - the work was completed in 1824 - beethoven probably thought things would improve .
and that alone is a reason the ninth symphony can be made a focal point .
the question of how the reception of this piece continues in 2008 has always moved me because , as far as i know , there is no other work in the world that is played so often and deliberately chosen for so many different occasions .
the piece has not only been a part of triumphs , but also of many mistakes that have been made by governments , rulers and leaders , where the symphony was totally appropriated by politics and exploited for political purposes and dictatorial statements .
relatively speaking , beethoven had a lot of contact with the powerful figures of his time , and if you look back on his work - for example the " eroica , " " wellington 's victory " or " egmont " - he often expressed himself politically through his music .
but he did so quite differently in each case .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt masur will conduct the ninth at this year 's festival the issue of how he surrounded himself with powerful figures , but at the same time also left them hanging , was a central theme in his life , i think .
and it begs the question of where beethoven 's development through the symphonies leads - past a rejection of the powers that be , to a civil society .
on the one hand it is really a path beyond the worship of powerful figures - such as napoleon - but , on the other hand , he is using the civil society , which finances the music and supports the composer .
that 's is why i think this music is still so relevant and moving today .
questions about how to deal with works of music today , how music is used , what demands are placed on it , how much it needs to align with the state to be performed on certain occasions , and how music is twisted or the text is rewritten , for example , so that it fits a particular regime - the ninth symphony has already been through all of that .
who else then has used beethoven 's music to serve their own ends ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ninth symphony has echoed both east and west goebbels always had the ninth symphony played for hitler 's birthday .
the gdr -lrb- communist east germany -rrb- chose it as their national anthem , albeit with a different text .
it has been played constantly both in the east and the west .
it has become the european anthem , and since the olympic games it has also been mentioned that mao used the symphony to motivate workers in the fields .
kamikaze pilots listened to this music - i 'm jumping through time a bit - and it was also the national anthem of rhodesia .
i think no other work has ever been so globalized .
nevertheless this human message , this commitment to human kindness has survived - and you could almost say this message is indestructible .
how would you judge beethoven 's music today ?
what is the situation with " power " and " music " ?
for me personally , the power of music is at the forefront because i 'd like to keep believing in the utopia that music can change a lot .
in 2006 , we had a guest youth orchestra from south africa , where musicians with different backgrounds performed together , for example .
music can also be a social instrument .
and this power ca n't be burned onto a cd .
the reproduction of music in a concert is something exclusive .
there you can really feel the power of music - and i do n't think you can get away from it . interview : klaus gehrke -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on the one hand it is really a path beyond the worship of powerful figures - such as napoleon - but , on the other hand , he is using the civil society , which finances the music and supports the composer .

questions about how to deal with works of music today , how music is used , what demands are placed on it , how much it needs to align with the state to be performed on certain occasions , and how music is twisted or the text is rewritten , for example , so that it fits a particular regime - the ninth symphony has already been through all of that .

"
the play on words reflects the turbulent history of the ninth symphony : its repeated exploitation by powerful figures , as well as its withstanding power to move people .
deutsche welle : ms schmiel , how did you choose the motto " macht.musik " ?
ilona schmiel : the ninth symphony was of course the impetus to ask how this work can be used to represent a whole program .
and that was the reason to hold the festival under the motto " macht.musik " and to follow the path of the ninth symphony from its premiere in 1824 to today .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ilona schmiel has directed the beethovenfest since 2004 beethoven 's political commitment , this utopia - the " ode to joy " by friedrich schiller , which he set to music , is a utopia - has n't lost any of its relevance .
we are still living in an age of war , suppression , hunger and many other injustices .
back in his time - the work was completed in 1824 - beethoven probably thought things would improve .
and that alone is a reason the ninth symphony can be made a focal point .
the question of how the reception of this piece continues in 2008 has always moved me because , as far as i know , there is no other work in the world that is played so often and deliberately chosen for so many different occasions .
the piece has not only been a part of triumphs , but also of many mistakes that have been made by governments , rulers and leaders , where the symphony was totally appropriated by politics and exploited for political purposes and dictatorial statements .
relatively speaking , beethoven had a lot of contact with the powerful figures of his time , and if you look back on his work - for example the " eroica , " " wellington 's victory " or " egmont " - he often expressed himself politically through his music .
but he did so quite differently in each case .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt masur will conduct the ninth at this year 's festival the issue of how he surrounded himself with powerful figures , but at the same time also left them hanging , was a central theme in his life , i think .
and it begs the question of where beethoven 's development through the symphonies leads - past a rejection of the powers that be , to a civil society .

experts say this sparked a chain reaction in the region , which only moscow can now halt . when the west recognized kosovo 's independence half a year ago , russia 's leaders warned that the move would open a " pandora 's box " in the caucasus .
the mountainous region 's patchwork of ethnicities and states have long been difficult to reconcile into coherent nation states .
the recent , bloody 10-day war between russia and georgia over the former soviet states ' rebel region of south ossetia is the realization of that pandora 's box scenario .
the background russia has long supported georgia 's two ethnically separatist provinces of abkhazia and south ossetia , but stopped short of recognizing their independence - until now - fearing that secessions in those provinces would provide a dangerous precedent for other minority nations within the russian federation .
nevertheless , russian lawmakers this week unanimously passed a motion urging president dmitry medvedev to recognize georgia 's rebel regions as independent - 15 years after they won de facto autonomy in a war of succession from tbilisi in the early 1990s .
by some counts , over 80 percent of the populations in the regions have been issued russian passports under an especially generous russian policy that saakashvili decried as the creeping annexation of georgian territory .
the kosovo precedent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's independence set a dangerous precedence as russian tanks rolled into south ossetia on aug .
8 to push back georgia 's offensive to re-assert control , medvedev took the national stage , invoking the army in defense of russian citizens .
in a series of interviews by dpa news agency after kosovo 's independence in february , russian analysts foresaw a military flare up , but did not predict the possibility that moscow 's policy could turn to recognizing the regions .
the threat that kosovo could stand as a secessionist precedent in the caucasus had formed the kremlin 's most vivid protest to the province 's break from its ally serbia .
but while moscow is still confronted by the problems that the kosovo precedent raises , paradoxically , the comparison has now been turned into a justification of south ossetia and abkhazia 's right to self-determination .
western leaders have labeled russia 's move to recognize georgia 's regions as hypocrisy , while russian leaders hit back with the accusation that a double standard has been applied in the case of kosovo .
the resolution passed on monday argued that by its assault on civilians tbilisi had forgone all moral right over the area , drawing a direct link between russia incursion and the justification of nato 's bombing campaign in serbia in 1998 .
appealing before russian lawmakers south ossetia 's president eduard kokoity repeated what has become a maxim : " we have more political-legal grounds than kosovo does to have our independence recognized . "
but professor yury kolosov of the moscow institute of international relations threw cold water on the much-cited " kosovo precedent . "
" there is no such thing as a ' precedent ' in international law ... and , if this is a precedent , then it 's a bad one , " kolosov , an eminent member of russia 's association of international law , told dpa .
the final say in other words , the kremlin has the last word .
while the threat of recognizing the breakaway region adds to its bargaining power with the west , analysts said it would look for ways to delay such recognition , for example , by requesting the provinces hold a new referendum .
" it seems to me that now politically it would be more favorable to leave this situation hanging , " moscow-based analyst vyacheslav nikonov , head of the politika foundation , told news agency interfax on monday .
the kremlin and its allies , meanwhile , are n't deaf to its own warnings that seizing on kosovo as a precedent could spark a " chain reaction " in the region .

south ossetia 's ultimate ambition to unite with russia 's ethnically-similar region of north ossetia is no less problematic .
russia 's ties to abkhazia , which seeks only self-determination , have traditionally been stronger , as has its economic interest in the region .
a poll by the independent levada center in the aftermath of the conflict show near half of russians - or 46 percent - say south ossetia should become part of russia .
only 4 percent of those surveyed in interviews with 2,100 adults believed the province should remain part of georgia .

1 , sarkozy wants to say clearly to moscow that the european union is " a force which has to dealt with , " and that agreements made with him by russian president dmitry medvedev must be honored , a french diplomat told the afp news agency on monday , aug .
25 . the six-point peace plan brokered by sarkozy , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , has been criticized in some european capitals as being too vague , too moscow-friendly and organized with too little consultation . after russia failed to withdraw all its troops from georgia , a key point of the cease-fire , the french president " realized that the russians were exploiting the ambiguous margins of the text and that there was a risk of a loss of credibility for the eu and the french presidency , " european policy center analyst antonio missiroli told afp . but it wo n't be easy , at the hastily-arranged summit which sarkozy announced sunday , to obtain european consensus on the future of relations with russia , he added . polish objections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk has led europe 's pro-georgian camp poland , as well as other eastern european nations that fell under the former soviet union 's direct sphere of influence , wants to convince the 27-member eu not to cut moscow any special deals after its military intervention in georgia this month . " i spoke with -lrb- germany 's -rrb- chancellor merkel this morning to make the european position uniform , harder and categorical concerning russia in the context of the crisis in the caucasus , " premier donald tusk told reporters . the differences among eu nations on how to handle russia were already highlighted earlier this month .

" i spoke with president sarkozy a few days ago and he did not hide that russia 's behavior is beginning to be irritating to a certain degree and will require the eu to make firm decisions , " tusk said . it was only last month that talks on a new strategic accord between russia and the eu got properly under way after being long-blocked by polish and lithuanian objections .
that , analysts say , is why there is a lot at stake as far as europe-russia relations are concerned .

dw takes a look at the man behind the baton . masur has been a leading conductor for over four decades .
deep in concentration but in constant eye contact with the musicians while on stage , he has a way of drawing the music out of his orchestra with spare but energetic gestures . intensity , passion and energy exude from the 81-year-old when he takes up his baton . born in 1927 in silesia , now part of poland , masur studied music and conducting in leipzig but did n't finish to receive his diploma .
nevertheless , he gathered extensive experience on the stages of the former east germany , conducting and working as a vocal coach in halle , erfurt , schwerin and at the comic opera in east berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw offers live recordings of masur conducting beethoven in 1967 , at the age of 40 , masur became director of the dresden philharmonic orchestra .
three years later he returned to leipzig , which would become the most significant station in his career . spokesman for democracy as the music director of the gewandhaus orchestra in leipzig , masur quickly became one of the most celebrated conductors in east germany .
he led the ensemble on numerous tours , performing in over 900 concerts between 1970 and 1997 . as the soviet union began to crumble in the late 1980s , leipzig became a center of political protest in communist east germany .
masur made his voice heard as well , joining in the famous monday demonstrations . " our common concerns and responsibility have brought us together today , " the conductor said in front of the nikolaikirche in leipzig on a monday in 1989 . " we are affected by the developments in our city and are looking for a solution , " said masur , addressing the government .
" we urgently ask you to be prudent , so that peaceful dialogue is possible . " music for lonely people in 1991 , masur left his newly reunified country to direct the new york philharmonic , succeeding zubin mehta .
over the next 11 years , he developed a special program structure that not only appealed to new yorkers , but went over well across the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new york is full of lonely people , concluded masur he said he discovered his secret while taking a walk in the big apple . " i found out that new york is actually full of lonely people , and i decided to make my programs so that everyone who came to the concert would feel at home , " he said . masur has since moved his workplace from the hudson river to the seine - with a layover on the thames as principal conductor of the london philharmonic orchestra from 2000 to 2007 - and now directs the orchestre national de france .
thoughts of retirement seem to be far from his mind . " i hope that i can cut back slowly , " he said .
" if i stop tomorrow , you 'll certainly be reading my obituary pretty soon because music is part of my life . " klaus gehrke -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

26 , by the environmental group transport and environment -lrb- t & e -rrb- . the munich-based carmaker will have to cut carbon dioxide emissions by another 19 percent by 2012 if it is to meet the european union 's target . under laws proposed by the eu 's executive , the european commission , and currently under debate , every car manufacturer which sells large numbers of vehicles in europe should be given a target for the average amount of co2 its new cars emit from 2012 .
the proposed targets are calculated according to the average weight of cars each firm sells . bad grade for german cars despite the munich manufacturer 's relative progress , t & e said that , overall , german cars - including those made by bmw , daimler and volkswagen - emitted 10 grams of carbon dioxide more than the eu average . french car manufacturers are the closest to hitting proposed european union targets for reducing their co2 emissions , said the brussels-based environmental group , while japanese makers are the furthest away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peugeot is close to the target , but moving forward slowly according to t & e 's study , based on official eu data , the peugeot-citroen group is closest to its target , needing to reduce average new car emissions by 10 percent in the next five years . at the other end of the spectrum , suzuki faces making cuts of a hefty 25 percent in its average car emissions , daimler and mazda will have to make 24-percent cuts and nissan will have to cut by 22 percent , the study said . " it is striking that three of the bottom four carmakers are japanese ...
all three did not close the gap sufficiently in 2007 and will have to speed up their efforts , " it said . heavy cars to blame while french carmakers are closer to their targets , they are making relatively slow progress : peugeot-citroen cut emissions by 0.9 percent in 2007 , while renault managed just 0.5 percent , meaning that both groups will have to step up their efforts in order to hit the target . t & e blamed the rising weight of cars for the small cuts made to emissions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 26.08.2008 danish rockstar uses nazi slogan to protest smoking ban großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking bans are the creations of " health fascists , " larson has said a pro-smoking campaign launched in denmark by one of the country 's best-known rockstars features a notorious nazi slogan .
the country 's modest jewish community is refusing to take offense . as frontman of gasolin ' , a seminal rock band which enjoyed its heyday in the 1970s , kim larsen has always been one of the bad boys of danish rock .
and like any self-respecting hellraiser , he 's vociferously anti-establishment . in the best rock ' n ' roll tradition , he 's also a die-hard smoker .
so it comes as no surprise that he does n't like the eu 's anti-smoking laws introduced in denmark one year ago , which ban smoking in public bars and restaurants . health fascists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who reads billboards anyway ?
not the type who likes being told what to do , larsen recently helped fund an advertising campaign revolving around the slogan " tillykke med rygeforbudet - gesundheit macht frei ! ! ! " the first claim means " good luck with the smoking ban " in danish , while the german slogan " health sets you free " is an obvious allusion to the nazi slogan " arbeit macht frei , " or " work sets you free , " which was placed at the entrances to a number of nazi concentration camps , such as auschwitz and dachau . " the people who introduced the smoking ban are health fascists , " larsen has been quoted as saying . he said the reference to the third reich is a valid one , because the nazis introduced a nationwide tobacco ban as part of their quest for bodily and racial purity . " hitler was the first to ban smoking , " said the one-time eurovision song contest hopeful . cause celebre bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kim larsen : too stupid to be taken seriously ?
larsen allegedly is n't the only celebrity to have donated to the " himmelbla " fund behind the campaign , whose ads are now splurged across copenhagen 's billboards . " this is not about a defense of smoking , " larsen has said .
" this is about a defense of democracy and freedom . " the country 's jewish community , for its part , is choosing to see the campaign in this context - merely a clumsy protest against government interference with individual freedoms . " it 's stupid , plain stupid , " stefan isaak , president of the danish jewish community , told dw-world.de.
" i do n't connect it with any kind of anti-semitism - it 's just plain stupidity . " explaining why larsen 's posters have gone largely ignored , he pointed out that denmark has few holocaust survivors , because most of the country 's jews left for sweden during world war ii . " feelings might be hurt , " he said .
" but the whole slogan is so idiotic ; you ca n't begin to connect it to auschwitz . " bad taste bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smokers : social pariahs arne rolighed of denmark 's leading cancer research charity is taking more offense . " it 's extremely tasteless , " he was quoted as saying in danish daily politiken . it 's not the first time this kind of parallel has been drawn .
in germany - where nazi allusions are not shrugged off as lightly as they are in denmark - one protester launched a line of t-shirts earlier this year bearing a yellow star of david along with the word " smoker . " the shirt was quickly withdrawn from the market after jewish groups objected to comparing the perceived persecution of smokers to that of the jews under the nazis . isaak is more circumspect . " the less said about -lsb- larsen 's campaign -rsb- , the better , " he said . jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw takes a look at the man behind the baton . masur has been a leading conductor for over four decades .
deep in concentration but in constant eye contact with the musicians while on stage , he has a way of drawing the music out of his orchestra with spare but energetic gestures . intensity , passion and energy exude from the 81-year-old when he takes up his baton . born in 1927 in silesia , now part of poland , masur studied music and conducting in leipzig but did n't finish to receive his diploma .
nevertheless , he gathered extensive experience on the stages of the former east germany , conducting and working as a vocal coach in halle , erfurt , schwerin and at the comic opera in east berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw offers live recordings of masur conducting beethoven in 1967 , at the age of 40 , masur became director of the dresden philharmonic orchestra .
three years later he returned to leipzig , which would become the most significant station in his career . spokesman for democracy as the music director of the gewandhaus orchestra in leipzig , masur quickly became one of the most celebrated conductors in east germany .
he led the ensemble on numerous tours , performing in over 900 concerts between 1970 and 1997 . as the soviet union began to crumble in the late 1980s , leipzig became a center of political protest in communist east germany .
masur made his voice heard as well , joining in the famous monday demonstrations . " our common concerns and responsibility have brought us together today , " the conductor said in front of the nikolaikirche in leipzig on a monday in 1989 . " we are affected by the developments in our city and are looking for a solution , " said masur , addressing the government .
" we urgently ask you to be prudent , so that peaceful dialogue is possible . " music for lonely people in 1991 , masur left his newly reunified country to direct the new york philharmonic , succeeding zubin mehta .
over the next 11 years , he developed a special program structure that not only appealed to new yorkers , but went over well across the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new york is full of lonely people , concluded masur he said he discovered his secret while taking a walk in the big apple . " i found out that new york is actually full of lonely people , and i decided to make my programs so that everyone who came to the concert would feel at home , " he said . masur has since moved his workplace from the hudson river to the seine - with a layover on the thames as principal conductor of the london philharmonic orchestra from 2000 to 2007 - and now directs the orchestre national de france .
thoughts of retirement seem to be far from his mind . " i hope that i can cut back slowly , " he said .
" if i stop tomorrow , you 'll certainly be reading my obituary pretty soon because music is part of my life . " klaus gehrke -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the country 's modest jewish community is refusing to take offense . as frontman of gasolin ' , a seminal rock band which enjoyed its heyday in the 1970s , kim larsen has always been one of the bad boys of danish rock .
and like any self-respecting hellraiser , he 's vociferously anti-establishment . in the best rock ' n ' roll tradition , he 's also a die-hard smoker .
so it comes as no surprise that he does n't like the eu 's anti-smoking laws introduced in denmark one year ago , which ban smoking in public bars and restaurants . health fascists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who reads billboards anyway ?
not the type who likes being told what to do , larsen recently helped fund an advertising campaign revolving around the slogan " tillykke med rygeforbudet - gesundheit macht frei ! ! ! " the first claim means " good luck with the smoking ban " in danish , while the german slogan " health sets you free " is an obvious allusion to the nazi slogan " arbeit macht frei , " or " work sets you free , " which was placed at the entrances to a number of nazi concentration camps , such as auschwitz and dachau . " the people who introduced the smoking ban are health fascists , " larsen has been quoted as saying . he said the reference to the third reich is a valid one , because the nazis introduced a nationwide tobacco ban as part of their quest for bodily and racial purity .

larsen allegedly is n't the only celebrity to have donated to the " himmelbla " fund behind the campaign , whose ads are now splurged across copenhagen 's billboards . " this is not about a defense of smoking , " larsen has said .
" this is about a defense of democracy and freedom . " the country 's jewish community , for its part , is choosing to see the campaign in this context - merely a clumsy protest against government interference with individual freedoms . " it 's stupid , plain stupid , " stefan isaak , president of the danish jewish community , told dw-world.de.
" i do n't connect it with any kind of anti-semitism - it 's just plain stupidity . " explaining why larsen 's posters have gone largely ignored , he pointed out that denmark has few holocaust survivors , because most of the country 's jews left for sweden during world war ii . " feelings might be hurt , " he said .
" but the whole slogan is so idiotic ; you ca n't begin to connect it to auschwitz . " bad taste bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smokers : social pariahs arne rolighed of denmark 's leading cancer research charity is taking more offense .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 26.08.2008 danish rockstar uses nazi slogan to protest smoking ban großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking bans are the creations of " health fascists , " larson has said a pro-smoking campaign launched in denmark by one of the country 's best-known rockstars features a notorious nazi slogan .
the country 's modest jewish community is refusing to take offense . as frontman of gasolin ' , a seminal rock band which enjoyed its heyday in the 1970s , kim larsen has always been one of the bad boys of danish rock .
and like any self-respecting hellraiser , he 's vociferously anti-establishment . in the best rock ' n ' roll tradition , he 's also a die-hard smoker .
so it comes as no surprise that he does n't like the eu 's anti-smoking laws introduced in denmark one year ago , which ban smoking in public bars and restaurants . health fascists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who reads billboards anyway ?
not the type who likes being told what to do , larsen recently helped fund an advertising campaign revolving around the slogan " tillykke med rygeforbudet - gesundheit macht frei ! ! ! " the first claim means " good luck with the smoking ban " in danish , while the german slogan " health sets you free " is an obvious allusion to the nazi slogan " arbeit macht frei , " or " work sets you free , " which was placed at the entrances to a number of nazi concentration camps , such as auschwitz and dachau . " the people who introduced the smoking ban are health fascists , " larsen has been quoted as saying . he said the reference to the third reich is a valid one , because the nazis introduced a nationwide tobacco ban as part of their quest for bodily and racial purity . " hitler was the first to ban smoking , " said the one-time eurovision song contest hopeful . cause celebre bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kim larsen : too stupid to be taken seriously ?
larsen allegedly is n't the only celebrity to have donated to the " himmelbla " fund behind the campaign , whose ads are now splurged across copenhagen 's billboards . " this is not about a defense of smoking , " larsen has said .
" this is about a defense of democracy and freedom . " the country 's jewish community , for its part , is choosing to see the campaign in this context - merely a clumsy protest against government interference with individual freedoms . " it 's stupid , plain stupid , " stefan isaak , president of the danish jewish community , told dw-world.de.
" i do n't connect it with any kind of anti-semitism - it 's just plain stupidity . " explaining why larsen 's posters have gone largely ignored , he pointed out that denmark has few holocaust survivors , because most of the country 's jews left for sweden during world war ii . " feelings might be hurt , " he said .
" but the whole slogan is so idiotic ; you ca n't begin to connect it to auschwitz . " bad taste bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smokers : social pariahs arne rolighed of denmark 's leading cancer research charity is taking more offense . " it 's extremely tasteless , " he was quoted as saying in danish daily politiken . it 's not the first time this kind of parallel has been drawn .
in germany - where nazi allusions are not shrugged off as lightly as they are in denmark - one protester launched a line of t-shirts earlier this year bearing a yellow star of david along with the word " smoker . " the shirt was quickly withdrawn from the market after jewish groups objected to comparing the perceived persecution of smokers to that of the jews under the nazis . isaak is more circumspect . " the less said about -lsb- larsen 's campaign -rsb- , the better , " he said . jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

26 , by the environmental group transport and environment -lrb- t & e -rrb- . the munich-based carmaker will have to cut carbon dioxide emissions by another 19 percent by 2012 if it is to meet the european union 's target . under laws proposed by the eu 's executive , the european commission , and currently under debate , every car manufacturer which sells large numbers of vehicles in europe should be given a target for the average amount of co2 its new cars emit from 2012 .
the proposed targets are calculated according to the average weight of cars each firm sells . bad grade for german cars despite the munich manufacturer 's relative progress , t & e said that , overall , german cars - including those made by bmw , daimler and volkswagen - emitted 10 grams of carbon dioxide more than the eu average . french car manufacturers are the closest to hitting proposed european union targets for reducing their co2 emissions , said the brussels-based environmental group , while japanese makers are the furthest away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peugeot is close to the target , but moving forward slowly according to t & e 's study , based on official eu data , the peugeot-citroen group is closest to its target , needing to reduce average new car emissions by 10 percent in the next five years . at the other end of the spectrum , suzuki faces making cuts of a hefty 25 percent in its average car emissions , daimler and mazda will have to make 24-percent cuts and nissan will have to cut by 22 percent , the study said . " it is striking that three of the bottom four carmakers are japanese ...
all three did not close the gap sufficiently in 2007 and will have to speed up their efforts , " it said . heavy cars to blame while french carmakers are closer to their targets , they are making relatively slow progress : peugeot-citroen cut emissions by 0.9 percent in 2007 , while renault managed just 0.5 percent , meaning that both groups will have to step up their efforts in order to hit the target . t & e blamed the rising weight of cars for the small cuts made to emissions .

with this move , russia is not only ignoring all the warnings of western governments handed out over the past few days , but is also in violation of international law by disregarding the sovereign borders of its european neighbor , georgia . of course , the russian president considers himself to be in the right , since the georgian government tried to remove the separatists ' regimes from georgian territory using force , but the kremlin is alone in this view . through this decision , russia has resorted to dangerous self isolation .

the proposed targets are calculated according to the average weight of cars each firm sells . bad grade for german cars despite the munich manufacturer 's relative progress , t & e said that , overall , german cars - including those made by bmw , daimler and volkswagen - emitted 10 grams of carbon dioxide more than the eu average . french car manufacturers are the closest to hitting proposed european union targets for reducing their co2 emissions , said the brussels-based environmental group , while japanese makers are the furthest away . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peugeot is close to the target , but moving forward slowly according to t & e 's study , based on official eu data , the peugeot-citroen group is closest to its target , needing to reduce average new car emissions by 10 percent in the next five years . at the other end of the spectrum , suzuki faces making cuts of a hefty 25 percent in its average car emissions , daimler and mazda will have to make 24-percent cuts and nissan will have to cut by 22 percent , the study said . " it is striking that three of the bottom four carmakers are japanese ...
all three did not close the gap sufficiently in 2007 and will have to speed up their efforts , " it said . heavy cars to blame while french carmakers are closer to their targets , they are making relatively slow progress : peugeot-citroen cut emissions by 0.9 percent in 2007 , while renault managed just 0.5 percent , meaning that both groups will have to step up their efforts in order to hit the target . t & e blamed the rising weight of cars for the small cuts made to emissions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de georgia -pipe- 26.08.2008 analysis : opening a pandora 's box in the caucasus großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the region has been thrown into disarray the caucasus conflict was brought about at least in part by the west 's decision to recognize kosovo 's independence 6 months ago .
experts say this sparked a chain reaction in the region , which only moscow can now halt . when the west recognized kosovo 's independence half a year ago , russia 's leaders warned that the move would open a " pandora 's box " in the caucasus .
the mountainous region 's patchwork of ethnicities and states have long been difficult to reconcile into coherent nation states .
the recent , bloody 10-day war between russia and georgia over the former soviet states ' rebel region of south ossetia is the realization of that pandora 's box scenario .
the background russia has long supported georgia 's two ethnically separatist provinces of abkhazia and south ossetia , but stopped short of recognizing their independence - until now - fearing that secessions in those provinces would provide a dangerous precedent for other minority nations within the russian federation .
nevertheless , russian lawmakers this week unanimously passed a motion urging president dmitry medvedev to recognize georgia 's rebel regions as independent - 15 years after they won de facto autonomy in a war of succession from tbilisi in the early 1990s .
by some counts , over 80 percent of the populations in the regions have been issued russian passports under an especially generous russian policy that saakashvili decried as the creeping annexation of georgian territory .
the kosovo precedent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's independence set a dangerous precedence as russian tanks rolled into south ossetia on aug .
8 to push back georgia 's offensive to re-assert control , medvedev took the national stage , invoking the army in defense of russian citizens .
in a series of interviews by dpa news agency after kosovo 's independence in february , russian analysts foresaw a military flare up , but did not predict the possibility that moscow 's policy could turn to recognizing the regions .
the threat that kosovo could stand as a secessionist precedent in the caucasus had formed the kremlin 's most vivid protest to the province 's break from its ally serbia .
but while moscow is still confronted by the problems that the kosovo precedent raises , paradoxically , the comparison has now been turned into a justification of south ossetia and abkhazia 's right to self-determination .
western leaders have labeled russia 's move to recognize georgia 's regions as hypocrisy , while russian leaders hit back with the accusation that a double standard has been applied in the case of kosovo .
the resolution passed on monday argued that by its assault on civilians tbilisi had forgone all moral right over the area , drawing a direct link between russia incursion and the justification of nato 's bombing campaign in serbia in 1998 .
appealing before russian lawmakers south ossetia 's president eduard kokoity repeated what has become a maxim : " we have more political-legal grounds than kosovo does to have our independence recognized . "
but professor yury kolosov of the moscow institute of international relations threw cold water on the much-cited " kosovo precedent . "
" there is no such thing as a ' precedent ' in international law ... and , if this is a precedent , then it 's a bad one , " kolosov , an eminent member of russia 's association of international law , told dpa .
the final say in other words , the kremlin has the last word .
while the threat of recognizing the breakaway region adds to its bargaining power with the west , analysts said it would look for ways to delay such recognition , for example , by requesting the provinces hold a new referendum .
" it seems to me that now politically it would be more favorable to leave this situation hanging , " moscow-based analyst vyacheslav nikonov , head of the politika foundation , told news agency interfax on monday .
the kremlin and its allies , meanwhile , are n't deaf to its own warnings that seizing on kosovo as a precedent could spark a " chain reaction " in the region .
legal limbo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president dmitry medvedev - the ball is in his court medvedev sought to reassure the molodovan and azeri presidents - who have similar secession worries to georgia - on monday over the respective breakaway regions of nagorno karabakh and transnistria .
south ossetia 's ultimate ambition to unite with russia 's ethnically-similar region of north ossetia is no less problematic .
russia 's ties to abkhazia , which seeks only self-determination , have traditionally been stronger , as has its economic interest in the region .
a poll by the independent levada center in the aftermath of the conflict show near half of russians - or 46 percent - say south ossetia should become part of russia .
only 4 percent of those surveyed in interviews with 2,100 adults believed the province should remain part of georgia .
but whatever the populations of the caucasus think , with the fate of both provinces of intimate interest to moscow and beyond , the situation is likely to remain - for now - in legal limbo . dpa news agency -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de georgia -pipe- 26.08.2008 analysis : opening a pandora 's box in the caucasus großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the region has been thrown into disarray the caucasus conflict was brought about at least in part by the west 's decision to recognize kosovo 's independence 6 months ago .
experts say this sparked a chain reaction in the region , which only moscow can now halt . when the west recognized kosovo 's independence half a year ago , russia 's leaders warned that the move would open a " pandora 's box " in the caucasus .
the mountainous region 's patchwork of ethnicities and states have long been difficult to reconcile into coherent nation states .
the recent , bloody 10-day war between russia and georgia over the former soviet states ' rebel region of south ossetia is the realization of that pandora 's box scenario .
the background russia has long supported georgia 's two ethnically separatist provinces of abkhazia and south ossetia , but stopped short of recognizing their independence - until now - fearing that secessions in those provinces would provide a dangerous precedent for other minority nations within the russian federation .

in a series of interviews by dpa news agency after kosovo 's independence in february , russian analysts foresaw a military flare up , but did not predict the possibility that moscow 's policy could turn to recognizing the regions .
the threat that kosovo could stand as a secessionist precedent in the caucasus had formed the kremlin 's most vivid protest to the province 's break from its ally serbia .

while the threat of recognizing the breakaway region adds to its bargaining power with the west , analysts said it would look for ways to delay such recognition , for example , by requesting the provinces hold a new referendum .

experts say this sparked a chain reaction in the region , which only moscow can now halt . when the west recognized kosovo 's independence half a year ago , russia 's leaders warned that the move would open a " pandora 's box " in the caucasus .
the mountainous region 's patchwork of ethnicities and states have long been difficult to reconcile into coherent nation states .
the recent , bloody 10-day war between russia and georgia over the former soviet states ' rebel region of south ossetia is the realization of that pandora 's box scenario .
the background russia has long supported georgia 's two ethnically separatist provinces of abkhazia and south ossetia , but stopped short of recognizing their independence - until now - fearing that secessions in those provinces would provide a dangerous precedent for other minority nations within the russian federation .
nevertheless , russian lawmakers this week unanimously passed a motion urging president dmitry medvedev to recognize georgia 's rebel regions as independent - 15 years after they won de facto autonomy in a war of succession from tbilisi in the early 1990s .
by some counts , over 80 percent of the populations in the regions have been issued russian passports under an especially generous russian policy that saakashvili decried as the creeping annexation of georgian territory .

" it is not an easy choice , but it is the only way to protect the lives of civilians , " the president said after meeting with russia 's security chiefs . medvedev signed a second decree tuesday instructing the russian foreign ministry to establish diplomatic relations with abkhazia and south ossetia and sign partnership agreements with them . ties ice over bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : resident of gori , south ossetia , received aid after their city was devastated the move is likely to deepen the wedge in russia 's relations with the west , which views south ossetia and abkhazia as part of georgia .
russian stocks fell tuesday , with traders anticipating an increase in international tension . the world now faces new rifts , former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev was quoted as saying by itar-tass news agency tuesday . " the risk of a new schism has arisen .
there is a growing threat of global chaos , " gorbachev was quoted as saying in reaction to the crisis . german chancellor angela merkel sharply criticized the decision tuesday .
speaking on a visit to the estonian capital of tallinn , merkel said medvedev 's decision was " absolutely not acceptable " and ran " contrary to international law . " " we must by consequence react united as the european union , " merkel said . she also stressed support for stronger relations between the eu and georgia , including making it easier for georgians to obtain visas to the bloc . " georgia and ukraine will be members of nato , " the chancellor said .
russia has sharply opposed nato 's eastward expansion , and both countries ' bids were turned down by alliance leaders earlier this year .
the matter is to be reconsidered at a summit in december . merkel said , however , that dialogue between nato and russia should continue . nato secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer also rejected medvedev 's decision to recognize the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia .
he questioned whether russia was truly interested in peace and security in the caucasus region , according to a statement . " this is in direct violation of numerous un security council resolutions regarding georgia 's territorial integrity , resolutions that russia itself has endorsed , " de hoop scheffer said in a statement read out by his spokeswoman . on the eve of something bigger france , which brokered the cease-fire agreement between russia and georgia , also criticized the kremlin 's decision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the georgian offensive was compared to the murder that set off world war i " we consider this a regrettable decision and i recall our attachment to the territorial integrity of georgia , " said a spokesman for the french foreign ministry . just prior to medvedev 's announcement , the european union had expressed its opposition to recognizing the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia . russia 's nato envoy , dmitry rogozin , compared the current situation to europe in 1914 on the eve of world war i , " when , because of one terrorist , leading world powers clashed , " he told the rbk daily business newspaper .
war broke out after austro-hungarian archduke franz ferdinand was assassinated in august 1914 . but russian foreign minister sergey lavrov said russia is unlikely to be subjected to international isolation . " i do n't think we should really be afraid of isolation , " he told reporters in english .
" i do n't believe this should really be a doomsday scenario .
i believe common sense should prevail . " accusations of genocide in his statement issued tuesday , medvedev condemned georgia 's offensive to reclaim south ossetia earlier this month . " on the night of august 8th , tbilisi had a choice : -lrb- georgian president -rrb- saakashvili opted for genocide , " said the russian president .
" with this choice saakashvili wiped out all hope of a peaceful coexistence of south ossetia and abkhazia under one government . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west has largely opposed recognizing the provinces russia and georgia fought a brief but bloody war over south ossetia with russia 's army moving deep into georgia after repelling the georgian offensive . on tuesday the kremlin convened the security council at the president 's black sea residence in sochi to review a plea by russia 's parliament for recognition of the two georgian breakaway regions .
russia 's powerful prime minister vladimir putin was also in attendance . the united states , a staunch ally of georgia , rebuked russia 's parliament over the resolution monday , saying it was " deeply concerned .

"
the play on words reflects the turbulent history of the ninth symphony : its repeated exploitation by powerful figures , as well as its withstanding power to move people .
deutsche welle : ms schmiel , how did you choose the motto " macht.musik " ?
ilona schmiel : the ninth symphony was of course the impetus to ask how this work can be used to represent a whole program .
and that was the reason to hold the festival under the motto " macht.musik " and to follow the path of the ninth symphony from its premiere in 1824 to today .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ilona schmiel has directed the beethovenfest since 2004 beethoven 's political commitment , this utopia - the " ode to joy " by friedrich schiller , which he set to music , is a utopia - has n't lost any of its relevance .
we are still living in an age of war , suppression , hunger and many other injustices .
back in his time - the work was completed in 1824 - beethoven probably thought things would improve .
and that alone is a reason the ninth symphony can be made a focal point .
the question of how the reception of this piece continues in 2008 has always moved me because , as far as i know , there is no other work in the world that is played so often and deliberately chosen for so many different occasions .
the piece has not only been a part of triumphs , but also of many mistakes that have been made by governments , rulers and leaders , where the symphony was totally appropriated by politics and exploited for political purposes and dictatorial statements .
relatively speaking , beethoven had a lot of contact with the powerful figures of his time , and if you look back on his work - for example the " eroica , " " wellington 's victory " or " egmont " - he often expressed himself politically through his music .
but he did so quite differently in each case .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt masur will conduct the ninth at this year 's festival the issue of how he surrounded himself with powerful figures , but at the same time also left them hanging , was a central theme in his life , i think .
and it begs the question of where beethoven 's development through the symphonies leads - past a rejection of the powers that be , to a civil society .
on the one hand it is really a path beyond the worship of powerful figures - such as napoleon - but , on the other hand , he is using the civil society , which finances the music and supports the composer .
that 's is why i think this music is still so relevant and moving today .
questions about how to deal with works of music today , how music is used , what demands are placed on it , how much it needs to align with the state to be performed on certain occasions , and how music is twisted or the text is rewritten , for example , so that it fits a particular regime - the ninth symphony has already been through all of that .
who else then has used beethoven 's music to serve their own ends ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ninth symphony has echoed both east and west goebbels always had the ninth symphony played for hitler 's birthday .
the gdr -lrb- communist east germany -rrb- chose it as their national anthem , albeit with a different text .
it has been played constantly both in the east and the west .
it has become the european anthem , and since the olympic games it has also been mentioned that mao used the symphony to motivate workers in the fields .
kamikaze pilots listened to this music - i 'm jumping through time a bit - and it was also the national anthem of rhodesia .
i think no other work has ever been so globalized .
nevertheless this human message , this commitment to human kindness has survived - and you could almost say this message is indestructible .
how would you judge beethoven 's music today ?
what is the situation with " power " and " music " ?
for me personally , the power of music is at the forefront because i 'd like to keep believing in the utopia that music can change a lot .
in 2006 , we had a guest youth orchestra from south africa , where musicians with different backgrounds performed together , for example .
music can also be a social instrument .
and this power ca n't be burned onto a cd .

dw takes a look at the man behind the baton . masur has been a leading conductor for over four decades .
deep in concentration but in constant eye contact with the musicians while on stage , he has a way of drawing the music out of his orchestra with spare but energetic gestures . intensity , passion and energy exude from the 81-year-old when he takes up his baton . born in 1927 in silesia , now part of poland , masur studied music and conducting in leipzig but did n't finish to receive his diploma .
nevertheless , he gathered extensive experience on the stages of the former east germany , conducting and working as a vocal coach in halle , erfurt , schwerin and at the comic opera in east berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw offers live recordings of masur conducting beethoven in 1967 , at the age of 40 , masur became director of the dresden philharmonic orchestra .
three years later he returned to leipzig , which would become the most significant station in his career . spokesman for democracy as the music director of the gewandhaus orchestra in leipzig , masur quickly became one of the most celebrated conductors in east germany .
he led the ensemble on numerous tours , performing in over 900 concerts between 1970 and 1997 . as the soviet union began to crumble in the late 1980s , leipzig became a center of political protest in communist east germany .
masur made his voice heard as well , joining in the famous monday demonstrations . " our common concerns and responsibility have brought us together today , " the conductor said in front of the nikolaikirche in leipzig on a monday in 1989 . " we are affected by the developments in our city and are looking for a solution , " said masur , addressing the government .
" we urgently ask you to be prudent , so that peaceful dialogue is possible . " music for lonely people in 1991 , masur left his newly reunified country to direct the new york philharmonic , succeeding zubin mehta .
over the next 11 years , he developed a special program structure that not only appealed to new yorkers , but went over well across the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new york is full of lonely people , concluded masur he said he discovered his secret while taking a walk in the big apple . " i found out that new york is actually full of lonely people , and i decided to make my programs so that everyone who came to the concert would feel at home , " he said . masur has since moved his workplace from the hudson river to the seine - with a layover on the thames as principal conductor of the london philharmonic orchestra from 2000 to 2007 - and now directs the orchestre national de france .
thoughts of retirement seem to be far from his mind . " i hope that i can cut back slowly , " he said .

warsaw , in particular , wants the eu to take a hard line in eu-russia relations . by announcing the eu summit in brussels next monday , sept .
1 , sarkozy wants to say clearly to moscow that the european union is " a force which has to dealt with , " and that agreements made with him by russian president dmitry medvedev must be honored , a french diplomat told the afp news agency on monday , aug .
25 . the six-point peace plan brokered by sarkozy , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , has been criticized in some european capitals as being too vague , too moscow-friendly and organized with too little consultation . after russia failed to withdraw all its troops from georgia , a key point of the cease-fire , the french president " realized that the russians were exploiting the ambiguous margins of the text and that there was a risk of a loss of credibility for the eu and the french presidency , " european policy center analyst antonio missiroli told afp . but it wo n't be easy , at the hastily-arranged summit which sarkozy announced sunday , to obtain european consensus on the future of relations with russia , he added . polish objections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tusk has led europe 's pro-georgian camp poland , as well as other eastern european nations that fell under the former soviet union 's direct sphere of influence , wants to convince the 27-member eu not to cut moscow any special deals after its military intervention in georgia this month . " i spoke with -lrb- germany 's -rrb- chancellor merkel this morning to make the european position uniform , harder and categorical concerning russia in the context of the crisis in the caucasus , " premier donald tusk told reporters . the differences among eu nations on how to handle russia were already highlighted earlier this month .
pro-georgia leaders of poland , estonia , lithuania and latvia traveled to tbilisi with the message that the french-brokered peace plan did not provide sufficient protection for georgia . meanwhile , france , germany , italy and spain lead the faction of eu member who do not want to see relations with moscow completely frozen due to russia 's importance as a trading partner and its international role as a veto-power at the united nations security council . chance for change ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is a key energy supplier to the european union but tusk said he would not rule out the possibility of some nations that want to keep communication with russia open could be convinced to change their tact at the summit . " i spoke with president sarkozy a few days ago and he did not hide that russia 's behavior is beginning to be irritating to a certain degree and will require the eu to make firm decisions , " tusk said . it was only last month that talks on a new strategic accord between russia and the eu got properly under way after being long-blocked by polish and lithuanian objections .
that , analysts say , is why there is a lot at stake as far as europe-russia relations are concerned .

" in the current crisis it became necessary to make a decision , " medvedev said in a nationally televised statement tuesday , aug .
26 .
" taking into consideration the will of the people and guided by the un charter of 1970 ... and other basic international law , i have signed a decree recognizing abkhazia and south ossetia . " it is not an easy choice , but it is the only way to protect the lives of civilians , " the president said after meeting with russia 's security chiefs . medvedev signed a second decree tuesday instructing the russian foreign ministry to establish diplomatic relations with abkhazia and south ossetia and sign partnership agreements with them . ties ice over bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : resident of gori , south ossetia , received aid after their city was devastated the move is likely to deepen the wedge in russia 's relations with the west , which views south ossetia and abkhazia as part of georgia .
russian stocks fell tuesday , with traders anticipating an increase in international tension . the world now faces new rifts , former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev was quoted as saying by itar-tass news agency tuesday . " the risk of a new schism has arisen .
there is a growing threat of global chaos , " gorbachev was quoted as saying in reaction to the crisis . german chancellor angela merkel sharply criticized the decision tuesday .
speaking on a visit to the estonian capital of tallinn , merkel said medvedev 's decision was " absolutely not acceptable " and ran " contrary to international law . " " we must by consequence react united as the european union , " merkel said . she also stressed support for stronger relations between the eu and georgia , including making it easier for georgians to obtain visas to the bloc . " georgia and ukraine will be members of nato , " the chancellor said .
russia has sharply opposed nato 's eastward expansion , and both countries ' bids were turned down by alliance leaders earlier this year .
the matter is to be reconsidered at a summit in december . merkel said , however , that dialogue between nato and russia should continue . nato secretary-general jaap de hoop scheffer also rejected medvedev 's decision to recognize the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia .
he questioned whether russia was truly interested in peace and security in the caucasus region , according to a statement . " this is in direct violation of numerous un security council resolutions regarding georgia 's territorial integrity , resolutions that russia itself has endorsed , " de hoop scheffer said in a statement read out by his spokeswoman . on the eve of something bigger france , which brokered the cease-fire agreement between russia and georgia , also criticized the kremlin 's decision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the georgian offensive was compared to the murder that set off world war i " we consider this a regrettable decision and i recall our attachment to the territorial integrity of georgia , " said a spokesman for the french foreign ministry . just prior to medvedev 's announcement , the european union had expressed its opposition to recognizing the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia . russia 's nato envoy , dmitry rogozin , compared the current situation to europe in 1914 on the eve of world war i , " when , because of one terrorist , leading world powers clashed , " he told the rbk daily business newspaper .
war broke out after austro-hungarian archduke franz ferdinand was assassinated in august 1914 . but russian foreign minister sergey lavrov said russia is unlikely to be subjected to international isolation . " i do n't think we should really be afraid of isolation , " he told reporters in english .
" i do n't believe this should really be a doomsday scenario .
i believe common sense should prevail . " accusations of genocide in his statement issued tuesday , medvedev condemned georgia 's offensive to reclaim south ossetia earlier this month . " on the night of august 8th , tbilisi had a choice : -lrb- georgian president -rrb- saakashvili opted for genocide , " said the russian president .
" with this choice saakashvili wiped out all hope of a peaceful coexistence of south ossetia and abkhazia under one government . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west has largely opposed recognizing the provinces russia and georgia fought a brief but bloody war over south ossetia with russia 's army moving deep into georgia after repelling the georgian offensive . on tuesday the kremlin convened the security council at the president 's black sea residence in sochi to review a plea by russia 's parliament for recognition of the two georgian breakaway regions .
russia 's powerful prime minister vladimir putin was also in attendance . the united states , a staunch ally of georgia , rebuked russia 's parliament over the resolution monday , saying it was " deeply concerned .

with this move , russia is not only ignoring all the warnings of western governments handed out over the past few days , but is also in violation of international law by disregarding the sovereign borders of its european neighbor , georgia . of course , the russian president considers himself to be in the right , since the georgian government tried to remove the separatists ' regimes from georgian territory using force , but the kremlin is alone in this view . through this decision , russia has resorted to dangerous self isolation .
the recognition of south ossetia and abkhazia will certainly cause considerable damage to the relationship between russia and the west . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ingo mannteufel the kremlin is delusional if it assumes that the west will simply be pacified after a short while .
russia has , without a doubt , the potential to cause considerable damage to western interests : in relation to afghanistan , the iranian nuclear problem , as well as the energy supply .
but that also applies to the west . now the danger exists that both sides can come up with more problems for the other .
the west could react by allowing georgia or the ukraine to join nato , or by blocking russia ’ s wto membership .
russia could stop supporting the west in afghanistan , or could form an international gas cartel .
the ammunition on both sides is considerable . what is unfortunate is that no one is being helped by the heightening of the dispute - neither russia nor the west .
even south ossetia and abkhazia wo n't get anything through the recognition of their independence by russia , since it 's only valid in moscow . it , however , can not be assumed that nato and the eu nations will simply stop their daily dealings with russia .
all of the western governments have already made that clear in their warnings over the past few days .
western nations will find asymmetrical answers to russia acting alone and defying international principles .
here russia has clearly underestimated how much control western nations have over russian interests . at first glance the georgian conflict was rather insignificant from an american and european perspective .
however , this recent russian action will surely lead to nato and the eu consolidating and unifying their russia policies .
russia 's critics will be there to take it all in , and advocates of a moderate course will be silenced .
that is clearly visible from the reactions of both german chancellor angela merkel and foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier .
germany has long belonged to the eu nations which have been firm in their cooperation with russia .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 26.08.2008 danish rockstar uses nazi slogan to protest smoking ban großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking bans are the creations of " health fascists , " larson has said a pro-smoking campaign launched in denmark by one of the country 's best-known rockstars features a notorious nazi slogan .
the country 's modest jewish community is refusing to take offense . as frontman of gasolin ' , a seminal rock band which enjoyed its heyday in the 1970s , kim larsen has always been one of the bad boys of danish rock .
and like any self-respecting hellraiser , he 's vociferously anti-establishment . in the best rock ' n ' roll tradition , he 's also a die-hard smoker .
so it comes as no surprise that he does n't like the eu 's anti-smoking laws introduced in denmark one year ago , which ban smoking in public bars and restaurants . health fascists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who reads billboards anyway ?
not the type who likes being told what to do , larsen recently helped fund an advertising campaign revolving around the slogan " tillykke med rygeforbudet - gesundheit macht frei ! ! ! " the first claim means " good luck with the smoking ban " in danish , while the german slogan " health sets you free " is an obvious allusion to the nazi slogan " arbeit macht frei , " or " work sets you free , " which was placed at the entrances to a number of nazi concentration camps , such as auschwitz and dachau . " the people who introduced the smoking ban are health fascists , " larsen has been quoted as saying . he said the reference to the third reich is a valid one , because the nazis introduced a nationwide tobacco ban as part of their quest for bodily and racial purity . " hitler was the first to ban smoking , " said the one-time eurovision song contest hopeful . cause celebre bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kim larsen : too stupid to be taken seriously ?
larsen allegedly is n't the only celebrity to have donated to the " himmelbla " fund behind the campaign , whose ads are now splurged across copenhagen 's billboards . " this is not about a defense of smoking , " larsen has said .
" this is about a defense of democracy and freedom . " the country 's jewish community , for its part , is choosing to see the campaign in this context - merely a clumsy protest against government interference with individual freedoms . " it 's stupid , plain stupid , " stefan isaak , president of the danish jewish community , told dw-world.de.
" i do n't connect it with any kind of anti-semitism - it 's just plain stupidity . " explaining why larsen 's posters have gone largely ignored , he pointed out that denmark has few holocaust survivors , because most of the country 's jews left for sweden during world war ii . " feelings might be hurt , " he said .
" but the whole slogan is so idiotic ; you ca n't begin to connect it to auschwitz . " bad taste bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smokers : social pariahs arne rolighed of denmark 's leading cancer research charity is taking more offense . " it 's extremely tasteless , " he was quoted as saying in danish daily politiken . it 's not the first time this kind of parallel has been drawn .
in germany - where nazi allusions are not shrugged off as lightly as they are in denmark - one protester launched a line of t-shirts earlier this year bearing a yellow star of david along with the word " smoker . " the shirt was quickly withdrawn from the market after jewish groups objected to comparing the perceived persecution of smokers to that of the jews under the nazis . isaak is more circumspect . " the less said about -lsb- larsen 's campaign -rsb- , the better , " he said . jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
the play on words reflects the turbulent history of the ninth symphony : its repeated exploitation by powerful figures , as well as its withstanding power to move people .
deutsche welle : ms schmiel , how did you choose the motto " macht.musik " ?
ilona schmiel : the ninth symphony was of course the impetus to ask how this work can be used to represent a whole program .
and that was the reason to hold the festival under the motto " macht.musik " and to follow the path of the ninth symphony from its premiere in 1824 to today .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ilona schmiel has directed the beethovenfest since 2004 beethoven 's political commitment , this utopia - the " ode to joy " by friedrich schiller , which he set to music , is a utopia - has n't lost any of its relevance .
we are still living in an age of war , suppression , hunger and many other injustices .
back in his time - the work was completed in 1824 - beethoven probably thought things would improve .
and that alone is a reason the ninth symphony can be made a focal point .
the question of how the reception of this piece continues in 2008 has always moved me because , as far as i know , there is no other work in the world that is played so often and deliberately chosen for so many different occasions .
the piece has not only been a part of triumphs , but also of many mistakes that have been made by governments , rulers and leaders , where the symphony was totally appropriated by politics and exploited for political purposes and dictatorial statements .
relatively speaking , beethoven had a lot of contact with the powerful figures of his time , and if you look back on his work - for example the " eroica , " " wellington 's victory " or " egmont " - he often expressed himself politically through his music .
but he did so quite differently in each case .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt masur will conduct the ninth at this year 's festival the issue of how he surrounded himself with powerful figures , but at the same time also left them hanging , was a central theme in his life , i think .
and it begs the question of where beethoven 's development through the symphonies leads - past a rejection of the powers that be , to a civil society .
on the one hand it is really a path beyond the worship of powerful figures - such as napoleon - but , on the other hand , he is using the civil society , which finances the music and supports the composer .
that 's is why i think this music is still so relevant and moving today .
questions about how to deal with works of music today , how music is used , what demands are placed on it , how much it needs to align with the state to be performed on certain occasions , and how music is twisted or the text is rewritten , for example , so that it fits a particular regime - the ninth symphony has already been through all of that .
who else then has used beethoven 's music to serve their own ends ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ninth symphony has echoed both east and west goebbels always had the ninth symphony played for hitler 's birthday .
the gdr -lrb- communist east germany -rrb- chose it as their national anthem , albeit with a different text .
it has been played constantly both in the east and the west .
it has become the european anthem , and since the olympic games it has also been mentioned that mao used the symphony to motivate workers in the fields .
kamikaze pilots listened to this music - i 'm jumping through time a bit - and it was also the national anthem of rhodesia .
i think no other work has ever been so globalized .
nevertheless this human message , this commitment to human kindness has survived - and you could almost say this message is indestructible .
how would you judge beethoven 's music today ?
what is the situation with " power " and " music " ?
for me personally , the power of music is at the forefront because i 'd like to keep believing in the utopia that music can change a lot .
in 2006 , we had a guest youth orchestra from south africa , where musicians with different backgrounds performed together , for example .
music can also be a social instrument .
and this power ca n't be burned onto a cd .
the reproduction of music in a concert is something exclusive .
there you can really feel the power of music - and i do n't think you can get away from it . interview : klaus gehrke -lrb- ah -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw takes a look at the man behind the baton . masur has been a leading conductor for over four decades .
deep in concentration but in constant eye contact with the musicians while on stage , he has a way of drawing the music out of his orchestra with spare but energetic gestures . intensity , passion and energy exude from the 81-year-old when he takes up his baton . born in 1927 in silesia , now part of poland , masur studied music and conducting in leipzig but did n't finish to receive his diploma .
nevertheless , he gathered extensive experience on the stages of the former east germany , conducting and working as a vocal coach in halle , erfurt , schwerin and at the comic opera in east berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw offers live recordings of masur conducting beethoven in 1967 , at the age of 40 , masur became director of the dresden philharmonic orchestra .
three years later he returned to leipzig , which would become the most significant station in his career . spokesman for democracy as the music director of the gewandhaus orchestra in leipzig , masur quickly became one of the most celebrated conductors in east germany .
he led the ensemble on numerous tours , performing in over 900 concerts between 1970 and 1997 . as the soviet union began to crumble in the late 1980s , leipzig became a center of political protest in communist east germany .
masur made his voice heard as well , joining in the famous monday demonstrations . " our common concerns and responsibility have brought us together today , " the conductor said in front of the nikolaikirche in leipzig on a monday in 1989 . " we are affected by the developments in our city and are looking for a solution , " said masur , addressing the government .
" we urgently ask you to be prudent , so that peaceful dialogue is possible . " music for lonely people in 1991 , masur left his newly reunified country to direct the new york philharmonic , succeeding zubin mehta .
over the next 11 years , he developed a special program structure that not only appealed to new yorkers , but went over well across the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new york is full of lonely people , concluded masur he said he discovered his secret while taking a walk in the big apple . " i found out that new york is actually full of lonely people , and i decided to make my programs so that everyone who came to the concert would feel at home , " he said . masur has since moved his workplace from the hudson river to the seine - with a layover on the thames as principal conductor of the london philharmonic orchestra from 2000 to 2007 - and now directs the orchestre national de france .
thoughts of retirement seem to be far from his mind . " i hope that i can cut back slowly , " he said .
" if i stop tomorrow , you 'll certainly be reading my obituary pretty soon because music is part of my life . " klaus gehrke -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a romantically glorified image : the lonely , troubled , but of course ingenious artist . first he threw a few books at his servant , then a chair without registering a trace of sympathy : " after that i had peace and quiet all day . "
and when a prince once thought two bassoons would do instead of three , he replied : " if your highness allocates instruments like that , then i do n't give a damn ! "
employees , the nobility , his publishers - they all got it dished to them .
one of his biographers called ludwig van beethoven the " bawdy genius . "
brain proprietor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there is only one beethoven " most of what we know about beethoven comes from his correspondence and his diary .
much unlike his contemporary goethe , who he did not get along very well with , beethoven was a stranger to self-stylization .
in his letters he writes about the malevolence of people and about the class restrictions which refused him contact with the women he worshipped .
he did not conduct himself as an outstanding nobleman ; he even treated friends to coarse language .
when his brother once acquired some land and signed himself as " van beethoven , land proprietor , " ludwig replied with " van beethoven , brain proprietor . "
to prince lichnowsky , one of his appreciators and patrons , he wrote : " prince , what you are , you are through chance and birth ; what i am , i am through my own labor .
there are many princes and there will continue to be thousands more , but there is only one beethoven . "
beethoven for all beethoven 's letters and diary are like a quarry from which one can extract whatever one needs .
there are sentences of his that give the impression that he had a revolutionary disposition , others that suggest he was elitist .
this ambiguity , together with his new musical aesthetic , later led to occasionally absurd attempts at exploiting his music : the 9th symphony sounded in 1937 for hitler 's birthday .
and even the news of hitler 's death was read out on the radio over the 9th symphony .
but even earlier , in the time of the weimar republic before the second world war , beethoven was politically exploited .
the right emphasized his supposed hostility towards the french and saw in him a " titanic fighting spirit . "
the left equated the revolutionary quality of his music with revolutionary politics .
that is something which later recurred in east germany : after the second world war beethoven was used by the gdr propagandists - beethoven as a fighter for world peace .
a moody artist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven did n't quite fit in to apply concrete political goals to beethoven himself is , however , totally excessive .
what he said was far too inconsistent .
for beethoven it was about finding new paths in music - new paths which he carved out dazzlingly .
beethoven was known for being business minded .
nevertheless he lived in a rundown house near vienna and hardly cared about his appearance .
to his contemporaries beethoven must have seemed completely unconventional .
beethoven remained a bachelor , he lived for music - in the morning he composed , in the afternoon he went for a walk , at lunchtime he ate heartily .
in many people 's eyes he defined the image of a brilliant but difficult artist - reinforced by the many hundreds of paintings and busts of a beethoven with wildly unkempt hair and a serious piercing glare .
beethoven 's deafness one often forgets the aspect that caused the most tragedy in his life : his deafness .
beethoven is just over 30 years old when it becomes clear that he can no longer conceal his worsening hearing .
a deaf musician ?
" my ears , they whirl and roar night and day , " he wrote .
beethoven considered suicide , withdrew himself from society .
he even wrote a farewell letter which he never sent .
in the letter is one of beethoven 's most famous sentences about himself : " oh you people who think me hostile , stubborn and misanthropic , how you wrong me .

when the announcement for the olympics was made in june 2007 culture secretary , tessa jowell , described the cultural olympiad as " absolutely central " to the vision of what could be achieved .
" winning the right to stage the olympic games in 2012 was always about more than simply hosting a few glorious weeks of sporting excellence in five years ' time , " she said .
i 've taken this job on because i want to make a difference gwyn l williams each of the four regions which make up great britain will have a creative programmer in charge of events - and in wales the job belongs to gwyn l williams , the former chief executive of llangollen international eisteddfod .
he hopes his experience in the arts will give him a good grounding for the task ahead , although the ' newness ' of his current post is a challenge .
" llangollen was an established festival with an annual rhythm , whilst the olympiad is something we have had to produce ourselves , " he said .
even people who have never heard of the cultural side of the olympics will have seen part of what they do as every single ceremony - from the opening , to the medals , to the very end - is part of it .
the difference in london 2012 will be the scope and breadth of the projects covered , said mr williams .
" anything from flower arranging in talwrn on anglesey to welsh national opera has the chance to be involved , " he said .
taking on a project which was a blank page was " scary but exciting " , he added .
" i 've taken this job on because i want to make a difference .
" if at the end of 2013 , when my contract ends , that has not happened then i have n't done my job properly , " he said .
the initial response from within the arts community has been " fantastic " , but there were people who had been disappointed when current projects lost money to the building of the olympic infrastructure in london , he said .
sporting triumphs can be used to promote the next event .
" i understand this completely , and it is a pity , but my job will be to get as much money as possible back into wales , " he said .
the cultural events will also be bringing unlikely groups together to work for a common goal , he added .
this includes a project between the welsh-language urdd and english-language valley kids .
" the idea of getting the two working together would normally be totally bananas but they are coming together because of the olympics , " he said .
mr williams is also planning to visit to the paralympics in beijing because a big part of the cultural olympiad is working with the disabled .
ultimately it is up to the people of wales to make the most of the situation , and to leave a legacy with a uniquely welsh flavour , he added .
" someone will always complain , but i do n't want wales to be left behind , " he said .
" yes people have lost money for their projects , but there 's no point sulking in a corner .
" we have to work to get that money back into wales . "

burn after reading is clooney 's third film with the coen brothers it remains to be seen , however , if this high-profile event will fulfil its traditional function as curtain-raiser to next year 's awards season .
last year 's programme included a number of features - among them atonement , michael clayton and the assassination of jesse james by the coward robert ford - that would go on to be shortlisted for a slew of film prizes .
this year , though , there are fewer obvious candidates for future glory - a consequence , perhaps , of the us writers ' strike and its impact on hollywood film production .
of the five american films up for the golden lion , the festival 's main award , the burning plain seems to have the most going for it .
directed by guillermo arriaga , the oscar-nominated writer of 2006 's babel , the drama sees previous oscar winners kim basinger and charlize theron play mother and daughter .
another family drama , rachel getting married , sees anne hathaway from 2005 lion winner brokeback mountain playing a troubled young woman who leaves a rehab facility to attend her sister 's nuptials .
comeback directed by jonathan demme of the silence of the lambs fame , the film marks the screenwriting debut of jenny lumet - daughter of veteran hollywood director sidney .
one competition entry sure to have people talking is the wrestler , the latest work from requiem of a dream director darren aronofsky .
hathaway can currently be seen in the comedy get smart that 's because its star is 1980s heartthrob mickey rourke , making a spirited comeback as a retired professional wrestler trying to get back into the ring for one last showdown .
the prospect of an encounter between rourke and basinger , with whom he appeared in the notorious nine-and-a-half weeks , on the venetian lido is one certain to get the press excited .
aronofsky , meanwhile , will no doubt face questions on his plans for the new version of cult sci-fi movie robocop that he is scheduled to direct .
with burn after reading boasting the stellar likes of george clooney and brad pitt , recipient of last year 's best actor prize for the assassination of jesse james , wednesday 's launch looks set to be a star-studded occasion .
festival-goers should also look out for natalie portman , whose first effort as director , eve , will feature in the short film programme .
it is not just hollywood talent , though , that will be in the spotlight at this truly international event .
thriller indeed , the fact there are two anime movies up for the golden lion award is evidence of an uncommonly strong japanese contingent .
ponyo on the cliff by the sea marks the latest production from hayao miyazaki , founder of legendary animation factory studio ghibli and director of the oscar-winning spirited away .
portman 's eve will launch the festival 's short films strand the sky crawlers , meanwhile , sees oshii mamoru , creator of celebrated anime ghost in the shell , bring his philosophical outlook to a science-fiction romance about young fighter pilots .
on the live-action front there is the latest from takeshi kitano , whose police thriller hana-bi won the golden lion in 1997 .

burn after reading is clooney 's third film with the coen brothers it remains to be seen , however , if this high-profile event will fulfil its traditional function as curtain-raiser to next year 's awards season .
last year 's programme included a number of features - among them atonement , michael clayton and the assassination of jesse james by the coward robert ford - that would go on to be shortlisted for a slew of film prizes .
this year , though , there are fewer obvious candidates for future glory - a consequence , perhaps , of the us writers ' strike and its impact on hollywood film production .
of the five american films up for the golden lion , the festival 's main award , the burning plain seems to have the most going for it .
directed by guillermo arriaga , the oscar-nominated writer of 2006 's babel , the drama sees previous oscar winners kim basinger and charlize theron play mother and daughter .
another family drama , rachel getting married , sees anne hathaway from 2005 lion winner brokeback mountain playing a troubled young woman who leaves a rehab facility to attend her sister 's nuptials .
comeback directed by jonathan demme of the silence of the lambs fame , the film marks the screenwriting debut of jenny lumet - daughter of veteran hollywood director sidney .
one competition entry sure to have people talking is the wrestler , the latest work from requiem of a dream director darren aronofsky .
hathaway can currently be seen in the comedy get smart that 's because its star is 1980s heartthrob mickey rourke , making a spirited comeback as a retired professional wrestler trying to get back into the ring for one last showdown .
the prospect of an encounter between rourke and basinger , with whom he appeared in the notorious nine-and-a-half weeks , on the venetian lido is one certain to get the press excited .
aronofsky , meanwhile , will no doubt face questions on his plans for the new version of cult sci-fi movie robocop that he is scheduled to direct .
with burn after reading boasting the stellar likes of george clooney and brad pitt , recipient of last year 's best actor prize for the assassination of jesse james , wednesday 's launch looks set to be a star-studded occasion .
festival-goers should also look out for natalie portman , whose first effort as director , eve , will feature in the short film programme .
it is not just hollywood talent , though , that will be in the spotlight at this truly international event .
thriller indeed , the fact there are two anime movies up for the golden lion award is evidence of an uncommonly strong japanese contingent .
ponyo on the cliff by the sea marks the latest production from hayao miyazaki , founder of legendary animation factory studio ghibli and director of the oscar-winning spirited away .
portman 's eve will launch the festival 's short films strand the sky crawlers , meanwhile , sees oshii mamoru , creator of celebrated anime ghost in the shell , bring his philosophical outlook to a science-fiction romance about young fighter pilots .
on the live-action front there is the latest from takeshi kitano , whose police thriller hana-bi won the golden lion in 1997 .

burn after reading is clooney 's third film with the coen brothers it remains to be seen , however , if this high-profile event will fulfil its traditional function as curtain-raiser to next year 's awards season .
last year 's programme included a number of features - among them atonement , michael clayton and the assassination of jesse james by the coward robert ford - that would go on to be shortlisted for a slew of film prizes .
this year , though , there are fewer obvious candidates for future glory - a consequence , perhaps , of the us writers ' strike and its impact on hollywood film production .
of the five american films up for the golden lion , the festival 's main award , the burning plain seems to have the most going for it .
directed by guillermo arriaga , the oscar-nominated writer of 2006 's babel , the drama sees previous oscar winners kim basinger and charlize theron play mother and daughter .
another family drama , rachel getting married , sees anne hathaway from 2005 lion winner brokeback mountain playing a troubled young woman who leaves a rehab facility to attend her sister 's nuptials .
comeback directed by jonathan demme of the silence of the lambs fame , the film marks the screenwriting debut of jenny lumet - daughter of veteran hollywood director sidney .
one competition entry sure to have people talking is the wrestler , the latest work from requiem of a dream director darren aronofsky .
hathaway can currently be seen in the comedy get smart that 's because its star is 1980s heartthrob mickey rourke , making a spirited comeback as a retired professional wrestler trying to get back into the ring for one last showdown .
the prospect of an encounter between rourke and basinger , with whom he appeared in the notorious nine-and-a-half weeks , on the venetian lido is one certain to get the press excited .
aronofsky , meanwhile , will no doubt face questions on his plans for the new version of cult sci-fi movie robocop that he is scheduled to direct .
with burn after reading boasting the stellar likes of george clooney and brad pitt , recipient of last year 's best actor prize for the assassination of jesse james , wednesday 's launch looks set to be a star-studded occasion .
festival-goers should also look out for natalie portman , whose first effort as director , eve , will feature in the short film programme .
it is not just hollywood talent , though , that will be in the spotlight at this truly international event .
thriller indeed , the fact there are two anime movies up for the golden lion award is evidence of an uncommonly strong japanese contingent .
ponyo on the cliff by the sea marks the latest production from hayao miyazaki , founder of legendary animation factory studio ghibli and director of the oscar-winning spirited away .
portman 's eve will launch the festival 's short films strand the sky crawlers , meanwhile , sees oshii mamoru , creator of celebrated anime ghost in the shell , bring his philosophical outlook to a science-fiction romance about young fighter pilots .
on the live-action front there is the latest from takeshi kitano , whose police thriller hana-bi won the golden lion in 1997 .
achilles and the tortoise promises to be a more light-hearted affair , focusing as it does on a talentless artist -lrb- played by the director -rrb- and his relationship with his doting wife .
japan also makes an appearance in l 'inju : la bete dans l 'ombre , the latest work from french film-maker barbet schroeder .
the thriller , whose subtitle translates as the beast in the shadows , involves a novelist who comes to the aid of a geisha during a promotional visit to tokyo .
with four of this year 's competition entrants hailing from italy , though , it is entirely possible the golden lion will go to something closer to home .
only time will tell what films catch the jury 's fancy , or whether their decisions - announced on 6 september - have a bearing on next year 's oscar race .
the venice film festival runs from 27 august to 6 september 2008 .

it further reiterated its opinion that bhp 's offer price for the company was too low .

both are due to report before the end of the year , but the australian competition and consumer commission has already said it has concerns that combining the two mining giants could lead to higher iron ore prices .

her breakthrough in the us came with the release of her ur so gay ep .
the title track was loathed by some gay rights groups and loved by madonna , who said it was one of her favourite songs .
perry , 23 , discusses controversial lyrics , strange dreams and freddie mercury .
how did i kissed a girl come about ?
i kissed a girl was born as an idea in my head .
the chorus actually popped into my head when i woke up .
it was one of those moments where you hear artists talking about songs they get in dreams or in the middle of the night .
i was like ' wow , what an interesting subject matter to kind of pop into the head ' and i did n't do anything with it for about a year-and-a-half .
then all of a sudden at the very , very end of making my album , i literally had two days left in the recording studio with my producer , dr luke .
we just said , ' we 're gonna finish it - it 's so catchy because it wo n't get out of our heads ' .
we brought it to the record label and they did n't even wanna put it on the record and we were like ' you 're crazy , you need to put this on the record , you need to put it out as the first single ' .
and how did you enjoy working with co-writer cathy dennis ?
cathy dennis is amazing by the way .
she 's like one of the best singers i 've heard in my entire life - she has such a beautiful soft , sultry , sexy voice .
why do you think it 's been such a massive global hit ?
i think that musically the song is catchy .
i think that it 's one of those subject matters that is , you know , like ' oh my god i ca n't believe she said that , that someone came out and said it ' .
i think that , whenever anyone writes something that is different than , like , your plain peanut butter and jelly song , ' i love you , you love me ' , everyone kind of perks up and says ' what 's this ? ' .
the song ur so gay is also controversial .
do you think writing such controversial lyrics helps to sell records ? "
i think my life is very , you know , very spontaneous and sometimes with a spontaneous life you try all kinds of different things . "
i think that my life is a bit more radical than others maybe .
i think it 's always been that way before i had a record deal , before i had a bit of success and i 've always been spontaneous and had a bit of a wild streak .
i think my life is very , you know , very spontaneous and sometimes with a spontaneous life you try all kinds of different things .
i never wrote anything for the sake of being like , ' ooh let 's be shocking or wild or rebellious ' .
i just kind of wrote about my life .
madonna has said ur so gay is one of her favourite songs .
how does that feel ?
it 's crazy because you have the poster of the person that you idolise in your bedroom growing up and you look at that person before you go to sleep .
you almost wish that it would come to life and , for me , it kind of did .
how did you get into making music ? "
they 're very opinionated , of course , as most parents are so i 'm sure they have their opinion on certain subject matters but , in general , they are very supportive " i got into making music because i was singing in church .
i grew up singing in church - both my parents are travelling ministers .
there 's always a lot of music in church and i always kind of followed along .
how do your parents feel about your controversial lyrics ?
my parents are really supportive of me and my career .
they were just on tour with me for the past few days , on stage watching the show .
they 're very opinionated , of course , as most parents are so i 'm sure they have their opinion on certain subject matters but , in general , they are very supportive .
they do their thing , i do my thing and there 's an equal level of respect .
how did you feel when your mother reportedly said she was disappointed in your actions ?
i think everything can be exaggerated and i saw some of the quotes and i 'm like , ' i do n't know whose mom you 're talking to but you were n't talking to mine ' .
tell us about your love for rock band queen ?
freddie mercury was a bad ass .
it was kinda like he did n't care what anybody thought about him , he always brought the entertainment value to the show .
who would have thought that you would write a song about girls with big asses ?
-lsb- fat bottomed girls -rsb- .
and everybody would sing along to it and , i do n't know , he seemed like he had a good sense of humour in his life and was smart and intelligent and , basically , said exactly what was on his mind and i respect that .
he never censored himself for the sake of anybody .
katy perry 's album one of the boys is out in the uk on 15 september .
she was talking to bbc news entertainment reporter liam allen .

her breakthrough in the us came with the release of her ur so gay ep .
the title track was loathed by some gay rights groups and loved by madonna , who said it was one of her favourite songs .
perry , 23 , discusses controversial lyrics , strange dreams and freddie mercury .
how did i kissed a girl come about ?
i kissed a girl was born as an idea in my head .
the chorus actually popped into my head when i woke up .
it was one of those moments where you hear artists talking about songs they get in dreams or in the middle of the night .
cathy dennis , who has written a plethora of hits , co-wrote the single i was like ' wow , what an interesting subject matter to kind of pop into the head ' and i did n't do anything with it for about a year-and-a-half .
then all of a sudden at the very , very end of making my album , i literally had two days left in the recording studio with my producer , dr luke .
we just said , ' we 're gonna finish it - it 's so catchy because it wo n't get out of our heads ' .
we brought it to the record label and they did n't even wanna put it on the record and we were like ' you 're crazy , you need to put this on the record , you need to put it out as the first single ' .
and how did you enjoy working with co-writer cathy dennis ?
cathy dennis is amazing by the way .
she 's like one of the best singers i 've heard in my entire life - she has such a beautiful soft , sultry , sexy voice .
why do you think it 's been such a massive global hit ?
i think that musically the song is catchy .
i think that it 's one of those subject matters that is , you know , like ' oh my god i ca n't believe she said that , that someone came out and said it ' .
i think that , whenever anyone writes something that is different than , like , your plain peanut butter and jelly song , ' i love you , you love me ' , everyone kind of perks up and says ' what 's this ? ' .
the song ur so gay is also controversial .

the woman has described the offer as " the final insult " saying it does not compensate her daughter for the ordeal .
sweeney was jailed for life in june 2006 , but was told he could seek parole after five years .
the criminal injuries compensation authority said it pays awards under a " tariff system " for injuries .
the girl 's mother said that when she heard the compensation figure : " i felt that they were having a laugh . "
sweeney , who was then aged 24 and living in newport , abducted and sexually assaulted the girl in january 2006 , while on early release after being jailed for another attack .
he sexually assaulted her again in a lay-by near swindon and was caught only after police in wiltshire chased his car .
at times sweeney reached speeds of 100 mph with the terrified youngster in his car .

police later found the little girl lying at the side of the road where she had been hurled out of the vehicle by sweeney .
the mother of the girl , who is now six , said : " the minute she was taken , everything have gone wrong .
that was two-and-a-half years ago and things are still going wrong .
" this is a baby involved , a little girl who was abducted and attacked by a paedophile .
it 's just like any other crime to everybody in the system .
there 's no justice for my baby at all .
" when i hear these things , anything to do with the case , i got a picture in my head of her being attacked .
you put that in your head - her being attacked and that £ 9,000 offer - it just beggars belief .
it 's not my money , it 's not for me , it 's for a baby who was subjected to a horrendous crime and all the money in the world wo n't make it better , but it will help victim 's mother " it 's not my money , it 's not for me , it 's for a baby who was subjected to a horrendous crime and all the money in the world wo n't make it better , but it will help . "
the woman said she had been given indications her daughter would receive between £ 40,000 and £ 70,000 .
she said her daughter has had up to 10 counselling sessions but said she felt she needed more intense counselling .
" she is really down .
she 's crying a lot and she just wants to be with us .
her temper is coming out a lot now which is -lrb- a -rrb- quite disturbing temper compared to other six-year-olds , " said the mother .
" she has no fear .
that man took that baby 's fear away .
i 've never seen a child with this behaviour .
she will do the most dangerous things and not think twice about it .
" she 'll run down the street , hoping that i will run and get her , just to reassure herself that i 'm there because she does n't trust us 100 % still .
' remembers his face ' " she will talk about ' the nasty man ' , -lrb- as she -rrb- calls him .
she will say things about how fast he was driving in the car and when he told her shut up and hit her in the back , when he threw her out of the car and ' her policeman ' .
" she always talks about them , but she never mentions about the assault . "
the woman said she has concerns that her daughter may meet sweeney in the street when he is released .
she said : " she remembers his face .
she remembers that face clearly .
it will take a hell of lot of counselling to get rid of that face , that 's for sure . "
cardiff north mp julie morgan , who has worked with the family , said she felt the strict tariff system needed examination as the girl 's trauma throughout her abduction may not have been taken into account .
she said : " it must seem at the end of all they 've been through another bitter pill to swallow . "
in a statement , the criminal injuries compensation authority said : " we can not comment specifically on applications made to the criminal injuries compensation authority , in order to protect applicants ' confidentiality .
" cica operates under the criminal injuries compensation scheme 2001 , as set down by parliament .
the scheme sets the levels of compensation depending on the injuries sustained .
" we pay awards under a tariff system that assigns each specific injury a fixed amount of compensation .
awards under this tariff range from £ 1,000 to £ 250,000 . "
