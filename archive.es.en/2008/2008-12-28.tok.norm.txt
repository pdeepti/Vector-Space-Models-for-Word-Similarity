1 , 1939 , next year also marks the 20th anniversary of the fall of communism across central europe .
starting with democratic elections in poland in june 1989 , the year of change across central europe culminated in november of that year with the fall of the berlin wall .
that event became a symbol of the end of the cold war and europe 's post-war divide .
the breaching of the berlin wall also led to the unseating of the soviet-backed government in prague and the ousting of romanian president nicolae ceausescu a few weeks later .
on christmas day , ceausescu and his wife were executed by firing squad following a bloody revolution in the country to unseat the hated dictator .
a new study released this month said , however , that germans living in the country 's former communist east felt they were second-class citizens in the reunified germany that emerged following the fall of the wall .
undertaken by the university of bielefeld , the study revealed lingering resentment in the east about life since a popular uprising in late 1989 paved the way for the collapse of east germany 's stalinist government .
shift to the west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stalinist regimes were toppled after the collapse of the berlin wall decades later both eastern and western europe are still grappling with the events surrounding world war two and the fall of communism , as well as struggling to forge a new identity in a world now shaped by fast-paced globalization .
" the common past is a chance for the future , " polish foreign minister radoslav sikorski said in a speech delivered in berlin this month .
" the events followed a decades-long struggle by those who refused to abandon their freedom , " sikorski said .
triggered by former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev 's drive for glasnost - openness - and perestroika - economic change - the fall of communism across central europe in 1989 also ultimately helped loosen communist grip on moscow and pave the way a few years later for the collapse of soviet russia .
nearly 20 years after the communist governments of central europe fell like dominoes , the region 's new political leadership is still trying to sweep away the industrial and social debris left by decades of command economics .
this transformation has been signified by a strong shift towards western-style economic systems .
however , this process is now likely to be made more complicated by the economic downturn rapidly taking hold around the world .
specter of the nazi state bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kristallnacht saw nazi thugs set fire to synagogues and loot jewish businesses november 9 rears itself as a strangely recurring date in german history .
this date marks hitler 's stepped-up reign of terror against jews on kristallnacht - the night of the broken glass - and the failure of his beer hall putsch in bavaria in 1923 .
kaiser wilhem ii also abdicated on nov .
9 , 1918 .
but , in a sense , all these strands of history lead back to a september day nearly 70 years ago when nazi troops crossed the border into poland , sparking six years of war and unleashing the barbarity of the third reich on eastern europe .
it is a measure of the ongoing fascination with the horrors of nazism that there seems little end to the book and movie industry that has grown up around it .
british historian richard evans has just published the third reich at war , the final instalment in his trilogy of books on nazi germany .
new york-born director bryan singer 's " valkyrie , " a film about the 1944 plot to assassinate hitler starring hollywood actor tom cruise , came out in the us at christmas and will open in germany in january .

next year will also mark the 10th birthday of the euro , which became the accounting currency of 12 european states on jan .

barack obama , however , was cheered across party lines . during the most dazzling event of the year in foreign policy in germany , the spotlight was n't on the german government , but on an american : barack obama .
as the presidential candidate of the democratic party , he visited berlin and held a much-anticipated speech at the victory column in front of 200,000 . it is highly unlikely - no , simply unimaginable - that as many people would have poured into the tiergarten , berlin 's central park , had it been the chancellor or and a group of high-ranking german politicians on stage instead of obama .
members of germany 's political class these days inspire more yawns than cheers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berliners welcomed obama at his speech at the victory column barack obama chose the monument as the place for his speech after some discussion – looking back it proved to be an omen of success .
in november , a delighted angela merkel congratulated the winner . " we 're witnessing a historical election victory , " merkel said . " no , we ca n't " obama delivered a wide-ranging speech and putting the focus on trans-atlantic ties .
in the eyes of many germans george w. bush had ruined those .
so hardly anybody noticed bush 's parting visit to angela merkel . merkel had tried to explain to him the pain threshold in german foreign policy , for example afghanistan .
under no circumstances did the german government want to send troops to the hard-fought south of afghanistan . the next task is to convince the american president-elect that germany 's version of his famous slogan is : " no , we ca n't . "
the german government is convinced to be doing enough for the stabilization of afghanistan . only in october , germany 's parliament voted to extend the country 's military mission and to deploy an extra 1,000 troops there , boosting their number to 4,500 .
germany 's allies should appreciate this commitment , said german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier . " we have pointed out in the past what germany does in afghanistan , not only the bundeswehr , but also what our civil helpers do for reconstruction , " steinmeier said .
" we get a lot of respect for that , also in the united states of america . " afghanistan remains key issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr forces patrolling on the outskirts of kunduz , northern afghanistan afghanistan remained one of the most controversial security topics for the german government in 2008 .
the training of the afghan police and army was plagued with problems .
regularly , the taliban fired at bundeswehr camps and attacked patrols . in october , two german soldiers died near kundus in a suicide attack .
for the first time since german soldiers were sent to afghanistan six years ago , german defense minister franz josef jung referred in november to the gefallene , or fallen soldiers , who had died there .
until now , any german soldiers killed in afghanistan were referred to as casualties . throughout 2008 , the military played an important role in german foreign policy .
german soldiers were deployed to afghanistan , kosovo , bosnia , the horn of africa and to the coast of lebanon .
unarmed forces were sent to southern sudan and georgia .
at the end of 2008 the bundeswehr took part in the european anti-pirate-force " atalanta " along the coast of somalia . but seen as a whole , german foreign policy in 2008 came across as fractured and heading in too many directions .
while , 2007 was dominated by major events such as the eu presidency and the g8 summit in heiligendamm , a clear course was never set for 2008 .
part of what was accomplished in 2007 fell victim to the global financial crisis and the irish eu " no " vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy did n't call and invite angela merkel to the mini-summit merkel stopped being the woman of action and was overshadowed by french president nicolas sarkozy 's overdrive .
in december , merkel - notable among european leaders for her wariness about increasing public borrowing to fund government spending - was excluded from a mini-summit initiated by sarkozy .
steinmeier was not amused . " i 'll be honest : i do n't think it was nice that germany and the chancellor were n't there , " he said . frictions within german government coalition another dilemma put a strain on german foreign policy in 2008 : the two most important people , christian democrat merkel and social democrat steinmeier disagreed on a number of issues , especially in the approach to countries like russia , china and syria . merkel either tends to be quite frank and open or she contains herself .
steinmeier places emphasis on rapproachment though diplomacy and dialogue .
their differing styles of policy-making led to some confusion in 2008 - much to the pleasure of the opposition .
the green party 's juergen trittin accused the government of having not one but two foreign policies . " one of them is responsible for the dalai lama , the other one for china , " trittin said .
" the foreign minister advocates dialogue with syria and is being criticized for it by the christian democrats .
or when asked what the government thinks of the positioning of new american missiles in europe , you wo n't get a consistent answer ! " merkel vs. steinmeier bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier wants to challenge merkel in next year 's election the disagreements also affected the dalai lama 's visit to germany : german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , a social democrat , was the only cabinet member to receive him .
the year before , chancellor merkel 's reception of the exiled tibetan spiritual leader angered china as well as her own foreign minister , who accused her of trying to " showcase " human rights . foreign policy expectations for 2009 are low : in october , steinmeier won his party 's support to face merkel in next year 's election .
an election campaign pitting merkel vs. steinmeier is likely to water down german foreign policy even more . dw staff -lrb- nma -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

1 , 1939 , next year also marks the 20th anniversary of the fall of communism across central europe .
starting with democratic elections in poland in june 1989 , the year of change across central europe culminated in november of that year with the fall of the berlin wall .
that event became a symbol of the end of the cold war and europe 's post-war divide .
the breaching of the berlin wall also led to the unseating of the soviet-backed government in prague and the ousting of romanian president nicolae ceausescu a few weeks later .
on christmas day , ceausescu and his wife were executed by firing squad following a bloody revolution in the country to unseat the hated dictator .
a new study released this month said , however , that germans living in the country 's former communist east felt they were second-class citizens in the reunified germany that emerged following the fall of the wall .
undertaken by the university of bielefeld , the study revealed lingering resentment in the east about life since a popular uprising in late 1989 paved the way for the collapse of east germany 's stalinist government .

" the common past is a chance for the future , " polish foreign minister radoslav sikorski said in a speech delivered in berlin this month .
" the events followed a decades-long struggle by those who refused to abandon their freedom , " sikorski said .
triggered by former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev 's drive for glasnost - openness - and perestroika - economic change - the fall of communism across central europe in 1989 also ultimately helped loosen communist grip on moscow and pave the way a few years later for the collapse of soviet russia .
nearly 20 years after the communist governments of central europe fell like dominoes , the region 's new political leadership is still trying to sweep away the industrial and social debris left by decades of command economics .
this transformation has been signified by a strong shift towards western-style economic systems .
however , this process is now likely to be made more complicated by the economic downturn rapidly taking hold around the world .

major events such as wimbledon are no longer broadcast on free-to-air television channels and there is no footage at all of the elite golden league athletics series as soccer rules the airwaves , pushing out almost anything else .
perennial runner-up michael ballack was the only german on the shortlist for the 2009 world footballer award .
katrin krabbe was the last german to win an athletics world title on the track in 1991 .
and the tennis glory days of boris becker and steffi graf are long gone .
germany placed fifth in the medal table at the beijing olympics , but a report from a leipzig-based training institute -lrb- iat -rrb- said that was no reason to cheer .
" high-performance sport in germany is in danger of losing contact to developments in world sports .
performances are on the decline in many sports , " the sueddeutsche zeitung -lrb- sz -rrb- newspaper wrote in mid-december , quoting an iat report .
bleak all year ' round bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael ballack has had to be content with second place had britta steffen not managed to win gold medals in the 50 and 100-meter freestyle events in beijing , germany would have ended with no gold at all in the showcase sports of athletics and swimming , which alone account for 81 of the 302 gold medals on offer at the games .
the winter situation is similar , with germany only a minor player in the popular sports of alpine skiing and figure skating .
instead , german athletes win their medals in luge , biathlon or bobsleigh , events which are not popular in many countries .
according to the sz , germany is the only country from the world 's big six - the others being the us , china , great britain , russia and australia - which does n't focus on sports with the most medals on offer or those with a long tradition in the country .
the iat criticism ranges from badly educated coaches to a lack of scientific support .
stellar stadiums are n't enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's winter sports prowess is also lacking only last week germany coach joachim loew and other officials went to france to look at the country 's famous soccer academy in clairefontaine .
germany has no such institute and lags behind in club and country competitions .
" we are world class as far as stadium atmosphere is concerned .
but we must do more on the pitch , " said former german soccer coach juergen klinsmann , now in charge at bayern munich .
germany came in second at euro 2008 but had its tactical deficits exposed by spain .
the last title came at euro 1996 and the world cup has not been won since 1990 .
just one year later krabbe - whose name has been tainted by doping allegations - claimed the last major sprint title when athletes from former east germany still ruled the scene shortly after the 1990 reunification .
doping-infested cycling is also on its way out and so is tennis , with the hamburg masters downgraded and the women 's berlin tournament possibly moving elsewhere .
winter olympics offers hope bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cars might be german , but the races are held elsewhere germany may also be without a formula one grand prix in 2010 , even though it is a country which has two major team players in mercedes and bmw , a record four drivers in the field and the most successful driver ever in seven-time champion michael schumacher .
the main hopes for a better future lie in improved training programs , a rise of new talent and the hosting of big events .
munich is setting up a promising bid for the 2018 winter olympics and officials have high hopes in the athletics worlds in berlin as well .
" we can all make 2009 a historic year in german athletics , " pledged clemens prokop , president of the german athletics association . dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

barack obama , however , was cheered across party lines . during the most dazzling event of the year in foreign policy in germany , the spotlight was n't on the german government , but on an american : barack obama .
as the presidential candidate of the democratic party , he visited berlin and held a much-anticipated speech at the victory column in front of 200,000 . it is highly unlikely - no , simply unimaginable - that as many people would have poured into the tiergarten , berlin 's central park , had it been the chancellor or and a group of high-ranking german politicians on stage instead of obama .
members of germany 's political class these days inspire more yawns than cheers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berliners welcomed obama at his speech at the victory column barack obama chose the monument as the place for his speech after some discussion – looking back it proved to be an omen of success .
in november , a delighted angela merkel congratulated the winner . " we 're witnessing a historical election victory , " merkel said . " no , we ca n't " obama delivered a wide-ranging speech and putting the focus on trans-atlantic ties .
in the eyes of many germans george w. bush had ruined those .
so hardly anybody noticed bush 's parting visit to angela merkel . merkel had tried to explain to him the pain threshold in german foreign policy , for example afghanistan .
under no circumstances did the german government want to send troops to the hard-fought south of afghanistan . the next task is to convince the american president-elect that germany 's version of his famous slogan is : " no , we ca n't . "
the german government is convinced to be doing enough for the stabilization of afghanistan . only in october , germany 's parliament voted to extend the country 's military mission and to deploy an extra 1,000 troops there , boosting their number to 4,500 .
germany 's allies should appreciate this commitment , said german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier . " we have pointed out in the past what germany does in afghanistan , not only the bundeswehr , but also what our civil helpers do for reconstruction , " steinmeier said .
" we get a lot of respect for that , also in the united states of america . " afghanistan remains key issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr forces patrolling on the outskirts of kunduz , northern afghanistan afghanistan remained one of the most controversial security topics for the german government in 2008 .
the training of the afghan police and army was plagued with problems .
regularly , the taliban fired at bundeswehr camps and attacked patrols . in october , two german soldiers died near kundus in a suicide attack .
for the first time since german soldiers were sent to afghanistan six years ago , german defense minister franz josef jung referred in november to the gefallene , or fallen soldiers , who had died there .
until now , any german soldiers killed in afghanistan were referred to as casualties . throughout 2008 , the military played an important role in german foreign policy .
german soldiers were deployed to afghanistan , kosovo , bosnia , the horn of africa and to the coast of lebanon .
unarmed forces were sent to southern sudan and georgia .
at the end of 2008 the bundeswehr took part in the european anti-pirate-force " atalanta " along the coast of somalia . but seen as a whole , german foreign policy in 2008 came across as fractured and heading in too many directions .

steinmeier was not amused . " i 'll be honest : i do n't think it was nice that germany and the chancellor were n't there , " he said . frictions within german government coalition another dilemma put a strain on german foreign policy in 2008 : the two most important people , christian democrat merkel and social democrat steinmeier disagreed on a number of issues , especially in the approach to countries like russia , china and syria . merkel either tends to be quite frank and open or she contains herself .

1 , 1939 , next year also marks the 20th anniversary of the fall of communism across central europe .
starting with democratic elections in poland in june 1989 , the year of change across central europe culminated in november of that year with the fall of the berlin wall .
that event became a symbol of the end of the cold war and europe 's post-war divide .
the breaching of the berlin wall also led to the unseating of the soviet-backed government in prague and the ousting of romanian president nicolae ceausescu a few weeks later .
on christmas day , ceausescu and his wife were executed by firing squad following a bloody revolution in the country to unseat the hated dictator .
a new study released this month said , however , that germans living in the country 's former communist east felt they were second-class citizens in the reunified germany that emerged following the fall of the wall .
undertaken by the university of bielefeld , the study revealed lingering resentment in the east about life since a popular uprising in late 1989 paved the way for the collapse of east germany 's stalinist government .
shift to the west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stalinist regimes were toppled after the collapse of the berlin wall decades later both eastern and western europe are still grappling with the events surrounding world war two and the fall of communism , as well as struggling to forge a new identity in a world now shaped by fast-paced globalization .
" the common past is a chance for the future , " polish foreign minister radoslav sikorski said in a speech delivered in berlin this month .
" the events followed a decades-long struggle by those who refused to abandon their freedom , " sikorski said .
triggered by former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev 's drive for glasnost - openness - and perestroika - economic change - the fall of communism across central europe in 1989 also ultimately helped loosen communist grip on moscow and pave the way a few years later for the collapse of soviet russia .
nearly 20 years after the communist governments of central europe fell like dominoes , the region 's new political leadership is still trying to sweep away the industrial and social debris left by decades of command economics .
this transformation has been signified by a strong shift towards western-style economic systems .
however , this process is now likely to be made more complicated by the economic downturn rapidly taking hold around the world .
specter of the nazi state bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kristallnacht saw nazi thugs set fire to synagogues and loot jewish businesses november 9 rears itself as a strangely recurring date in german history .
this date marks hitler 's stepped-up reign of terror against jews on kristallnacht - the night of the broken glass - and the failure of his beer hall putsch in bavaria in 1923 .
kaiser wilhem ii also abdicated on nov .
9 , 1918 .
but , in a sense , all these strands of history lead back to a september day nearly 70 years ago when nazi troops crossed the border into poland , sparking six years of war and unleashing the barbarity of the third reich on eastern europe .
it is a measure of the ongoing fascination with the horrors of nazism that there seems little end to the book and movie industry that has grown up around it .
british historian richard evans has just published the third reich at war , the final instalment in his trilogy of books on nazi germany .
new york-born director bryan singer 's " valkyrie , " a film about the 1944 plot to assassinate hitler starring hollywood actor tom cruise , came out in the us at christmas and will open in germany in january .

next year will also mark the 10th birthday of the euro , which became the accounting currency of 12 european states on jan .

barack obama , however , was cheered across party lines . during the most dazzling event of the year in foreign policy in germany , the spotlight was n't on the german government , but on an american : barack obama .
as the presidential candidate of the democratic party , he visited berlin and held a much-anticipated speech at the victory column in front of 200,000 . it is highly unlikely - no , simply unimaginable - that as many people would have poured into the tiergarten , berlin 's central park , had it been the chancellor or and a group of high-ranking german politicians on stage instead of obama .
members of germany 's political class these days inspire more yawns than cheers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berliners welcomed obama at his speech at the victory column barack obama chose the monument as the place for his speech after some discussion – looking back it proved to be an omen of success .
in november , a delighted angela merkel congratulated the winner . " we 're witnessing a historical election victory , " merkel said . " no , we ca n't " obama delivered a wide-ranging speech and putting the focus on trans-atlantic ties .
in the eyes of many germans george w. bush had ruined those .
so hardly anybody noticed bush 's parting visit to angela merkel . merkel had tried to explain to him the pain threshold in german foreign policy , for example afghanistan .
under no circumstances did the german government want to send troops to the hard-fought south of afghanistan . the next task is to convince the american president-elect that germany 's version of his famous slogan is : " no , we ca n't . "
the german government is convinced to be doing enough for the stabilization of afghanistan . only in october , germany 's parliament voted to extend the country 's military mission and to deploy an extra 1,000 troops there , boosting their number to 4,500 .
germany 's allies should appreciate this commitment , said german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier . " we have pointed out in the past what germany does in afghanistan , not only the bundeswehr , but also what our civil helpers do for reconstruction , " steinmeier said .
" we get a lot of respect for that , also in the united states of america . " afghanistan remains key issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr forces patrolling on the outskirts of kunduz , northern afghanistan afghanistan remained one of the most controversial security topics for the german government in 2008 .
the training of the afghan police and army was plagued with problems .
regularly , the taliban fired at bundeswehr camps and attacked patrols . in october , two german soldiers died near kundus in a suicide attack .
for the first time since german soldiers were sent to afghanistan six years ago , german defense minister franz josef jung referred in november to the gefallene , or fallen soldiers , who had died there .
until now , any german soldiers killed in afghanistan were referred to as casualties . throughout 2008 , the military played an important role in german foreign policy .
german soldiers were deployed to afghanistan , kosovo , bosnia , the horn of africa and to the coast of lebanon .
unarmed forces were sent to southern sudan and georgia .
at the end of 2008 the bundeswehr took part in the european anti-pirate-force " atalanta " along the coast of somalia . but seen as a whole , german foreign policy in 2008 came across as fractured and heading in too many directions .
while , 2007 was dominated by major events such as the eu presidency and the g8 summit in heiligendamm , a clear course was never set for 2008 .
part of what was accomplished in 2007 fell victim to the global financial crisis and the irish eu " no " vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy did n't call and invite angela merkel to the mini-summit merkel stopped being the woman of action and was overshadowed by french president nicolas sarkozy 's overdrive .
in december , merkel - notable among european leaders for her wariness about increasing public borrowing to fund government spending - was excluded from a mini-summit initiated by sarkozy .
steinmeier was not amused . " i 'll be honest : i do n't think it was nice that germany and the chancellor were n't there , " he said . frictions within german government coalition another dilemma put a strain on german foreign policy in 2008 : the two most important people , christian democrat merkel and social democrat steinmeier disagreed on a number of issues , especially in the approach to countries like russia , china and syria . merkel either tends to be quite frank and open or she contains herself .
steinmeier places emphasis on rapproachment though diplomacy and dialogue .
their differing styles of policy-making led to some confusion in 2008 - much to the pleasure of the opposition .
the green party 's juergen trittin accused the government of having not one but two foreign policies . " one of them is responsible for the dalai lama , the other one for china , " trittin said .
" the foreign minister advocates dialogue with syria and is being criticized for it by the christian democrats .
or when asked what the government thinks of the positioning of new american missiles in europe , you wo n't get a consistent answer ! " merkel vs. steinmeier bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier wants to challenge merkel in next year 's election the disagreements also affected the dalai lama 's visit to germany : german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , a social democrat , was the only cabinet member to receive him .
the year before , chancellor merkel 's reception of the exiled tibetan spiritual leader angered china as well as her own foreign minister , who accused her of trying to " showcase " human rights . foreign policy expectations for 2009 are low : in october , steinmeier won his party 's support to face merkel in next year 's election .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de foreign relations -pipe- 28.12.2008 2008 : a tough year in german foreign policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and frank-walter steinmeier lead germany 's coalition government germany 's government in 2008 was tested by the world 's financial crisis and the military mission in afghanistan while frictions dominated the ruling coalition .
barack obama , however , was cheered across party lines . during the most dazzling event of the year in foreign policy in germany , the spotlight was n't on the german government , but on an american : barack obama .
as the presidential candidate of the democratic party , he visited berlin and held a much-anticipated speech at the victory column in front of 200,000 . it is highly unlikely - no , simply unimaginable - that as many people would have poured into the tiergarten , berlin 's central park , had it been the chancellor or and a group of high-ranking german politicians on stage instead of obama .
members of germany 's political class these days inspire more yawns than cheers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berliners welcomed obama at his speech at the victory column barack obama chose the monument as the place for his speech after some discussion – looking back it proved to be an omen of success .
in november , a delighted angela merkel congratulated the winner . " we 're witnessing a historical election victory , " merkel said . " no , we ca n't " obama delivered a wide-ranging speech and putting the focus on trans-atlantic ties .
in the eyes of many germans george w. bush had ruined those .
so hardly anybody noticed bush 's parting visit to angela merkel . merkel had tried to explain to him the pain threshold in german foreign policy , for example afghanistan .
under no circumstances did the german government want to send troops to the hard-fought south of afghanistan . the next task is to convince the american president-elect that germany 's version of his famous slogan is : " no , we ca n't . "
the german government is convinced to be doing enough for the stabilization of afghanistan . only in october , germany 's parliament voted to extend the country 's military mission and to deploy an extra 1,000 troops there , boosting their number to 4,500 .
germany 's allies should appreciate this commitment , said german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier . " we have pointed out in the past what germany does in afghanistan , not only the bundeswehr , but also what our civil helpers do for reconstruction , " steinmeier said .
" we get a lot of respect for that , also in the united states of america . " afghanistan remains key issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr forces patrolling on the outskirts of kunduz , northern afghanistan afghanistan remained one of the most controversial security topics for the german government in 2008 .
the training of the afghan police and army was plagued with problems .
regularly , the taliban fired at bundeswehr camps and attacked patrols . in october , two german soldiers died near kundus in a suicide attack .
for the first time since german soldiers were sent to afghanistan six years ago , german defense minister franz josef jung referred in november to the gefallene , or fallen soldiers , who had died there .
until now , any german soldiers killed in afghanistan were referred to as casualties . throughout 2008 , the military played an important role in german foreign policy .
german soldiers were deployed to afghanistan , kosovo , bosnia , the horn of africa and to the coast of lebanon .
unarmed forces were sent to southern sudan and georgia .
at the end of 2008 the bundeswehr took part in the european anti-pirate-force " atalanta " along the coast of somalia . but seen as a whole , german foreign policy in 2008 came across as fractured and heading in too many directions .
while , 2007 was dominated by major events such as the eu presidency and the g8 summit in heiligendamm , a clear course was never set for 2008 .
part of what was accomplished in 2007 fell victim to the global financial crisis and the irish eu " no " vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy did n't call and invite angela merkel to the mini-summit merkel stopped being the woman of action and was overshadowed by french president nicolas sarkozy 's overdrive .
in december , merkel - notable among european leaders for her wariness about increasing public borrowing to fund government spending - was excluded from a mini-summit initiated by sarkozy .
steinmeier was not amused . " i 'll be honest : i do n't think it was nice that germany and the chancellor were n't there , " he said . frictions within german government coalition another dilemma put a strain on german foreign policy in 2008 : the two most important people , christian democrat merkel and social democrat steinmeier disagreed on a number of issues , especially in the approach to countries like russia , china and syria . merkel either tends to be quite frank and open or she contains herself .
steinmeier places emphasis on rapproachment though diplomacy and dialogue .
their differing styles of policy-making led to some confusion in 2008 - much to the pleasure of the opposition .
the green party 's juergen trittin accused the government of having not one but two foreign policies . " one of them is responsible for the dalai lama , the other one for china , " trittin said .
" the foreign minister advocates dialogue with syria and is being criticized for it by the christian democrats .
or when asked what the government thinks of the positioning of new american missiles in europe , you wo n't get a consistent answer ! " merkel vs. steinmeier bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier wants to challenge merkel in next year 's election the disagreements also affected the dalai lama 's visit to germany : german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , a social democrat , was the only cabinet member to receive him .
the year before , chancellor merkel 's reception of the exiled tibetan spiritual leader angered china as well as her own foreign minister , who accused her of trying to " showcase " human rights . foreign policy expectations for 2009 are low : in october , steinmeier won his party 's support to face merkel in next year 's election .
an election campaign pitting merkel vs. steinmeier is likely to water down german foreign policy even more . dw staff -lrb- nma -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

whether its swimming , soccer or skiing , sports commentators are finding reasons to be pessimistic about 2009 . first , the good news .
germany will host the world athletics championships in 2009 .
but apart from that berlin event , the forecast for the nation 's sports is as bleak as the glum economic predictions .
the former sports power lacks stars in major sports ranging from football to athletics and swimming .
in addition , there is an almost frightening disappearance of events from tennis to formula one .
always second best bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs another steffi graf berlin and leipzig have suffered embarrassment in their attempts to host olympic games in recent years .
major events such as wimbledon are no longer broadcast on free-to-air television channels and there is no footage at all of the elite golden league athletics series as soccer rules the airwaves , pushing out almost anything else .
perennial runner-up michael ballack was the only german on the shortlist for the 2009 world footballer award .
katrin krabbe was the last german to win an athletics world title on the track in 1991 .
and the tennis glory days of boris becker and steffi graf are long gone .
germany placed fifth in the medal table at the beijing olympics , but a report from a leipzig-based training institute -lrb- iat -rrb- said that was no reason to cheer .
" high-performance sport in germany is in danger of losing contact to developments in world sports .
performances are on the decline in many sports , " the sueddeutsche zeitung -lrb- sz -rrb- newspaper wrote in mid-december , quoting an iat report .
bleak all year ' round bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael ballack has had to be content with second place had britta steffen not managed to win gold medals in the 50 and 100-meter freestyle events in beijing , germany would have ended with no gold at all in the showcase sports of athletics and swimming , which alone account for 81 of the 302 gold medals on offer at the games .
the winter situation is similar , with germany only a minor player in the popular sports of alpine skiing and figure skating .
instead , german athletes win their medals in luge , biathlon or bobsleigh , events which are not popular in many countries .
according to the sz , germany is the only country from the world 's big six - the others being the us , china , great britain , russia and australia - which does n't focus on sports with the most medals on offer or those with a long tradition in the country .
the iat criticism ranges from badly educated coaches to a lack of scientific support .
stellar stadiums are n't enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's winter sports prowess is also lacking only last week germany coach joachim loew and other officials went to france to look at the country 's famous soccer academy in clairefontaine .
germany has no such institute and lags behind in club and country competitions .
" we are world class as far as stadium atmosphere is concerned .
but we must do more on the pitch , " said former german soccer coach juergen klinsmann , now in charge at bayern munich .
germany came in second at euro 2008 but had its tactical deficits exposed by spain .
the last title came at euro 1996 and the world cup has not been won since 1990 .
just one year later krabbe - whose name has been tainted by doping allegations - claimed the last major sprint title when athletes from former east germany still ruled the scene shortly after the 1990 reunification .
doping-infested cycling is also on its way out and so is tennis , with the hamburg masters downgraded and the women 's berlin tournament possibly moving elsewhere .
winter olympics offers hope bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cars might be german , but the races are held elsewhere germany may also be without a formula one grand prix in 2010 , even though it is a country which has two major team players in mercedes and bmw , a record four drivers in the field and the most successful driver ever in seven-time champion michael schumacher .
the main hopes for a better future lie in improved training programs , a rise of new talent and the hosting of big events .
munich is setting up a promising bid for the 2018 winter olympics and officials have high hopes in the athletics worlds in berlin as well .
" we can all make 2009 a historic year in german athletics , " pledged clemens prokop , president of the german athletics association . dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

1 , 1939 , next year also marks the 20th anniversary of the fall of communism across central europe .
starting with democratic elections in poland in june 1989 , the year of change across central europe culminated in november of that year with the fall of the berlin wall .
that event became a symbol of the end of the cold war and europe 's post-war divide .
the breaching of the berlin wall also led to the unseating of the soviet-backed government in prague and the ousting of romanian president nicolae ceausescu a few weeks later .
on christmas day , ceausescu and his wife were executed by firing squad following a bloody revolution in the country to unseat the hated dictator .
a new study released this month said , however , that germans living in the country 's former communist east felt they were second-class citizens in the reunified germany that emerged following the fall of the wall .
undertaken by the university of bielefeld , the study revealed lingering resentment in the east about life since a popular uprising in late 1989 paved the way for the collapse of east germany 's stalinist government .
shift to the west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stalinist regimes were toppled after the collapse of the berlin wall decades later both eastern and western europe are still grappling with the events surrounding world war two and the fall of communism , as well as struggling to forge a new identity in a world now shaped by fast-paced globalization .
" the common past is a chance for the future , " polish foreign minister radoslav sikorski said in a speech delivered in berlin this month .
" the events followed a decades-long struggle by those who refused to abandon their freedom , " sikorski said .
triggered by former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev 's drive for glasnost - openness - and perestroika - economic change - the fall of communism across central europe in 1989 also ultimately helped loosen communist grip on moscow and pave the way a few years later for the collapse of soviet russia .
nearly 20 years after the communist governments of central europe fell like dominoes , the region 's new political leadership is still trying to sweep away the industrial and social debris left by decades of command economics .
this transformation has been signified by a strong shift towards western-style economic systems .
however , this process is now likely to be made more complicated by the economic downturn rapidly taking hold around the world .
specter of the nazi state bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kristallnacht saw nazi thugs set fire to synagogues and loot jewish businesses november 9 rears itself as a strangely recurring date in german history .
this date marks hitler 's stepped-up reign of terror against jews on kristallnacht - the night of the broken glass - and the failure of his beer hall putsch in bavaria in 1923 .
kaiser wilhem ii also abdicated on nov .
9 , 1918 .
but , in a sense , all these strands of history lead back to a september day nearly 70 years ago when nazi troops crossed the border into poland , sparking six years of war and unleashing the barbarity of the third reich on eastern europe .
it is a measure of the ongoing fascination with the horrors of nazism that there seems little end to the book and movie industry that has grown up around it .
british historian richard evans has just published the third reich at war , the final instalment in his trilogy of books on nazi germany .
new york-born director bryan singer 's " valkyrie , " a film about the 1944 plot to assassinate hitler starring hollywood actor tom cruise , came out in the us at christmas and will open in germany in january .

1 , 1939 , next year also marks the 20th anniversary of the fall of communism across central europe .
starting with democratic elections in poland in june 1989 , the year of change across central europe culminated in november of that year with the fall of the berlin wall .
that event became a symbol of the end of the cold war and europe 's post-war divide .
the breaching of the berlin wall also led to the unseating of the soviet-backed government in prague and the ousting of romanian president nicolae ceausescu a few weeks later .
on christmas day , ceausescu and his wife were executed by firing squad following a bloody revolution in the country to unseat the hated dictator .
a new study released this month said , however , that germans living in the country 's former communist east felt they were second-class citizens in the reunified germany that emerged following the fall of the wall .
undertaken by the university of bielefeld , the study revealed lingering resentment in the east about life since a popular uprising in late 1989 paved the way for the collapse of east germany 's stalinist government .
shift to the west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stalinist regimes were toppled after the collapse of the berlin wall decades later both eastern and western europe are still grappling with the events surrounding world war two and the fall of communism , as well as struggling to forge a new identity in a world now shaped by fast-paced globalization .
" the common past is a chance for the future , " polish foreign minister radoslav sikorski said in a speech delivered in berlin this month .
" the events followed a decades-long struggle by those who refused to abandon their freedom , " sikorski said .
triggered by former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev 's drive for glasnost - openness - and perestroika - economic change - the fall of communism across central europe in 1989 also ultimately helped loosen communist grip on moscow and pave the way a few years later for the collapse of soviet russia .
nearly 20 years after the communist governments of central europe fell like dominoes , the region 's new political leadership is still trying to sweep away the industrial and social debris left by decades of command economics .
this transformation has been signified by a strong shift towards western-style economic systems .
however , this process is now likely to be made more complicated by the economic downturn rapidly taking hold around the world .

9 , 1918 .
but , in a sense , all these strands of history lead back to a september day nearly 70 years ago when nazi troops crossed the border into poland , sparking six years of war and unleashing the barbarity of the third reich on eastern europe .
it is a measure of the ongoing fascination with the horrors of nazism that there seems little end to the book and movie industry that has grown up around it .
british historian richard evans has just published the third reich at war , the final instalment in his trilogy of books on nazi germany .

always second best bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs another steffi graf berlin and leipzig have suffered embarrassment in their attempts to host olympic games in recent years .
major events such as wimbledon are no longer broadcast on free-to-air television channels and there is no footage at all of the elite golden league athletics series as soccer rules the airwaves , pushing out almost anything else .
perennial runner-up michael ballack was the only german on the shortlist for the 2009 world footballer award .
katrin krabbe was the last german to win an athletics world title on the track in 1991 .
and the tennis glory days of boris becker and steffi graf are long gone .
germany placed fifth in the medal table at the beijing olympics , but a report from a leipzig-based training institute -lrb- iat -rrb- said that was no reason to cheer .
" high-performance sport in germany is in danger of losing contact to developments in world sports .
performances are on the decline in many sports , " the sueddeutsche zeitung -lrb- sz -rrb- newspaper wrote in mid-december , quoting an iat report .
bleak all year ' round bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael ballack has had to be content with second place had britta steffen not managed to win gold medals in the 50 and 100-meter freestyle events in beijing , germany would have ended with no gold at all in the showcase sports of athletics and swimming , which alone account for 81 of the 302 gold medals on offer at the games .
the winter situation is similar , with germany only a minor player in the popular sports of alpine skiing and figure skating .
instead , german athletes win their medals in luge , biathlon or bobsleigh , events which are not popular in many countries .
according to the sz , germany is the only country from the world 's big six - the others being the us , china , great britain , russia and australia - which does n't focus on sports with the most medals on offer or those with a long tradition in the country .
the iat criticism ranges from badly educated coaches to a lack of scientific support .
stellar stadiums are n't enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's winter sports prowess is also lacking only last week germany coach joachim loew and other officials went to france to look at the country 's famous soccer academy in clairefontaine .
germany has no such institute and lags behind in club and country competitions .
" we are world class as far as stadium atmosphere is concerned .
but we must do more on the pitch , " said former german soccer coach juergen klinsmann , now in charge at bayern munich .
germany came in second at euro 2008 but had its tactical deficits exposed by spain .
the last title came at euro 1996 and the world cup has not been won since 1990 .
just one year later krabbe - whose name has been tainted by doping allegations - claimed the last major sprint title when athletes from former east germany still ruled the scene shortly after the 1990 reunification .
doping-infested cycling is also on its way out and so is tennis , with the hamburg masters downgraded and the women 's berlin tournament possibly moving elsewhere .
winter olympics offers hope bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cars might be german , but the races are held elsewhere germany may also be without a formula one grand prix in 2010 , even though it is a country which has two major team players in mercedes and bmw , a record four drivers in the field and the most successful driver ever in seven-time champion michael schumacher .
the main hopes for a better future lie in improved training programs , a rise of new talent and the hosting of big events .
munich is setting up a promising bid for the 2018 winter olympics and officials have high hopes in the athletics worlds in berlin as well .
" we can all make 2009 a historic year in german athletics , " pledged clemens prokop , president of the german athletics association . dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

1 , 1939 , next year also marks the 20th anniversary of the fall of communism across central europe .
starting with democratic elections in poland in june 1989 , the year of change across central europe culminated in november of that year with the fall of the berlin wall .
that event became a symbol of the end of the cold war and europe 's post-war divide .
the breaching of the berlin wall also led to the unseating of the soviet-backed government in prague and the ousting of romanian president nicolae ceausescu a few weeks later .
on christmas day , ceausescu and his wife were executed by firing squad following a bloody revolution in the country to unseat the hated dictator .
a new study released this month said , however , that germans living in the country 's former communist east felt they were second-class citizens in the reunified germany that emerged following the fall of the wall .
undertaken by the university of bielefeld , the study revealed lingering resentment in the east about life since a popular uprising in late 1989 paved the way for the collapse of east germany 's stalinist government .
shift to the west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stalinist regimes were toppled after the collapse of the berlin wall decades later both eastern and western europe are still grappling with the events surrounding world war two and the fall of communism , as well as struggling to forge a new identity in a world now shaped by fast-paced globalization .
" the common past is a chance for the future , " polish foreign minister radoslav sikorski said in a speech delivered in berlin this month .
" the events followed a decades-long struggle by those who refused to abandon their freedom , " sikorski said .
triggered by former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev 's drive for glasnost - openness - and perestroika - economic change - the fall of communism across central europe in 1989 also ultimately helped loosen communist grip on moscow and pave the way a few years later for the collapse of soviet russia .
nearly 20 years after the communist governments of central europe fell like dominoes , the region 's new political leadership is still trying to sweep away the industrial and social debris left by decades of command economics .
this transformation has been signified by a strong shift towards western-style economic systems .
however , this process is now likely to be made more complicated by the economic downturn rapidly taking hold around the world .
specter of the nazi state bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kristallnacht saw nazi thugs set fire to synagogues and loot jewish businesses november 9 rears itself as a strangely recurring date in german history .
this date marks hitler 's stepped-up reign of terror against jews on kristallnacht - the night of the broken glass - and the failure of his beer hall putsch in bavaria in 1923 .
kaiser wilhem ii also abdicated on nov .
9 , 1918 .
but , in a sense , all these strands of history lead back to a september day nearly 70 years ago when nazi troops crossed the border into poland , sparking six years of war and unleashing the barbarity of the third reich on eastern europe .
it is a measure of the ongoing fascination with the horrors of nazism that there seems little end to the book and movie industry that has grown up around it .
british historian richard evans has just published the third reich at war , the final instalment in his trilogy of books on nazi germany .
new york-born director bryan singer 's " valkyrie , " a film about the 1944 plot to assassinate hitler starring hollywood actor tom cruise , came out in the us at christmas and will open in germany in january .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de foreign relations -pipe- 28.12.2008 2008 : a tough year in german foreign policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and frank-walter steinmeier lead germany 's coalition government germany 's government in 2008 was tested by the world 's financial crisis and the military mission in afghanistan while frictions dominated the ruling coalition .
barack obama , however , was cheered across party lines . during the most dazzling event of the year in foreign policy in germany , the spotlight was n't on the german government , but on an american : barack obama .
as the presidential candidate of the democratic party , he visited berlin and held a much-anticipated speech at the victory column in front of 200,000 . it is highly unlikely - no , simply unimaginable - that as many people would have poured into the tiergarten , berlin 's central park , had it been the chancellor or and a group of high-ranking german politicians on stage instead of obama .
members of germany 's political class these days inspire more yawns than cheers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berliners welcomed obama at his speech at the victory column barack obama chose the monument as the place for his speech after some discussion – looking back it proved to be an omen of success .
in november , a delighted angela merkel congratulated the winner . " we 're witnessing a historical election victory , " merkel said . " no , we ca n't " obama delivered a wide-ranging speech and putting the focus on trans-atlantic ties .
in the eyes of many germans george w. bush had ruined those .
so hardly anybody noticed bush 's parting visit to angela merkel . merkel had tried to explain to him the pain threshold in german foreign policy , for example afghanistan .
under no circumstances did the german government want to send troops to the hard-fought south of afghanistan . the next task is to convince the american president-elect that germany 's version of his famous slogan is : " no , we ca n't . "
the german government is convinced to be doing enough for the stabilization of afghanistan . only in october , germany 's parliament voted to extend the country 's military mission and to deploy an extra 1,000 troops there , boosting their number to 4,500 .
germany 's allies should appreciate this commitment , said german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier . " we have pointed out in the past what germany does in afghanistan , not only the bundeswehr , but also what our civil helpers do for reconstruction , " steinmeier said .
" we get a lot of respect for that , also in the united states of america . " afghanistan remains key issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr forces patrolling on the outskirts of kunduz , northern afghanistan afghanistan remained one of the most controversial security topics for the german government in 2008 .
the training of the afghan police and army was plagued with problems .
regularly , the taliban fired at bundeswehr camps and attacked patrols . in october , two german soldiers died near kundus in a suicide attack .
for the first time since german soldiers were sent to afghanistan six years ago , german defense minister franz josef jung referred in november to the gefallene , or fallen soldiers , who had died there .
until now , any german soldiers killed in afghanistan were referred to as casualties . throughout 2008 , the military played an important role in german foreign policy .
german soldiers were deployed to afghanistan , kosovo , bosnia , the horn of africa and to the coast of lebanon .
unarmed forces were sent to southern sudan and georgia .
at the end of 2008 the bundeswehr took part in the european anti-pirate-force " atalanta " along the coast of somalia . but seen as a whole , german foreign policy in 2008 came across as fractured and heading in too many directions .
while , 2007 was dominated by major events such as the eu presidency and the g8 summit in heiligendamm , a clear course was never set for 2008 .
part of what was accomplished in 2007 fell victim to the global financial crisis and the irish eu " no " vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy did n't call and invite angela merkel to the mini-summit merkel stopped being the woman of action and was overshadowed by french president nicolas sarkozy 's overdrive .
in december , merkel - notable among european leaders for her wariness about increasing public borrowing to fund government spending - was excluded from a mini-summit initiated by sarkozy .
steinmeier was not amused . " i 'll be honest : i do n't think it was nice that germany and the chancellor were n't there , " he said . frictions within german government coalition another dilemma put a strain on german foreign policy in 2008 : the two most important people , christian democrat merkel and social democrat steinmeier disagreed on a number of issues , especially in the approach to countries like russia , china and syria . merkel either tends to be quite frank and open or she contains herself .
steinmeier places emphasis on rapproachment though diplomacy and dialogue .
their differing styles of policy-making led to some confusion in 2008 - much to the pleasure of the opposition .
the green party 's juergen trittin accused the government of having not one but two foreign policies . " one of them is responsible for the dalai lama , the other one for china , " trittin said .
" the foreign minister advocates dialogue with syria and is being criticized for it by the christian democrats .
or when asked what the government thinks of the positioning of new american missiles in europe , you wo n't get a consistent answer ! " merkel vs. steinmeier bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier wants to challenge merkel in next year 's election the disagreements also affected the dalai lama 's visit to germany : german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , a social democrat , was the only cabinet member to receive him .
the year before , chancellor merkel 's reception of the exiled tibetan spiritual leader angered china as well as her own foreign minister , who accused her of trying to " showcase " human rights . foreign policy expectations for 2009 are low : in october , steinmeier won his party 's support to face merkel in next year 's election .

whether its swimming , soccer or skiing , sports commentators are finding reasons to be pessimistic about 2009 . first , the good news .
germany will host the world athletics championships in 2009 .
but apart from that berlin event , the forecast for the nation 's sports is as bleak as the glum economic predictions .
the former sports power lacks stars in major sports ranging from football to athletics and swimming .
in addition , there is an almost frightening disappearance of events from tennis to formula one .
always second best bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs another steffi graf berlin and leipzig have suffered embarrassment in their attempts to host olympic games in recent years .
major events such as wimbledon are no longer broadcast on free-to-air television channels and there is no footage at all of the elite golden league athletics series as soccer rules the airwaves , pushing out almost anything else .
perennial runner-up michael ballack was the only german on the shortlist for the 2009 world footballer award .
katrin krabbe was the last german to win an athletics world title on the track in 1991 .
and the tennis glory days of boris becker and steffi graf are long gone .
germany placed fifth in the medal table at the beijing olympics , but a report from a leipzig-based training institute -lrb- iat -rrb- said that was no reason to cheer .
" high-performance sport in germany is in danger of losing contact to developments in world sports .
performances are on the decline in many sports , " the sueddeutsche zeitung -lrb- sz -rrb- newspaper wrote in mid-december , quoting an iat report .
bleak all year ' round bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael ballack has had to be content with second place had britta steffen not managed to win gold medals in the 50 and 100-meter freestyle events in beijing , germany would have ended with no gold at all in the showcase sports of athletics and swimming , which alone account for 81 of the 302 gold medals on offer at the games .
the winter situation is similar , with germany only a minor player in the popular sports of alpine skiing and figure skating .
instead , german athletes win their medals in luge , biathlon or bobsleigh , events which are not popular in many countries .
according to the sz , germany is the only country from the world 's big six - the others being the us , china , great britain , russia and australia - which does n't focus on sports with the most medals on offer or those with a long tradition in the country .
the iat criticism ranges from badly educated coaches to a lack of scientific support .
stellar stadiums are n't enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's winter sports prowess is also lacking only last week germany coach joachim loew and other officials went to france to look at the country 's famous soccer academy in clairefontaine .
germany has no such institute and lags behind in club and country competitions .
" we are world class as far as stadium atmosphere is concerned .
but we must do more on the pitch , " said former german soccer coach juergen klinsmann , now in charge at bayern munich .
germany came in second at euro 2008 but had its tactical deficits exposed by spain .
the last title came at euro 1996 and the world cup has not been won since 1990 .
just one year later krabbe - whose name has been tainted by doping allegations - claimed the last major sprint title when athletes from former east germany still ruled the scene shortly after the 1990 reunification .
doping-infested cycling is also on its way out and so is tennis , with the hamburg masters downgraded and the women 's berlin tournament possibly moving elsewhere .
winter olympics offers hope bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cars might be german , but the races are held elsewhere germany may also be without a formula one grand prix in 2010 , even though it is a country which has two major team players in mercedes and bmw , a record four drivers in the field and the most successful driver ever in seven-time champion michael schumacher .
the main hopes for a better future lie in improved training programs , a rise of new talent and the hosting of big events .
munich is setting up a promising bid for the 2018 winter olympics and officials have high hopes in the athletics worlds in berlin as well .
" we can all make 2009 a historic year in german athletics , " pledged clemens prokop , president of the german athletics association . dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

barack obama , however , was cheered across party lines . during the most dazzling event of the year in foreign policy in germany , the spotlight was n't on the german government , but on an american : barack obama .
as the presidential candidate of the democratic party , he visited berlin and held a much-anticipated speech at the victory column in front of 200,000 . it is highly unlikely - no , simply unimaginable - that as many people would have poured into the tiergarten , berlin 's central park , had it been the chancellor or and a group of high-ranking german politicians on stage instead of obama .
members of germany 's political class these days inspire more yawns than cheers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berliners welcomed obama at his speech at the victory column barack obama chose the monument as the place for his speech after some discussion – looking back it proved to be an omen of success .
in november , a delighted angela merkel congratulated the winner . " we 're witnessing a historical election victory , " merkel said . " no , we ca n't " obama delivered a wide-ranging speech and putting the focus on trans-atlantic ties .

barack obama , however , was cheered across party lines . during the most dazzling event of the year in foreign policy in germany , the spotlight was n't on the german government , but on an american : barack obama .
as the presidential candidate of the democratic party , he visited berlin and held a much-anticipated speech at the victory column in front of 200,000 . it is highly unlikely - no , simply unimaginable - that as many people would have poured into the tiergarten , berlin 's central park , had it been the chancellor or and a group of high-ranking german politicians on stage instead of obama .
members of germany 's political class these days inspire more yawns than cheers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berliners welcomed obama at his speech at the victory column barack obama chose the monument as the place for his speech after some discussion – looking back it proved to be an omen of success .
in november , a delighted angela merkel congratulated the winner . " we 're witnessing a historical election victory , " merkel said . " no , we ca n't " obama delivered a wide-ranging speech and putting the focus on trans-atlantic ties .
in the eyes of many germans george w. bush had ruined those .
so hardly anybody noticed bush 's parting visit to angela merkel . merkel had tried to explain to him the pain threshold in german foreign policy , for example afghanistan .
under no circumstances did the german government want to send troops to the hard-fought south of afghanistan . the next task is to convince the american president-elect that germany 's version of his famous slogan is : " no , we ca n't . "
the german government is convinced to be doing enough for the stabilization of afghanistan . only in october , germany 's parliament voted to extend the country 's military mission and to deploy an extra 1,000 troops there , boosting their number to 4,500 .
germany 's allies should appreciate this commitment , said german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier . " we have pointed out in the past what germany does in afghanistan , not only the bundeswehr , but also what our civil helpers do for reconstruction , " steinmeier said .
" we get a lot of respect for that , also in the united states of america . " afghanistan remains key issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr forces patrolling on the outskirts of kunduz , northern afghanistan afghanistan remained one of the most controversial security topics for the german government in 2008 .
the training of the afghan police and army was plagued with problems .
regularly , the taliban fired at bundeswehr camps and attacked patrols . in october , two german soldiers died near kundus in a suicide attack .
for the first time since german soldiers were sent to afghanistan six years ago , german defense minister franz josef jung referred in november to the gefallene , or fallen soldiers , who had died there .
until now , any german soldiers killed in afghanistan were referred to as casualties . throughout 2008 , the military played an important role in german foreign policy .
german soldiers were deployed to afghanistan , kosovo , bosnia , the horn of africa and to the coast of lebanon .
unarmed forces were sent to southern sudan and georgia .
at the end of 2008 the bundeswehr took part in the european anti-pirate-force " atalanta " along the coast of somalia . but seen as a whole , german foreign policy in 2008 came across as fractured and heading in too many directions .
while , 2007 was dominated by major events such as the eu presidency and the g8 summit in heiligendamm , a clear course was never set for 2008 .
part of what was accomplished in 2007 fell victim to the global financial crisis and the irish eu " no " vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy did n't call and invite angela merkel to the mini-summit merkel stopped being the woman of action and was overshadowed by french president nicolas sarkozy 's overdrive .
in december , merkel - notable among european leaders for her wariness about increasing public borrowing to fund government spending - was excluded from a mini-summit initiated by sarkozy .
steinmeier was not amused . " i 'll be honest : i do n't think it was nice that germany and the chancellor were n't there , " he said . frictions within german government coalition another dilemma put a strain on german foreign policy in 2008 : the two most important people , christian democrat merkel and social democrat steinmeier disagreed on a number of issues , especially in the approach to countries like russia , china and syria . merkel either tends to be quite frank and open or she contains herself .
steinmeier places emphasis on rapproachment though diplomacy and dialogue .
their differing styles of policy-making led to some confusion in 2008 - much to the pleasure of the opposition .
the green party 's juergen trittin accused the government of having not one but two foreign policies . " one of them is responsible for the dalai lama , the other one for china , " trittin said .
" the foreign minister advocates dialogue with syria and is being criticized for it by the christian democrats .

the year before , chancellor merkel 's reception of the exiled tibetan spiritual leader angered china as well as her own foreign minister , who accused her of trying to " showcase " human rights . foreign policy expectations for 2009 are low : in october , steinmeier won his party 's support to face merkel in next year 's election .

barack obama , however , was cheered across party lines . during the most dazzling event of the year in foreign policy in germany , the spotlight was n't on the german government , but on an american : barack obama .
as the presidential candidate of the democratic party , he visited berlin and held a much-anticipated speech at the victory column in front of 200,000 . it is highly unlikely - no , simply unimaginable - that as many people would have poured into the tiergarten , berlin 's central park , had it been the chancellor or and a group of high-ranking german politicians on stage instead of obama .
members of germany 's political class these days inspire more yawns than cheers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berliners welcomed obama at his speech at the victory column barack obama chose the monument as the place for his speech after some discussion – looking back it proved to be an omen of success .
in november , a delighted angela merkel congratulated the winner . " we 're witnessing a historical election victory , " merkel said . " no , we ca n't " obama delivered a wide-ranging speech and putting the focus on trans-atlantic ties .
in the eyes of many germans george w. bush had ruined those .
so hardly anybody noticed bush 's parting visit to angela merkel . merkel had tried to explain to him the pain threshold in german foreign policy , for example afghanistan .
under no circumstances did the german government want to send troops to the hard-fought south of afghanistan . the next task is to convince the american president-elect that germany 's version of his famous slogan is : " no , we ca n't . "
the german government is convinced to be doing enough for the stabilization of afghanistan . only in october , germany 's parliament voted to extend the country 's military mission and to deploy an extra 1,000 troops there , boosting their number to 4,500 .
germany 's allies should appreciate this commitment , said german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier . " we have pointed out in the past what germany does in afghanistan , not only the bundeswehr , but also what our civil helpers do for reconstruction , " steinmeier said .
" we get a lot of respect for that , also in the united states of america . " afghanistan remains key issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr forces patrolling on the outskirts of kunduz , northern afghanistan afghanistan remained one of the most controversial security topics for the german government in 2008 .
the training of the afghan police and army was plagued with problems .
regularly , the taliban fired at bundeswehr camps and attacked patrols . in october , two german soldiers died near kundus in a suicide attack .
for the first time since german soldiers were sent to afghanistan six years ago , german defense minister franz josef jung referred in november to the gefallene , or fallen soldiers , who had died there .
until now , any german soldiers killed in afghanistan were referred to as casualties . throughout 2008 , the military played an important role in german foreign policy .
german soldiers were deployed to afghanistan , kosovo , bosnia , the horn of africa and to the coast of lebanon .
unarmed forces were sent to southern sudan and georgia .
at the end of 2008 the bundeswehr took part in the european anti-pirate-force " atalanta " along the coast of somalia . but seen as a whole , german foreign policy in 2008 came across as fractured and heading in too many directions .
while , 2007 was dominated by major events such as the eu presidency and the g8 summit in heiligendamm , a clear course was never set for 2008 .
part of what was accomplished in 2007 fell victim to the global financial crisis and the irish eu " no " vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy did n't call and invite angela merkel to the mini-summit merkel stopped being the woman of action and was overshadowed by french president nicolas sarkozy 's overdrive .
in december , merkel - notable among european leaders for her wariness about increasing public borrowing to fund government spending - was excluded from a mini-summit initiated by sarkozy .
steinmeier was not amused . " i 'll be honest : i do n't think it was nice that germany and the chancellor were n't there , " he said . frictions within german government coalition another dilemma put a strain on german foreign policy in 2008 : the two most important people , christian democrat merkel and social democrat steinmeier disagreed on a number of issues , especially in the approach to countries like russia , china and syria . merkel either tends to be quite frank and open or she contains herself .
steinmeier places emphasis on rapproachment though diplomacy and dialogue .
their differing styles of policy-making led to some confusion in 2008 - much to the pleasure of the opposition .
the green party 's juergen trittin accused the government of having not one but two foreign policies . " one of them is responsible for the dalai lama , the other one for china , " trittin said .
" the foreign minister advocates dialogue with syria and is being criticized for it by the christian democrats .

1 , 1939 , next year also marks the 20th anniversary of the fall of communism across central europe .
starting with democratic elections in poland in june 1989 , the year of change across central europe culminated in november of that year with the fall of the berlin wall .
that event became a symbol of the end of the cold war and europe 's post-war divide .
the breaching of the berlin wall also led to the unseating of the soviet-backed government in prague and the ousting of romanian president nicolae ceausescu a few weeks later .
on christmas day , ceausescu and his wife were executed by firing squad following a bloody revolution in the country to unseat the hated dictator .
a new study released this month said , however , that germans living in the country 's former communist east felt they were second-class citizens in the reunified germany that emerged following the fall of the wall .
undertaken by the university of bielefeld , the study revealed lingering resentment in the east about life since a popular uprising in late 1989 paved the way for the collapse of east germany 's stalinist government .
shift to the west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stalinist regimes were toppled after the collapse of the berlin wall decades later both eastern and western europe are still grappling with the events surrounding world war two and the fall of communism , as well as struggling to forge a new identity in a world now shaped by fast-paced globalization .
" the common past is a chance for the future , " polish foreign minister radoslav sikorski said in a speech delivered in berlin this month .
" the events followed a decades-long struggle by those who refused to abandon their freedom , " sikorski said .
triggered by former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev 's drive for glasnost - openness - and perestroika - economic change - the fall of communism across central europe in 1989 also ultimately helped loosen communist grip on moscow and pave the way a few years later for the collapse of soviet russia .
nearly 20 years after the communist governments of central europe fell like dominoes , the region 's new political leadership is still trying to sweep away the industrial and social debris left by decades of command economics .
this transformation has been signified by a strong shift towards western-style economic systems .
however , this process is now likely to be made more complicated by the economic downturn rapidly taking hold around the world .
specter of the nazi state bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kristallnacht saw nazi thugs set fire to synagogues and loot jewish businesses november 9 rears itself as a strangely recurring date in german history .
this date marks hitler 's stepped-up reign of terror against jews on kristallnacht - the night of the broken glass - and the failure of his beer hall putsch in bavaria in 1923 .

1 , 1939 , next year also marks the 20th anniversary of the fall of communism across central europe .
starting with democratic elections in poland in june 1989 , the year of change across central europe culminated in november of that year with the fall of the berlin wall .
that event became a symbol of the end of the cold war and europe 's post-war divide .
the breaching of the berlin wall also led to the unseating of the soviet-backed government in prague and the ousting of romanian president nicolae ceausescu a few weeks later .
on christmas day , ceausescu and his wife were executed by firing squad following a bloody revolution in the country to unseat the hated dictator .
a new study released this month said , however , that germans living in the country 's former communist east felt they were second-class citizens in the reunified germany that emerged following the fall of the wall .
undertaken by the university of bielefeld , the study revealed lingering resentment in the east about life since a popular uprising in late 1989 paved the way for the collapse of east germany 's stalinist government .
shift to the west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stalinist regimes were toppled after the collapse of the berlin wall decades later both eastern and western europe are still grappling with the events surrounding world war two and the fall of communism , as well as struggling to forge a new identity in a world now shaped by fast-paced globalization .
" the common past is a chance for the future , " polish foreign minister radoslav sikorski said in a speech delivered in berlin this month .
" the events followed a decades-long struggle by those who refused to abandon their freedom , " sikorski said .
triggered by former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev 's drive for glasnost - openness - and perestroika - economic change - the fall of communism across central europe in 1989 also ultimately helped loosen communist grip on moscow and pave the way a few years later for the collapse of soviet russia .
nearly 20 years after the communist governments of central europe fell like dominoes , the region 's new political leadership is still trying to sweep away the industrial and social debris left by decades of command economics .
this transformation has been signified by a strong shift towards western-style economic systems .
however , this process is now likely to be made more complicated by the economic downturn rapidly taking hold around the world .
specter of the nazi state bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kristallnacht saw nazi thugs set fire to synagogues and loot jewish businesses november 9 rears itself as a strangely recurring date in german history .
this date marks hitler 's stepped-up reign of terror against jews on kristallnacht - the night of the broken glass - and the failure of his beer hall putsch in bavaria in 1923 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de foreign relations -pipe- 28.12.2008 2008 : a tough year in german foreign policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and frank-walter steinmeier lead germany 's coalition government germany 's government in 2008 was tested by the world 's financial crisis and the military mission in afghanistan while frictions dominated the ruling coalition .
barack obama , however , was cheered across party lines . during the most dazzling event of the year in foreign policy in germany , the spotlight was n't on the german government , but on an american : barack obama .
as the presidential candidate of the democratic party , he visited berlin and held a much-anticipated speech at the victory column in front of 200,000 . it is highly unlikely - no , simply unimaginable - that as many people would have poured into the tiergarten , berlin 's central park , had it been the chancellor or and a group of high-ranking german politicians on stage instead of obama .
members of germany 's political class these days inspire more yawns than cheers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berliners welcomed obama at his speech at the victory column barack obama chose the monument as the place for his speech after some discussion – looking back it proved to be an omen of success .
in november , a delighted angela merkel congratulated the winner . " we 're witnessing a historical election victory , " merkel said . " no , we ca n't " obama delivered a wide-ranging speech and putting the focus on trans-atlantic ties .
in the eyes of many germans george w. bush had ruined those .
so hardly anybody noticed bush 's parting visit to angela merkel . merkel had tried to explain to him the pain threshold in german foreign policy , for example afghanistan .
under no circumstances did the german government want to send troops to the hard-fought south of afghanistan . the next task is to convince the american president-elect that germany 's version of his famous slogan is : " no , we ca n't . "
the german government is convinced to be doing enough for the stabilization of afghanistan . only in october , germany 's parliament voted to extend the country 's military mission and to deploy an extra 1,000 troops there , boosting their number to 4,500 .
germany 's allies should appreciate this commitment , said german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier . " we have pointed out in the past what germany does in afghanistan , not only the bundeswehr , but also what our civil helpers do for reconstruction , " steinmeier said .
" we get a lot of respect for that , also in the united states of america . " afghanistan remains key issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr forces patrolling on the outskirts of kunduz , northern afghanistan afghanistan remained one of the most controversial security topics for the german government in 2008 .
the training of the afghan police and army was plagued with problems .
regularly , the taliban fired at bundeswehr camps and attacked patrols . in october , two german soldiers died near kundus in a suicide attack .
for the first time since german soldiers were sent to afghanistan six years ago , german defense minister franz josef jung referred in november to the gefallene , or fallen soldiers , who had died there .
until now , any german soldiers killed in afghanistan were referred to as casualties . throughout 2008 , the military played an important role in german foreign policy .
german soldiers were deployed to afghanistan , kosovo , bosnia , the horn of africa and to the coast of lebanon .
unarmed forces were sent to southern sudan and georgia .
at the end of 2008 the bundeswehr took part in the european anti-pirate-force " atalanta " along the coast of somalia . but seen as a whole , german foreign policy in 2008 came across as fractured and heading in too many directions .
while , 2007 was dominated by major events such as the eu presidency and the g8 summit in heiligendamm , a clear course was never set for 2008 .
part of what was accomplished in 2007 fell victim to the global financial crisis and the irish eu " no " vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy did n't call and invite angela merkel to the mini-summit merkel stopped being the woman of action and was overshadowed by french president nicolas sarkozy 's overdrive .
in december , merkel - notable among european leaders for her wariness about increasing public borrowing to fund government spending - was excluded from a mini-summit initiated by sarkozy .
steinmeier was not amused . " i 'll be honest : i do n't think it was nice that germany and the chancellor were n't there , " he said . frictions within german government coalition another dilemma put a strain on german foreign policy in 2008 : the two most important people , christian democrat merkel and social democrat steinmeier disagreed on a number of issues , especially in the approach to countries like russia , china and syria . merkel either tends to be quite frank and open or she contains herself .
steinmeier places emphasis on rapproachment though diplomacy and dialogue .
their differing styles of policy-making led to some confusion in 2008 - much to the pleasure of the opposition .
the green party 's juergen trittin accused the government of having not one but two foreign policies . " one of them is responsible for the dalai lama , the other one for china , " trittin said .
" the foreign minister advocates dialogue with syria and is being criticized for it by the christian democrats .
or when asked what the government thinks of the positioning of new american missiles in europe , you wo n't get a consistent answer ! " merkel vs. steinmeier bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier wants to challenge merkel in next year 's election the disagreements also affected the dalai lama 's visit to germany : german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , a social democrat , was the only cabinet member to receive him .
the year before , chancellor merkel 's reception of the exiled tibetan spiritual leader angered china as well as her own foreign minister , who accused her of trying to " showcase " human rights . foreign policy expectations for 2009 are low : in october , steinmeier won his party 's support to face merkel in next year 's election .

part of what was accomplished in 2007 fell victim to the global financial crisis and the irish eu " no " vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy did n't call and invite angela merkel to the mini-summit merkel stopped being the woman of action and was overshadowed by french president nicolas sarkozy 's overdrive .
in december , merkel - notable among european leaders for her wariness about increasing public borrowing to fund government spending - was excluded from a mini-summit initiated by sarkozy .
steinmeier was not amused . " i 'll be honest : i do n't think it was nice that germany and the chancellor were n't there , " he said . frictions within german government coalition another dilemma put a strain on german foreign policy in 2008 : the two most important people , christian democrat merkel and social democrat steinmeier disagreed on a number of issues , especially in the approach to countries like russia , china and syria . merkel either tends to be quite frank and open or she contains herself .
steinmeier places emphasis on rapproachment though diplomacy and dialogue .
their differing styles of policy-making led to some confusion in 2008 - much to the pleasure of the opposition .
the green party 's juergen trittin accused the government of having not one but two foreign policies . " one of them is responsible for the dalai lama , the other one for china , " trittin said .
" the foreign minister advocates dialogue with syria and is being criticized for it by the christian democrats .
or when asked what the government thinks of the positioning of new american missiles in europe , you wo n't get a consistent answer ! " merkel vs. steinmeier bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier wants to challenge merkel in next year 's election the disagreements also affected the dalai lama 's visit to germany : german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , a social democrat , was the only cabinet member to receive him .
the year before , chancellor merkel 's reception of the exiled tibetan spiritual leader angered china as well as her own foreign minister , who accused her of trying to " showcase " human rights . foreign policy expectations for 2009 are low : in october , steinmeier won his party 's support to face merkel in next year 's election .
an election campaign pitting merkel vs. steinmeier is likely to water down german foreign policy even more . dw staff -lrb- nma -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

whether its swimming , soccer or skiing , sports commentators are finding reasons to be pessimistic about 2009 . first , the good news .
germany will host the world athletics championships in 2009 .
but apart from that berlin event , the forecast for the nation 's sports is as bleak as the glum economic predictions .
the former sports power lacks stars in major sports ranging from football to athletics and swimming .
in addition , there is an almost frightening disappearance of events from tennis to formula one .
always second best bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs another steffi graf berlin and leipzig have suffered embarrassment in their attempts to host olympic games in recent years .
major events such as wimbledon are no longer broadcast on free-to-air television channels and there is no footage at all of the elite golden league athletics series as soccer rules the airwaves , pushing out almost anything else .
perennial runner-up michael ballack was the only german on the shortlist for the 2009 world footballer award .
katrin krabbe was the last german to win an athletics world title on the track in 1991 .
and the tennis glory days of boris becker and steffi graf are long gone .
germany placed fifth in the medal table at the beijing olympics , but a report from a leipzig-based training institute -lrb- iat -rrb- said that was no reason to cheer .
" high-performance sport in germany is in danger of losing contact to developments in world sports .
performances are on the decline in many sports , " the sueddeutsche zeitung -lrb- sz -rrb- newspaper wrote in mid-december , quoting an iat report .
bleak all year ' round bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael ballack has had to be content with second place had britta steffen not managed to win gold medals in the 50 and 100-meter freestyle events in beijing , germany would have ended with no gold at all in the showcase sports of athletics and swimming , which alone account for 81 of the 302 gold medals on offer at the games .
the winter situation is similar , with germany only a minor player in the popular sports of alpine skiing and figure skating .
instead , german athletes win their medals in luge , biathlon or bobsleigh , events which are not popular in many countries .
according to the sz , germany is the only country from the world 's big six - the others being the us , china , great britain , russia and australia - which does n't focus on sports with the most medals on offer or those with a long tradition in the country .
the iat criticism ranges from badly educated coaches to a lack of scientific support .
stellar stadiums are n't enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's winter sports prowess is also lacking only last week germany coach joachim loew and other officials went to france to look at the country 's famous soccer academy in clairefontaine .
germany has no such institute and lags behind in club and country competitions .
" we are world class as far as stadium atmosphere is concerned .
but we must do more on the pitch , " said former german soccer coach juergen klinsmann , now in charge at bayern munich .
germany came in second at euro 2008 but had its tactical deficits exposed by spain .
the last title came at euro 1996 and the world cup has not been won since 1990 .
just one year later krabbe - whose name has been tainted by doping allegations - claimed the last major sprint title when athletes from former east germany still ruled the scene shortly after the 1990 reunification .
doping-infested cycling is also on its way out and so is tennis , with the hamburg masters downgraded and the women 's berlin tournament possibly moving elsewhere .
winter olympics offers hope bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cars might be german , but the races are held elsewhere germany may also be without a formula one grand prix in 2010 , even though it is a country which has two major team players in mercedes and bmw , a record four drivers in the field and the most successful driver ever in seven-time champion michael schumacher .
the main hopes for a better future lie in improved training programs , a rise of new talent and the hosting of big events .
munich is setting up a promising bid for the 2018 winter olympics and officials have high hopes in the athletics worlds in berlin as well .
" we can all make 2009 a historic year in german athletics , " pledged clemens prokop , president of the german athletics association . dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 28.12.2008 opinion : the world ca n't afford to sit back and watch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas and israel are making the same old mistakes all over again because the latest attacks wo n't solve anything .
the world has to finally get involved in the middle east conflict , deutsche welle 's peter philipp says . no country in the world would accept being regularly fired at with rockets and taking no action against it .
that 's why israel is counting on international support and using renewed rocket attacks from the gaza strip since the end of the six-month ceasefire announced by hamas last week as justification for its massive military operation against hamas .
the group along with others in the gaza strip are " taking revenge " by firing rockets once again on southern israel .
unless there 's a miracle , this is the perfect situation for a further escalation which would have unforeseen consequences .
but it 's also a completely superfluous yet final proof that the promises made at the annapolis conference in the us in nov 2007 to resume peace talks with the aim of reaching a comprehensive agreement by the end of 2008 were nothing more than empty words .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp if the end of this year does possibly bring a new open-ended war , then there 's admittedly more to it than the above mentioned rockets .
israel and hamas would go back to the time when both resorted to violence for lack of sensible policies though it was long obvious that violence only creates counter-violence and that the vicious circle can hardly be broken .
repeating old mistakes thus israel is committing a cardinal mistake by believing it can wipe out hamas with a military operation .
just as it thought it could disarm hezbollah two and a half years ago .
the massive attack on lebanon at the time instead bombed hezbollah into the government and the same thing could happen with hamas in palestine .
in january 2006 , hamas won elections and a big israeli offensive would drive the palestinians into group 's arms .
but the frustrated and battered palestinians as well as hamas are making a huge mistake too by hoping that hamas ' uncompromising stance will lead to a solution or deliverance .
hamas ' vehement rejection of israel 's right to exist can not be a foundation for peace .
former plo chief yasser arafat learned that lesson after decades of armed struggle against israel .
the result was the olso treaty and palestinian autonomy .
but israel squandered a chance for peace by diluting oslo .
it did that by building new settlements in the occupied territories for instance and thus destroying any hopes that the palestinians had pinned on the treaty .
israel 's one-sided retreat from the gaza strip did n't do anything to change that .
an " occupied " territory turned into a " besieged " one under tight blockades particularly when hamas took control of gaza .
as always , it was the always the wrong people who suffered the most .
it was n't the ideologues or the snipers but rather civilians - women , children , old people - who bore the brunt .
they will be the ones who will do so again in the current escalation .
bombs after all do n't differentiate between people .
the world can no longer afford to sit back and watch .
if international troops can be mobilized for the fight against terrorists and pirates , then the world should be able to do more in palestine than simply pay lip service .
at least in order to prevent the worst if not to bring peace .

the world has to finally get involved in the middle east conflict , deutsche welle 's peter philipp says . no country in the world would accept being regularly fired at with rockets and taking no action against it .
that 's why israel is counting on international support and using renewed rocket attacks from the gaza strip since the end of the six-month ceasefire announced by hamas last week as justification for its massive military operation against hamas .
the group along with others in the gaza strip are " taking revenge " by firing rockets once again on southern israel .
unless there 's a miracle , this is the perfect situation for a further escalation which would have unforeseen consequences .
but it 's also a completely superfluous yet final proof that the promises made at the annapolis conference in the us in nov 2007 to resume peace talks with the aim of reaching a comprehensive agreement by the end of 2008 were nothing more than empty words .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp if the end of this year does possibly bring a new open-ended war , then there 's admittedly more to it than the above mentioned rockets .
israel and hamas would go back to the time when both resorted to violence for lack of sensible policies though it was long obvious that violence only creates counter-violence and that the vicious circle can hardly be broken .
repeating old mistakes thus israel is committing a cardinal mistake by believing it can wipe out hamas with a military operation .
just as it thought it could disarm hezbollah two and a half years ago .
the massive attack on lebanon at the time instead bombed hezbollah into the government and the same thing could happen with hamas in palestine .
in january 2006 , hamas won elections and a big israeli offensive would drive the palestinians into group 's arms .
but the frustrated and battered palestinians as well as hamas are making a huge mistake too by hoping that hamas ' uncompromising stance will lead to a solution or deliverance .
hamas ' vehement rejection of israel 's right to exist can not be a foundation for peace .
former plo chief yasser arafat learned that lesson after decades of armed struggle against israel .
the result was the olso treaty and palestinian autonomy .
but israel squandered a chance for peace by diluting oslo .
it did that by building new settlements in the occupied territories for instance and thus destroying any hopes that the palestinians had pinned on the treaty .
israel 's one-sided retreat from the gaza strip did n't do anything to change that .
an " occupied " territory turned into a " besieged " one under tight blockades particularly when hamas took control of gaza .
as always , it was the always the wrong people who suffered the most .
it was n't the ideologues or the snipers but rather civilians - women , children , old people - who bore the brunt .
they will be the ones who will do so again in the current escalation .
bombs after all do n't differentiate between people .
the world can no longer afford to sit back and watch .
if international troops can be mobilized for the fight against terrorists and pirates , then the world should be able to do more in palestine than simply pay lip service .
at least in order to prevent the worst if not to bring peace .

the world has to finally get involved in the middle east conflict , deutsche welle 's peter philipp says . no country in the world would accept being regularly fired at with rockets and taking no action against it .
that 's why israel is counting on international support and using renewed rocket attacks from the gaza strip since the end of the six-month ceasefire announced by hamas last week as justification for its massive military operation against hamas .
the group along with others in the gaza strip are " taking revenge " by firing rockets once again on southern israel .
unless there 's a miracle , this is the perfect situation for a further escalation which would have unforeseen consequences .
but it 's also a completely superfluous yet final proof that the promises made at the annapolis conference in the us in nov 2007 to resume peace talks with the aim of reaching a comprehensive agreement by the end of 2008 were nothing more than empty words .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp if the end of this year does possibly bring a new open-ended war , then there 's admittedly more to it than the above mentioned rockets .
israel and hamas would go back to the time when both resorted to violence for lack of sensible policies though it was long obvious that violence only creates counter-violence and that the vicious circle can hardly be broken .
repeating old mistakes thus israel is committing a cardinal mistake by believing it can wipe out hamas with a military operation .
just as it thought it could disarm hezbollah two and a half years ago .
the massive attack on lebanon at the time instead bombed hezbollah into the government and the same thing could happen with hamas in palestine .
in january 2006 , hamas won elections and a big israeli offensive would drive the palestinians into group 's arms .
but the frustrated and battered palestinians as well as hamas are making a huge mistake too by hoping that hamas ' uncompromising stance will lead to a solution or deliverance .
hamas ' vehement rejection of israel 's right to exist can not be a foundation for peace .
former plo chief yasser arafat learned that lesson after decades of armed struggle against israel .
the result was the olso treaty and palestinian autonomy .
but israel squandered a chance for peace by diluting oslo .
it did that by building new settlements in the occupied territories for instance and thus destroying any hopes that the palestinians had pinned on the treaty .
israel 's one-sided retreat from the gaza strip did n't do anything to change that .
an " occupied " territory turned into a " besieged " one under tight blockades particularly when hamas took control of gaza .
as always , it was the always the wrong people who suffered the most .
it was n't the ideologues or the snipers but rather civilians - women , children , old people - who bore the brunt .
they will be the ones who will do so again in the current escalation .
bombs after all do n't differentiate between people .
the world can no longer afford to sit back and watch .
if international troops can be mobilized for the fight against terrorists and pirates , then the world should be able to do more in palestine than simply pay lip service .
at least in order to prevent the worst if not to bring peace .

1 , 1939 , next year also marks the 20th anniversary of the fall of communism across central europe .
starting with democratic elections in poland in june 1989 , the year of change across central europe culminated in november of that year with the fall of the berlin wall .
that event became a symbol of the end of the cold war and europe 's post-war divide .
the breaching of the berlin wall also led to the unseating of the soviet-backed government in prague and the ousting of romanian president nicolae ceausescu a few weeks later .
on christmas day , ceausescu and his wife were executed by firing squad following a bloody revolution in the country to unseat the hated dictator .
a new study released this month said , however , that germans living in the country 's former communist east felt they were second-class citizens in the reunified germany that emerged following the fall of the wall .
undertaken by the university of bielefeld , the study revealed lingering resentment in the east about life since a popular uprising in late 1989 paved the way for the collapse of east germany 's stalinist government .

" the common past is a chance for the future , " polish foreign minister radoslav sikorski said in a speech delivered in berlin this month .
" the events followed a decades-long struggle by those who refused to abandon their freedom , " sikorski said .
triggered by former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev 's drive for glasnost - openness - and perestroika - economic change - the fall of communism across central europe in 1989 also ultimately helped loosen communist grip on moscow and pave the way a few years later for the collapse of soviet russia .
nearly 20 years after the communist governments of central europe fell like dominoes , the region 's new political leadership is still trying to sweep away the industrial and social debris left by decades of command economics .
this transformation has been signified by a strong shift towards western-style economic systems .
however , this process is now likely to be made more complicated by the economic downturn rapidly taking hold around the world .

1 , 1939 , next year also marks the 20th anniversary of the fall of communism across central europe .
starting with democratic elections in poland in june 1989 , the year of change across central europe culminated in november of that year with the fall of the berlin wall .
that event became a symbol of the end of the cold war and europe 's post-war divide .
the breaching of the berlin wall also led to the unseating of the soviet-backed government in prague and the ousting of romanian president nicolae ceausescu a few weeks later .
on christmas day , ceausescu and his wife were executed by firing squad following a bloody revolution in the country to unseat the hated dictator .
a new study released this month said , however , that germans living in the country 's former communist east felt they were second-class citizens in the reunified germany that emerged following the fall of the wall .
undertaken by the university of bielefeld , the study revealed lingering resentment in the east about life since a popular uprising in late 1989 paved the way for the collapse of east germany 's stalinist government .
shift to the west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stalinist regimes were toppled after the collapse of the berlin wall decades later both eastern and western europe are still grappling with the events surrounding world war two and the fall of communism , as well as struggling to forge a new identity in a world now shaped by fast-paced globalization .
" the common past is a chance for the future , " polish foreign minister radoslav sikorski said in a speech delivered in berlin this month .
" the events followed a decades-long struggle by those who refused to abandon their freedom , " sikorski said .
triggered by former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev 's drive for glasnost - openness - and perestroika - economic change - the fall of communism across central europe in 1989 also ultimately helped loosen communist grip on moscow and pave the way a few years later for the collapse of soviet russia .
nearly 20 years after the communist governments of central europe fell like dominoes , the region 's new political leadership is still trying to sweep away the industrial and social debris left by decades of command economics .
this transformation has been signified by a strong shift towards western-style economic systems .
however , this process is now likely to be made more complicated by the economic downturn rapidly taking hold around the world .
specter of the nazi state bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kristallnacht saw nazi thugs set fire to synagogues and loot jewish businesses november 9 rears itself as a strangely recurring date in german history .

9 , 1918 .
but , in a sense , all these strands of history lead back to a september day nearly 70 years ago when nazi troops crossed the border into poland , sparking six years of war and unleashing the barbarity of the third reich on eastern europe .
it is a measure of the ongoing fascination with the horrors of nazism that there seems little end to the book and movie industry that has grown up around it .
british historian richard evans has just published the third reich at war , the final instalment in his trilogy of books on nazi germany .

barack obama , however , was cheered across party lines . during the most dazzling event of the year in foreign policy in germany , the spotlight was n't on the german government , but on an american : barack obama .
as the presidential candidate of the democratic party , he visited berlin and held a much-anticipated speech at the victory column in front of 200,000 . it is highly unlikely - no , simply unimaginable - that as many people would have poured into the tiergarten , berlin 's central park , had it been the chancellor or and a group of high-ranking german politicians on stage instead of obama .
members of germany 's political class these days inspire more yawns than cheers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berliners welcomed obama at his speech at the victory column barack obama chose the monument as the place for his speech after some discussion – looking back it proved to be an omen of success .
in november , a delighted angela merkel congratulated the winner . " we 're witnessing a historical election victory , " merkel said . " no , we ca n't " obama delivered a wide-ranging speech and putting the focus on trans-atlantic ties .
in the eyes of many germans george w. bush had ruined those .
so hardly anybody noticed bush 's parting visit to angela merkel . merkel had tried to explain to him the pain threshold in german foreign policy , for example afghanistan .
under no circumstances did the german government want to send troops to the hard-fought south of afghanistan . the next task is to convince the american president-elect that germany 's version of his famous slogan is : " no , we ca n't . "
the german government is convinced to be doing enough for the stabilization of afghanistan . only in october , germany 's parliament voted to extend the country 's military mission and to deploy an extra 1,000 troops there , boosting their number to 4,500 .
germany 's allies should appreciate this commitment , said german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier . " we have pointed out in the past what germany does in afghanistan , not only the bundeswehr , but also what our civil helpers do for reconstruction , " steinmeier said .
" we get a lot of respect for that , also in the united states of america . " afghanistan remains key issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr forces patrolling on the outskirts of kunduz , northern afghanistan afghanistan remained one of the most controversial security topics for the german government in 2008 .
the training of the afghan police and army was plagued with problems .
regularly , the taliban fired at bundeswehr camps and attacked patrols . in october , two german soldiers died near kundus in a suicide attack .
for the first time since german soldiers were sent to afghanistan six years ago , german defense minister franz josef jung referred in november to the gefallene , or fallen soldiers , who had died there .
until now , any german soldiers killed in afghanistan were referred to as casualties . throughout 2008 , the military played an important role in german foreign policy .
german soldiers were deployed to afghanistan , kosovo , bosnia , the horn of africa and to the coast of lebanon .
unarmed forces were sent to southern sudan and georgia .
at the end of 2008 the bundeswehr took part in the european anti-pirate-force " atalanta " along the coast of somalia . but seen as a whole , german foreign policy in 2008 came across as fractured and heading in too many directions .
while , 2007 was dominated by major events such as the eu presidency and the g8 summit in heiligendamm , a clear course was never set for 2008 .
part of what was accomplished in 2007 fell victim to the global financial crisis and the irish eu " no " vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy did n't call and invite angela merkel to the mini-summit merkel stopped being the woman of action and was overshadowed by french president nicolas sarkozy 's overdrive .
in december , merkel - notable among european leaders for her wariness about increasing public borrowing to fund government spending - was excluded from a mini-summit initiated by sarkozy .
steinmeier was not amused . " i 'll be honest : i do n't think it was nice that germany and the chancellor were n't there , " he said . frictions within german government coalition another dilemma put a strain on german foreign policy in 2008 : the two most important people , christian democrat merkel and social democrat steinmeier disagreed on a number of issues , especially in the approach to countries like russia , china and syria . merkel either tends to be quite frank and open or she contains herself .
steinmeier places emphasis on rapproachment though diplomacy and dialogue .
their differing styles of policy-making led to some confusion in 2008 - much to the pleasure of the opposition .
the green party 's juergen trittin accused the government of having not one but two foreign policies . " one of them is responsible for the dalai lama , the other one for china , " trittin said .
" the foreign minister advocates dialogue with syria and is being criticized for it by the christian democrats .
or when asked what the government thinks of the positioning of new american missiles in europe , you wo n't get a consistent answer ! " merkel vs. steinmeier bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier wants to challenge merkel in next year 's election the disagreements also affected the dalai lama 's visit to germany : german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , a social democrat , was the only cabinet member to receive him .
the year before , chancellor merkel 's reception of the exiled tibetan spiritual leader angered china as well as her own foreign minister , who accused her of trying to " showcase " human rights . foreign policy expectations for 2009 are low : in october , steinmeier won his party 's support to face merkel in next year 's election .
an election campaign pitting merkel vs. steinmeier is likely to water down german foreign policy even more . dw staff -lrb- nma -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de foreign relations -pipe- 28.12.2008 2008 : a tough year in german foreign policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and frank-walter steinmeier lead germany 's coalition government germany 's government in 2008 was tested by the world 's financial crisis and the military mission in afghanistan while frictions dominated the ruling coalition .
barack obama , however , was cheered across party lines . during the most dazzling event of the year in foreign policy in germany , the spotlight was n't on the german government , but on an american : barack obama .
as the presidential candidate of the democratic party , he visited berlin and held a much-anticipated speech at the victory column in front of 200,000 . it is highly unlikely - no , simply unimaginable - that as many people would have poured into the tiergarten , berlin 's central park , had it been the chancellor or and a group of high-ranking german politicians on stage instead of obama .
members of germany 's political class these days inspire more yawns than cheers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berliners welcomed obama at his speech at the victory column barack obama chose the monument as the place for his speech after some discussion – looking back it proved to be an omen of success .
in november , a delighted angela merkel congratulated the winner . " we 're witnessing a historical election victory , " merkel said . " no , we ca n't " obama delivered a wide-ranging speech and putting the focus on trans-atlantic ties .
in the eyes of many germans george w. bush had ruined those .
so hardly anybody noticed bush 's parting visit to angela merkel . merkel had tried to explain to him the pain threshold in german foreign policy , for example afghanistan .
under no circumstances did the german government want to send troops to the hard-fought south of afghanistan . the next task is to convince the american president-elect that germany 's version of his famous slogan is : " no , we ca n't . "
the german government is convinced to be doing enough for the stabilization of afghanistan . only in october , germany 's parliament voted to extend the country 's military mission and to deploy an extra 1,000 troops there , boosting their number to 4,500 .
germany 's allies should appreciate this commitment , said german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier . " we have pointed out in the past what germany does in afghanistan , not only the bundeswehr , but also what our civil helpers do for reconstruction , " steinmeier said .
" we get a lot of respect for that , also in the united states of america . " afghanistan remains key issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr forces patrolling on the outskirts of kunduz , northern afghanistan afghanistan remained one of the most controversial security topics for the german government in 2008 .
the training of the afghan police and army was plagued with problems .
regularly , the taliban fired at bundeswehr camps and attacked patrols . in october , two german soldiers died near kundus in a suicide attack .
for the first time since german soldiers were sent to afghanistan six years ago , german defense minister franz josef jung referred in november to the gefallene , or fallen soldiers , who had died there .
until now , any german soldiers killed in afghanistan were referred to as casualties . throughout 2008 , the military played an important role in german foreign policy .
german soldiers were deployed to afghanistan , kosovo , bosnia , the horn of africa and to the coast of lebanon .
unarmed forces were sent to southern sudan and georgia .
at the end of 2008 the bundeswehr took part in the european anti-pirate-force " atalanta " along the coast of somalia . but seen as a whole , german foreign policy in 2008 came across as fractured and heading in too many directions .
while , 2007 was dominated by major events such as the eu presidency and the g8 summit in heiligendamm , a clear course was never set for 2008 .
part of what was accomplished in 2007 fell victim to the global financial crisis and the irish eu " no " vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy did n't call and invite angela merkel to the mini-summit merkel stopped being the woman of action and was overshadowed by french president nicolas sarkozy 's overdrive .
in december , merkel - notable among european leaders for her wariness about increasing public borrowing to fund government spending - was excluded from a mini-summit initiated by sarkozy .
steinmeier was not amused . " i 'll be honest : i do n't think it was nice that germany and the chancellor were n't there , " he said . frictions within german government coalition another dilemma put a strain on german foreign policy in 2008 : the two most important people , christian democrat merkel and social democrat steinmeier disagreed on a number of issues , especially in the approach to countries like russia , china and syria . merkel either tends to be quite frank and open or she contains herself .
steinmeier places emphasis on rapproachment though diplomacy and dialogue .
their differing styles of policy-making led to some confusion in 2008 - much to the pleasure of the opposition .
the green party 's juergen trittin accused the government of having not one but two foreign policies . " one of them is responsible for the dalai lama , the other one for china , " trittin said .
" the foreign minister advocates dialogue with syria and is being criticized for it by the christian democrats .
or when asked what the government thinks of the positioning of new american missiles in europe , you wo n't get a consistent answer ! " merkel vs. steinmeier bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier wants to challenge merkel in next year 's election the disagreements also affected the dalai lama 's visit to germany : german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , a social democrat , was the only cabinet member to receive him .
the year before , chancellor merkel 's reception of the exiled tibetan spiritual leader angered china as well as her own foreign minister , who accused her of trying to " showcase " human rights . foreign policy expectations for 2009 are low : in october , steinmeier won his party 's support to face merkel in next year 's election .

barack obama , however , was cheered across party lines . during the most dazzling event of the year in foreign policy in germany , the spotlight was n't on the german government , but on an american : barack obama .
as the presidential candidate of the democratic party , he visited berlin and held a much-anticipated speech at the victory column in front of 200,000 . it is highly unlikely - no , simply unimaginable - that as many people would have poured into the tiergarten , berlin 's central park , had it been the chancellor or and a group of high-ranking german politicians on stage instead of obama .
members of germany 's political class these days inspire more yawns than cheers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berliners welcomed obama at his speech at the victory column barack obama chose the monument as the place for his speech after some discussion – looking back it proved to be an omen of success .
in november , a delighted angela merkel congratulated the winner . " we 're witnessing a historical election victory , " merkel said . " no , we ca n't " obama delivered a wide-ranging speech and putting the focus on trans-atlantic ties .
in the eyes of many germans george w. bush had ruined those .
so hardly anybody noticed bush 's parting visit to angela merkel . merkel had tried to explain to him the pain threshold in german foreign policy , for example afghanistan .
under no circumstances did the german government want to send troops to the hard-fought south of afghanistan . the next task is to convince the american president-elect that germany 's version of his famous slogan is : " no , we ca n't . "
the german government is convinced to be doing enough for the stabilization of afghanistan . only in october , germany 's parliament voted to extend the country 's military mission and to deploy an extra 1,000 troops there , boosting their number to 4,500 .
germany 's allies should appreciate this commitment , said german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier . " we have pointed out in the past what germany does in afghanistan , not only the bundeswehr , but also what our civil helpers do for reconstruction , " steinmeier said .

german soldiers were deployed to afghanistan , kosovo , bosnia , the horn of africa and to the coast of lebanon .
unarmed forces were sent to southern sudan and georgia .

1 , 1939 , next year also marks the 20th anniversary of the fall of communism across central europe .
starting with democratic elections in poland in june 1989 , the year of change across central europe culminated in november of that year with the fall of the berlin wall .
that event became a symbol of the end of the cold war and europe 's post-war divide .
the breaching of the berlin wall also led to the unseating of the soviet-backed government in prague and the ousting of romanian president nicolae ceausescu a few weeks later .
on christmas day , ceausescu and his wife were executed by firing squad following a bloody revolution in the country to unseat the hated dictator .
a new study released this month said , however , that germans living in the country 's former communist east felt they were second-class citizens in the reunified germany that emerged following the fall of the wall .
undertaken by the university of bielefeld , the study revealed lingering resentment in the east about life since a popular uprising in late 1989 paved the way for the collapse of east germany 's stalinist government .
shift to the west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stalinist regimes were toppled after the collapse of the berlin wall decades later both eastern and western europe are still grappling with the events surrounding world war two and the fall of communism , as well as struggling to forge a new identity in a world now shaped by fast-paced globalization .
" the common past is a chance for the future , " polish foreign minister radoslav sikorski said in a speech delivered in berlin this month .
" the events followed a decades-long struggle by those who refused to abandon their freedom , " sikorski said .
triggered by former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev 's drive for glasnost - openness - and perestroika - economic change - the fall of communism across central europe in 1989 also ultimately helped loosen communist grip on moscow and pave the way a few years later for the collapse of soviet russia .
nearly 20 years after the communist governments of central europe fell like dominoes , the region 's new political leadership is still trying to sweep away the industrial and social debris left by decades of command economics .
this transformation has been signified by a strong shift towards western-style economic systems .
however , this process is now likely to be made more complicated by the economic downturn rapidly taking hold around the world .
specter of the nazi state bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kristallnacht saw nazi thugs set fire to synagogues and loot jewish businesses november 9 rears itself as a strangely recurring date in german history .
this date marks hitler 's stepped-up reign of terror against jews on kristallnacht - the night of the broken glass - and the failure of his beer hall putsch in bavaria in 1923 .
kaiser wilhem ii also abdicated on nov .
9 , 1918 .
but , in a sense , all these strands of history lead back to a september day nearly 70 years ago when nazi troops crossed the border into poland , sparking six years of war and unleashing the barbarity of the third reich on eastern europe .
it is a measure of the ongoing fascination with the horrors of nazism that there seems little end to the book and movie industry that has grown up around it .
british historian richard evans has just published the third reich at war , the final instalment in his trilogy of books on nazi germany .
new york-born director bryan singer 's " valkyrie , " a film about the 1944 plot to assassinate hitler starring hollywood actor tom cruise , came out in the us at christmas and will open in germany in january .

barack obama , however , was cheered across party lines . during the most dazzling event of the year in foreign policy in germany , the spotlight was n't on the german government , but on an american : barack obama .
as the presidential candidate of the democratic party , he visited berlin and held a much-anticipated speech at the victory column in front of 200,000 . it is highly unlikely - no , simply unimaginable - that as many people would have poured into the tiergarten , berlin 's central park , had it been the chancellor or and a group of high-ranking german politicians on stage instead of obama .
members of germany 's political class these days inspire more yawns than cheers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berliners welcomed obama at his speech at the victory column barack obama chose the monument as the place for his speech after some discussion – looking back it proved to be an omen of success .
in november , a delighted angela merkel congratulated the winner . " we 're witnessing a historical election victory , " merkel said . " no , we ca n't " obama delivered a wide-ranging speech and putting the focus on trans-atlantic ties .
in the eyes of many germans george w. bush had ruined those .
so hardly anybody noticed bush 's parting visit to angela merkel . merkel had tried to explain to him the pain threshold in german foreign policy , for example afghanistan .
under no circumstances did the german government want to send troops to the hard-fought south of afghanistan . the next task is to convince the american president-elect that germany 's version of his famous slogan is : " no , we ca n't . "
the german government is convinced to be doing enough for the stabilization of afghanistan . only in october , germany 's parliament voted to extend the country 's military mission and to deploy an extra 1,000 troops there , boosting their number to 4,500 .
germany 's allies should appreciate this commitment , said german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier . " we have pointed out in the past what germany does in afghanistan , not only the bundeswehr , but also what our civil helpers do for reconstruction , " steinmeier said .
" we get a lot of respect for that , also in the united states of america . " afghanistan remains key issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr forces patrolling on the outskirts of kunduz , northern afghanistan afghanistan remained one of the most controversial security topics for the german government in 2008 .
the training of the afghan police and army was plagued with problems .
regularly , the taliban fired at bundeswehr camps and attacked patrols . in october , two german soldiers died near kundus in a suicide attack .
for the first time since german soldiers were sent to afghanistan six years ago , german defense minister franz josef jung referred in november to the gefallene , or fallen soldiers , who had died there .
until now , any german soldiers killed in afghanistan were referred to as casualties . throughout 2008 , the military played an important role in german foreign policy .
german soldiers were deployed to afghanistan , kosovo , bosnia , the horn of africa and to the coast of lebanon .
unarmed forces were sent to southern sudan and georgia .
at the end of 2008 the bundeswehr took part in the european anti-pirate-force " atalanta " along the coast of somalia . but seen as a whole , german foreign policy in 2008 came across as fractured and heading in too many directions .
while , 2007 was dominated by major events such as the eu presidency and the g8 summit in heiligendamm , a clear course was never set for 2008 .
part of what was accomplished in 2007 fell victim to the global financial crisis and the irish eu " no " vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy did n't call and invite angela merkel to the mini-summit merkel stopped being the woman of action and was overshadowed by french president nicolas sarkozy 's overdrive .
in december , merkel - notable among european leaders for her wariness about increasing public borrowing to fund government spending - was excluded from a mini-summit initiated by sarkozy .
steinmeier was not amused . " i 'll be honest : i do n't think it was nice that germany and the chancellor were n't there , " he said . frictions within german government coalition another dilemma put a strain on german foreign policy in 2008 : the two most important people , christian democrat merkel and social democrat steinmeier disagreed on a number of issues , especially in the approach to countries like russia , china and syria . merkel either tends to be quite frank and open or she contains herself .
steinmeier places emphasis on rapproachment though diplomacy and dialogue .
their differing styles of policy-making led to some confusion in 2008 - much to the pleasure of the opposition .
the green party 's juergen trittin accused the government of having not one but two foreign policies . " one of them is responsible for the dalai lama , the other one for china , " trittin said .
" the foreign minister advocates dialogue with syria and is being criticized for it by the christian democrats .
or when asked what the government thinks of the positioning of new american missiles in europe , you wo n't get a consistent answer ! " merkel vs. steinmeier bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier wants to challenge merkel in next year 's election the disagreements also affected the dalai lama 's visit to germany : german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , a social democrat , was the only cabinet member to receive him .
the year before , chancellor merkel 's reception of the exiled tibetan spiritual leader angered china as well as her own foreign minister , who accused her of trying to " showcase " human rights . foreign policy expectations for 2009 are low : in october , steinmeier won his party 's support to face merkel in next year 's election .

1 , 1939 , next year also marks the 20th anniversary of the fall of communism across central europe .
starting with democratic elections in poland in june 1989 , the year of change across central europe culminated in november of that year with the fall of the berlin wall .
that event became a symbol of the end of the cold war and europe 's post-war divide .
the breaching of the berlin wall also led to the unseating of the soviet-backed government in prague and the ousting of romanian president nicolae ceausescu a few weeks later .
on christmas day , ceausescu and his wife were executed by firing squad following a bloody revolution in the country to unseat the hated dictator .
a new study released this month said , however , that germans living in the country 's former communist east felt they were second-class citizens in the reunified germany that emerged following the fall of the wall .
undertaken by the university of bielefeld , the study revealed lingering resentment in the east about life since a popular uprising in late 1989 paved the way for the collapse of east germany 's stalinist government .
shift to the west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stalinist regimes were toppled after the collapse of the berlin wall decades later both eastern and western europe are still grappling with the events surrounding world war two and the fall of communism , as well as struggling to forge a new identity in a world now shaped by fast-paced globalization .
" the common past is a chance for the future , " polish foreign minister radoslav sikorski said in a speech delivered in berlin this month .
" the events followed a decades-long struggle by those who refused to abandon their freedom , " sikorski said .
triggered by former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev 's drive for glasnost - openness - and perestroika - economic change - the fall of communism across central europe in 1989 also ultimately helped loosen communist grip on moscow and pave the way a few years later for the collapse of soviet russia .
nearly 20 years after the communist governments of central europe fell like dominoes , the region 's new political leadership is still trying to sweep away the industrial and social debris left by decades of command economics .
this transformation has been signified by a strong shift towards western-style economic systems .
however , this process is now likely to be made more complicated by the economic downturn rapidly taking hold around the world .

1 , 1939 , next year also marks the 20th anniversary of the fall of communism across central europe .
starting with democratic elections in poland in june 1989 , the year of change across central europe culminated in november of that year with the fall of the berlin wall .
that event became a symbol of the end of the cold war and europe 's post-war divide .
the breaching of the berlin wall also led to the unseating of the soviet-backed government in prague and the ousting of romanian president nicolae ceausescu a few weeks later .
on christmas day , ceausescu and his wife were executed by firing squad following a bloody revolution in the country to unseat the hated dictator .
a new study released this month said , however , that germans living in the country 's former communist east felt they were second-class citizens in the reunified germany that emerged following the fall of the wall .
undertaken by the university of bielefeld , the study revealed lingering resentment in the east about life since a popular uprising in late 1989 paved the way for the collapse of east germany 's stalinist government .
shift to the west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stalinist regimes were toppled after the collapse of the berlin wall decades later both eastern and western europe are still grappling with the events surrounding world war two and the fall of communism , as well as struggling to forge a new identity in a world now shaped by fast-paced globalization .
" the common past is a chance for the future , " polish foreign minister radoslav sikorski said in a speech delivered in berlin this month .
" the events followed a decades-long struggle by those who refused to abandon their freedom , " sikorski said .
triggered by former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev 's drive for glasnost - openness - and perestroika - economic change - the fall of communism across central europe in 1989 also ultimately helped loosen communist grip on moscow and pave the way a few years later for the collapse of soviet russia .
nearly 20 years after the communist governments of central europe fell like dominoes , the region 's new political leadership is still trying to sweep away the industrial and social debris left by decades of command economics .
this transformation has been signified by a strong shift towards western-style economic systems .
however , this process is now likely to be made more complicated by the economic downturn rapidly taking hold around the world .
specter of the nazi state bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kristallnacht saw nazi thugs set fire to synagogues and loot jewish businesses november 9 rears itself as a strangely recurring date in german history .
this date marks hitler 's stepped-up reign of terror against jews on kristallnacht - the night of the broken glass - and the failure of his beer hall putsch in bavaria in 1923 .
kaiser wilhem ii also abdicated on nov .
9 , 1918 .
but , in a sense , all these strands of history lead back to a september day nearly 70 years ago when nazi troops crossed the border into poland , sparking six years of war and unleashing the barbarity of the third reich on eastern europe .
it is a measure of the ongoing fascination with the horrors of nazism that there seems little end to the book and movie industry that has grown up around it .
british historian richard evans has just published the third reich at war , the final instalment in his trilogy of books on nazi germany .
new york-born director bryan singer 's " valkyrie , " a film about the 1944 plot to assassinate hitler starring hollywood actor tom cruise , came out in the us at christmas and will open in germany in january .

the world has to finally get involved in the middle east conflict , deutsche welle 's peter philipp says . no country in the world would accept being regularly fired at with rockets and taking no action against it .
that 's why israel is counting on international support and using renewed rocket attacks from the gaza strip since the end of the six-month ceasefire announced by hamas last week as justification for its massive military operation against hamas .
the group along with others in the gaza strip are " taking revenge " by firing rockets once again on southern israel .
unless there 's a miracle , this is the perfect situation for a further escalation which would have unforeseen consequences .
but it 's also a completely superfluous yet final proof that the promises made at the annapolis conference in the us in nov 2007 to resume peace talks with the aim of reaching a comprehensive agreement by the end of 2008 were nothing more than empty words .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp if the end of this year does possibly bring a new open-ended war , then there 's admittedly more to it than the above mentioned rockets .
israel and hamas would go back to the time when both resorted to violence for lack of sensible policies though it was long obvious that violence only creates counter-violence and that the vicious circle can hardly be broken .
repeating old mistakes thus israel is committing a cardinal mistake by believing it can wipe out hamas with a military operation .
just as it thought it could disarm hezbollah two and a half years ago .
the massive attack on lebanon at the time instead bombed hezbollah into the government and the same thing could happen with hamas in palestine .
in january 2006 , hamas won elections and a big israeli offensive would drive the palestinians into group 's arms .
but the frustrated and battered palestinians as well as hamas are making a huge mistake too by hoping that hamas ' uncompromising stance will lead to a solution or deliverance .
hamas ' vehement rejection of israel 's right to exist can not be a foundation for peace .
former plo chief yasser arafat learned that lesson after decades of armed struggle against israel .
the result was the olso treaty and palestinian autonomy .
but israel squandered a chance for peace by diluting oslo .
it did that by building new settlements in the occupied territories for instance and thus destroying any hopes that the palestinians had pinned on the treaty .
israel 's one-sided retreat from the gaza strip did n't do anything to change that .
an " occupied " territory turned into a " besieged " one under tight blockades particularly when hamas took control of gaza .
as always , it was the always the wrong people who suffered the most .
it was n't the ideologues or the snipers but rather civilians - women , children , old people - who bore the brunt .
they will be the ones who will do so again in the current escalation .
bombs after all do n't differentiate between people .
the world can no longer afford to sit back and watch .
if international troops can be mobilized for the fight against terrorists and pirates , then the world should be able to do more in palestine than simply pay lip service .
at least in order to prevent the worst if not to bring peace .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 28.12.2008 opinion : the world ca n't afford to sit back and watch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas and israel are making the same old mistakes all over again because the latest attacks wo n't solve anything .
the world has to finally get involved in the middle east conflict , deutsche welle 's peter philipp says . no country in the world would accept being regularly fired at with rockets and taking no action against it .
that 's why israel is counting on international support and using renewed rocket attacks from the gaza strip since the end of the six-month ceasefire announced by hamas last week as justification for its massive military operation against hamas .
the group along with others in the gaza strip are " taking revenge " by firing rockets once again on southern israel .
unless there 's a miracle , this is the perfect situation for a further escalation which would have unforeseen consequences .
but it 's also a completely superfluous yet final proof that the promises made at the annapolis conference in the us in nov 2007 to resume peace talks with the aim of reaching a comprehensive agreement by the end of 2008 were nothing more than empty words .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp if the end of this year does possibly bring a new open-ended war , then there 's admittedly more to it than the above mentioned rockets .
israel and hamas would go back to the time when both resorted to violence for lack of sensible policies though it was long obvious that violence only creates counter-violence and that the vicious circle can hardly be broken .
repeating old mistakes thus israel is committing a cardinal mistake by believing it can wipe out hamas with a military operation .
just as it thought it could disarm hezbollah two and a half years ago .
the massive attack on lebanon at the time instead bombed hezbollah into the government and the same thing could happen with hamas in palestine .
in january 2006 , hamas won elections and a big israeli offensive would drive the palestinians into group 's arms .
but the frustrated and battered palestinians as well as hamas are making a huge mistake too by hoping that hamas ' uncompromising stance will lead to a solution or deliverance .
hamas ' vehement rejection of israel 's right to exist can not be a foundation for peace .
former plo chief yasser arafat learned that lesson after decades of armed struggle against israel .
the result was the olso treaty and palestinian autonomy .
but israel squandered a chance for peace by diluting oslo .
it did that by building new settlements in the occupied territories for instance and thus destroying any hopes that the palestinians had pinned on the treaty .
israel 's one-sided retreat from the gaza strip did n't do anything to change that .
an " occupied " territory turned into a " besieged " one under tight blockades particularly when hamas took control of gaza .
as always , it was the always the wrong people who suffered the most .
it was n't the ideologues or the snipers but rather civilians - women , children , old people - who bore the brunt .
they will be the ones who will do so again in the current escalation .
bombs after all do n't differentiate between people .
the world can no longer afford to sit back and watch .
if international troops can be mobilized for the fight against terrorists and pirates , then the world should be able to do more in palestine than simply pay lip service .
at least in order to prevent the worst if not to bring peace .

" the current israeli strikes are inflicting an unacceptable toll on palestinian civilians and will only worsen the humanitarian crisis as well as complicate the search for a peaceful solution , " eu high representative javier solana said in a statement . " i call for an immediate cessation of military actions on both sides .
the eu has repeatedly condemned rocket attacks against israel , " the statement said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana solana 's comment came hours after the french government , which holds the eu 's rotating presidency until the end of the year , condemned a series of rocket attacks on israel launched from the gaza strip as an " unjustifiable provocation " and the israeli response as " disproportionate . " the eu sees israel as one of its most important foreign partners , but is the largest donor of aid to the palestinian territories , giving it a keen interest in seeing stability in the region . recently , the bloc has highlighted israel 's closure of the key crossings into and out of gaza as exacerbating the already difficult situation . day two israeli aircraft pounded the gaza strip for the second day sunday , hitting a hamas headquarters in gaza city , witnesses said , and bringing to 22 the number of attacks launched against the islamist movement since midnight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas has continued launching rocket attacks on israel the death toll in the israeli raids stood at 271 by mid-morning sunday , the majority believed to be militants .

the world has to finally get involved in the middle east conflict , deutsche welle 's peter philipp says . no country in the world would accept being regularly fired at with rockets and taking no action against it .
that 's why israel is counting on international support and using renewed rocket attacks from the gaza strip since the end of the six-month ceasefire announced by hamas last week as justification for its massive military operation against hamas .
the group along with others in the gaza strip are " taking revenge " by firing rockets once again on southern israel .
unless there 's a miracle , this is the perfect situation for a further escalation which would have unforeseen consequences .
but it 's also a completely superfluous yet final proof that the promises made at the annapolis conference in the us in nov 2007 to resume peace talks with the aim of reaching a comprehensive agreement by the end of 2008 were nothing more than empty words .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp if the end of this year does possibly bring a new open-ended war , then there 's admittedly more to it than the above mentioned rockets .
israel and hamas would go back to the time when both resorted to violence for lack of sensible policies though it was long obvious that violence only creates counter-violence and that the vicious circle can hardly be broken .
repeating old mistakes thus israel is committing a cardinal mistake by believing it can wipe out hamas with a military operation .
just as it thought it could disarm hezbollah two and a half years ago .
the massive attack on lebanon at the time instead bombed hezbollah into the government and the same thing could happen with hamas in palestine .
in january 2006 , hamas won elections and a big israeli offensive would drive the palestinians into group 's arms .
but the frustrated and battered palestinians as well as hamas are making a huge mistake too by hoping that hamas ' uncompromising stance will lead to a solution or deliverance .
hamas ' vehement rejection of israel 's right to exist can not be a foundation for peace .
former plo chief yasser arafat learned that lesson after decades of armed struggle against israel .
the result was the olso treaty and palestinian autonomy .
but israel squandered a chance for peace by diluting oslo .
it did that by building new settlements in the occupied territories for instance and thus destroying any hopes that the palestinians had pinned on the treaty .
israel 's one-sided retreat from the gaza strip did n't do anything to change that .
an " occupied " territory turned into a " besieged " one under tight blockades particularly when hamas took control of gaza .
as always , it was the always the wrong people who suffered the most .
it was n't the ideologues or the snipers but rather civilians - women , children , old people - who bore the brunt .
they will be the ones who will do so again in the current escalation .
bombs after all do n't differentiate between people .
the world can no longer afford to sit back and watch .
if international troops can be mobilized for the fight against terrorists and pirates , then the world should be able to do more in palestine than simply pay lip service .
at least in order to prevent the worst if not to bring peace .

1 , 1939 , next year also marks the 20th anniversary of the fall of communism across central europe .
starting with democratic elections in poland in june 1989 , the year of change across central europe culminated in november of that year with the fall of the berlin wall .
that event became a symbol of the end of the cold war and europe 's post-war divide .
the breaching of the berlin wall also led to the unseating of the soviet-backed government in prague and the ousting of romanian president nicolae ceausescu a few weeks later .
on christmas day , ceausescu and his wife were executed by firing squad following a bloody revolution in the country to unseat the hated dictator .
a new study released this month said , however , that germans living in the country 's former communist east felt they were second-class citizens in the reunified germany that emerged following the fall of the wall .
undertaken by the university of bielefeld , the study revealed lingering resentment in the east about life since a popular uprising in late 1989 paved the way for the collapse of east germany 's stalinist government .
shift to the west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stalinist regimes were toppled after the collapse of the berlin wall decades later both eastern and western europe are still grappling with the events surrounding world war two and the fall of communism , as well as struggling to forge a new identity in a world now shaped by fast-paced globalization .
" the common past is a chance for the future , " polish foreign minister radoslav sikorski said in a speech delivered in berlin this month .
" the events followed a decades-long struggle by those who refused to abandon their freedom , " sikorski said .
triggered by former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev 's drive for glasnost - openness - and perestroika - economic change - the fall of communism across central europe in 1989 also ultimately helped loosen communist grip on moscow and pave the way a few years later for the collapse of soviet russia .
nearly 20 years after the communist governments of central europe fell like dominoes , the region 's new political leadership is still trying to sweep away the industrial and social debris left by decades of command economics .
this transformation has been signified by a strong shift towards western-style economic systems .
however , this process is now likely to be made more complicated by the economic downturn rapidly taking hold around the world .
specter of the nazi state bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kristallnacht saw nazi thugs set fire to synagogues and loot jewish businesses november 9 rears itself as a strangely recurring date in german history .
this date marks hitler 's stepped-up reign of terror against jews on kristallnacht - the night of the broken glass - and the failure of his beer hall putsch in bavaria in 1923 .
kaiser wilhem ii also abdicated on nov .
9 , 1918 .
but , in a sense , all these strands of history lead back to a september day nearly 70 years ago when nazi troops crossed the border into poland , sparking six years of war and unleashing the barbarity of the third reich on eastern europe .
it is a measure of the ongoing fascination with the horrors of nazism that there seems little end to the book and movie industry that has grown up around it .
british historian richard evans has just published the third reich at war , the final instalment in his trilogy of books on nazi germany .
new york-born director bryan singer 's " valkyrie , " a film about the 1944 plot to assassinate hitler starring hollywood actor tom cruise , came out in the us at christmas and will open in germany in january .
brd , euro celebrated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad adenauer was the first chancellor of the federal republic of germany other commemorations to take place in europe in 2009 include the ceremonies surrounding the 60th anniversaries of the creation of the federal republic of germany -lrb- brd -rrb- and the formation of the us-led nato security alliance .
next year will also mark the 10th birthday of the euro , which became the accounting currency of 12 european states on jan .
1 , 1999 .

barack obama , however , was cheered across party lines . during the most dazzling event of the year in foreign policy in germany , the spotlight was n't on the german government , but on an american : barack obama .
as the presidential candidate of the democratic party , he visited berlin and held a much-anticipated speech at the victory column in front of 200,000 . it is highly unlikely - no , simply unimaginable - that as many people would have poured into the tiergarten , berlin 's central park , had it been the chancellor or and a group of high-ranking german politicians on stage instead of obama .
members of germany 's political class these days inspire more yawns than cheers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berliners welcomed obama at his speech at the victory column barack obama chose the monument as the place for his speech after some discussion – looking back it proved to be an omen of success .
in november , a delighted angela merkel congratulated the winner . " we 're witnessing a historical election victory , " merkel said . " no , we ca n't " obama delivered a wide-ranging speech and putting the focus on trans-atlantic ties .
in the eyes of many germans george w. bush had ruined those .
so hardly anybody noticed bush 's parting visit to angela merkel . merkel had tried to explain to him the pain threshold in german foreign policy , for example afghanistan .
under no circumstances did the german government want to send troops to the hard-fought south of afghanistan . the next task is to convince the american president-elect that germany 's version of his famous slogan is : " no , we ca n't . "
the german government is convinced to be doing enough for the stabilization of afghanistan . only in october , germany 's parliament voted to extend the country 's military mission and to deploy an extra 1,000 troops there , boosting their number to 4,500 .
germany 's allies should appreciate this commitment , said german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier . " we have pointed out in the past what germany does in afghanistan , not only the bundeswehr , but also what our civil helpers do for reconstruction , " steinmeier said .
" we get a lot of respect for that , also in the united states of america . " afghanistan remains key issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr forces patrolling on the outskirts of kunduz , northern afghanistan afghanistan remained one of the most controversial security topics for the german government in 2008 .
the training of the afghan police and army was plagued with problems .
regularly , the taliban fired at bundeswehr camps and attacked patrols . in october , two german soldiers died near kundus in a suicide attack .
for the first time since german soldiers were sent to afghanistan six years ago , german defense minister franz josef jung referred in november to the gefallene , or fallen soldiers , who had died there .
until now , any german soldiers killed in afghanistan were referred to as casualties . throughout 2008 , the military played an important role in german foreign policy .
german soldiers were deployed to afghanistan , kosovo , bosnia , the horn of africa and to the coast of lebanon .
unarmed forces were sent to southern sudan and georgia .
at the end of 2008 the bundeswehr took part in the european anti-pirate-force " atalanta " along the coast of somalia . but seen as a whole , german foreign policy in 2008 came across as fractured and heading in too many directions .
while , 2007 was dominated by major events such as the eu presidency and the g8 summit in heiligendamm , a clear course was never set for 2008 .
part of what was accomplished in 2007 fell victim to the global financial crisis and the irish eu " no " vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy did n't call and invite angela merkel to the mini-summit merkel stopped being the woman of action and was overshadowed by french president nicolas sarkozy 's overdrive .
in december , merkel - notable among european leaders for her wariness about increasing public borrowing to fund government spending - was excluded from a mini-summit initiated by sarkozy .
steinmeier was not amused . " i 'll be honest : i do n't think it was nice that germany and the chancellor were n't there , " he said . frictions within german government coalition another dilemma put a strain on german foreign policy in 2008 : the two most important people , christian democrat merkel and social democrat steinmeier disagreed on a number of issues , especially in the approach to countries like russia , china and syria . merkel either tends to be quite frank and open or she contains herself .
steinmeier places emphasis on rapproachment though diplomacy and dialogue .
their differing styles of policy-making led to some confusion in 2008 - much to the pleasure of the opposition .
the green party 's juergen trittin accused the government of having not one but two foreign policies . " one of them is responsible for the dalai lama , the other one for china , " trittin said .
" the foreign minister advocates dialogue with syria and is being criticized for it by the christian democrats .

the year before , chancellor merkel 's reception of the exiled tibetan spiritual leader angered china as well as her own foreign minister , who accused her of trying to " showcase " human rights . foreign policy expectations for 2009 are low : in october , steinmeier won his party 's support to face merkel in next year 's election .

the world has to finally get involved in the middle east conflict , deutsche welle 's peter philipp says . no country in the world would accept being regularly fired at with rockets and taking no action against it .
that 's why israel is counting on international support and using renewed rocket attacks from the gaza strip since the end of the six-month ceasefire announced by hamas last week as justification for its massive military operation against hamas .
the group along with others in the gaza strip are " taking revenge " by firing rockets once again on southern israel .
unless there 's a miracle , this is the perfect situation for a further escalation which would have unforeseen consequences .
but it 's also a completely superfluous yet final proof that the promises made at the annapolis conference in the us in nov 2007 to resume peace talks with the aim of reaching a comprehensive agreement by the end of 2008 were nothing more than empty words .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp if the end of this year does possibly bring a new open-ended war , then there 's admittedly more to it than the above mentioned rockets .
israel and hamas would go back to the time when both resorted to violence for lack of sensible policies though it was long obvious that violence only creates counter-violence and that the vicious circle can hardly be broken .
repeating old mistakes thus israel is committing a cardinal mistake by believing it can wipe out hamas with a military operation .
just as it thought it could disarm hezbollah two and a half years ago .
the massive attack on lebanon at the time instead bombed hezbollah into the government and the same thing could happen with hamas in palestine .
in january 2006 , hamas won elections and a big israeli offensive would drive the palestinians into group 's arms .
but the frustrated and battered palestinians as well as hamas are making a huge mistake too by hoping that hamas ' uncompromising stance will lead to a solution or deliverance .
hamas ' vehement rejection of israel 's right to exist can not be a foundation for peace .
former plo chief yasser arafat learned that lesson after decades of armed struggle against israel .
the result was the olso treaty and palestinian autonomy .
but israel squandered a chance for peace by diluting oslo .
it did that by building new settlements in the occupied territories for instance and thus destroying any hopes that the palestinians had pinned on the treaty .
israel 's one-sided retreat from the gaza strip did n't do anything to change that .
an " occupied " territory turned into a " besieged " one under tight blockades particularly when hamas took control of gaza .
as always , it was the always the wrong people who suffered the most .
it was n't the ideologues or the snipers but rather civilians - women , children , old people - who bore the brunt .
they will be the ones who will do so again in the current escalation .
bombs after all do n't differentiate between people .
the world can no longer afford to sit back and watch .
if international troops can be mobilized for the fight against terrorists and pirates , then the world should be able to do more in palestine than simply pay lip service .
at least in order to prevent the worst if not to bring peace .

the world has to finally get involved in the middle east conflict , deutsche welle 's peter philipp says . no country in the world would accept being regularly fired at with rockets and taking no action against it .
that 's why israel is counting on international support and using renewed rocket attacks from the gaza strip since the end of the six-month ceasefire announced by hamas last week as justification for its massive military operation against hamas .
the group along with others in the gaza strip are " taking revenge " by firing rockets once again on southern israel .
unless there 's a miracle , this is the perfect situation for a further escalation which would have unforeseen consequences .
but it 's also a completely superfluous yet final proof that the promises made at the annapolis conference in the us in nov 2007 to resume peace talks with the aim of reaching a comprehensive agreement by the end of 2008 were nothing more than empty words .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp if the end of this year does possibly bring a new open-ended war , then there 's admittedly more to it than the above mentioned rockets .
israel and hamas would go back to the time when both resorted to violence for lack of sensible policies though it was long obvious that violence only creates counter-violence and that the vicious circle can hardly be broken .
repeating old mistakes thus israel is committing a cardinal mistake by believing it can wipe out hamas with a military operation .
just as it thought it could disarm hezbollah two and a half years ago .
the massive attack on lebanon at the time instead bombed hezbollah into the government and the same thing could happen with hamas in palestine .
in january 2006 , hamas won elections and a big israeli offensive would drive the palestinians into group 's arms .
but the frustrated and battered palestinians as well as hamas are making a huge mistake too by hoping that hamas ' uncompromising stance will lead to a solution or deliverance .
hamas ' vehement rejection of israel 's right to exist can not be a foundation for peace .
former plo chief yasser arafat learned that lesson after decades of armed struggle against israel .
the result was the olso treaty and palestinian autonomy .
but israel squandered a chance for peace by diluting oslo .
it did that by building new settlements in the occupied territories for instance and thus destroying any hopes that the palestinians had pinned on the treaty .
israel 's one-sided retreat from the gaza strip did n't do anything to change that .
an " occupied " territory turned into a " besieged " one under tight blockades particularly when hamas took control of gaza .
as always , it was the always the wrong people who suffered the most .
it was n't the ideologues or the snipers but rather civilians - women , children , old people - who bore the brunt .
they will be the ones who will do so again in the current escalation .
bombs after all do n't differentiate between people .
the world can no longer afford to sit back and watch .
if international troops can be mobilized for the fight against terrorists and pirates , then the world should be able to do more in palestine than simply pay lip service .
at least in order to prevent the worst if not to bring peace .

the eu has repeatedly condemned rocket attacks against israel , " the statement said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana solana 's comment came hours after the french government , which holds the eu 's rotating presidency until the end of the year , condemned a series of rocket attacks on israel launched from the gaza strip as an " unjustifiable provocation " and the israeli response as " disproportionate . " the eu sees israel as one of its most important foreign partners , but is the largest donor of aid to the palestinian territories , giving it a keen interest in seeing stability in the region . recently , the bloc has highlighted israel 's closure of the key crossings into and out of gaza as exacerbating the already difficult situation . day two israeli aircraft pounded the gaza strip for the second day sunday , hitting a hamas headquarters in gaza city , witnesses said , and bringing to 22 the number of attacks launched against the islamist movement since midnight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas has continued launching rocket attacks on israel the death toll in the israeli raids stood at 271 by mid-morning sunday , the majority believed to be militants .

whether its swimming , soccer or skiing , sports commentators are finding reasons to be pessimistic about 2009 . first , the good news .
germany will host the world athletics championships in 2009 .
but apart from that berlin event , the forecast for the nation 's sports is as bleak as the glum economic predictions .
the former sports power lacks stars in major sports ranging from football to athletics and swimming .
in addition , there is an almost frightening disappearance of events from tennis to formula one .
always second best bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs another steffi graf berlin and leipzig have suffered embarrassment in their attempts to host olympic games in recent years .
major events such as wimbledon are no longer broadcast on free-to-air television channels and there is no footage at all of the elite golden league athletics series as soccer rules the airwaves , pushing out almost anything else .
perennial runner-up michael ballack was the only german on the shortlist for the 2009 world footballer award .
katrin krabbe was the last german to win an athletics world title on the track in 1991 .
and the tennis glory days of boris becker and steffi graf are long gone .
germany placed fifth in the medal table at the beijing olympics , but a report from a leipzig-based training institute -lrb- iat -rrb- said that was no reason to cheer .
" high-performance sport in germany is in danger of losing contact to developments in world sports .
performances are on the decline in many sports , " the sueddeutsche zeitung -lrb- sz -rrb- newspaper wrote in mid-december , quoting an iat report .
bleak all year ' round bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael ballack has had to be content with second place had britta steffen not managed to win gold medals in the 50 and 100-meter freestyle events in beijing , germany would have ended with no gold at all in the showcase sports of athletics and swimming , which alone account for 81 of the 302 gold medals on offer at the games .
the winter situation is similar , with germany only a minor player in the popular sports of alpine skiing and figure skating .
instead , german athletes win their medals in luge , biathlon or bobsleigh , events which are not popular in many countries .
according to the sz , germany is the only country from the world 's big six - the others being the us , china , great britain , russia and australia - which does n't focus on sports with the most medals on offer or those with a long tradition in the country .
the iat criticism ranges from badly educated coaches to a lack of scientific support .
stellar stadiums are n't enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's winter sports prowess is also lacking only last week germany coach joachim loew and other officials went to france to look at the country 's famous soccer academy in clairefontaine .
germany has no such institute and lags behind in club and country competitions .
" we are world class as far as stadium atmosphere is concerned .
but we must do more on the pitch , " said former german soccer coach juergen klinsmann , now in charge at bayern munich .
germany came in second at euro 2008 but had its tactical deficits exposed by spain .
the last title came at euro 1996 and the world cup has not been won since 1990 .
just one year later krabbe - whose name has been tainted by doping allegations - claimed the last major sprint title when athletes from former east germany still ruled the scene shortly after the 1990 reunification .
doping-infested cycling is also on its way out and so is tennis , with the hamburg masters downgraded and the women 's berlin tournament possibly moving elsewhere .
winter olympics offers hope bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cars might be german , but the races are held elsewhere germany may also be without a formula one grand prix in 2010 , even though it is a country which has two major team players in mercedes and bmw , a record four drivers in the field and the most successful driver ever in seven-time champion michael schumacher .
the main hopes for a better future lie in improved training programs , a rise of new talent and the hosting of big events .
munich is setting up a promising bid for the 2018 winter olympics and officials have high hopes in the athletics worlds in berlin as well .

whether its swimming , soccer or skiing , sports commentators are finding reasons to be pessimistic about 2009 . first , the good news .
germany will host the world athletics championships in 2009 .
but apart from that berlin event , the forecast for the nation 's sports is as bleak as the glum economic predictions .
the former sports power lacks stars in major sports ranging from football to athletics and swimming .
in addition , there is an almost frightening disappearance of events from tennis to formula one .
always second best bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs another steffi graf berlin and leipzig have suffered embarrassment in their attempts to host olympic games in recent years .
major events such as wimbledon are no longer broadcast on free-to-air television channels and there is no footage at all of the elite golden league athletics series as soccer rules the airwaves , pushing out almost anything else .
perennial runner-up michael ballack was the only german on the shortlist for the 2009 world footballer award .
katrin krabbe was the last german to win an athletics world title on the track in 1991 .
and the tennis glory days of boris becker and steffi graf are long gone .
germany placed fifth in the medal table at the beijing olympics , but a report from a leipzig-based training institute -lrb- iat -rrb- said that was no reason to cheer .
" high-performance sport in germany is in danger of losing contact to developments in world sports .
performances are on the decline in many sports , " the sueddeutsche zeitung -lrb- sz -rrb- newspaper wrote in mid-december , quoting an iat report .
bleak all year ' round bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael ballack has had to be content with second place had britta steffen not managed to win gold medals in the 50 and 100-meter freestyle events in beijing , germany would have ended with no gold at all in the showcase sports of athletics and swimming , which alone account for 81 of the 302 gold medals on offer at the games .
the winter situation is similar , with germany only a minor player in the popular sports of alpine skiing and figure skating .
instead , german athletes win their medals in luge , biathlon or bobsleigh , events which are not popular in many countries .
according to the sz , germany is the only country from the world 's big six - the others being the us , china , great britain , russia and australia - which does n't focus on sports with the most medals on offer or those with a long tradition in the country .
the iat criticism ranges from badly educated coaches to a lack of scientific support .
stellar stadiums are n't enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's winter sports prowess is also lacking only last week germany coach joachim loew and other officials went to france to look at the country 's famous soccer academy in clairefontaine .
germany has no such institute and lags behind in club and country competitions .
" we are world class as far as stadium atmosphere is concerned .
but we must do more on the pitch , " said former german soccer coach juergen klinsmann , now in charge at bayern munich .
germany came in second at euro 2008 but had its tactical deficits exposed by spain .
the last title came at euro 1996 and the world cup has not been won since 1990 .
just one year later krabbe - whose name has been tainted by doping allegations - claimed the last major sprint title when athletes from former east germany still ruled the scene shortly after the 1990 reunification .
doping-infested cycling is also on its way out and so is tennis , with the hamburg masters downgraded and the women 's berlin tournament possibly moving elsewhere .
winter olympics offers hope bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cars might be german , but the races are held elsewhere germany may also be without a formula one grand prix in 2010 , even though it is a country which has two major team players in mercedes and bmw , a record four drivers in the field and the most successful driver ever in seven-time champion michael schumacher .
the main hopes for a better future lie in improved training programs , a rise of new talent and the hosting of big events .
munich is setting up a promising bid for the 2018 winter olympics and officials have high hopes in the athletics worlds in berlin as well .

1 , 1939 , next year also marks the 20th anniversary of the fall of communism across central europe .
starting with democratic elections in poland in june 1989 , the year of change across central europe culminated in november of that year with the fall of the berlin wall .
that event became a symbol of the end of the cold war and europe 's post-war divide .
the breaching of the berlin wall also led to the unseating of the soviet-backed government in prague and the ousting of romanian president nicolae ceausescu a few weeks later .
on christmas day , ceausescu and his wife were executed by firing squad following a bloody revolution in the country to unseat the hated dictator .
a new study released this month said , however , that germans living in the country 's former communist east felt they were second-class citizens in the reunified germany that emerged following the fall of the wall .
undertaken by the university of bielefeld , the study revealed lingering resentment in the east about life since a popular uprising in late 1989 paved the way for the collapse of east germany 's stalinist government .
shift to the west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stalinist regimes were toppled after the collapse of the berlin wall decades later both eastern and western europe are still grappling with the events surrounding world war two and the fall of communism , as well as struggling to forge a new identity in a world now shaped by fast-paced globalization .
" the common past is a chance for the future , " polish foreign minister radoslav sikorski said in a speech delivered in berlin this month .
" the events followed a decades-long struggle by those who refused to abandon their freedom , " sikorski said .
triggered by former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev 's drive for glasnost - openness - and perestroika - economic change - the fall of communism across central europe in 1989 also ultimately helped loosen communist grip on moscow and pave the way a few years later for the collapse of soviet russia .
nearly 20 years after the communist governments of central europe fell like dominoes , the region 's new political leadership is still trying to sweep away the industrial and social debris left by decades of command economics .
this transformation has been signified by a strong shift towards western-style economic systems .
however , this process is now likely to be made more complicated by the economic downturn rapidly taking hold around the world .
specter of the nazi state bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kristallnacht saw nazi thugs set fire to synagogues and loot jewish businesses november 9 rears itself as a strangely recurring date in german history .
this date marks hitler 's stepped-up reign of terror against jews on kristallnacht - the night of the broken glass - and the failure of his beer hall putsch in bavaria in 1923 .
kaiser wilhem ii also abdicated on nov .
9 , 1918 .
but , in a sense , all these strands of history lead back to a september day nearly 70 years ago when nazi troops crossed the border into poland , sparking six years of war and unleashing the barbarity of the third reich on eastern europe .
it is a measure of the ongoing fascination with the horrors of nazism that there seems little end to the book and movie industry that has grown up around it .
british historian richard evans has just published the third reich at war , the final instalment in his trilogy of books on nazi germany .
new york-born director bryan singer 's " valkyrie , " a film about the 1944 plot to assassinate hitler starring hollywood actor tom cruise , came out in the us at christmas and will open in germany in january .

whether its swimming , soccer or skiing , sports commentators are finding reasons to be pessimistic about 2009 . first , the good news .
germany will host the world athletics championships in 2009 .
but apart from that berlin event , the forecast for the nation 's sports is as bleak as the glum economic predictions .
the former sports power lacks stars in major sports ranging from football to athletics and swimming .
in addition , there is an almost frightening disappearance of events from tennis to formula one .
always second best bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs another steffi graf berlin and leipzig have suffered embarrassment in their attempts to host olympic games in recent years .
major events such as wimbledon are no longer broadcast on free-to-air television channels and there is no footage at all of the elite golden league athletics series as soccer rules the airwaves , pushing out almost anything else .
perennial runner-up michael ballack was the only german on the shortlist for the 2009 world footballer award .
katrin krabbe was the last german to win an athletics world title on the track in 1991 .
and the tennis glory days of boris becker and steffi graf are long gone .
germany placed fifth in the medal table at the beijing olympics , but a report from a leipzig-based training institute -lrb- iat -rrb- said that was no reason to cheer .
" high-performance sport in germany is in danger of losing contact to developments in world sports .
performances are on the decline in many sports , " the sueddeutsche zeitung -lrb- sz -rrb- newspaper wrote in mid-december , quoting an iat report .
bleak all year ' round bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael ballack has had to be content with second place had britta steffen not managed to win gold medals in the 50 and 100-meter freestyle events in beijing , germany would have ended with no gold at all in the showcase sports of athletics and swimming , which alone account for 81 of the 302 gold medals on offer at the games .
the winter situation is similar , with germany only a minor player in the popular sports of alpine skiing and figure skating .
instead , german athletes win their medals in luge , biathlon or bobsleigh , events which are not popular in many countries .
according to the sz , germany is the only country from the world 's big six - the others being the us , china , great britain , russia and australia - which does n't focus on sports with the most medals on offer or those with a long tradition in the country .
the iat criticism ranges from badly educated coaches to a lack of scientific support .
stellar stadiums are n't enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's winter sports prowess is also lacking only last week germany coach joachim loew and other officials went to france to look at the country 's famous soccer academy in clairefontaine .
germany has no such institute and lags behind in club and country competitions .
" we are world class as far as stadium atmosphere is concerned .
but we must do more on the pitch , " said former german soccer coach juergen klinsmann , now in charge at bayern munich .
germany came in second at euro 2008 but had its tactical deficits exposed by spain .
the last title came at euro 1996 and the world cup has not been won since 1990 .
just one year later krabbe - whose name has been tainted by doping allegations - claimed the last major sprint title when athletes from former east germany still ruled the scene shortly after the 1990 reunification .
doping-infested cycling is also on its way out and so is tennis , with the hamburg masters downgraded and the women 's berlin tournament possibly moving elsewhere .

barack obama , however , was cheered across party lines . during the most dazzling event of the year in foreign policy in germany , the spotlight was n't on the german government , but on an american : barack obama .
as the presidential candidate of the democratic party , he visited berlin and held a much-anticipated speech at the victory column in front of 200,000 . it is highly unlikely - no , simply unimaginable - that as many people would have poured into the tiergarten , berlin 's central park , had it been the chancellor or and a group of high-ranking german politicians on stage instead of obama .
members of germany 's political class these days inspire more yawns than cheers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berliners welcomed obama at his speech at the victory column barack obama chose the monument as the place for his speech after some discussion – looking back it proved to be an omen of success .
in november , a delighted angela merkel congratulated the winner . " we 're witnessing a historical election victory , " merkel said . " no , we ca n't " obama delivered a wide-ranging speech and putting the focus on trans-atlantic ties .
in the eyes of many germans george w. bush had ruined those .
so hardly anybody noticed bush 's parting visit to angela merkel . merkel had tried to explain to him the pain threshold in german foreign policy , for example afghanistan .
under no circumstances did the german government want to send troops to the hard-fought south of afghanistan . the next task is to convince the american president-elect that germany 's version of his famous slogan is : " no , we ca n't . "
the german government is convinced to be doing enough for the stabilization of afghanistan . only in october , germany 's parliament voted to extend the country 's military mission and to deploy an extra 1,000 troops there , boosting their number to 4,500 .
germany 's allies should appreciate this commitment , said german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier . " we have pointed out in the past what germany does in afghanistan , not only the bundeswehr , but also what our civil helpers do for reconstruction , " steinmeier said .
" we get a lot of respect for that , also in the united states of america . " afghanistan remains key issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr forces patrolling on the outskirts of kunduz , northern afghanistan afghanistan remained one of the most controversial security topics for the german government in 2008 .
the training of the afghan police and army was plagued with problems .
regularly , the taliban fired at bundeswehr camps and attacked patrols . in october , two german soldiers died near kundus in a suicide attack .
for the first time since german soldiers were sent to afghanistan six years ago , german defense minister franz josef jung referred in november to the gefallene , or fallen soldiers , who had died there .
until now , any german soldiers killed in afghanistan were referred to as casualties . throughout 2008 , the military played an important role in german foreign policy .
german soldiers were deployed to afghanistan , kosovo , bosnia , the horn of africa and to the coast of lebanon .
unarmed forces were sent to southern sudan and georgia .
at the end of 2008 the bundeswehr took part in the european anti-pirate-force " atalanta " along the coast of somalia . but seen as a whole , german foreign policy in 2008 came across as fractured and heading in too many directions .
while , 2007 was dominated by major events such as the eu presidency and the g8 summit in heiligendamm , a clear course was never set for 2008 .
part of what was accomplished in 2007 fell victim to the global financial crisis and the irish eu " no " vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy did n't call and invite angela merkel to the mini-summit merkel stopped being the woman of action and was overshadowed by french president nicolas sarkozy 's overdrive .
in december , merkel - notable among european leaders for her wariness about increasing public borrowing to fund government spending - was excluded from a mini-summit initiated by sarkozy .
steinmeier was not amused . " i 'll be honest : i do n't think it was nice that germany and the chancellor were n't there , " he said . frictions within german government coalition another dilemma put a strain on german foreign policy in 2008 : the two most important people , christian democrat merkel and social democrat steinmeier disagreed on a number of issues , especially in the approach to countries like russia , china and syria . merkel either tends to be quite frank and open or she contains herself .
steinmeier places emphasis on rapproachment though diplomacy and dialogue .
their differing styles of policy-making led to some confusion in 2008 - much to the pleasure of the opposition .
the green party 's juergen trittin accused the government of having not one but two foreign policies . " one of them is responsible for the dalai lama , the other one for china , " trittin said .
" the foreign minister advocates dialogue with syria and is being criticized for it by the christian democrats .
or when asked what the government thinks of the positioning of new american missiles in europe , you wo n't get a consistent answer ! " merkel vs. steinmeier bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier wants to challenge merkel in next year 's election the disagreements also affected the dalai lama 's visit to germany : german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , a social democrat , was the only cabinet member to receive him .
the year before , chancellor merkel 's reception of the exiled tibetan spiritual leader angered china as well as her own foreign minister , who accused her of trying to " showcase " human rights . foreign policy expectations for 2009 are low : in october , steinmeier won his party 's support to face merkel in next year 's election .

the world has to finally get involved in the middle east conflict , deutsche welle 's peter philipp says . no country in the world would accept being regularly fired at with rockets and taking no action against it .
that 's why israel is counting on international support and using renewed rocket attacks from the gaza strip since the end of the six-month ceasefire announced by hamas last week as justification for its massive military operation against hamas .
the group along with others in the gaza strip are " taking revenge " by firing rockets once again on southern israel .
unless there 's a miracle , this is the perfect situation for a further escalation which would have unforeseen consequences .
but it 's also a completely superfluous yet final proof that the promises made at the annapolis conference in the us in nov 2007 to resume peace talks with the aim of reaching a comprehensive agreement by the end of 2008 were nothing more than empty words .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp if the end of this year does possibly bring a new open-ended war , then there 's admittedly more to it than the above mentioned rockets .
israel and hamas would go back to the time when both resorted to violence for lack of sensible policies though it was long obvious that violence only creates counter-violence and that the vicious circle can hardly be broken .
repeating old mistakes thus israel is committing a cardinal mistake by believing it can wipe out hamas with a military operation .
just as it thought it could disarm hezbollah two and a half years ago .
the massive attack on lebanon at the time instead bombed hezbollah into the government and the same thing could happen with hamas in palestine .
in january 2006 , hamas won elections and a big israeli offensive would drive the palestinians into group 's arms .
but the frustrated and battered palestinians as well as hamas are making a huge mistake too by hoping that hamas ' uncompromising stance will lead to a solution or deliverance .
hamas ' vehement rejection of israel 's right to exist can not be a foundation for peace .
former plo chief yasser arafat learned that lesson after decades of armed struggle against israel .
the result was the olso treaty and palestinian autonomy .
but israel squandered a chance for peace by diluting oslo .
it did that by building new settlements in the occupied territories for instance and thus destroying any hopes that the palestinians had pinned on the treaty .
israel 's one-sided retreat from the gaza strip did n't do anything to change that .
an " occupied " territory turned into a " besieged " one under tight blockades particularly when hamas took control of gaza .
as always , it was the always the wrong people who suffered the most .
it was n't the ideologues or the snipers but rather civilians - women , children , old people - who bore the brunt .
they will be the ones who will do so again in the current escalation .
bombs after all do n't differentiate between people .
the world can no longer afford to sit back and watch .
if international troops can be mobilized for the fight against terrorists and pirates , then the world should be able to do more in palestine than simply pay lip service .
at least in order to prevent the worst if not to bring peace .

1 , 1939 , next year also marks the 20th anniversary of the fall of communism across central europe .
starting with democratic elections in poland in june 1989 , the year of change across central europe culminated in november of that year with the fall of the berlin wall .
that event became a symbol of the end of the cold war and europe 's post-war divide .
the breaching of the berlin wall also led to the unseating of the soviet-backed government in prague and the ousting of romanian president nicolae ceausescu a few weeks later .
on christmas day , ceausescu and his wife were executed by firing squad following a bloody revolution in the country to unseat the hated dictator .
a new study released this month said , however , that germans living in the country 's former communist east felt they were second-class citizens in the reunified germany that emerged following the fall of the wall .
undertaken by the university of bielefeld , the study revealed lingering resentment in the east about life since a popular uprising in late 1989 paved the way for the collapse of east germany 's stalinist government .

triggered by former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev 's drive for glasnost - openness - and perestroika - economic change - the fall of communism across central europe in 1989 also ultimately helped loosen communist grip on moscow and pave the way a few years later for the collapse of soviet russia .
nearly 20 years after the communist governments of central europe fell like dominoes , the region 's new political leadership is still trying to sweep away the industrial and social debris left by decades of command economics .
this transformation has been signified by a strong shift towards western-style economic systems .
however , this process is now likely to be made more complicated by the economic downturn rapidly taking hold around the world .

barack obama , however , was cheered across party lines . during the most dazzling event of the year in foreign policy in germany , the spotlight was n't on the german government , but on an american : barack obama .
as the presidential candidate of the democratic party , he visited berlin and held a much-anticipated speech at the victory column in front of 200,000 . it is highly unlikely - no , simply unimaginable - that as many people would have poured into the tiergarten , berlin 's central park , had it been the chancellor or and a group of high-ranking german politicians on stage instead of obama .
members of germany 's political class these days inspire more yawns than cheers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berliners welcomed obama at his speech at the victory column barack obama chose the monument as the place for his speech after some discussion – looking back it proved to be an omen of success .
in november , a delighted angela merkel congratulated the winner . " we 're witnessing a historical election victory , " merkel said . " no , we ca n't " obama delivered a wide-ranging speech and putting the focus on trans-atlantic ties .
in the eyes of many germans george w. bush had ruined those .
so hardly anybody noticed bush 's parting visit to angela merkel . merkel had tried to explain to him the pain threshold in german foreign policy , for example afghanistan .
under no circumstances did the german government want to send troops to the hard-fought south of afghanistan . the next task is to convince the american president-elect that germany 's version of his famous slogan is : " no , we ca n't . "
the german government is convinced to be doing enough for the stabilization of afghanistan . only in october , germany 's parliament voted to extend the country 's military mission and to deploy an extra 1,000 troops there , boosting their number to 4,500 .
germany 's allies should appreciate this commitment , said german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier . " we have pointed out in the past what germany does in afghanistan , not only the bundeswehr , but also what our civil helpers do for reconstruction , " steinmeier said .
" we get a lot of respect for that , also in the united states of america . " afghanistan remains key issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr forces patrolling on the outskirts of kunduz , northern afghanistan afghanistan remained one of the most controversial security topics for the german government in 2008 .
the training of the afghan police and army was plagued with problems .
regularly , the taliban fired at bundeswehr camps and attacked patrols . in october , two german soldiers died near kundus in a suicide attack .
for the first time since german soldiers were sent to afghanistan six years ago , german defense minister franz josef jung referred in november to the gefallene , or fallen soldiers , who had died there .
until now , any german soldiers killed in afghanistan were referred to as casualties . throughout 2008 , the military played an important role in german foreign policy .
german soldiers were deployed to afghanistan , kosovo , bosnia , the horn of africa and to the coast of lebanon .
unarmed forces were sent to southern sudan and georgia .
at the end of 2008 the bundeswehr took part in the european anti-pirate-force " atalanta " along the coast of somalia . but seen as a whole , german foreign policy in 2008 came across as fractured and heading in too many directions .
while , 2007 was dominated by major events such as the eu presidency and the g8 summit in heiligendamm , a clear course was never set for 2008 .
part of what was accomplished in 2007 fell victim to the global financial crisis and the irish eu " no " vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy did n't call and invite angela merkel to the mini-summit merkel stopped being the woman of action and was overshadowed by french president nicolas sarkozy 's overdrive .
in december , merkel - notable among european leaders for her wariness about increasing public borrowing to fund government spending - was excluded from a mini-summit initiated by sarkozy .
steinmeier was not amused . " i 'll be honest : i do n't think it was nice that germany and the chancellor were n't there , " he said . frictions within german government coalition another dilemma put a strain on german foreign policy in 2008 : the two most important people , christian democrat merkel and social democrat steinmeier disagreed on a number of issues , especially in the approach to countries like russia , china and syria . merkel either tends to be quite frank and open or she contains herself .
steinmeier places emphasis on rapproachment though diplomacy and dialogue .
their differing styles of policy-making led to some confusion in 2008 - much to the pleasure of the opposition .
the green party 's juergen trittin accused the government of having not one but two foreign policies . " one of them is responsible for the dalai lama , the other one for china , " trittin said .
" the foreign minister advocates dialogue with syria and is being criticized for it by the christian democrats .
or when asked what the government thinks of the positioning of new american missiles in europe , you wo n't get a consistent answer ! " merkel vs. steinmeier bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier wants to challenge merkel in next year 's election the disagreements also affected the dalai lama 's visit to germany : german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , a social democrat , was the only cabinet member to receive him .
the year before , chancellor merkel 's reception of the exiled tibetan spiritual leader angered china as well as her own foreign minister , who accused her of trying to " showcase " human rights . foreign policy expectations for 2009 are low : in october , steinmeier won his party 's support to face merkel in next year 's election .

1 , 1939 , next year also marks the 20th anniversary of the fall of communism across central europe .
starting with democratic elections in poland in june 1989 , the year of change across central europe culminated in november of that year with the fall of the berlin wall .
that event became a symbol of the end of the cold war and europe 's post-war divide .
the breaching of the berlin wall also led to the unseating of the soviet-backed government in prague and the ousting of romanian president nicolae ceausescu a few weeks later .
on christmas day , ceausescu and his wife were executed by firing squad following a bloody revolution in the country to unseat the hated dictator .
a new study released this month said , however , that germans living in the country 's former communist east felt they were second-class citizens in the reunified germany that emerged following the fall of the wall .
undertaken by the university of bielefeld , the study revealed lingering resentment in the east about life since a popular uprising in late 1989 paved the way for the collapse of east germany 's stalinist government .
shift to the west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stalinist regimes were toppled after the collapse of the berlin wall decades later both eastern and western europe are still grappling with the events surrounding world war two and the fall of communism , as well as struggling to forge a new identity in a world now shaped by fast-paced globalization .
" the common past is a chance for the future , " polish foreign minister radoslav sikorski said in a speech delivered in berlin this month .
" the events followed a decades-long struggle by those who refused to abandon their freedom , " sikorski said .
triggered by former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev 's drive for glasnost - openness - and perestroika - economic change - the fall of communism across central europe in 1989 also ultimately helped loosen communist grip on moscow and pave the way a few years later for the collapse of soviet russia .
nearly 20 years after the communist governments of central europe fell like dominoes , the region 's new political leadership is still trying to sweep away the industrial and social debris left by decades of command economics .
this transformation has been signified by a strong shift towards western-style economic systems .
however , this process is now likely to be made more complicated by the economic downturn rapidly taking hold around the world .
specter of the nazi state bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kristallnacht saw nazi thugs set fire to synagogues and loot jewish businesses november 9 rears itself as a strangely recurring date in german history .
this date marks hitler 's stepped-up reign of terror against jews on kristallnacht - the night of the broken glass - and the failure of his beer hall putsch in bavaria in 1923 .
kaiser wilhem ii also abdicated on nov .
9 , 1918 .
but , in a sense , all these strands of history lead back to a september day nearly 70 years ago when nazi troops crossed the border into poland , sparking six years of war and unleashing the barbarity of the third reich on eastern europe .
it is a measure of the ongoing fascination with the horrors of nazism that there seems little end to the book and movie industry that has grown up around it .
british historian richard evans has just published the third reich at war , the final instalment in his trilogy of books on nazi germany .
new york-born director bryan singer 's " valkyrie , " a film about the 1944 plot to assassinate hitler starring hollywood actor tom cruise , came out in the us at christmas and will open in germany in january .

for the first time since german soldiers were sent to afghanistan six years ago , german defense minister franz josef jung referred in november to the gefallene , or fallen soldiers , who had died there .
until now , any german soldiers killed in afghanistan were referred to as casualties . throughout 2008 , the military played an important role in german foreign policy .
german soldiers were deployed to afghanistan , kosovo , bosnia , the horn of africa and to the coast of lebanon .
unarmed forces were sent to southern sudan and georgia .
at the end of 2008 the bundeswehr took part in the european anti-pirate-force " atalanta " along the coast of somalia . but seen as a whole , german foreign policy in 2008 came across as fractured and heading in too many directions .
while , 2007 was dominated by major events such as the eu presidency and the g8 summit in heiligendamm , a clear course was never set for 2008 .
part of what was accomplished in 2007 fell victim to the global financial crisis and the irish eu " no " vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy did n't call and invite angela merkel to the mini-summit merkel stopped being the woman of action and was overshadowed by french president nicolas sarkozy 's overdrive .
in december , merkel - notable among european leaders for her wariness about increasing public borrowing to fund government spending - was excluded from a mini-summit initiated by sarkozy .
steinmeier was not amused . " i 'll be honest : i do n't think it was nice that germany and the chancellor were n't there , " he said . frictions within german government coalition another dilemma put a strain on german foreign policy in 2008 : the two most important people , christian democrat merkel and social democrat steinmeier disagreed on a number of issues , especially in the approach to countries like russia , china and syria . merkel either tends to be quite frank and open or she contains herself .
steinmeier places emphasis on rapproachment though diplomacy and dialogue .
their differing styles of policy-making led to some confusion in 2008 - much to the pleasure of the opposition .
the green party 's juergen trittin accused the government of having not one but two foreign policies . " one of them is responsible for the dalai lama , the other one for china , " trittin said .
" the foreign minister advocates dialogue with syria and is being criticized for it by the christian democrats .
or when asked what the government thinks of the positioning of new american missiles in europe , you wo n't get a consistent answer ! " merkel vs. steinmeier bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier wants to challenge merkel in next year 's election the disagreements also affected the dalai lama 's visit to germany : german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , a social democrat , was the only cabinet member to receive him .
the year before , chancellor merkel 's reception of the exiled tibetan spiritual leader angered china as well as her own foreign minister , who accused her of trying to " showcase " human rights . foreign policy expectations for 2009 are low : in october , steinmeier won his party 's support to face merkel in next year 's election .
an election campaign pitting merkel vs. steinmeier is likely to water down german foreign policy even more . dw staff -lrb- nma -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

1 , 1939 , next year also marks the 20th anniversary of the fall of communism across central europe .
starting with democratic elections in poland in june 1989 , the year of change across central europe culminated in november of that year with the fall of the berlin wall .
that event became a symbol of the end of the cold war and europe 's post-war divide .
the breaching of the berlin wall also led to the unseating of the soviet-backed government in prague and the ousting of romanian president nicolae ceausescu a few weeks later .
on christmas day , ceausescu and his wife were executed by firing squad following a bloody revolution in the country to unseat the hated dictator .
a new study released this month said , however , that germans living in the country 's former communist east felt they were second-class citizens in the reunified germany that emerged following the fall of the wall .
undertaken by the university of bielefeld , the study revealed lingering resentment in the east about life since a popular uprising in late 1989 paved the way for the collapse of east germany 's stalinist government .
shift to the west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stalinist regimes were toppled after the collapse of the berlin wall decades later both eastern and western europe are still grappling with the events surrounding world war two and the fall of communism , as well as struggling to forge a new identity in a world now shaped by fast-paced globalization .
" the common past is a chance for the future , " polish foreign minister radoslav sikorski said in a speech delivered in berlin this month .
" the events followed a decades-long struggle by those who refused to abandon their freedom , " sikorski said .
triggered by former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev 's drive for glasnost - openness - and perestroika - economic change - the fall of communism across central europe in 1989 also ultimately helped loosen communist grip on moscow and pave the way a few years later for the collapse of soviet russia .
nearly 20 years after the communist governments of central europe fell like dominoes , the region 's new political leadership is still trying to sweep away the industrial and social debris left by decades of command economics .
this transformation has been signified by a strong shift towards western-style economic systems .
however , this process is now likely to be made more complicated by the economic downturn rapidly taking hold around the world .
specter of the nazi state bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kristallnacht saw nazi thugs set fire to synagogues and loot jewish businesses november 9 rears itself as a strangely recurring date in german history .

kaiser wilhem ii also abdicated on nov .
9 , 1918 .
but , in a sense , all these strands of history lead back to a september day nearly 70 years ago when nazi troops crossed the border into poland , sparking six years of war and unleashing the barbarity of the third reich on eastern europe .
it is a measure of the ongoing fascination with the horrors of nazism that there seems little end to the book and movie industry that has grown up around it .
british historian richard evans has just published the third reich at war , the final instalment in his trilogy of books on nazi germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 28.12.2008 opinion : the world ca n't afford to sit back and watch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas and israel are making the same old mistakes all over again because the latest attacks wo n't solve anything .
the world has to finally get involved in the middle east conflict , deutsche welle 's peter philipp says . no country in the world would accept being regularly fired at with rockets and taking no action against it .
that 's why israel is counting on international support and using renewed rocket attacks from the gaza strip since the end of the six-month ceasefire announced by hamas last week as justification for its massive military operation against hamas .
the group along with others in the gaza strip are " taking revenge " by firing rockets once again on southern israel .
unless there 's a miracle , this is the perfect situation for a further escalation which would have unforeseen consequences .
but it 's also a completely superfluous yet final proof that the promises made at the annapolis conference in the us in nov 2007 to resume peace talks with the aim of reaching a comprehensive agreement by the end of 2008 were nothing more than empty words .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp if the end of this year does possibly bring a new open-ended war , then there 's admittedly more to it than the above mentioned rockets .
israel and hamas would go back to the time when both resorted to violence for lack of sensible policies though it was long obvious that violence only creates counter-violence and that the vicious circle can hardly be broken .
repeating old mistakes thus israel is committing a cardinal mistake by believing it can wipe out hamas with a military operation .
just as it thought it could disarm hezbollah two and a half years ago .
the massive attack on lebanon at the time instead bombed hezbollah into the government and the same thing could happen with hamas in palestine .
in january 2006 , hamas won elections and a big israeli offensive would drive the palestinians into group 's arms .
but the frustrated and battered palestinians as well as hamas are making a huge mistake too by hoping that hamas ' uncompromising stance will lead to a solution or deliverance .
hamas ' vehement rejection of israel 's right to exist can not be a foundation for peace .
former plo chief yasser arafat learned that lesson after decades of armed struggle against israel .
the result was the olso treaty and palestinian autonomy .
but israel squandered a chance for peace by diluting oslo .
it did that by building new settlements in the occupied territories for instance and thus destroying any hopes that the palestinians had pinned on the treaty .
israel 's one-sided retreat from the gaza strip did n't do anything to change that .
an " occupied " territory turned into a " besieged " one under tight blockades particularly when hamas took control of gaza .
as always , it was the always the wrong people who suffered the most .
it was n't the ideologues or the snipers but rather civilians - women , children , old people - who bore the brunt .
they will be the ones who will do so again in the current escalation .
bombs after all do n't differentiate between people .
the world can no longer afford to sit back and watch .
if international troops can be mobilized for the fight against terrorists and pirates , then the world should be able to do more in palestine than simply pay lip service .
at least in order to prevent the worst if not to bring peace .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 28.12.2008 germany 's lackluster athletes worry sports lovers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this year 's german athletes of the year - but the country 's top athletes are not exactly household names the german sports scene lacks star power .
whether its swimming , soccer or skiing , sports commentators are finding reasons to be pessimistic about 2009 . first , the good news .
germany will host the world athletics championships in 2009 .
but apart from that berlin event , the forecast for the nation 's sports is as bleak as the glum economic predictions .
the former sports power lacks stars in major sports ranging from football to athletics and swimming .
in addition , there is an almost frightening disappearance of events from tennis to formula one .
always second best bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs another steffi graf berlin and leipzig have suffered embarrassment in their attempts to host olympic games in recent years .
major events such as wimbledon are no longer broadcast on free-to-air television channels and there is no footage at all of the elite golden league athletics series as soccer rules the airwaves , pushing out almost anything else .
perennial runner-up michael ballack was the only german on the shortlist for the 2009 world footballer award .
katrin krabbe was the last german to win an athletics world title on the track in 1991 .
and the tennis glory days of boris becker and steffi graf are long gone .
germany placed fifth in the medal table at the beijing olympics , but a report from a leipzig-based training institute -lrb- iat -rrb- said that was no reason to cheer .
" high-performance sport in germany is in danger of losing contact to developments in world sports .
performances are on the decline in many sports , " the sueddeutsche zeitung -lrb- sz -rrb- newspaper wrote in mid-december , quoting an iat report .
bleak all year ' round bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael ballack has had to be content with second place had britta steffen not managed to win gold medals in the 50 and 100-meter freestyle events in beijing , germany would have ended with no gold at all in the showcase sports of athletics and swimming , which alone account for 81 of the 302 gold medals on offer at the games .
the winter situation is similar , with germany only a minor player in the popular sports of alpine skiing and figure skating .
instead , german athletes win their medals in luge , biathlon or bobsleigh , events which are not popular in many countries .
according to the sz , germany is the only country from the world 's big six - the others being the us , china , great britain , russia and australia - which does n't focus on sports with the most medals on offer or those with a long tradition in the country .
the iat criticism ranges from badly educated coaches to a lack of scientific support .
stellar stadiums are n't enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's winter sports prowess is also lacking only last week germany coach joachim loew and other officials went to france to look at the country 's famous soccer academy in clairefontaine .
germany has no such institute and lags behind in club and country competitions .
" we are world class as far as stadium atmosphere is concerned .
but we must do more on the pitch , " said former german soccer coach juergen klinsmann , now in charge at bayern munich .
germany came in second at euro 2008 but had its tactical deficits exposed by spain .
the last title came at euro 1996 and the world cup has not been won since 1990 .

1 , 1939 , next year also marks the 20th anniversary of the fall of communism across central europe .
starting with democratic elections in poland in june 1989 , the year of change across central europe culminated in november of that year with the fall of the berlin wall .
that event became a symbol of the end of the cold war and europe 's post-war divide .
the breaching of the berlin wall also led to the unseating of the soviet-backed government in prague and the ousting of romanian president nicolae ceausescu a few weeks later .
on christmas day , ceausescu and his wife were executed by firing squad following a bloody revolution in the country to unseat the hated dictator .
a new study released this month said , however , that germans living in the country 's former communist east felt they were second-class citizens in the reunified germany that emerged following the fall of the wall .
undertaken by the university of bielefeld , the study revealed lingering resentment in the east about life since a popular uprising in late 1989 paved the way for the collapse of east germany 's stalinist government .
shift to the west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stalinist regimes were toppled after the collapse of the berlin wall decades later both eastern and western europe are still grappling with the events surrounding world war two and the fall of communism , as well as struggling to forge a new identity in a world now shaped by fast-paced globalization .
" the common past is a chance for the future , " polish foreign minister radoslav sikorski said in a speech delivered in berlin this month .
" the events followed a decades-long struggle by those who refused to abandon their freedom , " sikorski said .
triggered by former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev 's drive for glasnost - openness - and perestroika - economic change - the fall of communism across central europe in 1989 also ultimately helped loosen communist grip on moscow and pave the way a few years later for the collapse of soviet russia .
nearly 20 years after the communist governments of central europe fell like dominoes , the region 's new political leadership is still trying to sweep away the industrial and social debris left by decades of command economics .
this transformation has been signified by a strong shift towards western-style economic systems .
however , this process is now likely to be made more complicated by the economic downturn rapidly taking hold around the world .
specter of the nazi state bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kristallnacht saw nazi thugs set fire to synagogues and loot jewish businesses november 9 rears itself as a strangely recurring date in german history .
this date marks hitler 's stepped-up reign of terror against jews on kristallnacht - the night of the broken glass - and the failure of his beer hall putsch in bavaria in 1923 .
kaiser wilhem ii also abdicated on nov .
9 , 1918 .
but , in a sense , all these strands of history lead back to a september day nearly 70 years ago when nazi troops crossed the border into poland , sparking six years of war and unleashing the barbarity of the third reich on eastern europe .
it is a measure of the ongoing fascination with the horrors of nazism that there seems little end to the book and movie industry that has grown up around it .
british historian richard evans has just published the third reich at war , the final instalment in his trilogy of books on nazi germany .
new york-born director bryan singer 's " valkyrie , " a film about the 1944 plot to assassinate hitler starring hollywood actor tom cruise , came out in the us at christmas and will open in germany in january .

next year will also mark the 10th birthday of the euro , which became the accounting currency of 12 european states on jan .

whether its swimming , soccer or skiing , sports commentators are finding reasons to be pessimistic about 2009 . first , the good news .
germany will host the world athletics championships in 2009 .
but apart from that berlin event , the forecast for the nation 's sports is as bleak as the glum economic predictions .
the former sports power lacks stars in major sports ranging from football to athletics and swimming .
in addition , there is an almost frightening disappearance of events from tennis to formula one .
always second best bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs another steffi graf berlin and leipzig have suffered embarrassment in their attempts to host olympic games in recent years .
major events such as wimbledon are no longer broadcast on free-to-air television channels and there is no footage at all of the elite golden league athletics series as soccer rules the airwaves , pushing out almost anything else .
perennial runner-up michael ballack was the only german on the shortlist for the 2009 world footballer award .
katrin krabbe was the last german to win an athletics world title on the track in 1991 .
and the tennis glory days of boris becker and steffi graf are long gone .
germany placed fifth in the medal table at the beijing olympics , but a report from a leipzig-based training institute -lrb- iat -rrb- said that was no reason to cheer .
" high-performance sport in germany is in danger of losing contact to developments in world sports .
performances are on the decline in many sports , " the sueddeutsche zeitung -lrb- sz -rrb- newspaper wrote in mid-december , quoting an iat report .
bleak all year ' round bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael ballack has had to be content with second place had britta steffen not managed to win gold medals in the 50 and 100-meter freestyle events in beijing , germany would have ended with no gold at all in the showcase sports of athletics and swimming , which alone account for 81 of the 302 gold medals on offer at the games .
the winter situation is similar , with germany only a minor player in the popular sports of alpine skiing and figure skating .
instead , german athletes win their medals in luge , biathlon or bobsleigh , events which are not popular in many countries .
according to the sz , germany is the only country from the world 's big six - the others being the us , china , great britain , russia and australia - which does n't focus on sports with the most medals on offer or those with a long tradition in the country .
the iat criticism ranges from badly educated coaches to a lack of scientific support .
stellar stadiums are n't enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's winter sports prowess is also lacking only last week germany coach joachim loew and other officials went to france to look at the country 's famous soccer academy in clairefontaine .
germany has no such institute and lags behind in club and country competitions .
" we are world class as far as stadium atmosphere is concerned .
but we must do more on the pitch , " said former german soccer coach juergen klinsmann , now in charge at bayern munich .
germany came in second at euro 2008 but had its tactical deficits exposed by spain .
the last title came at euro 1996 and the world cup has not been won since 1990 .
just one year later krabbe - whose name has been tainted by doping allegations - claimed the last major sprint title when athletes from former east germany still ruled the scene shortly after the 1990 reunification .
doping-infested cycling is also on its way out and so is tennis , with the hamburg masters downgraded and the women 's berlin tournament possibly moving elsewhere .
winter olympics offers hope bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cars might be german , but the races are held elsewhere germany may also be without a formula one grand prix in 2010 , even though it is a country which has two major team players in mercedes and bmw , a record four drivers in the field and the most successful driver ever in seven-time champion michael schumacher .
the main hopes for a better future lie in improved training programs , a rise of new talent and the hosting of big events .
munich is setting up a promising bid for the 2018 winter olympics and officials have high hopes in the athletics worlds in berlin as well .

1 , 1939 , next year also marks the 20th anniversary of the fall of communism across central europe .
starting with democratic elections in poland in june 1989 , the year of change across central europe culminated in november of that year with the fall of the berlin wall .
that event became a symbol of the end of the cold war and europe 's post-war divide .
the breaching of the berlin wall also led to the unseating of the soviet-backed government in prague and the ousting of romanian president nicolae ceausescu a few weeks later .
on christmas day , ceausescu and his wife were executed by firing squad following a bloody revolution in the country to unseat the hated dictator .
a new study released this month said , however , that germans living in the country 's former communist east felt they were second-class citizens in the reunified germany that emerged following the fall of the wall .
undertaken by the university of bielefeld , the study revealed lingering resentment in the east about life since a popular uprising in late 1989 paved the way for the collapse of east germany 's stalinist government .
shift to the west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stalinist regimes were toppled after the collapse of the berlin wall decades later both eastern and western europe are still grappling with the events surrounding world war two and the fall of communism , as well as struggling to forge a new identity in a world now shaped by fast-paced globalization .
" the common past is a chance for the future , " polish foreign minister radoslav sikorski said in a speech delivered in berlin this month .
" the events followed a decades-long struggle by those who refused to abandon their freedom , " sikorski said .
triggered by former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev 's drive for glasnost - openness - and perestroika - economic change - the fall of communism across central europe in 1989 also ultimately helped loosen communist grip on moscow and pave the way a few years later for the collapse of soviet russia .
nearly 20 years after the communist governments of central europe fell like dominoes , the region 's new political leadership is still trying to sweep away the industrial and social debris left by decades of command economics .
this transformation has been signified by a strong shift towards western-style economic systems .
however , this process is now likely to be made more complicated by the economic downturn rapidly taking hold around the world .

kaiser wilhem ii also abdicated on nov .
9 , 1918 .
but , in a sense , all these strands of history lead back to a september day nearly 70 years ago when nazi troops crossed the border into poland , sparking six years of war and unleashing the barbarity of the third reich on eastern europe .
it is a measure of the ongoing fascination with the horrors of nazism that there seems little end to the book and movie industry that has grown up around it .
british historian richard evans has just published the third reich at war , the final instalment in his trilogy of books on nazi germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 28.12.2008 opinion : the world ca n't afford to sit back and watch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas and israel are making the same old mistakes all over again because the latest attacks wo n't solve anything .
the world has to finally get involved in the middle east conflict , deutsche welle 's peter philipp says . no country in the world would accept being regularly fired at with rockets and taking no action against it .
that 's why israel is counting on international support and using renewed rocket attacks from the gaza strip since the end of the six-month ceasefire announced by hamas last week as justification for its massive military operation against hamas .
the group along with others in the gaza strip are " taking revenge " by firing rockets once again on southern israel .
unless there 's a miracle , this is the perfect situation for a further escalation which would have unforeseen consequences .
but it 's also a completely superfluous yet final proof that the promises made at the annapolis conference in the us in nov 2007 to resume peace talks with the aim of reaching a comprehensive agreement by the end of 2008 were nothing more than empty words .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp if the end of this year does possibly bring a new open-ended war , then there 's admittedly more to it than the above mentioned rockets .
israel and hamas would go back to the time when both resorted to violence for lack of sensible policies though it was long obvious that violence only creates counter-violence and that the vicious circle can hardly be broken .
repeating old mistakes thus israel is committing a cardinal mistake by believing it can wipe out hamas with a military operation .
just as it thought it could disarm hezbollah two and a half years ago .
the massive attack on lebanon at the time instead bombed hezbollah into the government and the same thing could happen with hamas in palestine .
in january 2006 , hamas won elections and a big israeli offensive would drive the palestinians into group 's arms .
but the frustrated and battered palestinians as well as hamas are making a huge mistake too by hoping that hamas ' uncompromising stance will lead to a solution or deliverance .
hamas ' vehement rejection of israel 's right to exist can not be a foundation for peace .
former plo chief yasser arafat learned that lesson after decades of armed struggle against israel .
the result was the olso treaty and palestinian autonomy .
but israel squandered a chance for peace by diluting oslo .
it did that by building new settlements in the occupied territories for instance and thus destroying any hopes that the palestinians had pinned on the treaty .
israel 's one-sided retreat from the gaza strip did n't do anything to change that .
an " occupied " territory turned into a " besieged " one under tight blockades particularly when hamas took control of gaza .
as always , it was the always the wrong people who suffered the most .
it was n't the ideologues or the snipers but rather civilians - women , children , old people - who bore the brunt .
they will be the ones who will do so again in the current escalation .
bombs after all do n't differentiate between people .
the world can no longer afford to sit back and watch .
if international troops can be mobilized for the fight against terrorists and pirates , then the world should be able to do more in palestine than simply pay lip service .
at least in order to prevent the worst if not to bring peace .

starting with democratic elections in poland in june 1989 , the year of change across central europe culminated in november of that year with the fall of the berlin wall .
that event became a symbol of the end of the cold war and europe 's post-war divide .
the breaching of the berlin wall also led to the unseating of the soviet-backed government in prague and the ousting of romanian president nicolae ceausescu a few weeks later .
on christmas day , ceausescu and his wife were executed by firing squad following a bloody revolution in the country to unseat the hated dictator .
a new study released this month said , however , that germans living in the country 's former communist east felt they were second-class citizens in the reunified germany that emerged following the fall of the wall .
undertaken by the university of bielefeld , the study revealed lingering resentment in the east about life since a popular uprising in late 1989 paved the way for the collapse of east germany 's stalinist government .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 28.12.2008 opinion : the world ca n't afford to sit back and watch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas and israel are making the same old mistakes all over again because the latest attacks wo n't solve anything .
the world has to finally get involved in the middle east conflict , deutsche welle 's peter philipp says . no country in the world would accept being regularly fired at with rockets and taking no action against it .
that 's why israel is counting on international support and using renewed rocket attacks from the gaza strip since the end of the six-month ceasefire announced by hamas last week as justification for its massive military operation against hamas .
the group along with others in the gaza strip are " taking revenge " by firing rockets once again on southern israel .
unless there 's a miracle , this is the perfect situation for a further escalation which would have unforeseen consequences .
but it 's also a completely superfluous yet final proof that the promises made at the annapolis conference in the us in nov 2007 to resume peace talks with the aim of reaching a comprehensive agreement by the end of 2008 were nothing more than empty words .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp if the end of this year does possibly bring a new open-ended war , then there 's admittedly more to it than the above mentioned rockets .
israel and hamas would go back to the time when both resorted to violence for lack of sensible policies though it was long obvious that violence only creates counter-violence and that the vicious circle can hardly be broken .
repeating old mistakes thus israel is committing a cardinal mistake by believing it can wipe out hamas with a military operation .
just as it thought it could disarm hezbollah two and a half years ago .
the massive attack on lebanon at the time instead bombed hezbollah into the government and the same thing could happen with hamas in palestine .
in january 2006 , hamas won elections and a big israeli offensive would drive the palestinians into group 's arms .
but the frustrated and battered palestinians as well as hamas are making a huge mistake too by hoping that hamas ' uncompromising stance will lead to a solution or deliverance .
hamas ' vehement rejection of israel 's right to exist can not be a foundation for peace .
former plo chief yasser arafat learned that lesson after decades of armed struggle against israel .
the result was the olso treaty and palestinian autonomy .
but israel squandered a chance for peace by diluting oslo .
it did that by building new settlements in the occupied territories for instance and thus destroying any hopes that the palestinians had pinned on the treaty .
israel 's one-sided retreat from the gaza strip did n't do anything to change that .
an " occupied " territory turned into a " besieged " one under tight blockades particularly when hamas took control of gaza .
as always , it was the always the wrong people who suffered the most .
it was n't the ideologues or the snipers but rather civilians - women , children , old people - who bore the brunt .
they will be the ones who will do so again in the current escalation .
bombs after all do n't differentiate between people .
the world can no longer afford to sit back and watch .
if international troops can be mobilized for the fight against terrorists and pirates , then the world should be able to do more in palestine than simply pay lip service .
at least in order to prevent the worst if not to bring peace .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de foreign relations -pipe- 28.12.2008 2008 : a tough year in german foreign policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and frank-walter steinmeier lead germany 's coalition government germany 's government in 2008 was tested by the world 's financial crisis and the military mission in afghanistan while frictions dominated the ruling coalition .
barack obama , however , was cheered across party lines . during the most dazzling event of the year in foreign policy in germany , the spotlight was n't on the german government , but on an american : barack obama .
as the presidential candidate of the democratic party , he visited berlin and held a much-anticipated speech at the victory column in front of 200,000 . it is highly unlikely - no , simply unimaginable - that as many people would have poured into the tiergarten , berlin 's central park , had it been the chancellor or and a group of high-ranking german politicians on stage instead of obama .
members of germany 's political class these days inspire more yawns than cheers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berliners welcomed obama at his speech at the victory column barack obama chose the monument as the place for his speech after some discussion – looking back it proved to be an omen of success .
in november , a delighted angela merkel congratulated the winner . " we 're witnessing a historical election victory , " merkel said . " no , we ca n't " obama delivered a wide-ranging speech and putting the focus on trans-atlantic ties .
in the eyes of many germans george w. bush had ruined those .
so hardly anybody noticed bush 's parting visit to angela merkel . merkel had tried to explain to him the pain threshold in german foreign policy , for example afghanistan .
under no circumstances did the german government want to send troops to the hard-fought south of afghanistan . the next task is to convince the american president-elect that germany 's version of his famous slogan is : " no , we ca n't . "
the german government is convinced to be doing enough for the stabilization of afghanistan . only in october , germany 's parliament voted to extend the country 's military mission and to deploy an extra 1,000 troops there , boosting their number to 4,500 .
germany 's allies should appreciate this commitment , said german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier . " we have pointed out in the past what germany does in afghanistan , not only the bundeswehr , but also what our civil helpers do for reconstruction , " steinmeier said .
" we get a lot of respect for that , also in the united states of america . " afghanistan remains key issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr forces patrolling on the outskirts of kunduz , northern afghanistan afghanistan remained one of the most controversial security topics for the german government in 2008 .
the training of the afghan police and army was plagued with problems .
regularly , the taliban fired at bundeswehr camps and attacked patrols . in october , two german soldiers died near kundus in a suicide attack .
for the first time since german soldiers were sent to afghanistan six years ago , german defense minister franz josef jung referred in november to the gefallene , or fallen soldiers , who had died there .
until now , any german soldiers killed in afghanistan were referred to as casualties . throughout 2008 , the military played an important role in german foreign policy .
german soldiers were deployed to afghanistan , kosovo , bosnia , the horn of africa and to the coast of lebanon .
unarmed forces were sent to southern sudan and georgia .
at the end of 2008 the bundeswehr took part in the european anti-pirate-force " atalanta " along the coast of somalia . but seen as a whole , german foreign policy in 2008 came across as fractured and heading in too many directions .
while , 2007 was dominated by major events such as the eu presidency and the g8 summit in heiligendamm , a clear course was never set for 2008 .
part of what was accomplished in 2007 fell victim to the global financial crisis and the irish eu " no " vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy did n't call and invite angela merkel to the mini-summit merkel stopped being the woman of action and was overshadowed by french president nicolas sarkozy 's overdrive .
in december , merkel - notable among european leaders for her wariness about increasing public borrowing to fund government spending - was excluded from a mini-summit initiated by sarkozy .
steinmeier was not amused . " i 'll be honest : i do n't think it was nice that germany and the chancellor were n't there , " he said . frictions within german government coalition another dilemma put a strain on german foreign policy in 2008 : the two most important people , christian democrat merkel and social democrat steinmeier disagreed on a number of issues , especially in the approach to countries like russia , china and syria . merkel either tends to be quite frank and open or she contains herself .
steinmeier places emphasis on rapproachment though diplomacy and dialogue .
their differing styles of policy-making led to some confusion in 2008 - much to the pleasure of the opposition .
the green party 's juergen trittin accused the government of having not one but two foreign policies . " one of them is responsible for the dalai lama , the other one for china , " trittin said .
" the foreign minister advocates dialogue with syria and is being criticized for it by the christian democrats .
or when asked what the government thinks of the positioning of new american missiles in europe , you wo n't get a consistent answer ! " merkel vs. steinmeier bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier wants to challenge merkel in next year 's election the disagreements also affected the dalai lama 's visit to germany : german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , a social democrat , was the only cabinet member to receive him .
the year before , chancellor merkel 's reception of the exiled tibetan spiritual leader angered china as well as her own foreign minister , who accused her of trying to " showcase " human rights . foreign policy expectations for 2009 are low : in october , steinmeier won his party 's support to face merkel in next year 's election .
an election campaign pitting merkel vs. steinmeier is likely to water down german foreign policy even more . dw staff -lrb- nma -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the eu sees israel as one of its most important foreign partners , but is the largest donor of aid to the palestinian territories , giving it a keen interest in seeing stability in the region . recently , the bloc has highlighted israel 's closure of the key crossings into and out of gaza as exacerbating the already difficult situation . day two israeli aircraft pounded the gaza strip for the second day sunday , hitting a hamas headquarters in gaza city , witnesses said , and bringing to 22 the number of attacks launched against the islamist movement since midnight . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamas has continued launching rocket attacks on israel the death toll in the israeli raids stood at 271 by mid-morning sunday , the majority believed to be militants .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 28.12.2008 germany 's lackluster athletes worry sports lovers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this year 's german athletes of the year - but the country 's top athletes are not exactly household names the german sports scene lacks star power .
whether its swimming , soccer or skiing , sports commentators are finding reasons to be pessimistic about 2009 . first , the good news .
germany will host the world athletics championships in 2009 .
but apart from that berlin event , the forecast for the nation 's sports is as bleak as the glum economic predictions .
the former sports power lacks stars in major sports ranging from football to athletics and swimming .
in addition , there is an almost frightening disappearance of events from tennis to formula one .
always second best bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs another steffi graf berlin and leipzig have suffered embarrassment in their attempts to host olympic games in recent years .
major events such as wimbledon are no longer broadcast on free-to-air television channels and there is no footage at all of the elite golden league athletics series as soccer rules the airwaves , pushing out almost anything else .
perennial runner-up michael ballack was the only german on the shortlist for the 2009 world footballer award .
katrin krabbe was the last german to win an athletics world title on the track in 1991 .
and the tennis glory days of boris becker and steffi graf are long gone .
germany placed fifth in the medal table at the beijing olympics , but a report from a leipzig-based training institute -lrb- iat -rrb- said that was no reason to cheer .
" high-performance sport in germany is in danger of losing contact to developments in world sports .
performances are on the decline in many sports , " the sueddeutsche zeitung -lrb- sz -rrb- newspaper wrote in mid-december , quoting an iat report .
bleak all year ' round bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael ballack has had to be content with second place had britta steffen not managed to win gold medals in the 50 and 100-meter freestyle events in beijing , germany would have ended with no gold at all in the showcase sports of athletics and swimming , which alone account for 81 of the 302 gold medals on offer at the games .
the winter situation is similar , with germany only a minor player in the popular sports of alpine skiing and figure skating .
instead , german athletes win their medals in luge , biathlon or bobsleigh , events which are not popular in many countries .
according to the sz , germany is the only country from the world 's big six - the others being the us , china , great britain , russia and australia - which does n't focus on sports with the most medals on offer or those with a long tradition in the country .
the iat criticism ranges from badly educated coaches to a lack of scientific support .
stellar stadiums are n't enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's winter sports prowess is also lacking only last week germany coach joachim loew and other officials went to france to look at the country 's famous soccer academy in clairefontaine .
germany has no such institute and lags behind in club and country competitions .
" we are world class as far as stadium atmosphere is concerned .
but we must do more on the pitch , " said former german soccer coach juergen klinsmann , now in charge at bayern munich .
germany came in second at euro 2008 but had its tactical deficits exposed by spain .
the last title came at euro 1996 and the world cup has not been won since 1990 .
just one year later krabbe - whose name has been tainted by doping allegations - claimed the last major sprint title when athletes from former east germany still ruled the scene shortly after the 1990 reunification .
doping-infested cycling is also on its way out and so is tennis , with the hamburg masters downgraded and the women 's berlin tournament possibly moving elsewhere .
winter olympics offers hope bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cars might be german , but the races are held elsewhere germany may also be without a formula one grand prix in 2010 , even though it is a country which has two major team players in mercedes and bmw , a record four drivers in the field and the most successful driver ever in seven-time champion michael schumacher .
the main hopes for a better future lie in improved training programs , a rise of new talent and the hosting of big events .
munich is setting up a promising bid for the 2018 winter olympics and officials have high hopes in the athletics worlds in berlin as well .
" we can all make 2009 a historic year in german athletics , " pledged clemens prokop , president of the german athletics association . dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

how could it have been otherwise in a year in which la seleccion won all of their matches ? -lrb- 17.12.2008 -rrb- despite strife , coach loew remains upbeat about 2008 germany coach joachim loew has admitted to dissenting voices in the national team squad but still feels the euro 2008 finalists can look back " positively overall " on the year .

the world has to finally get involved in the middle east conflict , deutsche welle 's peter philipp says . no country in the world would accept being regularly fired at with rockets and taking no action against it .
that 's why israel is counting on international support and using renewed rocket attacks from the gaza strip since the end of the six-month ceasefire announced by hamas last week as justification for its massive military operation against hamas .
the group along with others in the gaza strip are " taking revenge " by firing rockets once again on southern israel .
unless there 's a miracle , this is the perfect situation for a further escalation which would have unforeseen consequences .
but it 's also a completely superfluous yet final proof that the promises made at the annapolis conference in the us in nov 2007 to resume peace talks with the aim of reaching a comprehensive agreement by the end of 2008 were nothing more than empty words .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp if the end of this year does possibly bring a new open-ended war , then there 's admittedly more to it than the above mentioned rockets .
israel and hamas would go back to the time when both resorted to violence for lack of sensible policies though it was long obvious that violence only creates counter-violence and that the vicious circle can hardly be broken .
repeating old mistakes thus israel is committing a cardinal mistake by believing it can wipe out hamas with a military operation .
just as it thought it could disarm hezbollah two and a half years ago .
the massive attack on lebanon at the time instead bombed hezbollah into the government and the same thing could happen with hamas in palestine .
in january 2006 , hamas won elections and a big israeli offensive would drive the palestinians into group 's arms .
but the frustrated and battered palestinians as well as hamas are making a huge mistake too by hoping that hamas ' uncompromising stance will lead to a solution or deliverance .
hamas ' vehement rejection of israel 's right to exist can not be a foundation for peace .
former plo chief yasser arafat learned that lesson after decades of armed struggle against israel .
the result was the olso treaty and palestinian autonomy .
but israel squandered a chance for peace by diluting oslo .
it did that by building new settlements in the occupied territories for instance and thus destroying any hopes that the palestinians had pinned on the treaty .
israel 's one-sided retreat from the gaza strip did n't do anything to change that .
an " occupied " territory turned into a " besieged " one under tight blockades particularly when hamas took control of gaza .
as always , it was the always the wrong people who suffered the most .
it was n't the ideologues or the snipers but rather civilians - women , children , old people - who bore the brunt .
they will be the ones who will do so again in the current escalation .
bombs after all do n't differentiate between people .
the world can no longer afford to sit back and watch .
if international troops can be mobilized for the fight against terrorists and pirates , then the world should be able to do more in palestine than simply pay lip service .
at least in order to prevent the worst if not to bring peace .

whether its swimming , soccer or skiing , sports commentators are finding reasons to be pessimistic about 2009 . first , the good news .
germany will host the world athletics championships in 2009 .
but apart from that berlin event , the forecast for the nation 's sports is as bleak as the glum economic predictions .
the former sports power lacks stars in major sports ranging from football to athletics and swimming .
in addition , there is an almost frightening disappearance of events from tennis to formula one .
always second best bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs another steffi graf berlin and leipzig have suffered embarrassment in their attempts to host olympic games in recent years .
major events such as wimbledon are no longer broadcast on free-to-air television channels and there is no footage at all of the elite golden league athletics series as soccer rules the airwaves , pushing out almost anything else .
perennial runner-up michael ballack was the only german on the shortlist for the 2009 world footballer award .
katrin krabbe was the last german to win an athletics world title on the track in 1991 .
and the tennis glory days of boris becker and steffi graf are long gone .
germany placed fifth in the medal table at the beijing olympics , but a report from a leipzig-based training institute -lrb- iat -rrb- said that was no reason to cheer .
" high-performance sport in germany is in danger of losing contact to developments in world sports .
performances are on the decline in many sports , " the sueddeutsche zeitung -lrb- sz -rrb- newspaper wrote in mid-december , quoting an iat report .
bleak all year ' round bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael ballack has had to be content with second place had britta steffen not managed to win gold medals in the 50 and 100-meter freestyle events in beijing , germany would have ended with no gold at all in the showcase sports of athletics and swimming , which alone account for 81 of the 302 gold medals on offer at the games .
the winter situation is similar , with germany only a minor player in the popular sports of alpine skiing and figure skating .
instead , german athletes win their medals in luge , biathlon or bobsleigh , events which are not popular in many countries .
according to the sz , germany is the only country from the world 's big six - the others being the us , china , great britain , russia and australia - which does n't focus on sports with the most medals on offer or those with a long tradition in the country .
the iat criticism ranges from badly educated coaches to a lack of scientific support .
stellar stadiums are n't enough bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's winter sports prowess is also lacking only last week germany coach joachim loew and other officials went to france to look at the country 's famous soccer academy in clairefontaine .
germany has no such institute and lags behind in club and country competitions .
" we are world class as far as stadium atmosphere is concerned .
but we must do more on the pitch , " said former german soccer coach juergen klinsmann , now in charge at bayern munich .
germany came in second at euro 2008 but had its tactical deficits exposed by spain .
the last title came at euro 1996 and the world cup has not been won since 1990 .
just one year later krabbe - whose name has been tainted by doping allegations - claimed the last major sprint title when athletes from former east germany still ruled the scene shortly after the 1990 reunification .
doping-infested cycling is also on its way out and so is tennis , with the hamburg masters downgraded and the women 's berlin tournament possibly moving elsewhere .
winter olympics offers hope bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cars might be german , but the races are held elsewhere germany may also be without a formula one grand prix in 2010 , even though it is a country which has two major team players in mercedes and bmw , a record four drivers in the field and the most successful driver ever in seven-time champion michael schumacher .
the main hopes for a better future lie in improved training programs , a rise of new talent and the hosting of big events .
munich is setting up a promising bid for the 2018 winter olympics and officials have high hopes in the athletics worlds in berlin as well .
" we can all make 2009 a historic year in german athletics , " pledged clemens prokop , president of the german athletics association . dpa news agency -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de swimming legend labels streamline suits unfair former german swim star michael gross has entered the debate over streamline racing suits , which have led to a flood of world records , by calling on his sport to return to using basic equipment .
-lrb- 19.12.2008 -rrb- number-one fifa ranking crowns spain 's dream year in a surprise to absolutely no one , european champions spain came out tops in fifa 's final 2008 rankings .
how could it have been otherwise in a year in which la seleccion won all of their matches ? -lrb- 17.12.2008 -rrb- despite strife , coach loew remains upbeat about 2008 germany coach joachim loew has admitted to dissenting voices in the national team squad but still feels the euro 2008 finalists can look back " positively overall " on the year .

barack obama , however , was cheered across party lines . during the most dazzling event of the year in foreign policy in germany , the spotlight was n't on the german government , but on an american : barack obama .
as the presidential candidate of the democratic party , he visited berlin and held a much-anticipated speech at the victory column in front of 200,000 . it is highly unlikely - no , simply unimaginable - that as many people would have poured into the tiergarten , berlin 's central park , had it been the chancellor or and a group of high-ranking german politicians on stage instead of obama .
members of germany 's political class these days inspire more yawns than cheers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berliners welcomed obama at his speech at the victory column barack obama chose the monument as the place for his speech after some discussion – looking back it proved to be an omen of success .
in november , a delighted angela merkel congratulated the winner . " we 're witnessing a historical election victory , " merkel said . " no , we ca n't " obama delivered a wide-ranging speech and putting the focus on trans-atlantic ties .
in the eyes of many germans george w. bush had ruined those .
so hardly anybody noticed bush 's parting visit to angela merkel . merkel had tried to explain to him the pain threshold in german foreign policy , for example afghanistan .
under no circumstances did the german government want to send troops to the hard-fought south of afghanistan . the next task is to convince the american president-elect that germany 's version of his famous slogan is : " no , we ca n't . "
the german government is convinced to be doing enough for the stabilization of afghanistan . only in october , germany 's parliament voted to extend the country 's military mission and to deploy an extra 1,000 troops there , boosting their number to 4,500 .
germany 's allies should appreciate this commitment , said german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier . " we have pointed out in the past what germany does in afghanistan , not only the bundeswehr , but also what our civil helpers do for reconstruction , " steinmeier said .

steinmeier places emphasis on rapproachment though diplomacy and dialogue .

barack obama , however , was cheered across party lines . during the most dazzling event of the year in foreign policy in germany , the spotlight was n't on the german government , but on an american : barack obama .
as the presidential candidate of the democratic party , he visited berlin and held a much-anticipated speech at the victory column in front of 200,000 . it is highly unlikely - no , simply unimaginable - that as many people would have poured into the tiergarten , berlin 's central park , had it been the chancellor or and a group of high-ranking german politicians on stage instead of obama .
members of germany 's political class these days inspire more yawns than cheers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berliners welcomed obama at his speech at the victory column barack obama chose the monument as the place for his speech after some discussion – looking back it proved to be an omen of success .
in november , a delighted angela merkel congratulated the winner . " we 're witnessing a historical election victory , " merkel said . " no , we ca n't " obama delivered a wide-ranging speech and putting the focus on trans-atlantic ties .
in the eyes of many germans george w. bush had ruined those .
so hardly anybody noticed bush 's parting visit to angela merkel . merkel had tried to explain to him the pain threshold in german foreign policy , for example afghanistan .
under no circumstances did the german government want to send troops to the hard-fought south of afghanistan . the next task is to convince the american president-elect that germany 's version of his famous slogan is : " no , we ca n't . "
the german government is convinced to be doing enough for the stabilization of afghanistan . only in october , germany 's parliament voted to extend the country 's military mission and to deploy an extra 1,000 troops there , boosting their number to 4,500 .
germany 's allies should appreciate this commitment , said german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier . " we have pointed out in the past what germany does in afghanistan , not only the bundeswehr , but also what our civil helpers do for reconstruction , " steinmeier said .
" we get a lot of respect for that , also in the united states of america . " afghanistan remains key issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeswehr forces patrolling on the outskirts of kunduz , northern afghanistan afghanistan remained one of the most controversial security topics for the german government in 2008 .
the training of the afghan police and army was plagued with problems .
regularly , the taliban fired at bundeswehr camps and attacked patrols . in october , two german soldiers died near kundus in a suicide attack .
for the first time since german soldiers were sent to afghanistan six years ago , german defense minister franz josef jung referred in november to the gefallene , or fallen soldiers , who had died there .
until now , any german soldiers killed in afghanistan were referred to as casualties . throughout 2008 , the military played an important role in german foreign policy .
german soldiers were deployed to afghanistan , kosovo , bosnia , the horn of africa and to the coast of lebanon .
unarmed forces were sent to southern sudan and georgia .
at the end of 2008 the bundeswehr took part in the european anti-pirate-force " atalanta " along the coast of somalia . but seen as a whole , german foreign policy in 2008 came across as fractured and heading in too many directions .
while , 2007 was dominated by major events such as the eu presidency and the g8 summit in heiligendamm , a clear course was never set for 2008 .
part of what was accomplished in 2007 fell victim to the global financial crisis and the irish eu " no " vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy did n't call and invite angela merkel to the mini-summit merkel stopped being the woman of action and was overshadowed by french president nicolas sarkozy 's overdrive .
in december , merkel - notable among european leaders for her wariness about increasing public borrowing to fund government spending - was excluded from a mini-summit initiated by sarkozy .
steinmeier was not amused . " i 'll be honest : i do n't think it was nice that germany and the chancellor were n't there , " he said . frictions within german government coalition another dilemma put a strain on german foreign policy in 2008 : the two most important people , christian democrat merkel and social democrat steinmeier disagreed on a number of issues , especially in the approach to countries like russia , china and syria . merkel either tends to be quite frank and open or she contains herself .

the world has to finally get involved in the middle east conflict , deutsche welle 's peter philipp says . no country in the world would accept being regularly fired at with rockets and taking no action against it .
that 's why israel is counting on international support and using renewed rocket attacks from the gaza strip since the end of the six-month ceasefire announced by hamas last week as justification for its massive military operation against hamas .
the group along with others in the gaza strip are " taking revenge " by firing rockets once again on southern israel .
unless there 's a miracle , this is the perfect situation for a further escalation which would have unforeseen consequences .
but it 's also a completely superfluous yet final proof that the promises made at the annapolis conference in the us in nov 2007 to resume peace talks with the aim of reaching a comprehensive agreement by the end of 2008 were nothing more than empty words .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp if the end of this year does possibly bring a new open-ended war , then there 's admittedly more to it than the above mentioned rockets .
israel and hamas would go back to the time when both resorted to violence for lack of sensible policies though it was long obvious that violence only creates counter-violence and that the vicious circle can hardly be broken .
repeating old mistakes thus israel is committing a cardinal mistake by believing it can wipe out hamas with a military operation .
just as it thought it could disarm hezbollah two and a half years ago .
the massive attack on lebanon at the time instead bombed hezbollah into the government and the same thing could happen with hamas in palestine .
in january 2006 , hamas won elections and a big israeli offensive would drive the palestinians into group 's arms .
but the frustrated and battered palestinians as well as hamas are making a huge mistake too by hoping that hamas ' uncompromising stance will lead to a solution or deliverance .
hamas ' vehement rejection of israel 's right to exist can not be a foundation for peace .
former plo chief yasser arafat learned that lesson after decades of armed struggle against israel .
the result was the olso treaty and palestinian autonomy .
but israel squandered a chance for peace by diluting oslo .
it did that by building new settlements in the occupied territories for instance and thus destroying any hopes that the palestinians had pinned on the treaty .
israel 's one-sided retreat from the gaza strip did n't do anything to change that .
an " occupied " territory turned into a " besieged " one under tight blockades particularly when hamas took control of gaza .
as always , it was the always the wrong people who suffered the most .
it was n't the ideologues or the snipers but rather civilians - women , children , old people - who bore the brunt .
they will be the ones who will do so again in the current escalation .
bombs after all do n't differentiate between people .
the world can no longer afford to sit back and watch .
if international troops can be mobilized for the fight against terrorists and pirates , then the world should be able to do more in palestine than simply pay lip service .
at least in order to prevent the worst if not to bring peace .

the world has to finally get involved in the middle east conflict , deutsche welle 's peter philipp says . no country in the world would accept being regularly fired at with rockets and taking no action against it .
that 's why israel is counting on international support and using renewed rocket attacks from the gaza strip since the end of the six-month ceasefire announced by hamas last week as justification for its massive military operation against hamas .
the group along with others in the gaza strip are " taking revenge " by firing rockets once again on southern israel .
unless there 's a miracle , this is the perfect situation for a further escalation which would have unforeseen consequences .
but it 's also a completely superfluous yet final proof that the promises made at the annapolis conference in the us in nov 2007 to resume peace talks with the aim of reaching a comprehensive agreement by the end of 2008 were nothing more than empty words .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp if the end of this year does possibly bring a new open-ended war , then there 's admittedly more to it than the above mentioned rockets .
israel and hamas would go back to the time when both resorted to violence for lack of sensible policies though it was long obvious that violence only creates counter-violence and that the vicious circle can hardly be broken .
repeating old mistakes thus israel is committing a cardinal mistake by believing it can wipe out hamas with a military operation .
just as it thought it could disarm hezbollah two and a half years ago .
the massive attack on lebanon at the time instead bombed hezbollah into the government and the same thing could happen with hamas in palestine .
in january 2006 , hamas won elections and a big israeli offensive would drive the palestinians into group 's arms .
but the frustrated and battered palestinians as well as hamas are making a huge mistake too by hoping that hamas ' uncompromising stance will lead to a solution or deliverance .
hamas ' vehement rejection of israel 's right to exist can not be a foundation for peace .
former plo chief yasser arafat learned that lesson after decades of armed struggle against israel .
the result was the olso treaty and palestinian autonomy .
but israel squandered a chance for peace by diluting oslo .
it did that by building new settlements in the occupied territories for instance and thus destroying any hopes that the palestinians had pinned on the treaty .
israel 's one-sided retreat from the gaza strip did n't do anything to change that .
an " occupied " territory turned into a " besieged " one under tight blockades particularly when hamas took control of gaza .
as always , it was the always the wrong people who suffered the most .
it was n't the ideologues or the snipers but rather civilians - women , children , old people - who bore the brunt .
they will be the ones who will do so again in the current escalation .
bombs after all do n't differentiate between people .

the world has to finally get involved in the middle east conflict , deutsche welle 's peter philipp says . no country in the world would accept being regularly fired at with rockets and taking no action against it .
that 's why israel is counting on international support and using renewed rocket attacks from the gaza strip since the end of the six-month ceasefire announced by hamas last week as justification for its massive military operation against hamas .
the group along with others in the gaza strip are " taking revenge " by firing rockets once again on southern israel .
unless there 's a miracle , this is the perfect situation for a further escalation which would have unforeseen consequences .
but it 's also a completely superfluous yet final proof that the promises made at the annapolis conference in the us in nov 2007 to resume peace talks with the aim of reaching a comprehensive agreement by the end of 2008 were nothing more than empty words .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp if the end of this year does possibly bring a new open-ended war , then there 's admittedly more to it than the above mentioned rockets .
israel and hamas would go back to the time when both resorted to violence for lack of sensible policies though it was long obvious that violence only creates counter-violence and that the vicious circle can hardly be broken .
repeating old mistakes thus israel is committing a cardinal mistake by believing it can wipe out hamas with a military operation .
just as it thought it could disarm hezbollah two and a half years ago .
the massive attack on lebanon at the time instead bombed hezbollah into the government and the same thing could happen with hamas in palestine .
in january 2006 , hamas won elections and a big israeli offensive would drive the palestinians into group 's arms .
but the frustrated and battered palestinians as well as hamas are making a huge mistake too by hoping that hamas ' uncompromising stance will lead to a solution or deliverance .
hamas ' vehement rejection of israel 's right to exist can not be a foundation for peace .
former plo chief yasser arafat learned that lesson after decades of armed struggle against israel .
the result was the olso treaty and palestinian autonomy .
but israel squandered a chance for peace by diluting oslo .
it did that by building new settlements in the occupied territories for instance and thus destroying any hopes that the palestinians had pinned on the treaty .
israel 's one-sided retreat from the gaza strip did n't do anything to change that .
an " occupied " territory turned into a " besieged " one under tight blockades particularly when hamas took control of gaza .
as always , it was the always the wrong people who suffered the most .
it was n't the ideologues or the snipers but rather civilians - women , children , old people - who bore the brunt .
they will be the ones who will do so again in the current escalation .
bombs after all do n't differentiate between people .
the world can no longer afford to sit back and watch .
if international troops can be mobilized for the fight against terrorists and pirates , then the world should be able to do more in palestine than simply pay lip service .
at least in order to prevent the worst if not to bring peace .

he said the priority of gordon brown 's government must be financial stability , including working in close partnership with the welsh assembly government .
mr murphy said they could " offer support to stimulate the economy " .
but in his new year 's message he warned that there was " no silver bullet " for the financial climate .
" after witnessing the booming economic growth of recent years , in wales , like the rest of the uk and virtually the whole world , we are preparing ourselves for a more demanding economic climate in the months ahead , " said mr murphy .
it is critically important that the uk and the welsh assembly governments both listen carefully to the experiences of businesses and other local groups to ensure we understand exactly what is happening at the sharp end paul murphy " that is why i am sure many of you , especially those facing job uncertainty or redundancies , have tightened your belts and cut back this christmas .
" the government 's priority at the moment must be financial stability .
' invaluable ' " this is also a time when it is critically important that the uk and the welsh assembly governments both listen carefully to the experiences of businesses and other local groups to ensure we understand exactly what is happening at the sharp end of the downturn .
" that is why i have been attending all-wales economic summit meetings with welsh first minister rhodri morgan . "
mr murphy said the summits had been " invaluable " in bringing together private businesses , unions and financial institutions .
joe calzaghe 's us win was just one of paul murphy 's highlights in 2008 " i want to reassure you that the government will be continuing to work in partnership with the welsh assembly to ensure 2009 is as happy and prosperous a new year as possible for you and your families , " he added .
mr murphy said 2008 had been an extraordinary year , and not just in the financial markets .
" since my own return as secretary of state for wales last january , i have witnessed one of the most remarkable years for wales for many generations , " added the minister .
" there has been welsh sporting glory in one of the most successful sporting calendar years wales has ever seen .
" whether it was on the rugby or soccer pitch , boxing ring or at the olympic and paralympics games in beijing this summer , welsh sportsmen and women made 2008 a golden year for welsh sport .
he singled out the success of boxer joe calzaghe , who remains undefeated after his victory in new york over roy jones jnr .
he also highlighted the welsh olympic achievements of cyclists nicole cooke and geraint thomas , the rower tom james , and the paralympic golds of swimmer david roberts .
the welsh secretary also had praise for wales ' impact on arts and entertainment in 2008 , especially the comedy series gavin and stacey , and bbc wales ' dr who .

the nickname was to stick throughout its existence .
toys were a staple of woolworths ' business as its popularity soared .
in the 1950s , shoppers flocked to its january sales .
in the years immediately after the second world war , some stores - like here in plymouth - remained boarded up .
but post-war austerity did not stop the sale of another woolies favourite - easter eggs .
by the 1960s , woolworths was a formidable high street presence .
its status secured it a place in the modern shopping centres of new towns like kirkby , in the north-west .
decimalisation may have changed the prices in 1971 but , as chairman of the decimal currency board lord fiske found out , it did not affect woolies ' range of stock after the 1980s , while sales of many goods dropped in the face of growing competition , pic ' n ' mix remained a favourite with customers .
the economic downturn of 2008 brought about woolworths ' downfall .
it entered administration and immediately launched huge discounts which resulted in the chain 's biggest ever trading day .
despite the sales , the administrators have so far been unable to find a buyer and the shutters were brought down for the final time on the first tranche of stores on saturday .
shoppers remained sentimental about the woolies brand .
but their messages of goodwill were not sufficiently matched by spending to keep the stores open .
woolworths staff have been praised for their professionalism in the face of redundancy .
for many , it is the emotional end of a long association with the store .
