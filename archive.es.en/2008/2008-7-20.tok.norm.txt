the speech , they say , will focus on the need to strengthen trans-atlantic relations to meet 21st-century challenges . obama is set to meet with german chancellor angela merkel and other top politicians on thursday , july 24 before giving an hour-long public speech at berlin 's gold-topped victory column , about a mile from the historic brandenburg gate . obamamania in germany the us presidential contender , hailed as the new john f kennedy in germany , is hugely popular in germany .
a poll published this month in bild newspaper showed 72 percent of germans would vote for him if they could . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's gold-topped victory column is expected to draw a million people when obama speaks berlin authorities expect up to a million people to show up at the strasse des 17 juni between the brandenburg gate and victory column , or siegesaeule , to hear obama speak .
his speech is scheduled at around 7 p.m. on thursday . german media have reported that authorities plan to set up an obama " fan mile , " similar to arrangements during the european soccer championship and the soccer world cup two years ago to allow thousands to watch the event on big screens . after seven years of george w. bush - a deeply unpopular us president in germany - europeans are lapping up the illinois senator 's message of change . analysts say obama , if elected us president , could inject a new momentum into diplomatic relations with germany which have improved since chancellor merkel took office . " people here see him almost as a political redeemer after seven years of bush , " political analyst jan techau of the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- told news agency dpa this week . visit marred by controversy though berlin is abuzz with excitement about obama 's visit , the venue for his much-anticipated speech follows weeks of speculation and controversy in germany . obama is believed to have originally wanted to hold his speech at the brandenburg gate .
however , german chancellor angela merkel made clear she was against " electioneering " by obama at the historic monument and a symbol of german unity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel was against an obama " electioneering " at the historic brandenburg gate her comments put her at odds with foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier who said he would welcome an appearance by obama at the brandenburg gate . obama 's team decided against tempelhof airport , the site of the berlin airlift , and opted instead for the victory column . still , the compromise site for obama 's speech , a 70-meter high column built to celebrate 19th century prussian military victories over denmark , france and austria , continues to rankle some german politicians . " the siegessaeule in berlin was moved from the reichstag -lrb- german parliament -rrb- to its current position by adolf hitler , " rainer bruederle , deputy chairman of the opposition liberal party , fdp , said in an interview with bild am sonntag .
he said he questioned , " if barack obama has been well advised to use it as the site of a speech outlining his vision of a world of cooperation . " the same paper quoted andreas schockenhoff , deputy chairman of the christian democrats in parliament , criticizing the " unhappy symbolism " of the venue . " the berlin victory colum is dedicated to victory over neighbors who today are our european friends and allies , " he said . obama 's planned speech in berlin has also sparked a row in the us with a foreign policy aide to john mccain , the republican presidential candidate , saying it was an " election show . " referring to the controversy over the venue for obama 's speech , randy scheunemann told german news magazine der spiegel this week that obama had put " a close american ally in an unpleasant position , " with his decision to take his campaign abroad . a sustainable love-affair ? obama is in afghanistan sunday as part of a whirlwind tour abroad that will also take him to iraq and the middle east .
after speaking in berlin on thursday he is to visit france and britain . though obama is expected to stress a more multilateral approach on foreign policy than the current bush administration , experts warn he will still have to tackle difficult issues , for example on world trade and afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's budweiser comments have generated some concern in europe some of obama 's comments about reforming the north american free trade agreement -lrb- nafta -rrb- have caused worry among europeans .
obama recently said that he felt it was " a shame " that belgium-based brewer , inbev nv would take over the iconic budweiser label . this week , europe 's top trade commissioner , peter mandelson , called on obama to stop " crowd-pleasing rhetoric " which could be interpreted as anti-trade . in an interview with bloomberg television , mandelson called on both obama and likely republican candidate john mccain to " acknowledge the huge benefits for the american economy and the american people of continued trade growth . " jan techau told dpa that obama still had n't spelt out his stance on a number of thorny issues . " iraq , afghanistan , iran and missile defense - these are the issues , although he has n't named them , " techau said .
" this will be the most important part of the speech .

our achievements belong to the whole world and should be used for expanding love and peace , " said iranian vice-president esfandiar rahim-mashaei , who is also head of the cultural heritage organization . the cultural heritage organization news agency quoted him as saying that even during the eight-year war against iraq -lrb- 1980-88 -rrb- , iran just defended itself against the military invasion by former iraqi dictator saddam hussein . the remarks by the vice-president followed last week 's warnings by some iranian officials that tehran 's long-range missiles could target the jewish state if the us and israel realized their threats to attack iran 's nuclear sites . ahmadinejad himself caused international uproar with his anti- israeli tirades , voicing hope for eradication of israel from the middle east , demanding its relocation to europe or alaska and doubting the historic dimension of the holocaust during world war ii .
after a day of high-level talks in geneva between iran and representatives of the five un veto powers and germany on saturday , july 19 , the european union 's foreign policy chief javier solana said not enough progress had been made to persuade tehran to suspend uranium enrichment .
" there is always progress in these talks , but insufficient , " and the international community was still waiting for iran 's response to a proposed package of incentives for tehran to give up its nuclear programme , solana said .
" it was a constructive meeting , but still we did n't get the answer to our questions , " said solana , who added he hoped for an answer from tehran in two weeks .
a " freeze for freeze " approach western countries have slapped several sets of sanctions on tehran over its refusal to halt enrichment which it believes is meant to develop nuclear weapons .
iran vehemently denies seeking nuclear weapons , insisting that its program is designed to provide energy for its growing population for the time when its reserves of fossil fuels run out .
the meeting on saturday in geneva was supposed to talk about future cooperation in the areas of economy , nuclear energy and politics , once tehran halts its nuclear activities .
it was also meant to pave the way to full negotiations possible by squaring the world powers ' precondition of nuclear suspension with iran 's insistence on its right to civilian nuclear energy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west suspects iran of covertly developing a nuclear program britain , france , germany , the united states , russia and china are offering iran a " freeze for freeze " approach .
in a pre-negotiation phase , tehran would not expand its enrichment facility in natanz , while the six nations would not press for additional security council sanctions .
after confidence between the two sides has been established in this phase , iran would halt its uranium enrichment , and comprehensive talks about the world powers ' offer of cooperation and similar package put forward by iran could start .
iran refuses to play along but iran 's top nuclear negotiator saeed jalili after talks in geneva that in any next round of talks iran was not ready to discuss a freeze in enrichment proposed by the " sextet " in return for the un security council halting further sanctions measures . " we will only discuss common points of the package , " jalili told reuters .
he described the talks as " constructive and progressing " in comments to reporters afterwards .
" there are points in common and points that are not in common , " jalili said .
" we have agreed to discuss this . "
the iranian nuclear negotiator compared the diplomatic process to weaving traditional persian carpets : progress in cases " moves forward in millimetres , " he said .
" it 's a very precise work , in certain cases it 's a very beautiful endeavour and hopefully the end result , the final product would be beautiful to behold , " jalili said .
us warns iran of further isolation the meeting in geneva took on added importance with the us sending a high-ranking representative , undersecretary of state william burns - the first us diplomat in 30 years to participate in negotiations with iran .
burns however did not take an active role in the talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burns ' participation in the talks was seen as a shift in washington 's hard-line stance towards iran in a statement issued after the meeting , us state department spokesman sean mccormack said iran has two weeks to " give a clear answer , " and added : " iran has a choice to make : negotiation or further isolation . "
burns , it said , delivered a " clear simple message " that washington was " serious " in backing proposed international incentives for iran to halt uranium enrichment and that it will only engage in negotiations with iran when it does so .
" we hope the iranian people understand that their leaders need to make a choice between cooperation , which would bring benefits to all , and confrontation , which can only lead to further isolation , " the statement said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's top placed driver was nick heidfeld in fourth . renault 's nelson piquet jr. was a surprise second and felipe massa of ferrari finished third behind hamilton , whose fourth season win was the first for mclaren-mercedes at hockenheim in a decade .
heidfeld , in a bmw-sauber , took fourth followed by heikki kovalainen in the second mclaren with defending world champion kimi raikkonen of ferrari sixth .
bmw 's robert kubica and sebastian vettel of toro rosso completed the points placings .
hamilton , who also won the british gp a fortnight ago , now heads the drivers ' standings with 58 points after 10 of 18 races thanks his victory in a time of 1 hour 31 minutes 20.874 seconds for the 67 laps .
massa sits second on 54 with teammate raikkonen third on 51 points .
starting from pole position on the grid ahead of massa , hamilton got a flying start into the first corner and immediately started building up a commanding lead .
the 23-year-old briton pitted on lap 18 , taking on a significant amount of fuel for his second stint , but was briefly held up by jarno trulli of toyota before the italian pitted .
once kovalainen and massa pitted , hamilton once again started building up his advantage on track , running up a lead of nearly 10 seconds after 25 laps .
glock crash causes congestion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glock 's crash caused problems for other drivers however , the cars bunched back together with 32 laps remaining when the safety car was called out following a spectacular crash involving timo glock .
the toyota driver 's right rear suspension appeared to snap , sending his car careering into the pit wall at high speed and sending debris flying all over the track .
both ferraris and kovalainen were among a host of cars to take advantage of the presence of the safety car to pit while hamilton remained out on track , a decision that initially looked like it might cost him victory .
the drivers to gain most advantage from glock 's misfortune were heidfeld , who moved up to second thanks to pitting on lap 27 , and piquet jr . , who had also pitted just before the german 's accident and found himself in third when racing resumed five laps later .
hamilton began to pull away again in an effort to build up a lead on massa but had to pit again on lap 50 , returning on soft compounds in sixth place behind kovalainen .
the finn appeared to allow his teammate pass him a lap later while once heidfeld pitted , piquet jr. found himself the surprise leader from massa .
hamilton immediately began closing down on massa and passed the brazilian at the hairpin on 57 to move up to second behind piquet jr .
the brazilian 's renault was no match for the power of the mclaren and hamilton regained top spot with eight laps remaining before then cruising to victory . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 20.07.2008 release of tom cruise 's world war ii epic delayed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tom cruise 's attempt on hitler 's life wo n't be seen in cinemas until next year a movie in which tom cruise plays a true-life german world war ii hero will not reach screens until february 2009 , the producers said as germans were getting ready to mark the 64th anniversary of the anti-hitler plot . " valkyrie " was meant to launch this summer as public interest grows in the failed bid to assassinate the nazi dictator on july 20 , 1944 .
the german armed forces revere the chief plotter , colonel claus von stauffenberg , as a paragon of self-initiative and courage , and are set to hold a torchlit parade on sunday in berlin in his memory .
the film 's german-language website includes both a promotional video in english still giving the 2008 release date and a fast-moving trailer in german stating the german theatre release will be on february 5 .
talk of an autumn release has come to nothing .
carl woebcken , chief executive of studio babelsberg , which is co- producing the movie with cruise 's company united artists , said the delay was beneficial since the film could earn better box-office receipts next year .
" shooting has only just finished , " he said .
" we 're likely to have the first rough edit of the movie by the end of july . "
location filming in germany began in july last year , just as germany was gearing up to mark the 63rd anniversary of the plot , and lasted till october .
the director was bryan singer .
cruise , who plays stauffenberg , is the main face in the trailer .
the video uses overlays with a real-life stauffenberg photo to assert that he is the spitting image of the german aristocrat , who placed a bomb near hitler 's knees at the dictator 's wolf 's lair headquarter .
hitler survived the blast with cuts .
the fact that the audience will know from the beginning that the bomb plot failed has raised questions about whether the film can be truly exciting .
the producers say it is more a thriller than a war movie .
" the first half of the movie explains to you who these people were and what they would have to go through to successfully assassinate adolf hitler .
" the second half of the movie we wanted to be the day of the event itself , " explains writer christopher mcquarrie in the video .
the casting of cruise , a practicing scientologist , in the role of the anti-nazi hero caused controversy last year in germany , where the scientology creed is viewed by some people as anti-democratic .
stauffenberg and his fellow plotters are among the very few members of germany 's wartime armed services given hero status today . dpa news agency send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the speech , they say , will focus on the need to strengthen trans-atlantic relations to meet 21st-century challenges . obama is set to meet with german chancellor angela merkel and other top politicians on thursday , july 24 before giving an hour-long public speech at berlin 's gold-topped victory column , about a mile from the historic brandenburg gate . obamamania in germany the us presidential contender , hailed as the new john f kennedy in germany , is hugely popular in germany .
a poll published this month in bild newspaper showed 72 percent of germans would vote for him if they could . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's gold-topped victory column is expected to draw a million people when obama speaks berlin authorities expect up to a million people to show up at the strasse des 17 juni between the brandenburg gate and victory column , or siegesaeule , to hear obama speak .
his speech is scheduled at around 7 p.m. on thursday . german media have reported that authorities plan to set up an obama " fan mile , " similar to arrangements during the european soccer championship and the soccer world cup two years ago to allow thousands to watch the event on big screens . after seven years of george w. bush - a deeply unpopular us president in germany - europeans are lapping up the illinois senator 's message of change . analysts say obama , if elected us president , could inject a new momentum into diplomatic relations with germany which have improved since chancellor merkel took office . " people here see him almost as a political redeemer after seven years of bush , " political analyst jan techau of the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- told news agency dpa this week . visit marred by controversy though berlin is abuzz with excitement about obama 's visit , the venue for his much-anticipated speech follows weeks of speculation and controversy in germany . obama is believed to have originally wanted to hold his speech at the brandenburg gate .
however , german chancellor angela merkel made clear she was against " electioneering " by obama at the historic monument and a symbol of german unity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel was against an obama " electioneering " at the historic brandenburg gate her comments put her at odds with foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier who said he would welcome an appearance by obama at the brandenburg gate . obama 's team decided against tempelhof airport , the site of the berlin airlift , and opted instead for the victory column . still , the compromise site for obama 's speech , a 70-meter high column built to celebrate 19th century prussian military victories over denmark , france and austria , continues to rankle some german politicians . " the siegessaeule in berlin was moved from the reichstag -lrb- german parliament -rrb- to its current position by adolf hitler , " rainer bruederle , deputy chairman of the opposition liberal party , fdp , said in an interview with bild am sonntag .
he said he questioned , " if barack obama has been well advised to use it as the site of a speech outlining his vision of a world of cooperation . " the same paper quoted andreas schockenhoff , deputy chairman of the christian democrats in parliament , criticizing the " unhappy symbolism " of the venue . " the berlin victory colum is dedicated to victory over neighbors who today are our european friends and allies , " he said . obama 's planned speech in berlin has also sparked a row in the us with a foreign policy aide to john mccain , the republican presidential candidate , saying it was an " election show . " referring to the controversy over the venue for obama 's speech , randy scheunemann told german news magazine der spiegel this week that obama had put " a close american ally in an unpleasant position , " with his decision to take his campaign abroad . a sustainable love-affair ? obama is in afghanistan sunday as part of a whirlwind tour abroad that will also take him to iraq and the middle east .
after speaking in berlin on thursday he is to visit france and britain . though obama is expected to stress a more multilateral approach on foreign policy than the current bush administration , experts warn he will still have to tackle difficult issues , for example on world trade and afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's budweiser comments have generated some concern in europe some of obama 's comments about reforming the north american free trade agreement -lrb- nafta -rrb- have caused worry among europeans .
obama recently said that he felt it was " a shame " that belgium-based brewer , inbev nv would take over the iconic budweiser label . this week , europe 's top trade commissioner , peter mandelson , called on obama to stop " crowd-pleasing rhetoric " which could be interpreted as anti-trade . in an interview with bloomberg television , mandelson called on both obama and likely republican candidate john mccain to " acknowledge the huge benefits for the american economy and the american people of continued trade growth . " jan techau told dpa that obama still had n't spelt out his stance on a number of thorny issues . " iraq , afghanistan , iran and missile defense - these are the issues , although he has n't named them , " techau said .

" iran wants no war with any country , and today iran is friend of the united states and even israel . ...
our achievements belong to the whole world and should be used for expanding love and peace , " said iranian vice-president esfandiar rahim-mashaei , who is also head of the cultural heritage organization . the cultural heritage organization news agency quoted him as saying that even during the eight-year war against iraq -lrb- 1980-88 -rrb- , iran just defended itself against the military invasion by former iraqi dictator saddam hussein . the remarks by the vice-president followed last week 's warnings by some iranian officials that tehran 's long-range missiles could target the jewish state if the us and israel realized their threats to attack iran 's nuclear sites . ahmadinejad himself caused international uproar with his anti- israeli tirades , voicing hope for eradication of israel from the middle east , demanding its relocation to europe or alaska and doubting the historic dimension of the holocaust during world war ii .
after a day of high-level talks in geneva between iran and representatives of the five un veto powers and germany on saturday , july 19 , the european union 's foreign policy chief javier solana said not enough progress had been made to persuade tehran to suspend uranium enrichment .
" there is always progress in these talks , but insufficient , " and the international community was still waiting for iran 's response to a proposed package of incentives for tehran to give up its nuclear programme , solana said .
" it was a constructive meeting , but still we did n't get the answer to our questions , " said solana , who added he hoped for an answer from tehran in two weeks .
a " freeze for freeze " approach western countries have slapped several sets of sanctions on tehran over its refusal to halt enrichment which it believes is meant to develop nuclear weapons .
iran vehemently denies seeking nuclear weapons , insisting that its program is designed to provide energy for its growing population for the time when its reserves of fossil fuels run out .
the meeting on saturday in geneva was supposed to talk about future cooperation in the areas of economy , nuclear energy and politics , once tehran halts its nuclear activities .
it was also meant to pave the way to full negotiations possible by squaring the world powers ' precondition of nuclear suspension with iran 's insistence on its right to civilian nuclear energy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west suspects iran of covertly developing a nuclear program britain , france , germany , the united states , russia and china are offering iran a " freeze for freeze " approach .
in a pre-negotiation phase , tehran would not expand its enrichment facility in natanz , while the six nations would not press for additional security council sanctions .
after confidence between the two sides has been established in this phase , iran would halt its uranium enrichment , and comprehensive talks about the world powers ' offer of cooperation and similar package put forward by iran could start .
iran refuses to play along but iran 's top nuclear negotiator saeed jalili after talks in geneva that in any next round of talks iran was not ready to discuss a freeze in enrichment proposed by the " sextet " in return for the un security council halting further sanctions measures . " we will only discuss common points of the package , " jalili told reuters .
he described the talks as " constructive and progressing " in comments to reporters afterwards .
" there are points in common and points that are not in common , " jalili said .
" we have agreed to discuss this . "
the iranian nuclear negotiator compared the diplomatic process to weaving traditional persian carpets : progress in cases " moves forward in millimetres , " he said .
" it 's a very precise work , in certain cases it 's a very beautiful endeavour and hopefully the end result , the final product would be beautiful to behold , " jalili said .
us warns iran of further isolation the meeting in geneva took on added importance with the us sending a high-ranking representative , undersecretary of state william burns - the first us diplomat in 30 years to participate in negotiations with iran .
burns however did not take an active role in the talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burns ' participation in the talks was seen as a shift in washington 's hard-line stance towards iran in a statement issued after the meeting , us state department spokesman sean mccormack said iran has two weeks to " give a clear answer , " and added : " iran has a choice to make : negotiation or further isolation .

the speech , they say , will focus on the need to strengthen trans-atlantic relations to meet 21st-century challenges . obama is set to meet with german chancellor angela merkel and other top politicians on thursday , july 24 before giving an hour-long public speech at berlin 's gold-topped victory column , about a mile from the historic brandenburg gate . obamamania in germany the us presidential contender , hailed as the new john f kennedy in germany , is hugely popular in germany .
a poll published this month in bild newspaper showed 72 percent of germans would vote for him if they could . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's gold-topped victory column is expected to draw a million people when obama speaks berlin authorities expect up to a million people to show up at the strasse des 17 juni between the brandenburg gate and victory column , or siegesaeule , to hear obama speak .
his speech is scheduled at around 7 p.m. on thursday . german media have reported that authorities plan to set up an obama " fan mile , " similar to arrangements during the european soccer championship and the soccer world cup two years ago to allow thousands to watch the event on big screens . after seven years of george w. bush - a deeply unpopular us president in germany - europeans are lapping up the illinois senator 's message of change . analysts say obama , if elected us president , could inject a new momentum into diplomatic relations with germany which have improved since chancellor merkel took office . " people here see him almost as a political redeemer after seven years of bush , " political analyst jan techau of the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- told news agency dpa this week . visit marred by controversy though berlin is abuzz with excitement about obama 's visit , the venue for his much-anticipated speech follows weeks of speculation and controversy in germany . obama is believed to have originally wanted to hold his speech at the brandenburg gate .
however , german chancellor angela merkel made clear she was against " electioneering " by obama at the historic monument and a symbol of german unity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel was against an obama " electioneering " at the historic brandenburg gate her comments put her at odds with foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier who said he would welcome an appearance by obama at the brandenburg gate . obama 's team decided against tempelhof airport , the site of the berlin airlift , and opted instead for the victory column . still , the compromise site for obama 's speech , a 70-meter high column built to celebrate 19th century prussian military victories over denmark , france and austria , continues to rankle some german politicians . " the siegessaeule in berlin was moved from the reichstag -lrb- german parliament -rrb- to its current position by adolf hitler , " rainer bruederle , deputy chairman of the opposition liberal party , fdp , said in an interview with bild am sonntag .
he said he questioned , " if barack obama has been well advised to use it as the site of a speech outlining his vision of a world of cooperation . " the same paper quoted andreas schockenhoff , deputy chairman of the christian democrats in parliament , criticizing the " unhappy symbolism " of the venue . " the berlin victory colum is dedicated to victory over neighbors who today are our european friends and allies , " he said . obama 's planned speech in berlin has also sparked a row in the us with a foreign policy aide to john mccain , the republican presidential candidate , saying it was an " election show . " referring to the controversy over the venue for obama 's speech , randy scheunemann told german news magazine der spiegel this week that obama had put " a close american ally in an unpleasant position , " with his decision to take his campaign abroad . a sustainable love-affair ? obama is in afghanistan sunday as part of a whirlwind tour abroad that will also take him to iraq and the middle east .
after speaking in berlin on thursday he is to visit france and britain . though obama is expected to stress a more multilateral approach on foreign policy than the current bush administration , experts warn he will still have to tackle difficult issues , for example on world trade and afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's budweiser comments have generated some concern in europe some of obama 's comments about reforming the north american free trade agreement -lrb- nafta -rrb- have caused worry among europeans .
obama recently said that he felt it was " a shame " that belgium-based brewer , inbev nv would take over the iconic budweiser label . this week , europe 's top trade commissioner , peter mandelson , called on obama to stop " crowd-pleasing rhetoric " which could be interpreted as anti-trade . in an interview with bloomberg television , mandelson called on both obama and likely republican candidate john mccain to " acknowledge the huge benefits for the american economy and the american people of continued trade growth . " jan techau told dpa that obama still had n't spelt out his stance on a number of thorny issues . " iraq , afghanistan , iran and missile defense - these are the issues , although he has n't named them , " techau said .
" this will be the most important part of the speech .

" valkyrie " was meant to launch this summer as public interest grows in the failed bid to assassinate the nazi dictator on july 20 , 1944 .
the german armed forces revere the chief plotter , colonel claus von stauffenberg , as a paragon of self-initiative and courage , and are set to hold a torchlit parade on sunday in berlin in his memory .
the film 's german-language website includes both a promotional video in english still giving the 2008 release date and a fast-moving trailer in german stating the german theatre release will be on february 5 .
talk of an autumn release has come to nothing .
carl woebcken , chief executive of studio babelsberg , which is co- producing the movie with cruise 's company united artists , said the delay was beneficial since the film could earn better box-office receipts next year .
" shooting has only just finished , " he said .
" we 're likely to have the first rough edit of the movie by the end of july . "
location filming in germany began in july last year , just as germany was gearing up to mark the 63rd anniversary of the plot , and lasted till october .
the director was bryan singer .
cruise , who plays stauffenberg , is the main face in the trailer .
the video uses overlays with a real-life stauffenberg photo to assert that he is the spitting image of the german aristocrat , who placed a bomb near hitler 's knees at the dictator 's wolf 's lair headquarter .
hitler survived the blast with cuts .
the fact that the audience will know from the beginning that the bomb plot failed has raised questions about whether the film can be truly exciting .
the producers say it is more a thriller than a war movie .
" the first half of the movie explains to you who these people were and what they would have to go through to successfully assassinate adolf hitler .
" the second half of the movie we wanted to be the day of the event itself , " explains writer christopher mcquarrie in the video .
the casting of cruise , a practicing scientologist , in the role of the anti-nazi hero caused controversy last year in germany , where the scientology creed is viewed by some people as anti-democratic .
stauffenberg and his fellow plotters are among the very few members of germany 's wartime armed services given hero status today . dpa news agency send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" iran wants no war with any country , and today iran is friend of the united states and even israel . ...
our achievements belong to the whole world and should be used for expanding love and peace , " said iranian vice-president esfandiar rahim-mashaei , who is also head of the cultural heritage organization . the cultural heritage organization news agency quoted him as saying that even during the eight-year war against iraq -lrb- 1980-88 -rrb- , iran just defended itself against the military invasion by former iraqi dictator saddam hussein . the remarks by the vice-president followed last week 's warnings by some iranian officials that tehran 's long-range missiles could target the jewish state if the us and israel realized their threats to attack iran 's nuclear sites . ahmadinejad himself caused international uproar with his anti- israeli tirades , voicing hope for eradication of israel from the middle east , demanding its relocation to europe or alaska and doubting the historic dimension of the holocaust during world war ii .
after a day of high-level talks in geneva between iran and representatives of the five un veto powers and germany on saturday , july 19 , the european union 's foreign policy chief javier solana said not enough progress had been made to persuade tehran to suspend uranium enrichment .
" there is always progress in these talks , but insufficient , " and the international community was still waiting for iran 's response to a proposed package of incentives for tehran to give up its nuclear programme , solana said .
" it was a constructive meeting , but still we did n't get the answer to our questions , " said solana , who added he hoped for an answer from tehran in two weeks .
a " freeze for freeze " approach western countries have slapped several sets of sanctions on tehran over its refusal to halt enrichment which it believes is meant to develop nuclear weapons .
iran vehemently denies seeking nuclear weapons , insisting that its program is designed to provide energy for its growing population for the time when its reserves of fossil fuels run out .
the meeting on saturday in geneva was supposed to talk about future cooperation in the areas of economy , nuclear energy and politics , once tehran halts its nuclear activities .
it was also meant to pave the way to full negotiations possible by squaring the world powers ' precondition of nuclear suspension with iran 's insistence on its right to civilian nuclear energy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west suspects iran of covertly developing a nuclear program britain , france , germany , the united states , russia and china are offering iran a " freeze for freeze " approach .
in a pre-negotiation phase , tehran would not expand its enrichment facility in natanz , while the six nations would not press for additional security council sanctions .
after confidence between the two sides has been established in this phase , iran would halt its uranium enrichment , and comprehensive talks about the world powers ' offer of cooperation and similar package put forward by iran could start .
iran refuses to play along but iran 's top nuclear negotiator saeed jalili after talks in geneva that in any next round of talks iran was not ready to discuss a freeze in enrichment proposed by the " sextet " in return for the un security council halting further sanctions measures . " we will only discuss common points of the package , " jalili told reuters .
he described the talks as " constructive and progressing " in comments to reporters afterwards .
" there are points in common and points that are not in common , " jalili said .
" we have agreed to discuss this . "
the iranian nuclear negotiator compared the diplomatic process to weaving traditional persian carpets : progress in cases " moves forward in millimetres , " he said .
" it 's a very precise work , in certain cases it 's a very beautiful endeavour and hopefully the end result , the final product would be beautiful to behold , " jalili said .
us warns iran of further isolation the meeting in geneva took on added importance with the us sending a high-ranking representative , undersecretary of state william burns - the first us diplomat in 30 years to participate in negotiations with iran .
burns however did not take an active role in the talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burns ' participation in the talks was seen as a shift in washington 's hard-line stance towards iran in a statement issued after the meeting , us state department spokesman sean mccormack said iran has two weeks to " give a clear answer , " and added : " iran has a choice to make : negotiation or further isolation . "
burns , it said , delivered a " clear simple message " that washington was " serious " in backing proposed international incentives for iran to halt uranium enrichment and that it will only engage in negotiations with iran when it does so .

germany 's top placed driver was nick heidfeld in fourth . renault 's nelson piquet jr. was a surprise second and felipe massa of ferrari finished third behind hamilton , whose fourth season win was the first for mclaren-mercedes at hockenheim in a decade .
heidfeld , in a bmw-sauber , took fourth followed by heikki kovalainen in the second mclaren with defending world champion kimi raikkonen of ferrari sixth .
bmw 's robert kubica and sebastian vettel of toro rosso completed the points placings .
hamilton , who also won the british gp a fortnight ago , now heads the drivers ' standings with 58 points after 10 of 18 races thanks his victory in a time of 1 hour 31 minutes 20.874 seconds for the 67 laps .
massa sits second on 54 with teammate raikkonen third on 51 points .
starting from pole position on the grid ahead of massa , hamilton got a flying start into the first corner and immediately started building up a commanding lead .
the 23-year-old briton pitted on lap 18 , taking on a significant amount of fuel for his second stint , but was briefly held up by jarno trulli of toyota before the italian pitted .
once kovalainen and massa pitted , hamilton once again started building up his advantage on track , running up a lead of nearly 10 seconds after 25 laps .

the toyota driver 's right rear suspension appeared to snap , sending his car careering into the pit wall at high speed and sending debris flying all over the track .
both ferraris and kovalainen were among a host of cars to take advantage of the presence of the safety car to pit while hamilton remained out on track , a decision that initially looked like it might cost him victory .
the drivers to gain most advantage from glock 's misfortune were heidfeld , who moved up to second thanks to pitting on lap 27 , and piquet jr . , who had also pitted just before the german 's accident and found himself in third when racing resumed five laps later .
hamilton began to pull away again in an effort to build up a lead on massa but had to pit again on lap 50 , returning on soft compounds in sixth place behind kovalainen .
the finn appeared to allow his teammate pass him a lap later while once heidfeld pitted , piquet jr. found himself the surprise leader from massa .
hamilton immediately began closing down on massa and passed the brazilian at the hairpin on 57 to move up to second behind piquet jr .

eu commission chief barroso urged trade ministers from more than 30 nations meeting for make-or-break talks in geneva monday to reach a balanced deal , warning that emerging economies too had to make a major contribution . after nearly seven years of unsuccessful haggling , trade ministers from three dozen rich , poor and emerging economies will try to bridge massive differences on farm subsidies , import tariffs and accessibility of markets at a meeting in geneva which opens monday , july 21 .
called the doha development agenda or doha round , named after the qatari capital where the world trade talks were first launched with great fanfare and hope in 2001 , the negotiations have been jammed for years .
at the heart of the deadlock lie developing nations ' demand for lower farm subsidies and agricultural tariffs in the rich world .
in return , industrialized countries are pressing that developing countries reduce import duties and make their markets more accessible to imported services and manufactured goods .
both sides have been slow to move away from their entrenched positions and make concessions .
" now or never " the geneva meeting is marked by a sense of urgency given the fact that from next january , the united states will have a new administration and a new congress whose attitudes toward trade liberalization are at this point uncertain .
" it has never been more important for wto members to move forward on the doha development agenda , " world bank president robert zoellick said in a statement before the talks .
" it is now or never , " said zoellick , who as former us trade representative helped launch the doha round in 2001 .
in a statement in brussels , jose manuel barroso said the talks were " perhaps the last great opportunity " to conclude the doha round .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european farmers are against lowering duties on imports such as sugar from brazil " for those negotiations to succeed , the other developed countries and the emerging economies in the wto also have to make a major contribution .
the overall result has to be balanced and ambitious , " barroso said .
" europe can not be the sole banker of this deal . "
germany urges emerging economies to do more the view was echoed by germany 's economy minister michael glos who called on emerging global powerhouses to stop hiding behind developing countries ' demands in a newspaper article .
" major emerging countries like brazil , india and china do not have the right to entrench their positions in the name of developing countries , " glos wrote in the monday edition of business daily financial times deutschland . " to my mind , it is indispensable that the major emerging -lrb- markets -rrb- assume their responsibilities in the global trade system , " he wrote .
" they too must guarantee real improvements in access to -lrb- their -rrb- markets , " he said , adding that concessions must go both ways .
german industry federation chief juergen thumann told another business daily , handelsblatt that a deal could only be achieved if both sides were willing to make compromises .
" as long as certain key participants see the world trade organization summit as a one-way street , agreement is unlikely , " he said .
one of the main sticking points is the level of farm support that rich nations dole out to their farmers .
rich countries are concerned that proposals to allow developing countries to protect their fledgling industries from the full impact of tariff cuts could allow them to shield entire sectors from market opening .
eu divided however , the eu 's own position in the talks has been undermined by a public row between french president nicolas sarkozy and eu trade commissioner peter mandelson .
france , backed by ireland , believes that mandelson has made too many concessions on agriculture to emerging economies without getting much in return .
on friday , french trade minister anne-marie idrac said after a meeting with eu counterparts that they had agreed that the wto talks needed a " new balance " to take better account of concessions brussels had already put on the table .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say only rich countries stand to benefit from wto proposals on farm subsidies " the general sentiment is that europe has exhausted its room for manoeuvre in the agricultural sector and can go no further , " she said .
critics however point out that rich countries are the only ones who stand to profit from the current negotiations .
" industrialized nations demand from developing nations that they reduce their customs duties on imports .
but the industrialized nations are only offering in return to cut farm subsidies up to a level which is still more than what they 're actually spending right now , " said tobias reichert , expert on world trade for non-government group , germanwatch .
as an example , he pointed out that the us is meant to limit its agricultural subsidies to 13 billion euros a year as foreseen by the wto proposals - more than what the country currently shells out . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

called the doha development agenda or doha round , named after the qatari capital where the world trade talks were first launched with great fanfare and hope in 2001 , the negotiations have been jammed for years .
at the heart of the deadlock lie developing nations ' demand for lower farm subsidies and agricultural tariffs in the rich world .
in return , industrialized countries are pressing that developing countries reduce import duties and make their markets more accessible to imported services and manufactured goods .
both sides have been slow to move away from their entrenched positions and make concessions .
" now or never " the geneva meeting is marked by a sense of urgency given the fact that from next january , the united states will have a new administration and a new congress whose attitudes toward trade liberalization are at this point uncertain .
" it has never been more important for wto members to move forward on the doha development agenda , " world bank president robert zoellick said in a statement before the talks .
" it is now or never , " said zoellick , who as former us trade representative helped launch the doha round in 2001 .
in a statement in brussels , jose manuel barroso said the talks were " perhaps the last great opportunity " to conclude the doha round .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european farmers are against lowering duties on imports such as sugar from brazil " for those negotiations to succeed , the other developed countries and the emerging economies in the wto also have to make a major contribution .
the overall result has to be balanced and ambitious , " barroso said .
" europe can not be the sole banker of this deal . "
germany urges emerging economies to do more the view was echoed by germany 's economy minister michael glos who called on emerging global powerhouses to stop hiding behind developing countries ' demands in a newspaper article .
" major emerging countries like brazil , india and china do not have the right to entrench their positions in the name of developing countries , " glos wrote in the monday edition of business daily financial times deutschland . " to my mind , it is indispensable that the major emerging -lrb- markets -rrb- assume their responsibilities in the global trade system , " he wrote .
" they too must guarantee real improvements in access to -lrb- their -rrb- markets , " he said , adding that concessions must go both ways .
german industry federation chief juergen thumann told another business daily , handelsblatt that a deal could only be achieved if both sides were willing to make compromises .
" as long as certain key participants see the world trade organization summit as a one-way street , agreement is unlikely , " he said .
one of the main sticking points is the level of farm support that rich nations dole out to their farmers .
rich countries are concerned that proposals to allow developing countries to protect their fledgling industries from the full impact of tariff cuts could allow them to shield entire sectors from market opening .
eu divided however , the eu 's own position in the talks has been undermined by a public row between french president nicolas sarkozy and eu trade commissioner peter mandelson .
france , backed by ireland , believes that mandelson has made too many concessions on agriculture to emerging economies without getting much in return .
on friday , french trade minister anne-marie idrac said after a meeting with eu counterparts that they had agreed that the wto talks needed a " new balance " to take better account of concessions brussels had already put on the table .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say only rich countries stand to benefit from wto proposals on farm subsidies " the general sentiment is that europe has exhausted its room for manoeuvre in the agricultural sector and can go no further , " she said .
critics however point out that rich countries are the only ones who stand to profit from the current negotiations .
" industrialized nations demand from developing nations that they reduce their customs duties on imports .
but the industrialized nations are only offering in return to cut farm subsidies up to a level which is still more than what they 're actually spending right now , " said tobias reichert , expert on world trade for non-government group , germanwatch .
as an example , he pointed out that the us is meant to limit its agricultural subsidies to 13 billion euros a year as foreseen by the wto proposals - more than what the country currently shells out . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the idea is to build bridges between european culture and the islamic nations .
" shiraz will be the first host in june 2009 , " explained the event 's artistic director , klaus gallas , in an interview with dpa news agency .
a 15-day iranian culture program will then take place in august 2009 in weimar .
the program will comprise concerts , literary readings and art exhibitions .
gallas intends to hold the divan festival every year thereafter in both weimar and a changing partner city in iran or the arab world .
he said talks were already under way with the united arab emirates on a venue there in 2010 .
the word " divan " has passed into several western languages meaning a collection of poetry .
this was inspired by the divan of hafez .
its author , hafez , was a persian mystic and poet born about 1325 in shiraz .
sams ud-din mohammed hafez lived till 1390 and his divan collection of subtly ambiguous poetry is admired in many countries .
the title was mirrored by the west-eastern divan , the title of an 1819 collection of poems in a quasi-persian style by johann wolfgang goethe -lrb- 1749-1832 -rrb- who lived in weimar and is revered as germany 's greatest poet , dramatist and novelist .
cross-cultural celebration " we are calling the event the west-eastern divan festival to commemorate both goethe and hafez , " said the organizer .
a 1999 west-eastern divan monument in weimar , in the form of two high-backed chairs carved out of stone and facing one another , already represents the two great national poets in virtual dialogue and recalls goethe 's cross-cultural interests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barenboim 's orchestra is composed of israelis and arabs the argentine-born conductor daniel barenboim has also used the name , separately setting up a west-eastern divan orchestra in weimar .
the city , which has given its name to the 1919-1933 pre-nazi weimar republic in germany , is a magnet for intellectual tourists because of its links with goethe and other leading german poets .
" we aim to hold a cultural festival in weimar that will be influential in the whole of europe , " said gallas .
" it will oppose the tendency to think in terms of blocks , east and west , occidental and oriental .
" the objective is to expose how we are mutually reluctant to be friends , how we are bound by our prejudices and misconceptions , " said gallas , who describes himself as a historian of culture .
he has visited iran several times , the first time more than 30 years ago .
project gets german governmental backing gallas said he had won government encouragement from the german foreign ministry , the goethe institute which promotes german culture abroad , the federal culture fund which promotes culture within germany and the municipality of weimar .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier agreed to give his patronage " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has agreed to be the patron , " said gallas , who has now taken the step of legally incorporating the west-eastern divan festival weimar as a non-profit society .
" the next step is to apply for public subsidies , " said gallas , who adds that he has set up a board of cultural advisers .
its membership would include mumbai-born classical music conductor zubin mehta , who has twice conducted the israel philharmonic orchestra in weimar .
two german orchestras will be led by iranian conductors in concerts at the opening and closing of the festival under gallas ' plan .
" in between those dates there will be public readings from the works of goethe and hafez , exhibitions by contemporary artists and concerts of iranian classical and popular music , " said gallas , 66 , who has been working on the project for more than a year .
he denied in the interview that he was encroaching on barenboim 's west-eastern divan orchestra .

the idea is to build bridges between european culture and the islamic nations .
" shiraz will be the first host in june 2009 , " explained the event 's artistic director , klaus gallas , in an interview with dpa news agency .
a 15-day iranian culture program will then take place in august 2009 in weimar .
the program will comprise concerts , literary readings and art exhibitions .
gallas intends to hold the divan festival every year thereafter in both weimar and a changing partner city in iran or the arab world .
he said talks were already under way with the united arab emirates on a venue there in 2010 .
the word " divan " has passed into several western languages meaning a collection of poetry .
this was inspired by the divan of hafez .
its author , hafez , was a persian mystic and poet born about 1325 in shiraz .
sams ud-din mohammed hafez lived till 1390 and his divan collection of subtly ambiguous poetry is admired in many countries .
the title was mirrored by the west-eastern divan , the title of an 1819 collection of poems in a quasi-persian style by johann wolfgang goethe -lrb- 1749-1832 -rrb- who lived in weimar and is revered as germany 's greatest poet , dramatist and novelist .
cross-cultural celebration " we are calling the event the west-eastern divan festival to commemorate both goethe and hafez , " said the organizer .
a 1999 west-eastern divan monument in weimar , in the form of two high-backed chairs carved out of stone and facing one another , already represents the two great national poets in virtual dialogue and recalls goethe 's cross-cultural interests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barenboim 's orchestra is composed of israelis and arabs the argentine-born conductor daniel barenboim has also used the name , separately setting up a west-eastern divan orchestra in weimar .
the city , which has given its name to the 1919-1933 pre-nazi weimar republic in germany , is a magnet for intellectual tourists because of its links with goethe and other leading german poets .
" we aim to hold a cultural festival in weimar that will be influential in the whole of europe , " said gallas .
" it will oppose the tendency to think in terms of blocks , east and west , occidental and oriental .
" the objective is to expose how we are mutually reluctant to be friends , how we are bound by our prejudices and misconceptions , " said gallas , who describes himself as a historian of culture .
he has visited iran several times , the first time more than 30 years ago .
project gets german governmental backing gallas said he had won government encouragement from the german foreign ministry , the goethe institute which promotes german culture abroad , the federal culture fund which promotes culture within germany and the municipality of weimar .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier agreed to give his patronage " foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has agreed to be the patron , " said gallas , who has now taken the step of legally incorporating the west-eastern divan festival weimar as a non-profit society .
" the next step is to apply for public subsidies , " said gallas , who adds that he has set up a board of cultural advisers .
its membership would include mumbai-born classical music conductor zubin mehta , who has twice conducted the israel philharmonic orchestra in weimar .
two german orchestras will be led by iranian conductors in concerts at the opening and closing of the festival under gallas ' plan .
" in between those dates there will be public readings from the works of goethe and hafez , exhibitions by contemporary artists and concerts of iranian classical and popular music , " said gallas , 66 , who has been working on the project for more than a year .

eu commission chief barroso urged trade ministers from more than 30 nations meeting for make-or-break talks in geneva monday to reach a balanced deal , warning that emerging economies too had to make a major contribution . after nearly seven years of unsuccessful haggling , trade ministers from three dozen rich , poor and emerging economies will try to bridge massive differences on farm subsidies , import tariffs and accessibility of markets at a meeting in geneva which opens monday , july 21 .
called the doha development agenda or doha round , named after the qatari capital where the world trade talks were first launched with great fanfare and hope in 2001 , the negotiations have been jammed for years .
at the heart of the deadlock lie developing nations ' demand for lower farm subsidies and agricultural tariffs in the rich world .
in return , industrialized countries are pressing that developing countries reduce import duties and make their markets more accessible to imported services and manufactured goods .
both sides have been slow to move away from their entrenched positions and make concessions .
" now or never " the geneva meeting is marked by a sense of urgency given the fact that from next january , the united states will have a new administration and a new congress whose attitudes toward trade liberalization are at this point uncertain .
" it has never been more important for wto members to move forward on the doha development agenda , " world bank president robert zoellick said in a statement before the talks .
" it is now or never , " said zoellick , who as former us trade representative helped launch the doha round in 2001 .
in a statement in brussels , jose manuel barroso said the talks were " perhaps the last great opportunity " to conclude the doha round .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european farmers are against lowering duties on imports such as sugar from brazil " for those negotiations to succeed , the other developed countries and the emerging economies in the wto also have to make a major contribution .
the overall result has to be balanced and ambitious , " barroso said .
" europe can not be the sole banker of this deal . "
germany urges emerging economies to do more the view was echoed by germany 's economy minister michael glos who called on emerging global powerhouses to stop hiding behind developing countries ' demands in a newspaper article .
" major emerging countries like brazil , india and china do not have the right to entrench their positions in the name of developing countries , " glos wrote in the monday edition of business daily financial times deutschland . " to my mind , it is indispensable that the major emerging -lrb- markets -rrb- assume their responsibilities in the global trade system , " he wrote .
" they too must guarantee real improvements in access to -lrb- their -rrb- markets , " he said , adding that concessions must go both ways .
german industry federation chief juergen thumann told another business daily , handelsblatt that a deal could only be achieved if both sides were willing to make compromises .
" as long as certain key participants see the world trade organization summit as a one-way street , agreement is unlikely , " he said .
one of the main sticking points is the level of farm support that rich nations dole out to their farmers .
rich countries are concerned that proposals to allow developing countries to protect their fledgling industries from the full impact of tariff cuts could allow them to shield entire sectors from market opening .
eu divided however , the eu 's own position in the talks has been undermined by a public row between french president nicolas sarkozy and eu trade commissioner peter mandelson .
france , backed by ireland , believes that mandelson has made too many concessions on agriculture to emerging economies without getting much in return .
on friday , french trade minister anne-marie idrac said after a meeting with eu counterparts that they had agreed that the wto talks needed a " new balance " to take better account of concessions brussels had already put on the table .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say only rich countries stand to benefit from wto proposals on farm subsidies " the general sentiment is that europe has exhausted its room for manoeuvre in the agricultural sector and can go no further , " she said .
critics however point out that rich countries are the only ones who stand to profit from the current negotiations .
" industrialized nations demand from developing nations that they reduce their customs duties on imports .
but the industrialized nations are only offering in return to cut farm subsidies up to a level which is still more than what they 're actually spending right now , " said tobias reichert , expert on world trade for non-government group , germanwatch .
as an example , he pointed out that the us is meant to limit its agricultural subsidies to 13 billion euros a year as foreseen by the wto proposals - more than what the country currently shells out . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 20.07.2008 release of tom cruise 's world war ii epic delayed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tom cruise 's attempt on hitler 's life wo n't be seen in cinemas until next year a movie in which tom cruise plays a true-life german world war ii hero will not reach screens until february 2009 , the producers said as germans were getting ready to mark the 64th anniversary of the anti-hitler plot . " valkyrie " was meant to launch this summer as public interest grows in the failed bid to assassinate the nazi dictator on july 20 , 1944 .
the german armed forces revere the chief plotter , colonel claus von stauffenberg , as a paragon of self-initiative and courage , and are set to hold a torchlit parade on sunday in berlin in his memory .
the film 's german-language website includes both a promotional video in english still giving the 2008 release date and a fast-moving trailer in german stating the german theatre release will be on february 5 .
talk of an autumn release has come to nothing .
carl woebcken , chief executive of studio babelsberg , which is co- producing the movie with cruise 's company united artists , said the delay was beneficial since the film could earn better box-office receipts next year .
" shooting has only just finished , " he said .
" we 're likely to have the first rough edit of the movie by the end of july . "
location filming in germany began in july last year , just as germany was gearing up to mark the 63rd anniversary of the plot , and lasted till october .
the director was bryan singer .
cruise , who plays stauffenberg , is the main face in the trailer .
the video uses overlays with a real-life stauffenberg photo to assert that he is the spitting image of the german aristocrat , who placed a bomb near hitler 's knees at the dictator 's wolf 's lair headquarter .
hitler survived the blast with cuts .
the fact that the audience will know from the beginning that the bomb plot failed has raised questions about whether the film can be truly exciting .
the producers say it is more a thriller than a war movie .
" the first half of the movie explains to you who these people were and what they would have to go through to successfully assassinate adolf hitler .
" the second half of the movie we wanted to be the day of the event itself , " explains writer christopher mcquarrie in the video .
the casting of cruise , a practicing scientologist , in the role of the anti-nazi hero caused controversy last year in germany , where the scientology creed is viewed by some people as anti-democratic .
stauffenberg and his fellow plotters are among the very few members of germany 's wartime armed services given hero status today . dpa news agency send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" valkyrie " was meant to launch this summer as public interest grows in the failed bid to assassinate the nazi dictator on july 20 , 1944 .
the german armed forces revere the chief plotter , colonel claus von stauffenberg , as a paragon of self-initiative and courage , and are set to hold a torchlit parade on sunday in berlin in his memory .
the film 's german-language website includes both a promotional video in english still giving the 2008 release date and a fast-moving trailer in german stating the german theatre release will be on february 5 .
talk of an autumn release has come to nothing .
carl woebcken , chief executive of studio babelsberg , which is co- producing the movie with cruise 's company united artists , said the delay was beneficial since the film could earn better box-office receipts next year .
" shooting has only just finished , " he said .
" we 're likely to have the first rough edit of the movie by the end of july . "
location filming in germany began in july last year , just as germany was gearing up to mark the 63rd anniversary of the plot , and lasted till october .
the director was bryan singer .
cruise , who plays stauffenberg , is the main face in the trailer .
the video uses overlays with a real-life stauffenberg photo to assert that he is the spitting image of the german aristocrat , who placed a bomb near hitler 's knees at the dictator 's wolf 's lair headquarter .
hitler survived the blast with cuts .
the fact that the audience will know from the beginning that the bomb plot failed has raised questions about whether the film can be truly exciting .
the producers say it is more a thriller than a war movie .
" the first half of the movie explains to you who these people were and what they would have to go through to successfully assassinate adolf hitler .
" the second half of the movie we wanted to be the day of the event itself , " explains writer christopher mcquarrie in the video .
the casting of cruise , a practicing scientologist , in the role of the anti-nazi hero caused controversy last year in germany , where the scientology creed is viewed by some people as anti-democratic .

spiegel said that it had located four of the men in germany and interviewed two , who denied committing war crimes .
the unit of the nazi party private army , the ss , was commanded by oskar dirlewanger who formed his violent military unit out of ex-prisoners , spiegel said in a story for publication monday .
it said polish officials had sent the file to the national war-crimes prosecutions office at ludwigsburg , germany .
the german office said it had been asked to trace surviving dirlewanger personnel and study if they could be prosecuted for nazi reprisals after the warsaw uprising of 1944 .
the unit had at first been formed out of poachers , and later included ex-prisoners from armed forces jails and concentration camps .
spiegel said all previous attempts to identify them had failed , but names had now been found in red cross tracing records .
spiegel quoted one former member of the unit saying he did not join the unit until 1945 .
he praised the commander dirlewanger .
" he was a great guy .
always at the forefront , never the rear , " said the man , 83 .
spiegel said the unit conducted mass rapes and its massacres in belarus and poland included putting people in barns and setting them alight , slaughtering doctors and nurses at a hospital and " clearing " mines by making civilians walk on them .

however , home fans will be cheering on a glut of homegrown talent scattered through the grid . hamilton registered a time of 1 minute 15.666 seconds on the 4.574-kilometre hockenheim circuit to finish ahead of ferrari 's felipe massa , who clocked a time of 1:15.859 . heikki kovalainen was third fastest in the second mclaren while toyota 's jarno trulli will start from fourth on the grid after putting in a stunning drive . " i knew i had it in me , i knew i had the pace , i am quite cool , " said hamilton .
" it has been very windy , you notice it down the back straight - when you get to stadium and then suddenly you have a big gust of wind . " hamilton is coming off a superb win in the british home gp of mclaren that drew him level on 48 points with massa and his ferrari teammate kimi raikkonen at the top of the championship standings . he complimented his team before adding that he felt sunday 's race , another home event due to mercedes , would be quite tight . hamilton ahead - but only just bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamilton stays cool as the championship heat increases " i am surprised how close all the teams were , " he said .
" between ferrari and mclaren it is a tenth -lrb- of a second -rrb- here or there but we have the pace to win . " massa , for his part , said he found qualifying " very tough " but that both sides would only know how strong they were on sunday when it became clear how much fuel each car was carrying . " it is very competitive between mclaren and ferrari and it will be a big competition between the four cars .
hopefully we will do everything right in the race , " said the brazilian . kovalainen said he was very happy with his third place , not least because he went off track in the final session . " the car has been performing really well last the five or six weeks .
we have made significant steps forward , " said the finn , who took the first pole of his career at the last f1 race at silverstone . renault 's fernando alonso qualified in fifth spot followed by the defending world champion raikkonen , who appeared to struggle throughout the session in his ferrari . robert kubica of bmw-sauber , who sits two points behind the leaders in the driver 's standings , starts from seventh on the grid alongside red bull 's mark webber while toro rosso 's sebastian vettel and david coulthard in the second red bull complete the top 10 . nick heidfeld in the second bmw-sauber will start from 12th on the grid behind toyota 's timo glock after a mistake in the second qualifying round saw the german fail to make it to the final round . experienced heidfeld looks for first win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will nick heidfeld be germany 's number one ?
heidfeld is the most experienced german driver on the track .
the 30-year-old has over 130 races under his belt .
he has finished second three times but has never won a grand prix .
last year heidfeld was essentially " the best of the rest " in his bmw sauber , finishing fifth in the drivers ' championship behind the men at top teams , mclaren and ferrari .
heidfeld says he wants to go one step further in 2008 and challenge for victories , and fans and observers believe he has the ability and experience to do this .
for years heidfeld lived in the shadow of german motor sport legend michael schumacher .
but while it may seem that his way is now clear to take the top german driver slot , a precocious young talent is seeking to catch up with bmw and relegate heidfeld to the role of german number two again .
german wunderkind with finnish pedigree bildunterschrift : team germany 2008 : heidfeld , glock , vettel , rosberg and sutil nico rosberg is germany 's rising star .
the blonde-haired , clean-cut , multilingual poster boy is a tremendously quick driver , who mclaren mercedes reportedly tried to sign in the off-season .
but rosberg has stayed with williams toyota , and many expect rosberg to impress in 2008 .
some confusion surrounds rosberg 's quest to be germany 's number one .
his father , keke rosberg , was the first finnish world champion which many would say rules nico out of that quest .
but young nico holds a german passport , making him heidfeld 's number one contender .
another german rising star is sebastian vettel .

" iran wants no war with any country , and today iran is friend of the united states and even israel . ...
our achievements belong to the whole world and should be used for expanding love and peace , " said iranian vice-president esfandiar rahim-mashaei , who is also head of the cultural heritage organization . the cultural heritage organization news agency quoted him as saying that even during the eight-year war against iraq -lrb- 1980-88 -rrb- , iran just defended itself against the military invasion by former iraqi dictator saddam hussein . the remarks by the vice-president followed last week 's warnings by some iranian officials that tehran 's long-range missiles could target the jewish state if the us and israel realized their threats to attack iran 's nuclear sites . ahmadinejad himself caused international uproar with his anti- israeli tirades , voicing hope for eradication of israel from the middle east , demanding its relocation to europe or alaska and doubting the historic dimension of the holocaust during world war ii .
after a day of high-level talks in geneva between iran and representatives of the five un veto powers and germany on saturday , july 19 , the european union 's foreign policy chief javier solana said not enough progress had been made to persuade tehran to suspend uranium enrichment .
" there is always progress in these talks , but insufficient , " and the international community was still waiting for iran 's response to a proposed package of incentives for tehran to give up its nuclear programme , solana said .
" it was a constructive meeting , but still we did n't get the answer to our questions , " said solana , who added he hoped for an answer from tehran in two weeks .
a " freeze for freeze " approach western countries have slapped several sets of sanctions on tehran over its refusal to halt enrichment which it believes is meant to develop nuclear weapons .
iran vehemently denies seeking nuclear weapons , insisting that its program is designed to provide energy for its growing population for the time when its reserves of fossil fuels run out .
the meeting on saturday in geneva was supposed to talk about future cooperation in the areas of economy , nuclear energy and politics , once tehran halts its nuclear activities .
it was also meant to pave the way to full negotiations possible by squaring the world powers ' precondition of nuclear suspension with iran 's insistence on its right to civilian nuclear energy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west suspects iran of covertly developing a nuclear program britain , france , germany , the united states , russia and china are offering iran a " freeze for freeze " approach .
in a pre-negotiation phase , tehran would not expand its enrichment facility in natanz , while the six nations would not press for additional security council sanctions .
after confidence between the two sides has been established in this phase , iran would halt its uranium enrichment , and comprehensive talks about the world powers ' offer of cooperation and similar package put forward by iran could start .
iran refuses to play along but iran 's top nuclear negotiator saeed jalili after talks in geneva that in any next round of talks iran was not ready to discuss a freeze in enrichment proposed by the " sextet " in return for the un security council halting further sanctions measures . " we will only discuss common points of the package , " jalili told reuters .
he described the talks as " constructive and progressing " in comments to reporters afterwards .
" there are points in common and points that are not in common , " jalili said .
" we have agreed to discuss this . "
the iranian nuclear negotiator compared the diplomatic process to weaving traditional persian carpets : progress in cases " moves forward in millimetres , " he said .
" it 's a very precise work , in certain cases it 's a very beautiful endeavour and hopefully the end result , the final product would be beautiful to behold , " jalili said .
us warns iran of further isolation the meeting in geneva took on added importance with the us sending a high-ranking representative , undersecretary of state william burns - the first us diplomat in 30 years to participate in negotiations with iran .
burns however did not take an active role in the talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burns ' participation in the talks was seen as a shift in washington 's hard-line stance towards iran in a statement issued after the meeting , us state department spokesman sean mccormack said iran has two weeks to " give a clear answer , " and added : " iran has a choice to make : negotiation or further isolation . "
burns , it said , delivered a " clear simple message " that washington was " serious " in backing proposed international incentives for iran to halt uranium enrichment and that it will only engage in negotiations with iran when it does so .
" we hope the iranian people understand that their leaders need to make a choice between cooperation , which would bring benefits to all , and confrontation , which can only lead to further isolation , " the statement said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" iran wants no war with any country , and today iran is friend of the united states and even israel . ...
our achievements belong to the whole world and should be used for expanding love and peace , " said iranian vice-president esfandiar rahim-mashaei , who is also head of the cultural heritage organization . the cultural heritage organization news agency quoted him as saying that even during the eight-year war against iraq -lrb- 1980-88 -rrb- , iran just defended itself against the military invasion by former iraqi dictator saddam hussein . the remarks by the vice-president followed last week 's warnings by some iranian officials that tehran 's long-range missiles could target the jewish state if the us and israel realized their threats to attack iran 's nuclear sites . ahmadinejad himself caused international uproar with his anti- israeli tirades , voicing hope for eradication of israel from the middle east , demanding its relocation to europe or alaska and doubting the historic dimension of the holocaust during world war ii .
after a day of high-level talks in geneva between iran and representatives of the five un veto powers and germany on saturday , july 19 , the european union 's foreign policy chief javier solana said not enough progress had been made to persuade tehran to suspend uranium enrichment .
" there is always progress in these talks , but insufficient , " and the international community was still waiting for iran 's response to a proposed package of incentives for tehran to give up its nuclear programme , solana said .
" it was a constructive meeting , but still we did n't get the answer to our questions , " said solana , who added he hoped for an answer from tehran in two weeks .
a " freeze for freeze " approach western countries have slapped several sets of sanctions on tehran over its refusal to halt enrichment which it believes is meant to develop nuclear weapons .
iran vehemently denies seeking nuclear weapons , insisting that its program is designed to provide energy for its growing population for the time when its reserves of fossil fuels run out .
the meeting on saturday in geneva was supposed to talk about future cooperation in the areas of economy , nuclear energy and politics , once tehran halts its nuclear activities .
it was also meant to pave the way to full negotiations possible by squaring the world powers ' precondition of nuclear suspension with iran 's insistence on its right to civilian nuclear energy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west suspects iran of covertly developing a nuclear program britain , france , germany , the united states , russia and china are offering iran a " freeze for freeze " approach .
in a pre-negotiation phase , tehran would not expand its enrichment facility in natanz , while the six nations would not press for additional security council sanctions .
after confidence between the two sides has been established in this phase , iran would halt its uranium enrichment , and comprehensive talks about the world powers ' offer of cooperation and similar package put forward by iran could start .
iran refuses to play along but iran 's top nuclear negotiator saeed jalili after talks in geneva that in any next round of talks iran was not ready to discuss a freeze in enrichment proposed by the " sextet " in return for the un security council halting further sanctions measures . " we will only discuss common points of the package , " jalili told reuters .
he described the talks as " constructive and progressing " in comments to reporters afterwards .
" there are points in common and points that are not in common , " jalili said .
" we have agreed to discuss this . "
the iranian nuclear negotiator compared the diplomatic process to weaving traditional persian carpets : progress in cases " moves forward in millimetres , " he said .
" it 's a very precise work , in certain cases it 's a very beautiful endeavour and hopefully the end result , the final product would be beautiful to behold , " jalili said .
us warns iran of further isolation the meeting in geneva took on added importance with the us sending a high-ranking representative , undersecretary of state william burns - the first us diplomat in 30 years to participate in negotiations with iran .
burns however did not take an active role in the talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burns ' participation in the talks was seen as a shift in washington 's hard-line stance towards iran in a statement issued after the meeting , us state department spokesman sean mccormack said iran has two weeks to " give a clear answer , " and added : " iran has a choice to make : negotiation or further isolation . "
burns , it said , delivered a " clear simple message " that washington was " serious " in backing proposed international incentives for iran to halt uranium enrichment and that it will only engage in negotiations with iran when it does so .
" we hope the iranian people understand that their leaders need to make a choice between cooperation , which would bring benefits to all , and confrontation , which can only lead to further isolation , " the statement said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the speech , they say , will focus on the need to strengthen trans-atlantic relations to meet 21st-century challenges . obama is set to meet with german chancellor angela merkel and other top politicians on thursday , july 24 before giving an hour-long public speech at berlin 's gold-topped victory column , about a mile from the historic brandenburg gate . obamamania in germany the us presidential contender , hailed as the new john f kennedy in germany , is hugely popular in germany .
a poll published this month in bild newspaper showed 72 percent of germans would vote for him if they could . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's gold-topped victory column is expected to draw a million people when obama speaks berlin authorities expect up to a million people to show up at the strasse des 17 juni between the brandenburg gate and victory column , or siegesaeule , to hear obama speak .
his speech is scheduled at around 7 p.m. on thursday . german media have reported that authorities plan to set up an obama " fan mile , " similar to arrangements during the european soccer championship and the soccer world cup two years ago to allow thousands to watch the event on big screens . after seven years of george w. bush - a deeply unpopular us president in germany - europeans are lapping up the illinois senator 's message of change . analysts say obama , if elected us president , could inject a new momentum into diplomatic relations with germany which have improved since chancellor merkel took office . " people here see him almost as a political redeemer after seven years of bush , " political analyst jan techau of the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- told news agency dpa this week . visit marred by controversy though berlin is abuzz with excitement about obama 's visit , the venue for his much-anticipated speech follows weeks of speculation and controversy in germany . obama is believed to have originally wanted to hold his speech at the brandenburg gate .
however , german chancellor angela merkel made clear she was against " electioneering " by obama at the historic monument and a symbol of german unity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel was against an obama " electioneering " at the historic brandenburg gate her comments put her at odds with foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier who said he would welcome an appearance by obama at the brandenburg gate . obama 's team decided against tempelhof airport , the site of the berlin airlift , and opted instead for the victory column . still , the compromise site for obama 's speech , a 70-meter high column built to celebrate 19th century prussian military victories over denmark , france and austria , continues to rankle some german politicians . " the siegessaeule in berlin was moved from the reichstag -lrb- german parliament -rrb- to its current position by adolf hitler , " rainer bruederle , deputy chairman of the opposition liberal party , fdp , said in an interview with bild am sonntag .
he said he questioned , " if barack obama has been well advised to use it as the site of a speech outlining his vision of a world of cooperation . " the same paper quoted andreas schockenhoff , deputy chairman of the christian democrats in parliament , criticizing the " unhappy symbolism " of the venue . " the berlin victory colum is dedicated to victory over neighbors who today are our european friends and allies , " he said . obama 's planned speech in berlin has also sparked a row in the us with a foreign policy aide to john mccain , the republican presidential candidate , saying it was an " election show . " referring to the controversy over the venue for obama 's speech , randy scheunemann told german news magazine der spiegel this week that obama had put " a close american ally in an unpleasant position , " with his decision to take his campaign abroad . a sustainable love-affair ? obama is in afghanistan sunday as part of a whirlwind tour abroad that will also take him to iraq and the middle east .
after speaking in berlin on thursday he is to visit france and britain . though obama is expected to stress a more multilateral approach on foreign policy than the current bush administration , experts warn he will still have to tackle difficult issues , for example on world trade and afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's budweiser comments have generated some concern in europe some of obama 's comments about reforming the north american free trade agreement -lrb- nafta -rrb- have caused worry among europeans .
obama recently said that he felt it was " a shame " that belgium-based brewer , inbev nv would take over the iconic budweiser label . this week , europe 's top trade commissioner , peter mandelson , called on obama to stop " crowd-pleasing rhetoric " which could be interpreted as anti-trade . in an interview with bloomberg television , mandelson called on both obama and likely republican candidate john mccain to " acknowledge the huge benefits for the american economy and the american people of continued trade growth . " jan techau told dpa that obama still had n't spelt out his stance on a number of thorny issues . " iraq , afghanistan , iran and missile defense - these are the issues , although he has n't named them , " techau said .
" this will be the most important part of the speech .
europeans are going to find out whether the love affair with obama is going to be sustainable . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

spiegel said that it had located four of the men in germany and interviewed two , who denied committing war crimes .
the unit of the nazi party private army , the ss , was commanded by oskar dirlewanger who formed his violent military unit out of ex-prisoners , spiegel said in a story for publication monday .
it said polish officials had sent the file to the national war-crimes prosecutions office at ludwigsburg , germany .
the german office said it had been asked to trace surviving dirlewanger personnel and study if they could be prosecuted for nazi reprisals after the warsaw uprising of 1944 .
the unit had at first been formed out of poachers , and later included ex-prisoners from armed forces jails and concentration camps .
spiegel said all previous attempts to identify them had failed , but names had now been found in red cross tracing records .
spiegel quoted one former member of the unit saying he did not join the unit until 1945 .
he praised the commander dirlewanger .
" he was a great guy .
always at the forefront , never the rear , " said the man , 83 .
spiegel said the unit conducted mass rapes and its massacres in belarus and poland included putting people in barns and setting them alight , slaughtering doctors and nurses at a hospital and " clearing " mines by making civilians walk on them .
dirlewanger himself was captured after the war and tortured to death by polish jailers , the magazine said . dpa news agency send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the tape , purporting to come from the group holding the men , alleges that a man known as jason died on 25 may 2008 .
british officials say they are not able to corroborate the claim .
armed militants , disguised as police officers , kidnapped the four bodyguards and a computer expert at the finance ministry in baghdad in may 2007 .
' first warning ' the bodyguards worked for security company gardaworld and the fifth man worked for american management consultancy bearingpoint .
in the video , arabic writing is shown as well as images of two other hostages .
the group which is holding them calls itself the islamic shia resistance in iraq . "
i want to see my family again " alan in december , the kidnappers released a videotape of their hostages .
it is understood that the man alleged to have committed suicide is the same jason who appeared in this previous video .
his family are said to have been informed last week .
a statement , claiming to come from the captors , accuses the british government of failing to respond to their messages .
" this procrastination and foot-dragging and lack of seriousness on the part of the british government has prolonged their psychological deterioration , pushing one of them , jason , to commit suicide on 25/5 / 2008 , " the statement ran .
" he surprised our brethren , who were taking care of him , with his suicide . "
the video also shows another british hostage , alan , who comes from dumbarton , appealing to the british government to meet his captors ' demands for the release of prisoners .
" physically , i 'm not doing well , " he says .
" psychologically , i 'm doing a lot worse .
" i want to see my family again . "
however , he makes no reference to jason 's alleged suicide .
according to the sunday times , an intermediary who handed the video to its representative said jason had attempted suicide on two previous occasions .
proof of his death would be handed over if the british government agreed to negotiate with the militants , the intermediary added .
' deep distress ' the men were snatched in broad daylight by around 40 men dressed as iraqi police officers .
in the previous film , dated 18 november , the militants said they would kill one of the men as a " first warning " unless the uk forces left iraq within 10 days .
the tape , filmed in front of an " islamic shia resistance in iraq " flag , shows one man giving his name , saying he has been held for 173 days and adding : " i feel we have been forgotten . " " " i call on those holding the hostages to release them immediately and unconditionally " gordon brown prime minister foreign secretary david miliband responded to the latest tape by condemning kidnapping as " disgusting " .
it " will cause deep distress and concern to the families of the five men " , he added .
however , he said the government remained open to working with anyone who can help free the men .
prime minister gordon brown said he had raised the case of the five men with his iraqi counterpart , nouri maliki , during his visit to baghdad .
he said he had also raised the issue with " americans and others who are active in iraq " .
in a statement , the prime minister said : " this abhorrent film will only add to the anguish of families who have suffered a great deal over a year for their loved ones who have been kept in captivity .
" i call on the hostage takers to release these people who have been held in captivity immediately . "
sensitive negotiations the hostages ' friends and relatives marked the first anniversary of their capture in may by appealing for the hostages to be released .
the foreign and commonwealth office has always maintained that sensitive negotiations for the men 's release are going on behind the scenes .
one of the hostages has been identified as peter moore , originally from lincoln , who was working as a computer consultant .
the identities of the four other men have not been confirmed .
bbc security correspondent frank gardner warned that there were numerous reports that his colleague alan johnston was killed after he was kidnapped in gaza - all of which turned out to be inaccurate .
he added that the iraqi captors appeared to want to do a prisoner exchange deal with the british government , and were not thought to be " bloodthirsty " in the same manner as al-qaeda .

in a statement , the prime minister said : " this abhorrent film will only add to the anguish of families who have suffered a great deal over a year for their loved ones who have been kept in captivity .
" i call on the hostage takers to release these people who have been held in captivity immediately . "
sensitive negotiations the hostages ' friends and relatives marked the first anniversary of their capture in may by appealing for the hostages to be released .
the foreign and commonwealth office has always maintained that sensitive negotiations for the men 's release are going on behind the scenes .
one of the hostages has been identified as peter moore , originally from lincoln , who was working as a computer consultant .
the identities of the four other men have not been confirmed .
bbc security correspondent frank gardner warned that there were numerous reports that his colleague alan johnston was killed after he was kidnapped in gaza - all of which turned out to be inaccurate .
he added that the iraqi captors appeared to want to do a prisoner exchange deal with the british government , and were not thought to be " bloodthirsty " in the same manner as al-qaeda .

advertisement a video passed to the sunday times contained distressing news of the uk hostages in iraq one of the five british hostages held captive by militants in iraq has killed himself , a video obtained by the sunday times has claimed .
the tape , purporting to come from the group holding the men , alleges that a man known as jason died on 25 may 2008 .
british officials say they are not able to corroborate the claim .
armed militants , disguised as police officers , kidnapped the four bodyguards and a computer expert at the finance ministry in baghdad in may 2007 .
' first warning ' the bodyguards worked for security company gardaworld and the fifth man worked for american management consultancy bearingpoint .
in the video , arabic writing is shown as well as images of two other hostages .
the group which is holding them calls itself the islamic shia resistance in iraq .
i want to see my family again alan in december , the kidnappers released a videotape of their hostages .
it is understood that the man alleged to have committed suicide is the same jason who appeared in this previous video .
his family are said to have been informed last week .
a statement , claiming to come from the captors , accuses the british government of failing to respond to their messages .
" this procrastination and foot-dragging and lack of seriousness on the part of the british government has prolonged their psychological deterioration , pushing one of them , jason , to commit suicide on 25/5 / 2008 , " the statement ran .
" he surprised our brethren , who were taking care of him , with his suicide . "
the video also shows another british hostage , alan , who comes from dumbarton , appealing to the british government to meet his captors ' demands for the release of prisoners .

" psychologically , i 'm doing a lot worse .
" i want to see my family again . "
however , he makes no reference to jason 's alleged suicide .
according to the sunday times , an intermediary who handed the video to its representative said jason had attempted suicide on two previous occasions .
proof of his death would be handed over if the british government agreed to negotiate with the militants , the intermediary added .
' deep distress ' the men were snatched in broad daylight by around 40 men dressed as iraqi police officers .
in the previous film , dated 18 november , the militants said they would kill one of the men as a " first warning " unless the uk forces left iraq within 10 days .
the tape , filmed in front of an " islamic shia resistance in iraq " flag , shows one man giving his name , saying he has been held for 173 days and adding : " i feel we have been forgotten . "
" i call on those holding the hostages to release them immediately and unconditionally gordon brown prime minister foreign secretary david miliband responded to the latest tape by condemning kidnapping as " disgusting " .
it " will cause deep distress and concern to the families of the five men " , he added .
however , he said the government remained open to working with anyone who can help free the men .

advertisement a video passed to the sunday times contained distressing news of the uk hostages in iraq one of the five british hostages held captive by militants in iraq has killed himself , a video obtained by the sunday times has claimed .
the tape , purporting to come from the group holding the men , alleges that a man known as jason died on 25 may 2008 .
british officials say they are not able to corroborate the claim .
armed militants , disguised as police officers , kidnapped the four bodyguards and a computer expert at the finance ministry in baghdad in may 2007 .
' first warning ' the bodyguards worked for security company gardaworld and the fifth man worked for american management consultancy bearingpoint .
in the video , arabic writing is shown as well as images of two other hostages .
the group which is holding them calls itself the islamic shia resistance in iraq .
i want to see my family again alan in december , the kidnappers released a videotape of their hostages .
it is understood that the man alleged to have committed suicide is the same jason who appeared in this previous video .
his family are said to have been informed last week .
a statement , claiming to come from the captors , accuses the british government of failing to respond to their messages .
" this procrastination and foot-dragging and lack of seriousness on the part of the british government has prolonged their psychological deterioration , pushing one of them , jason , to commit suicide on 25/5 / 2008 , " the statement ran .
" he surprised our brethren , who were taking care of him , with his suicide . "
the video also shows another british hostage , alan , who comes from dumbarton , appealing to the british government to meet his captors ' demands for the release of prisoners .
" physically , i 'm not doing well , " he says .
" psychologically , i 'm doing a lot worse .
" i want to see my family again . "
however , he makes no reference to jason 's alleged suicide .
according to the sunday times , an intermediary who handed the video to its representative said jason had attempted suicide on two previous occasions .
proof of his death would be handed over if the british government agreed to negotiate with the militants , the intermediary added .
' deep distress ' the men were snatched in broad daylight by around 40 men dressed as iraqi police officers .
in the previous film , dated 18 november , the militants said they would kill one of the men as a " first warning " unless the uk forces left iraq within 10 days .
the tape , filmed in front of an " islamic shia resistance in iraq " flag , shows one man giving his name , saying he has been held for 173 days and adding : " i feel we have been forgotten . "
" i call on those holding the hostages to release them immediately and unconditionally gordon brown prime minister foreign secretary david miliband responded to the latest tape by condemning kidnapping as " disgusting " .
it " will cause deep distress and concern to the families of the five men " , he added .
however , he said the government remained open to working with anyone who can help free the men .
prime minister gordon brown said he had raised the case of the five men with his iraqi counterpart , nouri maliki , during his visit to baghdad .
he said he had also raised the issue with " americans and others who are active in iraq " .
in a statement , the prime minister said : " this abhorrent film will only add to the anguish of families who have suffered a great deal over a year for their loved ones who have been kept in captivity .
" i call on the hostage takers to release these people who have been held in captivity immediately . "
sensitive negotiations the hostages ' friends and relatives marked the first anniversary of their capture in may by appealing for the hostages to be released .
the foreign and commonwealth office has always maintained that sensitive negotiations for the men 's release are going on behind the scenes .
one of the hostages has been identified as peter moore , originally from lincoln , who was working as a computer consultant .
the identities of the four other men have not been confirmed .
bbc security correspondent frank gardner warned that there were numerous reports that his colleague alan johnston was killed after he was kidnapped in gaza - all of which turned out to be inaccurate .
he added that the iraqi captors appeared to want to do a prisoner exchange deal with the british government , and were not thought to be " bloodthirsty " in the same manner as al-qaeda .

an excavator has had to be placed on a barge to get closer to the bedrock silt and clays .
it can only operate at certain times to suit the tides , daylight and other quay usage which means odd noises can be heard at the harbour at unusual times .

rock and roll legend chuck berry , singer kate nash and alternative band the flaming lips are the headline acts at camp bestival at lulworth castle .
the organisers of the annual bestival on the isle of wight are behind the inaugural three-day event .
but the music stopped for one hour on saturday - for a local church service .
the festival is aimed at " yummy mummies " with boutique camping .
organiser and dj , rob da bank , said : " we feel there 's not a show out there with a really great musical line up and where your children can enjoy it too - womad , guilfest and larmer tree do it , but for a different market .
" i 'm sure there 'll be some yummy mummies but also some freaky daddies , grown-up babies and some rave children .
the more mixed up the better for me . "
about 3,500 children were expected at the festival taking part in sports day , story telling , jousting and dressing up .
the event was inspired by the british 1950s holiday camp experience complete with the bestival bluecoats .
saturday 's line-up included billy bragg , up and coming band black kids , dj yoda , dexys midnight runners ' frontman kevin rowland on the decks and headliners the flaming lips .
but as part of the deal to host the event , general manager james weld insisted that the music stop to allow for his local catholic church service .
" it 's great to have an opportunity to run a music festival at lulworth particularly one aimed at families , " he said .
" being a catholic family we were glad we were able to agree with camp bestival that the service could continue in the festival .
" i was very impressed that everything stopped to allow it to happen . "
kate nash was due to take to the stage on sunday along with dj rob da bank .

at least another six remain missing , disaster relief officials said .
the storm lashed central and southern taiwan with high winds and heavy rain on thursday and friday before weakening and moving on to southern china .
the local media have raised questions about an apparent lack of preparedness on the part of taiwan 's authorities .
chinese state media reported that the government had evacuated hundreds of thousands of people from coastal provinces ahead of the storm 's arrival in china .
the first typhoon to hit taiwan this year , kalmaegi initially packed winds of up to 90 km / h -lrb- 56mph -rrb- , but quickly lost power and was downgraded to a tropical storm .
in tainan county , water supplies were cut off because of the heavy rain .
kalmaegi means " seagull " in korean .
