program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 26.11.2008 eu bids to bring africa into immigration pact großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spanish coast guard frequently intercepts illegal immigrants from africa the european union sat down with representatives from 27 african countries this week to enlist their help in a new effort to curb the flood of illegal immigration . the joint eu-africa conference on tuesday , nov .
25 was meant to underscore a partnership between the two continents .
but african governments view the shift in eu policy with trepidation , concerned that a " fortress europe " is toughening its stance on immigration , as african nations struggle with food and environmental crises , as well as the global economic downturn .
the meeting follows an agreement by eu leaders last month to adopt new immigration rules , which seek to tailor policies to meet the bloc 's labor needs , while slapping additional restrictions on illegal residents .
" neither bunker nor sieve " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african immigrants seeking a better life arrive almost daily in europe in an effort to ease those concerns , french immigration minister brice hortefeux reassured his african counterparts at the meeting in paris , saying " a policy on migration can not be defined without or against africa , but rather with africa . "
" the objective of the european pact , " hortefeux said , " is to avoid a europe that is a bunker or a sieve . "
the ministers are expected to adopt a cooperation program for the next three years to step up the fight against illegal immigration and also look at development programs to create work opportunities for africans at home .

more than 250,000 people are estimated to have been displaced in dr congo in the past three months .

loew accepted the apology and retained the chelsea midfielder as his captain .
frings later also had a private meeting with loew to clear the air .

25 was meant to underscore a partnership between the two continents .
but african governments view the shift in eu policy with trepidation , concerned that a " fortress europe " is toughening its stance on immigration , as african nations struggle with food and environmental crises , as well as the global economic downturn .
the meeting follows an agreement by eu leaders last month to adopt new immigration rules , which seek to tailor policies to meet the bloc 's labor needs , while slapping additional restrictions on illegal residents .
" neither bunker nor sieve " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african immigrants seeking a better life arrive almost daily in europe in an effort to ease those concerns , french immigration minister brice hortefeux reassured his african counterparts at the meeting in paris , saying " a policy on migration can not be defined without or against africa , but rather with africa . "
" the objective of the european pact , " hortefeux said , " is to avoid a europe that is a bunker or a sieve . "
the ministers are expected to adopt a cooperation program for the next three years to step up the fight against illegal immigration and also look at development programs to create work opportunities for africans at home .
morocco 's foreign minister taieb fassi fihri called on europeans to be " realistic , " arguing that tough immigration laws would not discourage migrants from trying to reach europe .
alain bedouma yoda , the foreign minister of burkina faso , said more development projects were needed to bolster prospects at home , while easing entry regulations to combat human trafficking .
ngos call eu pact " too repressive " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a growing number of african immigrants now have german citizenship in the run-up to the meeting , a coalition of 300 non-governmental organizations called " bridges , not walls " denounced the eu 's new immigration stance as " essentially security-driven and self-serving . "
rights groups charged that the new pact is repressive and puts too much emphasis on regulating immigration flows to allow more skilled workers and fewer refugees .
echoing those concerns , morocco 's foreign minister fihri was quoted as saying that " europe most certainly should not be a sieve , but it should recognize that in the coming years it is going to need 30 million immigrants from non-eu states - with and without qualifications . "
a recent report by the french office of statistics , insee , said that immigrants make up about ten percent of the labor force in europe .
the report found that immigrants remain vital for europe 's labor market and provide at least part of the solution to the problem of the continent 's aging workforce . dw staff -lrb- gb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

kosovo is worried it would end up dividing the country along ethnic lines . shortly after kosovo declared independence from serbia in february , the european union agreed to send police , customs and judicial experts to kosovo in an attempt to bring stability to the region .
but with kosovo 's independence still being challenged by serbia , the eu 's so-called eulex mission remains on hold .

more than 250,000 people are estimated to have been displaced in dr congo in the past three months .

" by early november , the humanitarian community estimated that nearly 70 percent of the population in north kivu was either displaced or hosting internally displaced persons , " he added .

aubry vows to take the socialists further to the left than the more centrist royal . the current mayor of the northern city lille has been chosen as the new leader of the french socialists , ending the infighting that left the party unable to provide effective opposition to president nicolas sarkozy 's right of center ump party .
martine aubry , 58 , won by a razor thin margin of only 102 votes out of 134,800 cast , the former socialist presidential candidate segolene royal according to official ballot results made public on wednesday , nov .
26 .
aubry , a former labor minister best known for introducing the controversial 35 hour work week in france , is also the daughter of jacques delors , the former president of the european commission .
over the weekend , aubry had claimed victory with an initial lead of only 42 votes out of nearly 137,000 cast , prompting royal to cry foul and demand verification of the vote count .
then on monday , a party commission convened to look at claims by both camps and by tuesday , decided which candidate was the winner .
rivalry between candidates splits party further bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal was the socialist candidate against sarkozy in last year 's presidential elections the vote count clash splits the deeply divided party even further between a more traditional leftist faction backing aubry and the more centrist members supporting royal .
many party leaders voted for aubry not based on her politics , but because of their intense dislike of her glamorous rival .
royal has been accused of lacking depth and the consistency of her convictions .
this became apparent during the presidential campaign last year when she switched her position on issues several times .
the bitterly contested leadership battle has also left the socialists in even more disarray and weaker in opposing sarkozy , who has undermined the party by poaching some its most prominent leaders , such as foreign minister bernard kouchner , into his conservative government .
infighting must stop aubry , who succeeds francois hollande , royal 's former partner and father of their four children , will first need to restore the socialist party 's credibility and unite the warring factions .
jean-marc ayrault , who is the party 's parliamentary leader , had urged the two women to call a truce .
" we must stop this totally ridiculous soap opera , " ayrault said on french television .
" whoever leads the socialist party tomorrow will not be able to do so without the others . "
aubry , for her part , even gave her rival a peck on the cheek .
" i want to tell segolene that together we will win for the french people , " she said .
aubry vows to steer socialists further left at the same time , aubry has also vowed to steer the party further to the left , warning that royal 's shift towards the middle would alienate the party 's traditional working class voter base .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last french socialist to serve as president was francois mitterrand , right a bva opinion poll published on tuesday found that most leftist voters viewed aubry 's victory as party leader in a positive light . but 30 percent had said they still preferred royal as the party 's the candidate in the 2012 presidential elections compared to only 20 percent for aubry , suggesting that a more centrist candidate had a better chance of winning .
the last time france had a president from the socialist party , was when francois mitterrand served from 1981 to 1995 .
still , the party controls nearly all of frances 22 regional councils as well as key cities such as paris , lyon and toulouse , even though it has minority representation in the national parliament .
royal wo n't fade away some socialists had even warned of that the party would be unable to overcome the personal loathing between aubry and royal , who has no intention of fading away . " we managed the exploit of convincing half , and maybe a little over half , of the socialist party even though we had the entire party establishment against us , " royal told reporters .

aubry vows to take the socialists further to the left than the more centrist royal . the current mayor of the northern city lille has been chosen as the new leader of the french socialists , ending the infighting that left the party unable to provide effective opposition to president nicolas sarkozy 's right of center ump party .
martine aubry , 58 , won by a razor thin margin of only 102 votes out of 134,800 cast , the former socialist presidential candidate segolene royal according to official ballot results made public on wednesday , nov .
26 .
aubry , a former labor minister best known for introducing the controversial 35 hour work week in france , is also the daughter of jacques delors , the former president of the european commission .
over the weekend , aubry had claimed victory with an initial lead of only 42 votes out of nearly 137,000 cast , prompting royal to cry foul and demand verification of the vote count .
then on monday , a party commission convened to look at claims by both camps and by tuesday , decided which candidate was the winner .
rivalry between candidates splits party further bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal was the socialist candidate against sarkozy in last year 's presidential elections the vote count clash splits the deeply divided party even further between a more traditional leftist faction backing aubry and the more centrist members supporting royal .
many party leaders voted for aubry not based on her politics , but because of their intense dislike of her glamorous rival .
royal has been accused of lacking depth and the consistency of her convictions .
this became apparent during the presidential campaign last year when she switched her position on issues several times .
the bitterly contested leadership battle has also left the socialists in even more disarray and weaker in opposing sarkozy , who has undermined the party by poaching some its most prominent leaders , such as foreign minister bernard kouchner , into his conservative government .
infighting must stop aubry , who succeeds francois hollande , royal 's former partner and father of their four children , will first need to restore the socialist party 's credibility and unite the warring factions .
jean-marc ayrault , who is the party 's parliamentary leader , had urged the two women to call a truce .
" we must stop this totally ridiculous soap opera , " ayrault said on french television .
" whoever leads the socialist party tomorrow will not be able to do so without the others . "
aubry , for her part , even gave her rival a peck on the cheek .
" i want to tell segolene that together we will win for the french people , " she said .
aubry vows to steer socialists further left at the same time , aubry has also vowed to steer the party further to the left , warning that royal 's shift towards the middle would alienate the party 's traditional working class voter base .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last french socialist to serve as president was francois mitterrand , right a bva opinion poll published on tuesday found that most leftist voters viewed aubry 's victory as party leader in a positive light . but 30 percent had said they still preferred royal as the party 's the candidate in the 2012 presidential elections compared to only 20 percent for aubry , suggesting that a more centrist candidate had a better chance of winning .
the last time france had a president from the socialist party , was when francois mitterrand served from 1981 to 1995 .
still , the party controls nearly all of frances 22 regional councils as well as key cities such as paris , lyon and toulouse , even though it has minority representation in the national parliament .
royal wo n't fade away some socialists had even warned of that the party would be unable to overcome the personal loathing between aubry and royal , who has no intention of fading away . " we managed the exploit of convincing half , and maybe a little over half , of the socialist party even though we had the entire party establishment against us , " royal told reporters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 26.11.2008 after 80 years of marriage , gm and opel face possible divorce großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the clock keep ticking for germany 's opel , one of general motor 's most prized assets ?
auto analysts say that it 's high time for the currently solvent opel car manufacturer to separate from its nearly bankrupt us parent general motors .
scenarios for the german firm 's future are the subject of speculation . general motors is burning cash so fast that it is likely to go bankrupt before the inauguration of barack obama as us president in january , but its opel division in germany , known as vauxhall in the uk , is still liquid .
opel 's mid-size insignia was even voted as 2009 european car of the year by the trade press . gm and opel have been bound together ever since adam opel ’ s heirs sold what was then germany ’ s biggest carmaker for the princely sum of $ 33 million -lrb- 26 million euros -rrb- during the great depression of the 1930s . however , the german press is now talking about divorce before detroit brings them both down . " opel is not for sale " last week , a gm spokesman in the us told afp news agency told that “ opel is not for sale . ” but , gm 's zurich-based european works council head klaus franz told reporters “ gm won ’ t let us go , ” explaining that opel ’ s r & d center in ruesselsheim , which develops an entire range of gm models , is too valuable for the parent company . bildunterschrift : in mid-november opel became the europe 's first carmaker to seek loan guarantees franz had even gone on to say that gm owed opel over one billion euros in cash , the same amount opel seeks from a german government bailout .
should gm fail , berlin has been asked to guarantee loans of up to one billion euros for 2009 . back in ruesselsheim , opel head hans demant denied franz ’ s statement to the frankfurter rundschau newspaper . divorce recommended the flip-flop is only one sign of contradictions and turmoil at gm ’ s european operations , according to christoph stuermer , an auto analyst at global insight gmbh in frankfurt , adding that he would recommend a divorce from gm for opel ’ s sake . “ the problem is that opel still makes money for gm , ” said stuermer , who believes that gm could be prepared to let go of one of its more prized assets if the price was right . last week , germany ’ s flamboyant sun king frank asbeck of the green energy firm solarworld had offered gm one billion euros in cash and guaranteed credit lines to take over opel 's four production plants in germany that was promptly turned down by gm . solar king 's offer for opel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asbeck 's offer to buy opel was turned down although stuermer characterized asbeck ’ s extremely low sum as “ a slap in the face ” and other auto experts dismiss the offer as a “ publicity stunt , ” the move triggered speculation about opel ’ s future and how inextricably the 100 percent owned subsidiary is bound to its parent company . “ gm and opel have been together for nearly 80 years .
they are woven so tightly together that it would be extremely difficult to separate them , ” said juergen pieper , a transport analyst at the private banking firm bankhaus metzler in frankfurt . ferdinand dudenhoeffer , director of the center for automotive research -lrb- car -rrb- in gelsenkirchen dismissed the longstanding relationship between gm and opel . " what man has put together can always be torn asunder , ” he said , pointing out that ford had recently divested itself of the long-held , but financially troubled , luxury brand aston martin bought by a consortium of kuwaiti investors , a texas banker and british rally driver . rocky marriage between gm and opel besides the marriage between gm and opel has been a rocky one to say the least in the last decades , according to wolfgang meinig of the center for automotive research -lrb- faw -rrb- in bamberg . “ it would be sensible for gm to let opel go before it might be forced to file for chapter 11 bankruptcy , ” said meinig , who added he could also see opel being bought out by equity investors . shortly after asbeck publicised his offer last wednesday , 1,000 opel dealers banded together to propose a buyout .
the problem is that those franchises are struggling financially themselves , according to stuermer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel 's mid-size insignia was voted european car of the year “ but it is a good sign that dealers out there are willing to stand up for opel , that there is still life left in the brand , ” said stuermer , who had also slammed opel ’ s downscale image .
“ in an image-driven market , many germany don ’ t want to be associated with some of opel ’ s uninspired brands - astra , omega , corsa , ” he said . gm blamed for opel 's problems “ image problems don ’ t fall from the sky , ” said pieper , who explained that other german manufacturers simply produced better quality cars in the last decade or so .
opel ’ s market share in western europe has tumbled in the last 15 years from 13.2 percent in 1993 to an estimated 8.6 percent for 2008 .
during the same period , opel ’ s chief rival in the mass market , volkswagen , climbed from 16.3 percent to what is expected to be above 20 percent for this year , said pieper . the analysts all pin at least part of opel ’ s problems on general motors .
“ in the last decades , gm has been so grossly mismanaged , ” said pieper , who believes it serves gm right if the us congress allows america ’ s biggest automaker to file for chapter 11 bankruptcy , which might not be the end of the world .
“ who knows ?
gm could emerge healthier from it , ” he said . but even if gm was to fail and took opel down with it , pieper thinks that the demise would not be tragic for the saturated european car industry .
“ opel is just another brand .
it ’ s up to the market to regulate which brands survive , ” he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is what 's good for gm good for america ?
opel is " worth saving " but stuermer says that opel is worth saving .
“ they ’ re making money , so they don ’ t deserve to go under .
they ought to have a chance at survival -lrb- without gm -rrb- , ” he said . dudenhoeffer believes that potential buyers could even be waiting for opel to come on the auction block if gm enters chapter 11 , which even could be one of the conditions of a federal bailout . " then opel could be a real bargain for , say , the chinese , who would n't mind the technology that comes with it and a foothold in the european car market , " he said , adding that us congressional approval to bail out gm is not guaranteed . " the us did n't save chrysler in the end either .
why should gm be a sacred cow ?
what 's more important : detroit or america ?
they are not necessarily the same , " asked dudenhoeffer , disputing the gm motto " what 's good for gm is good for america . " diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

auto analysts say that it 's high time for the currently solvent opel car manufacturer to separate from its nearly bankrupt us parent general motors .
scenarios for the german firm 's future are the subject of speculation . general motors is burning cash so fast that it is likely to go bankrupt before the inauguration of barack obama as us president in january , but its opel division in germany , known as vauxhall in the uk , is still liquid .
opel 's mid-size insignia was even voted as 2009 european car of the year by the trade press . gm and opel have been bound together ever since adam opel ’ s heirs sold what was then germany ’ s biggest carmaker for the princely sum of $ 33 million -lrb- 26 million euros -rrb- during the great depression of the 1930s . however , the german press is now talking about divorce before detroit brings them both down . " opel is not for sale " last week , a gm spokesman in the us told afp news agency told that “ opel is not for sale . ” but , gm 's zurich-based european works council head klaus franz told reporters “ gm won ’ t let us go , ” explaining that opel ’ s r & d center in ruesselsheim , which develops an entire range of gm models , is too valuable for the parent company . bildunterschrift : in mid-november opel became the europe 's first carmaker to seek loan guarantees franz had even gone on to say that gm owed opel over one billion euros in cash , the same amount opel seeks from a german government bailout .
should gm fail , berlin has been asked to guarantee loans of up to one billion euros for 2009 . back in ruesselsheim , opel head hans demant denied franz ’ s statement to the frankfurter rundschau newspaper . divorce recommended the flip-flop is only one sign of contradictions and turmoil at gm ’ s european operations , according to christoph stuermer , an auto analyst at global insight gmbh in frankfurt , adding that he would recommend a divorce from gm for opel ’ s sake . “ the problem is that opel still makes money for gm , ” said stuermer , who believes that gm could be prepared to let go of one of its more prized assets if the price was right . last week , germany ’ s flamboyant sun king frank asbeck of the green energy firm solarworld had offered gm one billion euros in cash and guaranteed credit lines to take over opel 's four production plants in germany that was promptly turned down by gm . solar king 's offer for opel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asbeck 's offer to buy opel was turned down although stuermer characterized asbeck ’ s extremely low sum as “ a slap in the face ” and other auto experts dismiss the offer as a “ publicity stunt , ” the move triggered speculation about opel ’ s future and how inextricably the 100 percent owned subsidiary is bound to its parent company . “ gm and opel have been together for nearly 80 years .
they are woven so tightly together that it would be extremely difficult to separate them , ” said juergen pieper , a transport analyst at the private banking firm bankhaus metzler in frankfurt . ferdinand dudenhoeffer , director of the center for automotive research -lrb- car -rrb- in gelsenkirchen dismissed the longstanding relationship between gm and opel . " what man has put together can always be torn asunder , ” he said , pointing out that ford had recently divested itself of the long-held , but financially troubled , luxury brand aston martin bought by a consortium of kuwaiti investors , a texas banker and british rally driver . rocky marriage between gm and opel besides the marriage between gm and opel has been a rocky one to say the least in the last decades , according to wolfgang meinig of the center for automotive research -lrb- faw -rrb- in bamberg . “ it would be sensible for gm to let opel go before it might be forced to file for chapter 11 bankruptcy , ” said meinig , who added he could also see opel being bought out by equity investors . shortly after asbeck publicised his offer last wednesday , 1,000 opel dealers banded together to propose a buyout .
the problem is that those franchises are struggling financially themselves , according to stuermer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel 's mid-size insignia was voted european car of the year “ but it is a good sign that dealers out there are willing to stand up for opel , that there is still life left in the brand , ” said stuermer , who had also slammed opel ’ s downscale image .
“ in an image-driven market , many germany don ’ t want to be associated with some of opel ’ s uninspired brands - astra , omega , corsa , ” he said . gm blamed for opel 's problems “ image problems don ’ t fall from the sky , ” said pieper , who explained that other german manufacturers simply produced better quality cars in the last decade or so .
opel ’ s market share in western europe has tumbled in the last 15 years from 13.2 percent in 1993 to an estimated 8.6 percent for 2008 .
during the same period , opel ’ s chief rival in the mass market , volkswagen , climbed from 16.3 percent to what is expected to be above 20 percent for this year , said pieper . the analysts all pin at least part of opel ’ s problems on general motors .

26 aimed at jolting european union economies out of a recession .
the european commission said it wanted 200 billion euros of extra spending and tax cuts over the next two years .
" exceptional times call for exceptional measures , " european commission president jose manuel barroso said as the details of the plan were announced .
the plan would represent 1.5 percent of the eu 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
around 170 billion euros needed to finance the plan would come from national governments and the rest from eu funds and the european investment bank .
the european plan follows a us federal reserve announcement on tuesday that it would spend up to $ 600 billion to purchase mortgage securities and $ 200 billion for asset-backed securities to help get credit to consumers .
that money is in addition to the $ 700 billion rescue package already approved by congress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would a tax cut get europeans spending again ?
in an attempt to bridge the differences of opinion , eu leaders put forward a proposal that gives member countries a set of options for dealing with the crisis , but steers clear of a one-size-fits-all solution .
the commission said that the stimulus measures will need to be quick , targeted and temporary .
they will be a mix of revenue and spending instruments and will be accompanied by structural reforms .
eu leaders will formally vote on the proposal at a summit in december .
" i expect this package to receive strong support from european governments , " barroso said .
eu wants to coordinate actions the commission suggested that member countries consider temporary vat rate cuts , temporary increases in benefits to low-income households and the unemployed as well as temporary extensions of benefit pay-out periods .
it also suggested that governments could offer guarantees and loan subsidies to companies to help them attain credit .
the proposal also looks at increasing investments in infrastructure and in key sectors such as the automobile sector - where an additional five billion euros in extra funding is planned .
while the commission stopped short of mandating solutions , it wants all fiscal measures to be coordinated at the european level so as to " exploit synergies and avoid negative spillovers , " economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia tuesday in a speech in brussels .
spending up , deficits up one of the biggest points of disagreement is whether european countries should temporarily cut vat rates .
current vat rates on goods and services vary from 25 percent in sweden and denmark to 15 percent in cyprus and luxembourg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france and germany have come out against a vat cut on monday , britain became the first european country to announce a vat cut , with leaders saying it would reduce the vat by 2.5 percentage points to 15 percent through the end of 2009 .
the move is aimed at boosting consumer spending .
germany and france ruled out similar vat rate cuts .
president nicolas sarkozy said tuesday he would unveil an economic stimulus package within the next 10 days to help france 's key sectors resist the global slowdown .
germany announced earlier this month various stimulus measures including tax breaks and infrastructure spending that it says is worth 32 billion euros over two years . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that money is in addition to the $ 700 billion rescue package already approved by congress .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 26.11.2008 after 80 years of marriage , gm and opel face possible divorce großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the clock keep ticking for germany 's opel , one of general motor 's most prized assets ?
auto analysts say that it 's high time for the currently solvent opel car manufacturer to separate from its nearly bankrupt us parent general motors .
scenarios for the german firm 's future are the subject of speculation . general motors is burning cash so fast that it is likely to go bankrupt before the inauguration of barack obama as us president in january , but its opel division in germany , known as vauxhall in the uk , is still liquid .
opel 's mid-size insignia was even voted as 2009 european car of the year by the trade press . gm and opel have been bound together ever since adam opel ’ s heirs sold what was then germany ’ s biggest carmaker for the princely sum of $ 33 million -lrb- 26 million euros -rrb- during the great depression of the 1930s . however , the german press is now talking about divorce before detroit brings them both down . " opel is not for sale " last week , a gm spokesman in the us told afp news agency told that “ opel is not for sale . ” but , gm 's zurich-based european works council head klaus franz told reporters “ gm won ’ t let us go , ” explaining that opel ’ s r & d center in ruesselsheim , which develops an entire range of gm models , is too valuable for the parent company . bildunterschrift : in mid-november opel became the europe 's first carmaker to seek loan guarantees franz had even gone on to say that gm owed opel over one billion euros in cash , the same amount opel seeks from a german government bailout .
should gm fail , berlin has been asked to guarantee loans of up to one billion euros for 2009 . back in ruesselsheim , opel head hans demant denied franz ’ s statement to the frankfurter rundschau newspaper . divorce recommended the flip-flop is only one sign of contradictions and turmoil at gm ’ s european operations , according to christoph stuermer , an auto analyst at global insight gmbh in frankfurt , adding that he would recommend a divorce from gm for opel ’ s sake . “ the problem is that opel still makes money for gm , ” said stuermer , who believes that gm could be prepared to let go of one of its more prized assets if the price was right . last week , germany ’ s flamboyant sun king frank asbeck of the green energy firm solarworld had offered gm one billion euros in cash and guaranteed credit lines to take over opel 's four production plants in germany that was promptly turned down by gm . solar king 's offer for opel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asbeck 's offer to buy opel was turned down although stuermer characterized asbeck ’ s extremely low sum as “ a slap in the face ” and other auto experts dismiss the offer as a “ publicity stunt , ” the move triggered speculation about opel ’ s future and how inextricably the 100 percent owned subsidiary is bound to its parent company . “ gm and opel have been together for nearly 80 years .
they are woven so tightly together that it would be extremely difficult to separate them , ” said juergen pieper , a transport analyst at the private banking firm bankhaus metzler in frankfurt . ferdinand dudenhoeffer , director of the center for automotive research -lrb- car -rrb- in gelsenkirchen dismissed the longstanding relationship between gm and opel . " what man has put together can always be torn asunder , ” he said , pointing out that ford had recently divested itself of the long-held , but financially troubled , luxury brand aston martin bought by a consortium of kuwaiti investors , a texas banker and british rally driver . rocky marriage between gm and opel besides the marriage between gm and opel has been a rocky one to say the least in the last decades , according to wolfgang meinig of the center for automotive research -lrb- faw -rrb- in bamberg . “ it would be sensible for gm to let opel go before it might be forced to file for chapter 11 bankruptcy , ” said meinig , who added he could also see opel being bought out by equity investors . shortly after asbeck publicised his offer last wednesday , 1,000 opel dealers banded together to propose a buyout .
the problem is that those franchises are struggling financially themselves , according to stuermer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel 's mid-size insignia was voted european car of the year “ but it is a good sign that dealers out there are willing to stand up for opel , that there is still life left in the brand , ” said stuermer , who had also slammed opel ’ s downscale image .
“ in an image-driven market , many germany don ’ t want to be associated with some of opel ’ s uninspired brands - astra , omega , corsa , ” he said . gm blamed for opel 's problems “ image problems don ’ t fall from the sky , ” said pieper , who explained that other german manufacturers simply produced better quality cars in the last decade or so .
opel ’ s market share in western europe has tumbled in the last 15 years from 13.2 percent in 1993 to an estimated 8.6 percent for 2008 .
during the same period , opel ’ s chief rival in the mass market , volkswagen , climbed from 16.3 percent to what is expected to be above 20 percent for this year , said pieper . the analysts all pin at least part of opel ’ s problems on general motors .
“ in the last decades , gm has been so grossly mismanaged , ” said pieper , who believes it serves gm right if the us congress allows america ’ s biggest automaker to file for chapter 11 bankruptcy , which might not be the end of the world .
“ who knows ?
gm could emerge healthier from it , ” he said . but even if gm was to fail and took opel down with it , pieper thinks that the demise would not be tragic for the saturated european car industry .
“ opel is just another brand .
it ’ s up to the market to regulate which brands survive , ” he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is what 's good for gm good for america ?
opel is " worth saving " but stuermer says that opel is worth saving .
“ they ’ re making money , so they don ’ t deserve to go under .
they ought to have a chance at survival -lrb- without gm -rrb- , ” he said . dudenhoeffer believes that potential buyers could even be waiting for opel to come on the auction block if gm enters chapter 11 , which even could be one of the conditions of a federal bailout . " then opel could be a real bargain for , say , the chinese , who would n't mind the technology that comes with it and a foothold in the european car market , " he said , adding that us congressional approval to bail out gm is not guaranteed . " the us did n't save chrysler in the end either .
why should gm be a sacred cow ?
what 's more important : detroit or america ?
they are not necessarily the same , " asked dudenhoeffer , disputing the gm motto " what 's good for gm is good for america . " diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" tomorrow we propose a coordinated eu fiscal stimulus , we will offer guidance to member states on the kind of measures to adopt , " said economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia tuesday in a speech in brussels .
officials told the dpa news agency this means giving governments a free hand in reducing their vat rates - but only as long as these cuts are temporary and that the standard rate is kept above the bloc 's minimum level of 15 percent .
current vat rates on goods and services vary from 25 percent in sweden and denmark to 15 percent in cyprus and luxembourg .
member states can also apply reduced rates on certain products .
british vat cut leads the way bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's chancellor alistair darling takes the credit the decision follows a move by the british government , which on monday announced that it would next month cut the country 's vat on consumer goods from 17.5 percent to 15 percent until the end of 2009 .
the vat measure , which is estimated to put 12.5 billion pounds -lrb- $ 18.75 billion -rrb- in consumers ' pockets , is part of a massive fiscal and financial package of 20 billion pounds to stimulate the economy in the face of a looming recession .
the european commission wants any fiscal measures to be coordinated at european level so as to " exploit synergies and avoid negative spillovers , " almunia said .
the commission also wants to mobilize resources in favour of troubled sectors such as the car industry , which has asked for 40 billion euros -lrb- $ 51 billion -rrb- in cheap loans to help it meet the eu 's latest environmental standards .
however , with no new eu money being promised , the amount of funds available from brussels is likely to be limited .
eu : funds must be efficiently used bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : existing eu funds must be better managed instead , officials are expected to call for a more efficient use of resources , such as the existing 500-million-euro globalization fund , which is aimed at retraining workers who have lost their jobs to non-eu countries , and the 11-billion-euro european social fund , which is aimed at boosting employment more generally .
they are also expected to call for a more rapid and effective use of the eu 's massive " cohesion " budget , which is designed to bring the standard of living in its poorest areas up to western levels , and which is set to cost 347 billion euros between 2007 and 2013 .
the eu executive will also urge eu member states to push for more economic reform and modernization in areas from energy efficiency to research and development and waste management - sectors long highlighted as the key to making europe 's economy more competitive .
at the same time , almunia has cautioned governments against seeking to spend their way out of the economic slowdown , saying " we need to reduce public debt over the medium term . "
dark times ahead for recession-hit bloc commission figures out earlier this month showed that the 15- member eurozone has officially slumped into recession .

" tomorrow we propose a coordinated eu fiscal stimulus , we will offer guidance to member states on the kind of measures to adopt , " said economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia tuesday in a speech in brussels .
officials told the dpa news agency this means giving governments a free hand in reducing their vat rates - but only as long as these cuts are temporary and that the standard rate is kept above the bloc 's minimum level of 15 percent .
current vat rates on goods and services vary from 25 percent in sweden and denmark to 15 percent in cyprus and luxembourg .
member states can also apply reduced rates on certain products .
british vat cut leads the way bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's chancellor alistair darling takes the credit the decision follows a move by the british government , which on monday announced that it would next month cut the country 's vat on consumer goods from 17.5 percent to 15 percent until the end of 2009 .
the vat measure , which is estimated to put 12.5 billion pounds -lrb- $ 18.75 billion -rrb- in consumers ' pockets , is part of a massive fiscal and financial package of 20 billion pounds to stimulate the economy in the face of a looming recession .
the european commission wants any fiscal measures to be coordinated at european level so as to " exploit synergies and avoid negative spillovers , " almunia said .
the commission also wants to mobilize resources in favour of troubled sectors such as the car industry , which has asked for 40 billion euros -lrb- $ 51 billion -rrb- in cheap loans to help it meet the eu 's latest environmental standards .
however , with no new eu money being promised , the amount of funds available from brussels is likely to be limited .
eu : funds must be efficiently used bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : existing eu funds must be better managed instead , officials are expected to call for a more efficient use of resources , such as the existing 500-million-euro globalization fund , which is aimed at retraining workers who have lost their jobs to non-eu countries , and the 11-billion-euro european social fund , which is aimed at boosting employment more generally .
they are also expected to call for a more rapid and effective use of the eu 's massive " cohesion " budget , which is designed to bring the standard of living in its poorest areas up to western levels , and which is set to cost 347 billion euros between 2007 and 2013 .
the eu executive will also urge eu member states to push for more economic reform and modernization in areas from energy efficiency to research and development and waste management - sectors long highlighted as the key to making europe 's economy more competitive .
at the same time , almunia has cautioned governments against seeking to spend their way out of the economic slowdown , saying " we need to reduce public debt over the medium term . "

25 was meant to underscore a partnership between the two continents .
but african governments view the shift in eu policy with trepidation , concerned that a " fortress europe " is toughening its stance on immigration , as african nations struggle with food and environmental crises , as well as the global economic downturn .
the meeting follows an agreement by eu leaders last month to adopt new immigration rules , which seek to tailor policies to meet the bloc 's labor needs , while slapping additional restrictions on illegal residents .
" neither bunker nor sieve " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african immigrants seeking a better life arrive almost daily in europe in an effort to ease those concerns , french immigration minister brice hortefeux reassured his african counterparts at the meeting in paris , saying " a policy on migration can not be defined without or against africa , but rather with africa . "
" the objective of the european pact , " hortefeux said , " is to avoid a europe that is a bunker or a sieve . "
the ministers are expected to adopt a cooperation program for the next three years to step up the fight against illegal immigration and also look at development programs to create work opportunities for africans at home .
morocco 's foreign minister taieb fassi fihri called on europeans to be " realistic , " arguing that tough immigration laws would not discourage migrants from trying to reach europe .
alain bedouma yoda , the foreign minister of burkina faso , said more development projects were needed to bolster prospects at home , while easing entry regulations to combat human trafficking .
ngos call eu pact " too repressive " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a growing number of african immigrants now have german citizenship in the run-up to the meeting , a coalition of 300 non-governmental organizations called " bridges , not walls " denounced the eu 's new immigration stance as " essentially security-driven and self-serving . "
rights groups charged that the new pact is repressive and puts too much emphasis on regulating immigration flows to allow more skilled workers and fewer refugees .
echoing those concerns , morocco 's foreign minister fihri was quoted as saying that " europe most certainly should not be a sieve , but it should recognize that in the coming years it is going to need 30 million immigrants from non-eu states - with and without qualifications . "
a recent report by the french office of statistics , insee , said that immigrants make up about ten percent of the labor force in europe .
the report found that immigrants remain vital for europe 's labor market and provide at least part of the solution to the problem of the continent 's aging workforce . dw staff -lrb- gb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but pakistan 's north west was part of the historical gandhara region , where buddhist culture and traditions flourished - especially between the 1st and 4th century ad .
ruled at different times by the persians , the greeks , the indian mauryas and the kushans , gandhara was also open to various cultural influences .
ancient relics and artefacts from this period have been put on display at the art and exhibition hall in bonn , germany . a haunting buddhist chant greets your ears as you step inside the hall .
a massive picture hanging high on the ceiling shows the snow-capped peaks of the hindu kush mountain range .
the art and exhibition hall in bonn has been made to resemble a buddhist monastery court .
among the visitors to the exhibition is abdul samad from pakistan .
samad is doing his ph.d thesis on the gandhara culture at the freie universität in berlin , germany .
his area of interest is the influence of indian mythology in the gandhara art , and the coexistence of the buddhist and hindu religions .
indian mythology in gandhara one of the stone sculptures in the display particularly fascinates him .
it is an image of of skanda kartikeya , a hindu god . ‘ ’ he is shown riding on his ‘ vahana ’ or vehicle , which is the peacock .
he is just sitting here , and you can see his armour dress .
in gandhara , skanda was always shown as a warrior god with his spear in his right hand , and with his bird , ’ ’ says samad .
it is not just hindu mythology that influenced gandhara art .
just a few paces away is a statue of the greek goddess athena , made during the 4th century bc during the rule of the greek conqueror alexander the great .
as we walk along , samad points out to grey stone palettes displayed on the wall .
the palettes are carved with images of men and women wearing dresses that resemble the greek toga . ‘ ’ these are what we call toilet trays ; these are decoration pieces , which you can see are most influenced by greek art .
one can see this couple in the drinking scene .
the drinking and dancing scenes are typically greek images , ’ ’ explains samad .
other elements borrowed from greek art are the corinthian pillars depicted in the carvings .
buddhist art flourished in kushan rule beyond the indo-greek display are the artefacts found during the period of the kushan rulers from central asia .
the kushans patronised buddhism in gandhara , and during their rule buddhist art flourished .
one such buddhist artefact is the standing stone statue of bodhisattva or the buddha as he is known before attaining enlightenment .
the hair is intricately carved to depict curls that resemble snail-shells .
there are other typical features , says samad . ‘ ’ in gandhara most of the famous style of bodhisattvas is heavy jewellery , he is wearing heavy jewellery , and the kafur style , his hair knot .
from his water flask and his heavy jewellery , we can identify this bodhisattva , ’ ’ says samad .
the gandhara region once also extended up to bamiyan in afghanistan , known for the monumental twin stone statues of buddha carved into the valley .
the valley made headlines in march 2001 when the taliban destroyed the two statues .
at the exhibition , the up to 53 meter high statues have been recreated in a unique 3-dimensional virtual display .

she said enough aid is there , but it 's not being used . the second day of the bundestag 's budget debates centered on a speech by angela merkel , who laid out the principles behind the budget and admitted that the immediate economic and financial outlook was gloomy .
" 2009 will be year of bad news , " merkel said .
" that 's why we 're building a bridge so that things will get better by 2010 at the latest . "
she also responded to criticism that the budget proposed by the governing conservative-social democratic grand coalition does little to stimulate the economy , compared with plans envisioned by other nations such as the us and britain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said banks need to shake off their paralysis and get the money flowing merkel said the 480 billion euros -lrb- $ 625 billion -rrb- in financial injections and guarantees for banks was a sufficient stimulus , but that banks had yet to avail themselves of the money .
" confidence between banks is still not at the level that it should be , " merkel said .
" it is the responsibility of financial institutions to give loans to companies that need them . "
the german government made the funds available this fall in response to the global financial crisis that virtual froze lending between financial institutions .
but germany 's opposition parties say the government 's response to the crisis , which has led to economic recession in germany , was woefully inadequate .
weird outsiders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and westerwelle are still cordial despite the free democrats ' criticism the business-friendly free democrats took merkel 's government to task for ruling out the sort of tax breaks britain , for instance , hopes will encourage consumer spending .
" in europe , people are doing what the liberal opposition is demanding , " free democrat leader guido westerwelle said .
" the truth is that , with your policy of not lowering taxes , you 're the weird outsider in europe . "
the greens , too , said merkel 's approach was too negative .
" you nickname in brussels is ' madame non , " ' quipped green parliamentary leader renate kuenast .
meanwhile , the left party blamed privatization for germany 's current economic woes and said social programs should be prioritized .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs to invest in education but money is tight " mrs. chancellor , as long as you 're of the opinion that small government is a worthwhile goal , you might as well not hold your education summit , " said left party parliamentary leader oskar lafontaine .
acting on recommendations from economic experts , the governing grand coalition has abandoned its policy of state financial consolidation and included 18.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 24 billion -rrb- in deficit spending in its proposed 2009 budget .
but merkel and her social democratic finance minister peer steinbrueck have said they 're unwilling to take on more debt to allow for tax cuts or increased investments to stimulate the german economy . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she said enough aid is there , but it 's not being used . the second day of the bundestag 's budget debates centered on a speech by angela merkel , who laid out the principles behind the budget and admitted that the immediate economic and financial outlook was gloomy .
" 2009 will be year of bad news , " merkel said .
" that 's why we 're building a bridge so that things will get better by 2010 at the latest . "
she also responded to criticism that the budget proposed by the governing conservative-social democratic grand coalition does little to stimulate the economy , compared with plans envisioned by other nations such as the us and britain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said banks need to shake off their paralysis and get the money flowing merkel said the 480 billion euros -lrb- $ 625 billion -rrb- in financial injections and guarantees for banks was a sufficient stimulus , but that banks had yet to avail themselves of the money .
" confidence between banks is still not at the level that it should be , " merkel said .
" it is the responsibility of financial institutions to give loans to companies that need them . "
the german government made the funds available this fall in response to the global financial crisis that virtual froze lending between financial institutions .
but germany 's opposition parties say the government 's response to the crisis , which has led to economic recession in germany , was woefully inadequate .
weird outsiders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and westerwelle are still cordial despite the free democrats ' criticism the business-friendly free democrats took merkel 's government to task for ruling out the sort of tax breaks britain , for instance , hopes will encourage consumer spending .
" in europe , people are doing what the liberal opposition is demanding , " free democrat leader guido westerwelle said .
" the truth is that , with your policy of not lowering taxes , you 're the weird outsider in europe . "
the greens , too , said merkel 's approach was too negative .
" you nickname in brussels is ' madame non , " ' quipped green parliamentary leader renate kuenast .
meanwhile , the left party blamed privatization for germany 's current economic woes and said social programs should be prioritized .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs to invest in education but money is tight " mrs. chancellor , as long as you 're of the opinion that small government is a worthwhile goal , you might as well not hold your education summit , " said left party parliamentary leader oskar lafontaine .
acting on recommendations from economic experts , the governing grand coalition has abandoned its policy of state financial consolidation and included 18.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 24 billion -rrb- in deficit spending in its proposed 2009 budget .
but merkel and her social democratic finance minister peer steinbrueck have said they 're unwilling to take on more debt to allow for tax cuts or increased investments to stimulate the german economy . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" tomorrow we propose a coordinated eu fiscal stimulus , we will offer guidance to member states on the kind of measures to adopt , " said economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia tuesday in a speech in brussels .
officials told the dpa news agency this means giving governments a free hand in reducing their vat rates - but only as long as these cuts are temporary and that the standard rate is kept above the bloc 's minimum level of 15 percent .
current vat rates on goods and services vary from 25 percent in sweden and denmark to 15 percent in cyprus and luxembourg .
member states can also apply reduced rates on certain products .
british vat cut leads the way bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's chancellor alistair darling takes the credit the decision follows a move by the british government , which on monday announced that it would next month cut the country 's vat on consumer goods from 17.5 percent to 15 percent until the end of 2009 .
the vat measure , which is estimated to put 12.5 billion pounds -lrb- $ 18.75 billion -rrb- in consumers ' pockets , is part of a massive fiscal and financial package of 20 billion pounds to stimulate the economy in the face of a looming recession .
the european commission wants any fiscal measures to be coordinated at european level so as to " exploit synergies and avoid negative spillovers , " almunia said .
the commission also wants to mobilize resources in favour of troubled sectors such as the car industry , which has asked for 40 billion euros -lrb- $ 51 billion -rrb- in cheap loans to help it meet the eu 's latest environmental standards .
however , with no new eu money being promised , the amount of funds available from brussels is likely to be limited .
eu : funds must be efficiently used bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : existing eu funds must be better managed instead , officials are expected to call for a more efficient use of resources , such as the existing 500-million-euro globalization fund , which is aimed at retraining workers who have lost their jobs to non-eu countries , and the 11-billion-euro european social fund , which is aimed at boosting employment more generally .
they are also expected to call for a more rapid and effective use of the eu 's massive " cohesion " budget , which is designed to bring the standard of living in its poorest areas up to western levels , and which is set to cost 347 billion euros between 2007 and 2013 .
the eu executive will also urge eu member states to push for more economic reform and modernization in areas from energy efficiency to research and development and waste management - sectors long highlighted as the key to making europe 's economy more competitive .
at the same time , almunia has cautioned governments against seeking to spend their way out of the economic slowdown , saying " we need to reduce public debt over the medium term . "
dark times ahead for recession-hit bloc commission figures out earlier this month showed that the 15- member eurozone has officially slumped into recession .
the prospects for 2009 remain gloomy .
among the worst-performing eu economies are those of britain , germany , ireland , spain , and italy .

auto analysts say that it 's high time for the currently solvent opel car manufacturer to separate from its nearly bankrupt us parent general motors .
scenarios for the german firm 's future are the subject of speculation . general motors is burning cash so fast that it is likely to go bankrupt before the inauguration of barack obama as us president in january , but its opel division in germany , known as vauxhall in the uk , is still liquid .
opel 's mid-size insignia was even voted as 2009 european car of the year by the trade press . gm and opel have been bound together ever since adam opel ’ s heirs sold what was then germany ’ s biggest carmaker for the princely sum of $ 33 million -lrb- 26 million euros -rrb- during the great depression of the 1930s . however , the german press is now talking about divorce before detroit brings them both down . " opel is not for sale " last week , a gm spokesman in the us told afp news agency told that “ opel is not for sale . ” but , gm 's zurich-based european works council head klaus franz told reporters “ gm won ’ t let us go , ” explaining that opel ’ s r & d center in ruesselsheim , which develops an entire range of gm models , is too valuable for the parent company . bildunterschrift : in mid-november opel became the europe 's first carmaker to seek loan guarantees franz had even gone on to say that gm owed opel over one billion euros in cash , the same amount opel seeks from a german government bailout .
should gm fail , berlin has been asked to guarantee loans of up to one billion euros for 2009 . back in ruesselsheim , opel head hans demant denied franz ’ s statement to the frankfurter rundschau newspaper . divorce recommended the flip-flop is only one sign of contradictions and turmoil at gm ’ s european operations , according to christoph stuermer , an auto analyst at global insight gmbh in frankfurt , adding that he would recommend a divorce from gm for opel ’ s sake . “ the problem is that opel still makes money for gm , ” said stuermer , who believes that gm could be prepared to let go of one of its more prized assets if the price was right . last week , germany ’ s flamboyant sun king frank asbeck of the green energy firm solarworld had offered gm one billion euros in cash and guaranteed credit lines to take over opel 's four production plants in germany that was promptly turned down by gm . solar king 's offer for opel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asbeck 's offer to buy opel was turned down although stuermer characterized asbeck ’ s extremely low sum as “ a slap in the face ” and other auto experts dismiss the offer as a “ publicity stunt , ” the move triggered speculation about opel ’ s future and how inextricably the 100 percent owned subsidiary is bound to its parent company . “ gm and opel have been together for nearly 80 years .
they are woven so tightly together that it would be extremely difficult to separate them , ” said juergen pieper , a transport analyst at the private banking firm bankhaus metzler in frankfurt . ferdinand dudenhoeffer , director of the center for automotive research -lrb- car -rrb- in gelsenkirchen dismissed the longstanding relationship between gm and opel . " what man has put together can always be torn asunder , ” he said , pointing out that ford had recently divested itself of the long-held , but financially troubled , luxury brand aston martin bought by a consortium of kuwaiti investors , a texas banker and british rally driver . rocky marriage between gm and opel besides the marriage between gm and opel has been a rocky one to say the least in the last decades , according to wolfgang meinig of the center for automotive research -lrb- faw -rrb- in bamberg . “ it would be sensible for gm to let opel go before it might be forced to file for chapter 11 bankruptcy , ” said meinig , who added he could also see opel being bought out by equity investors . shortly after asbeck publicised his offer last wednesday , 1,000 opel dealers banded together to propose a buyout .
the problem is that those franchises are struggling financially themselves , according to stuermer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel 's mid-size insignia was voted european car of the year “ but it is a good sign that dealers out there are willing to stand up for opel , that there is still life left in the brand , ” said stuermer , who had also slammed opel ’ s downscale image .
“ in an image-driven market , many germany don ’ t want to be associated with some of opel ’ s uninspired brands - astra , omega , corsa , ” he said . gm blamed for opel 's problems “ image problems don ’ t fall from the sky , ” said pieper , who explained that other german manufacturers simply produced better quality cars in the last decade or so .
opel ’ s market share in western europe has tumbled in the last 15 years from 13.2 percent in 1993 to an estimated 8.6 percent for 2008 .
during the same period , opel ’ s chief rival in the mass market , volkswagen , climbed from 16.3 percent to what is expected to be above 20 percent for this year , said pieper . the analysts all pin at least part of opel ’ s problems on general motors .
“ in the last decades , gm has been so grossly mismanaged , ” said pieper , who believes it serves gm right if the us congress allows america ’ s biggest automaker to file for chapter 11 bankruptcy , which might not be the end of the world .
“ who knows ?
gm could emerge healthier from it , ” he said . but even if gm was to fail and took opel down with it , pieper thinks that the demise would not be tragic for the saturated european car industry .
“ opel is just another brand .
it ’ s up to the market to regulate which brands survive , ” he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is what 's good for gm good for america ?
opel is " worth saving " but stuermer says that opel is worth saving .
“ they ’ re making money , so they don ’ t deserve to go under .
they ought to have a chance at survival -lrb- without gm -rrb- , ” he said . dudenhoeffer believes that potential buyers could even be waiting for opel to come on the auction block if gm enters chapter 11 , which even could be one of the conditions of a federal bailout . " then opel could be a real bargain for , say , the chinese , who would n't mind the technology that comes with it and a foothold in the european car market , " he said , adding that us congressional approval to bail out gm is not guaranteed . " the us did n't save chrysler in the end either .
why should gm be a sacred cow ?
what 's more important : detroit or america ?
they are not necessarily the same , " asked dudenhoeffer , disputing the gm motto " what 's good for gm is good for america . " diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

auto analysts say that it 's high time for the currently solvent opel car manufacturer to separate from its nearly bankrupt us parent general motors .
scenarios for the german firm 's future are the subject of speculation . general motors is burning cash so fast that it is likely to go bankrupt before the inauguration of barack obama as us president in january , but its opel division in germany , known as vauxhall in the uk , is still liquid .
opel 's mid-size insignia was even voted as 2009 european car of the year by the trade press . gm and opel have been bound together ever since adam opel ’ s heirs sold what was then germany ’ s biggest carmaker for the princely sum of $ 33 million -lrb- 26 million euros -rrb- during the great depression of the 1930s . however , the german press is now talking about divorce before detroit brings them both down . " opel is not for sale " last week , a gm spokesman in the us told afp news agency told that “ opel is not for sale . ” but , gm 's zurich-based european works council head klaus franz told reporters “ gm won ’ t let us go , ” explaining that opel ’ s r & d center in ruesselsheim , which develops an entire range of gm models , is too valuable for the parent company . bildunterschrift : in mid-november opel became the europe 's first carmaker to seek loan guarantees franz had even gone on to say that gm owed opel over one billion euros in cash , the same amount opel seeks from a german government bailout .
should gm fail , berlin has been asked to guarantee loans of up to one billion euros for 2009 . back in ruesselsheim , opel head hans demant denied franz ’ s statement to the frankfurter rundschau newspaper . divorce recommended the flip-flop is only one sign of contradictions and turmoil at gm ’ s european operations , according to christoph stuermer , an auto analyst at global insight gmbh in frankfurt , adding that he would recommend a divorce from gm for opel ’ s sake . “ the problem is that opel still makes money for gm , ” said stuermer , who believes that gm could be prepared to let go of one of its more prized assets if the price was right . last week , germany ’ s flamboyant sun king frank asbeck of the green energy firm solarworld had offered gm one billion euros in cash and guaranteed credit lines to take over opel 's four production plants in germany that was promptly turned down by gm . solar king 's offer for opel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asbeck 's offer to buy opel was turned down although stuermer characterized asbeck ’ s extremely low sum as “ a slap in the face ” and other auto experts dismiss the offer as a “ publicity stunt , ” the move triggered speculation about opel ’ s future and how inextricably the 100 percent owned subsidiary is bound to its parent company . “ gm and opel have been together for nearly 80 years .
they are woven so tightly together that it would be extremely difficult to separate them , ” said juergen pieper , a transport analyst at the private banking firm bankhaus metzler in frankfurt . ferdinand dudenhoeffer , director of the center for automotive research -lrb- car -rrb- in gelsenkirchen dismissed the longstanding relationship between gm and opel . " what man has put together can always be torn asunder , ” he said , pointing out that ford had recently divested itself of the long-held , but financially troubled , luxury brand aston martin bought by a consortium of kuwaiti investors , a texas banker and british rally driver . rocky marriage between gm and opel besides the marriage between gm and opel has been a rocky one to say the least in the last decades , according to wolfgang meinig of the center for automotive research -lrb- faw -rrb- in bamberg . “ it would be sensible for gm to let opel go before it might be forced to file for chapter 11 bankruptcy , ” said meinig , who added he could also see opel being bought out by equity investors . shortly after asbeck publicised his offer last wednesday , 1,000 opel dealers banded together to propose a buyout .
the problem is that those franchises are struggling financially themselves , according to stuermer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel 's mid-size insignia was voted european car of the year “ but it is a good sign that dealers out there are willing to stand up for opel , that there is still life left in the brand , ” said stuermer , who had also slammed opel ’ s downscale image .
“ in an image-driven market , many germany don ’ t want to be associated with some of opel ’ s uninspired brands - astra , omega , corsa , ” he said . gm blamed for opel 's problems “ image problems don ’ t fall from the sky , ” said pieper , who explained that other german manufacturers simply produced better quality cars in the last decade or so .
opel ’ s market share in western europe has tumbled in the last 15 years from 13.2 percent in 1993 to an estimated 8.6 percent for 2008 .
during the same period , opel ’ s chief rival in the mass market , volkswagen , climbed from 16.3 percent to what is expected to be above 20 percent for this year , said pieper . the analysts all pin at least part of opel ’ s problems on general motors .
“ in the last decades , gm has been so grossly mismanaged , ” said pieper , who believes it serves gm right if the us congress allows america ’ s biggest automaker to file for chapter 11 bankruptcy , which might not be the end of the world .
“ who knows ?
gm could emerge healthier from it , ” he said . but even if gm was to fail and took opel down with it , pieper thinks that the demise would not be tragic for the saturated european car industry .
“ opel is just another brand .
it ’ s up to the market to regulate which brands survive , ” he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is what 's good for gm good for america ?
opel is " worth saving " but stuermer says that opel is worth saving .
“ they ’ re making money , so they don ’ t deserve to go under .
they ought to have a chance at survival -lrb- without gm -rrb- , ” he said . dudenhoeffer believes that potential buyers could even be waiting for opel to come on the auction block if gm enters chapter 11 , which even could be one of the conditions of a federal bailout . " then opel could be a real bargain for , say , the chinese , who would n't mind the technology that comes with it and a foothold in the european car market , " he said , adding that us congressional approval to bail out gm is not guaranteed . " the us did n't save chrysler in the end either .
why should gm be a sacred cow ?
what 's more important : detroit or america ?

she said enough aid is there , but it 's not being used . the second day of the bundestag 's budget debates centered on a speech by angela merkel , who laid out the principles behind the budget and admitted that the immediate economic and financial outlook was gloomy .
" 2009 will be year of bad news , " merkel said .
" that 's why we 're building a bridge so that things will get better by 2010 at the latest . "
she also responded to criticism that the budget proposed by the governing conservative-social democratic grand coalition does little to stimulate the economy , compared with plans envisioned by other nations such as the us and britain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said banks need to shake off their paralysis and get the money flowing merkel said the 480 billion euros -lrb- $ 625 billion -rrb- in financial injections and guarantees for banks was a sufficient stimulus , but that banks had yet to avail themselves of the money .

she said enough aid is there , but it 's not being used . the second day of the bundestag 's budget debates centered on a speech by angela merkel , who laid out the principles behind the budget and admitted that the immediate economic and financial outlook was gloomy .
" 2009 will be year of bad news , " merkel said .
" that 's why we 're building a bridge so that things will get better by 2010 at the latest . "
she also responded to criticism that the budget proposed by the governing conservative-social democratic grand coalition does little to stimulate the economy , compared with plans envisioned by other nations such as the us and britain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said banks need to shake off their paralysis and get the money flowing merkel said the 480 billion euros -lrb- $ 625 billion -rrb- in financial injections and guarantees for banks was a sufficient stimulus , but that banks had yet to avail themselves of the money .
" confidence between banks is still not at the level that it should be , " merkel said .
" it is the responsibility of financial institutions to give loans to companies that need them . "
the german government made the funds available this fall in response to the global financial crisis that virtual froze lending between financial institutions .
but germany 's opposition parties say the government 's response to the crisis , which has led to economic recession in germany , was woefully inadequate .
weird outsiders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and westerwelle are still cordial despite the free democrats ' criticism the business-friendly free democrats took merkel 's government to task for ruling out the sort of tax breaks britain , for instance , hopes will encourage consumer spending .
" in europe , people are doing what the liberal opposition is demanding , " free democrat leader guido westerwelle said .
" the truth is that , with your policy of not lowering taxes , you 're the weird outsider in europe . "
the greens , too , said merkel 's approach was too negative .
" you nickname in brussels is ' madame non , " ' quipped green parliamentary leader renate kuenast .
meanwhile , the left party blamed privatization for germany 's current economic woes and said social programs should be prioritized .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs to invest in education but money is tight " mrs. chancellor , as long as you 're of the opinion that small government is a worthwhile goal , you might as well not hold your education summit , " said left party parliamentary leader oskar lafontaine .
acting on recommendations from economic experts , the governing grand coalition has abandoned its policy of state financial consolidation and included 18.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 24 billion -rrb- in deficit spending in its proposed 2009 budget .
but merkel and her social democratic finance minister peer steinbrueck have said they 're unwilling to take on more debt to allow for tax cuts or increased investments to stimulate the german economy . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

cologne have said they 're starting an all-out push to bring local boy and former cologne star lukas podolski back to the team .
but can the bundesliga minnow afford bayern munich 's asking price ? cologne president wolfgang overath and general manager michael meier confirmed on tuesday , nov .
25 , that they have spoken with both the 23-year-old striker and his current club bayern munich about a possible transfer .
" we have done our homework , " overath said at the club 's annual meeting .
" we 'll be doing everything - and i mean everything - in our power to bring the boy back home . "
podolski grew up near cologne and began his career with the team 's amateurs .
he played for the professional team from 2003 to 2006 , scoring 46 goals in 81 first- and second-division matches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ... though he 's largely been a flop for bayern that spell of success established podolski , who was born in poland , as one of the bright young stars of the german national team .
he has won 60 caps in the past four years .
in 2006 he transferred to bayern munich for 12 million euros -lrb- $ 15.5 million -rrb- .
but he 's had difficulty cracking the starting line-up there , despite being reunited this season with juergen klinsmann , his coach with germany at the 2006 world cup .
earlier this week , podolski said he planned to leave bayern during the winter break , although klinsmann has denied that he will let the striker go .
a possible transfer fee of 15 million euros -lrb- 19.6 million -rrb- has been batted about in the media .
cologne is reportedly negotiating with local investors to raise money to buy " prince poldi , " as he 's known .

cologne have said they 're starting an all-out push to bring local boy and former cologne star lukas podolski back to the team .
but can the bundesliga minnow afford bayern munich 's asking price ? cologne president wolfgang overath and general manager michael meier confirmed on tuesday , nov .
25 , that they have spoken with both the 23-year-old striker and his current club bayern munich about a possible transfer .
" we have done our homework , " overath said at the club 's annual meeting .
" we 'll be doing everything - and i mean everything - in our power to bring the boy back home . "
podolski grew up near cologne and began his career with the team 's amateurs .
he played for the professional team from 2003 to 2006 , scoring 46 goals in 81 first- and second-division matches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ... though he 's largely been a flop for bayern that spell of success established podolski , who was born in poland , as one of the bright young stars of the german national team .
he has won 60 caps in the past four years .
in 2006 he transferred to bayern munich for 12 million euros -lrb- $ 15.5 million -rrb- .
but he 's had difficulty cracking the starting line-up there , despite being reunited this season with juergen klinsmann , his coach with germany at the 2006 world cup .
earlier this week , podolski said he planned to leave bayern during the winter break , although klinsmann has denied that he will let the striker go .
a possible transfer fee of 15 million euros -lrb- 19.6 million -rrb- has been batted about in the media .
cologne is reportedly negotiating with local investors to raise money to buy " prince poldi , " as he 's known .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 26.11.2008 eu bids to bring africa into immigration pact großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spanish coast guard frequently intercepts illegal immigrants from africa the european union sat down with representatives from 27 african countries this week to enlist their help in a new effort to curb the flood of illegal immigration . the joint eu-africa conference on tuesday , nov .
25 was meant to underscore a partnership between the two continents .
but african governments view the shift in eu policy with trepidation , concerned that a " fortress europe " is toughening its stance on immigration , as african nations struggle with food and environmental crises , as well as the global economic downturn .
the meeting follows an agreement by eu leaders last month to adopt new immigration rules , which seek to tailor policies to meet the bloc 's labor needs , while slapping additional restrictions on illegal residents .
" neither bunker nor sieve " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african immigrants seeking a better life arrive almost daily in europe in an effort to ease those concerns , french immigration minister brice hortefeux reassured his african counterparts at the meeting in paris , saying " a policy on migration can not be defined without or against africa , but rather with africa . "
" the objective of the european pact , " hortefeux said , " is to avoid a europe that is a bunker or a sieve . "
the ministers are expected to adopt a cooperation program for the next three years to step up the fight against illegal immigration and also look at development programs to create work opportunities for africans at home .
morocco 's foreign minister taieb fassi fihri called on europeans to be " realistic , " arguing that tough immigration laws would not discourage migrants from trying to reach europe .
alain bedouma yoda , the foreign minister of burkina faso , said more development projects were needed to bolster prospects at home , while easing entry regulations to combat human trafficking .
ngos call eu pact " too repressive " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a growing number of african immigrants now have german citizenship in the run-up to the meeting , a coalition of 300 non-governmental organizations called " bridges , not walls " denounced the eu 's new immigration stance as " essentially security-driven and self-serving . "
rights groups charged that the new pact is repressive and puts too much emphasis on regulating immigration flows to allow more skilled workers and fewer refugees .
echoing those concerns , morocco 's foreign minister fihri was quoted as saying that " europe most certainly should not be a sieve , but it should recognize that in the coming years it is going to need 30 million immigrants from non-eu states - with and without qualifications . "
a recent report by the french office of statistics , insee , said that immigrants make up about ten percent of the labor force in europe .
the report found that immigrants remain vital for europe 's labor market and provide at least part of the solution to the problem of the continent 's aging workforce . dw staff -lrb- gb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the delay does n't mean porsche 's plans have been put on hold . at a news conference on wednesday , nov .

a possible transfer fee of 15 million euros -lrb- 19.6 million -rrb- has been batted about in the media .
cologne is reportedly negotiating with local investors to raise money to buy " prince poldi , " as he 's known .

25 was meant to underscore a partnership between the two continents .
but african governments view the shift in eu policy with trepidation , concerned that a " fortress europe " is toughening its stance on immigration , as african nations struggle with food and environmental crises , as well as the global economic downturn .
the meeting follows an agreement by eu leaders last month to adopt new immigration rules , which seek to tailor policies to meet the bloc 's labor needs , while slapping additional restrictions on illegal residents .
" neither bunker nor sieve " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african immigrants seeking a better life arrive almost daily in europe in an effort to ease those concerns , french immigration minister brice hortefeux reassured his african counterparts at the meeting in paris , saying " a policy on migration can not be defined without or against africa , but rather with africa . "
" the objective of the european pact , " hortefeux said , " is to avoid a europe that is a bunker or a sieve . "
the ministers are expected to adopt a cooperation program for the next three years to step up the fight against illegal immigration and also look at development programs to create work opportunities for africans at home .
morocco 's foreign minister taieb fassi fihri called on europeans to be " realistic , " arguing that tough immigration laws would not discourage migrants from trying to reach europe .
alain bedouma yoda , the foreign minister of burkina faso , said more development projects were needed to bolster prospects at home , while easing entry regulations to combat human trafficking .

25 was meant to underscore a partnership between the two continents .
but african governments view the shift in eu policy with trepidation , concerned that a " fortress europe " is toughening its stance on immigration , as african nations struggle with food and environmental crises , as well as the global economic downturn .
the meeting follows an agreement by eu leaders last month to adopt new immigration rules , which seek to tailor policies to meet the bloc 's labor needs , while slapping additional restrictions on illegal residents .
" neither bunker nor sieve " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african immigrants seeking a better life arrive almost daily in europe in an effort to ease those concerns , french immigration minister brice hortefeux reassured his african counterparts at the meeting in paris , saying " a policy on migration can not be defined without or against africa , but rather with africa . "
" the objective of the european pact , " hortefeux said , " is to avoid a europe that is a bunker or a sieve . "
the ministers are expected to adopt a cooperation program for the next three years to step up the fight against illegal immigration and also look at development programs to create work opportunities for africans at home .
morocco 's foreign minister taieb fassi fihri called on europeans to be " realistic , " arguing that tough immigration laws would not discourage migrants from trying to reach europe .
alain bedouma yoda , the foreign minister of burkina faso , said more development projects were needed to bolster prospects at home , while easing entry regulations to combat human trafficking .

"
rights groups charged that the new pact is repressive and puts too much emphasis on regulating immigration flows to allow more skilled workers and fewer refugees .
echoing those concerns , morocco 's foreign minister fihri was quoted as saying that " europe most certainly should not be a sieve , but it should recognize that in the coming years it is going to need 30 million immigrants from non-eu states - with and without qualifications . "

aubry vows to take the socialists further to the left than the more centrist royal . the current mayor of the northern city lille has been chosen as the new leader of the french socialists , ending the infighting that left the party unable to provide effective opposition to president nicolas sarkozy 's right of center ump party .
martine aubry , 58 , won by a razor thin margin of only 102 votes out of 134,800 cast , the former socialist presidential candidate segolene royal according to official ballot results made public on wednesday , nov .
26 .
aubry , a former labor minister best known for introducing the controversial 35 hour work week in france , is also the daughter of jacques delors , the former president of the european commission .
over the weekend , aubry had claimed victory with an initial lead of only 42 votes out of nearly 137,000 cast , prompting royal to cry foul and demand verification of the vote count .
then on monday , a party commission convened to look at claims by both camps and by tuesday , decided which candidate was the winner .
rivalry between candidates splits party further bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal was the socialist candidate against sarkozy in last year 's presidential elections the vote count clash splits the deeply divided party even further between a more traditional leftist faction backing aubry and the more centrist members supporting royal .
many party leaders voted for aubry not based on her politics , but because of their intense dislike of her glamorous rival .
royal has been accused of lacking depth and the consistency of her convictions .
this became apparent during the presidential campaign last year when she switched her position on issues several times .
the bitterly contested leadership battle has also left the socialists in even more disarray and weaker in opposing sarkozy , who has undermined the party by poaching some its most prominent leaders , such as foreign minister bernard kouchner , into his conservative government .
infighting must stop aubry , who succeeds francois hollande , royal 's former partner and father of their four children , will first need to restore the socialist party 's credibility and unite the warring factions .
jean-marc ayrault , who is the party 's parliamentary leader , had urged the two women to call a truce .
" we must stop this totally ridiculous soap opera , " ayrault said on french television .
" whoever leads the socialist party tomorrow will not be able to do so without the others . "
aubry , for her part , even gave her rival a peck on the cheek .
" i want to tell segolene that together we will win for the french people , " she said .
aubry vows to steer socialists further left at the same time , aubry has also vowed to steer the party further to the left , warning that royal 's shift towards the middle would alienate the party 's traditional working class voter base .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last french socialist to serve as president was francois mitterrand , right a bva opinion poll published on tuesday found that most leftist voters viewed aubry 's victory as party leader in a positive light . but 30 percent had said they still preferred royal as the party 's the candidate in the 2012 presidential elections compared to only 20 percent for aubry , suggesting that a more centrist candidate had a better chance of winning .
the last time france had a president from the socialist party , was when francois mitterrand served from 1981 to 1995 .
still , the party controls nearly all of frances 22 regional councils as well as key cities such as paris , lyon and toulouse , even though it has minority representation in the national parliament .
royal wo n't fade away some socialists had even warned of that the party would be unable to overcome the personal loathing between aubry and royal , who has no intention of fading away . " we managed the exploit of convincing half , and maybe a little over half , of the socialist party even though we had the entire party establishment against us , " royal told reporters .

aubry vows to take the socialists further to the left than the more centrist royal . the current mayor of the northern city lille has been chosen as the new leader of the french socialists , ending the infighting that left the party unable to provide effective opposition to president nicolas sarkozy 's right of center ump party .
martine aubry , 58 , won by a razor thin margin of only 102 votes out of 134,800 cast , the former socialist presidential candidate segolene royal according to official ballot results made public on wednesday , nov .
26 .
aubry , a former labor minister best known for introducing the controversial 35 hour work week in france , is also the daughter of jacques delors , the former president of the european commission .
over the weekend , aubry had claimed victory with an initial lead of only 42 votes out of nearly 137,000 cast , prompting royal to cry foul and demand verification of the vote count .
then on monday , a party commission convened to look at claims by both camps and by tuesday , decided which candidate was the winner .
rivalry between candidates splits party further bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal was the socialist candidate against sarkozy in last year 's presidential elections the vote count clash splits the deeply divided party even further between a more traditional leftist faction backing aubry and the more centrist members supporting royal .
many party leaders voted for aubry not based on her politics , but because of their intense dislike of her glamorous rival .
royal has been accused of lacking depth and the consistency of her convictions .
this became apparent during the presidential campaign last year when she switched her position on issues several times .
the bitterly contested leadership battle has also left the socialists in even more disarray and weaker in opposing sarkozy , who has undermined the party by poaching some its most prominent leaders , such as foreign minister bernard kouchner , into his conservative government .
infighting must stop aubry , who succeeds francois hollande , royal 's former partner and father of their four children , will first need to restore the socialist party 's credibility and unite the warring factions .
jean-marc ayrault , who is the party 's parliamentary leader , had urged the two women to call a truce .

cologne have said they 're starting an all-out push to bring local boy and former cologne star lukas podolski back to the team .

" we 'll be doing everything - and i mean everything - in our power to bring the boy back home . "
podolski grew up near cologne and began his career with the team 's amateurs .
he played for the professional team from 2003 to 2006 , scoring 46 goals in 81 first- and second-division matches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ... though he 's largely been a flop for bayern that spell of success established podolski , who was born in poland , as one of the bright young stars of the german national team .
he has won 60 caps in the past four years .
in 2006 he transferred to bayern munich for 12 million euros -lrb- $ 15.5 million -rrb- .
but he 's had difficulty cracking the starting line-up there , despite being reunited this season with juergen klinsmann , his coach with germany at the 2006 world cup .
earlier this week , podolski said he planned to leave bayern during the winter break , although klinsmann has denied that he will let the striker go .
a possible transfer fee of 15 million euros -lrb- 19.6 million -rrb- has been batted about in the media .
cologne is reportedly negotiating with local investors to raise money to buy " prince poldi , " as he 's known .
" you talk to the player , the advisors , the club he wants to leave and the boards , " michael meier .
" all of that has happened .
we have a clear plan . " dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" tomorrow we propose a coordinated eu fiscal stimulus , we will offer guidance to member states on the kind of measures to adopt , " said economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia tuesday in a speech in brussels .
officials told the dpa news agency this means giving governments a free hand in reducing their vat rates - but only as long as these cuts are temporary and that the standard rate is kept above the bloc 's minimum level of 15 percent .
current vat rates on goods and services vary from 25 percent in sweden and denmark to 15 percent in cyprus and luxembourg .
member states can also apply reduced rates on certain products .
british vat cut leads the way bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's chancellor alistair darling takes the credit the decision follows a move by the british government , which on monday announced that it would next month cut the country 's vat on consumer goods from 17.5 percent to 15 percent until the end of 2009 .
the vat measure , which is estimated to put 12.5 billion pounds -lrb- $ 18.75 billion -rrb- in consumers ' pockets , is part of a massive fiscal and financial package of 20 billion pounds to stimulate the economy in the face of a looming recession .
the european commission wants any fiscal measures to be coordinated at european level so as to " exploit synergies and avoid negative spillovers , " almunia said .
the commission also wants to mobilize resources in favour of troubled sectors such as the car industry , which has asked for 40 billion euros -lrb- $ 51 billion -rrb- in cheap loans to help it meet the eu 's latest environmental standards .
however , with no new eu money being promised , the amount of funds available from brussels is likely to be limited .
eu : funds must be efficiently used bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : existing eu funds must be better managed instead , officials are expected to call for a more efficient use of resources , such as the existing 500-million-euro globalization fund , which is aimed at retraining workers who have lost their jobs to non-eu countries , and the 11-billion-euro european social fund , which is aimed at boosting employment more generally .
they are also expected to call for a more rapid and effective use of the eu 's massive " cohesion " budget , which is designed to bring the standard of living in its poorest areas up to western levels , and which is set to cost 347 billion euros between 2007 and 2013 .
the eu executive will also urge eu member states to push for more economic reform and modernization in areas from energy efficiency to research and development and waste management - sectors long highlighted as the key to making europe 's economy more competitive .
at the same time , almunia has cautioned governments against seeking to spend their way out of the economic slowdown , saying " we need to reduce public debt over the medium term . "
dark times ahead for recession-hit bloc commission figures out earlier this month showed that the 15- member eurozone has officially slumped into recession .
the prospects for 2009 remain gloomy .
among the worst-performing eu economies are those of britain , germany , ireland , spain , and italy .

she said enough aid is there , but it 's not being used . the second day of the bundestag 's budget debates centered on a speech by angela merkel , who laid out the principles behind the budget and admitted that the immediate economic and financial outlook was gloomy .
" 2009 will be year of bad news , " merkel said .
" that 's why we 're building a bridge so that things will get better by 2010 at the latest . "
she also responded to criticism that the budget proposed by the governing conservative-social democratic grand coalition does little to stimulate the economy , compared with plans envisioned by other nations such as the us and britain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said banks need to shake off their paralysis and get the money flowing merkel said the 480 billion euros -lrb- $ 625 billion -rrb- in financial injections and guarantees for banks was a sufficient stimulus , but that banks had yet to avail themselves of the money .
" confidence between banks is still not at the level that it should be , " merkel said .
" it is the responsibility of financial institutions to give loans to companies that need them . "
the german government made the funds available this fall in response to the global financial crisis that virtual froze lending between financial institutions .
but germany 's opposition parties say the government 's response to the crisis , which has led to economic recession in germany , was woefully inadequate .
weird outsiders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and westerwelle are still cordial despite the free democrats ' criticism the business-friendly free democrats took merkel 's government to task for ruling out the sort of tax breaks britain , for instance , hopes will encourage consumer spending .
" in europe , people are doing what the liberal opposition is demanding , " free democrat leader guido westerwelle said .
" the truth is that , with your policy of not lowering taxes , you 're the weird outsider in europe . "
the greens , too , said merkel 's approach was too negative .
" you nickname in brussels is ' madame non , " ' quipped green parliamentary leader renate kuenast .
meanwhile , the left party blamed privatization for germany 's current economic woes and said social programs should be prioritized .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs to invest in education but money is tight " mrs. chancellor , as long as you 're of the opinion that small government is a worthwhile goal , you might as well not hold your education summit , " said left party parliamentary leader oskar lafontaine .
acting on recommendations from economic experts , the governing grand coalition has abandoned its policy of state financial consolidation and included 18.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 24 billion -rrb- in deficit spending in its proposed 2009 budget .
but merkel and her social democratic finance minister peer steinbrueck have said they 're unwilling to take on more debt to allow for tax cuts or increased investments to stimulate the german economy . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she said enough aid is there , but it 's not being used . the second day of the bundestag 's budget debates centered on a speech by angela merkel , who laid out the principles behind the budget and admitted that the immediate economic and financial outlook was gloomy .
" 2009 will be year of bad news , " merkel said .
" that 's why we 're building a bridge so that things will get better by 2010 at the latest . "
she also responded to criticism that the budget proposed by the governing conservative-social democratic grand coalition does little to stimulate the economy , compared with plans envisioned by other nations such as the us and britain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said banks need to shake off their paralysis and get the money flowing merkel said the 480 billion euros -lrb- $ 625 billion -rrb- in financial injections and guarantees for banks was a sufficient stimulus , but that banks had yet to avail themselves of the money .
" confidence between banks is still not at the level that it should be , " merkel said .
" it is the responsibility of financial institutions to give loans to companies that need them . "
the german government made the funds available this fall in response to the global financial crisis that virtual froze lending between financial institutions .
but germany 's opposition parties say the government 's response to the crisis , which has led to economic recession in germany , was woefully inadequate .
weird outsiders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and westerwelle are still cordial despite the free democrats ' criticism the business-friendly free democrats took merkel 's government to task for ruling out the sort of tax breaks britain , for instance , hopes will encourage consumer spending .
" in europe , people are doing what the liberal opposition is demanding , " free democrat leader guido westerwelle said .
" the truth is that , with your policy of not lowering taxes , you 're the weird outsider in europe . "
the greens , too , said merkel 's approach was too negative .
" you nickname in brussels is ' madame non , " ' quipped green parliamentary leader renate kuenast .
meanwhile , the left party blamed privatization for germany 's current economic woes and said social programs should be prioritized .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs to invest in education but money is tight " mrs. chancellor , as long as you 're of the opinion that small government is a worthwhile goal , you might as well not hold your education summit , " said left party parliamentary leader oskar lafontaine .
acting on recommendations from economic experts , the governing grand coalition has abandoned its policy of state financial consolidation and included 18.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 24 billion -rrb- in deficit spending in its proposed 2009 budget .
but merkel and her social democratic finance minister peer steinbrueck have said they 're unwilling to take on more debt to allow for tax cuts or increased investments to stimulate the german economy . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

aubry , a former labor minister best known for introducing the controversial 35 hour work week in france , is also the daughter of jacques delors , the former president of the european commission .
over the weekend , aubry had claimed victory with an initial lead of only 42 votes out of nearly 137,000 cast , prompting royal to cry foul and demand verification of the vote count .
then on monday , a party commission convened to look at claims by both camps and by tuesday , decided which candidate was the winner .
rivalry between candidates splits party further bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal was the socialist candidate against sarkozy in last year 's presidential elections the vote count clash splits the deeply divided party even further between a more traditional leftist faction backing aubry and the more centrist members supporting royal .
many party leaders voted for aubry not based on her politics , but because of their intense dislike of her glamorous rival .
royal has been accused of lacking depth and the consistency of her convictions .
this became apparent during the presidential campaign last year when she switched her position on issues several times .
the bitterly contested leadership battle has also left the socialists in even more disarray and weaker in opposing sarkozy , who has undermined the party by poaching some its most prominent leaders , such as foreign minister bernard kouchner , into his conservative government .
infighting must stop aubry , who succeeds francois hollande , royal 's former partner and father of their four children , will first need to restore the socialist party 's credibility and unite the warring factions .
jean-marc ayrault , who is the party 's parliamentary leader , had urged the two women to call a truce .
" we must stop this totally ridiculous soap opera , " ayrault said on french television .
" whoever leads the socialist party tomorrow will not be able to do so without the others . "
aubry , for her part , even gave her rival a peck on the cheek .
" i want to tell segolene that together we will win for the french people , " she said .
aubry vows to steer socialists further left at the same time , aubry has also vowed to steer the party further to the left , warning that royal 's shift towards the middle would alienate the party 's traditional working class voter base .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last french socialist to serve as president was francois mitterrand , right a bva opinion poll published on tuesday found that most leftist voters viewed aubry 's victory as party leader in a positive light . but 30 percent had said they still preferred royal as the party 's the candidate in the 2012 presidential elections compared to only 20 percent for aubry , suggesting that a more centrist candidate had a better chance of winning .
the last time france had a president from the socialist party , was when francois mitterrand served from 1981 to 1995 .
still , the party controls nearly all of frances 22 regional councils as well as key cities such as paris , lyon and toulouse , even though it has minority representation in the national parliament .
royal wo n't fade away some socialists had even warned of that the party would be unable to overcome the personal loathing between aubry and royal , who has no intention of fading away . " we managed the exploit of convincing half , and maybe a little over half , of the socialist party even though we had the entire party establishment against us , " royal told reporters .

current vat rates on goods and services vary from 25 percent in sweden and denmark to 15 percent in cyprus and luxembourg .
member states can also apply reduced rates on certain products .
british vat cut leads the way bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's chancellor alistair darling takes the credit the decision follows a move by the british government , which on monday announced that it would next month cut the country 's vat on consumer goods from 17.5 percent to 15 percent until the end of 2009 .
the vat measure , which is estimated to put 12.5 billion pounds -lrb- $ 18.75 billion -rrb- in consumers ' pockets , is part of a massive fiscal and financial package of 20 billion pounds to stimulate the economy in the face of a looming recession .
the european commission wants any fiscal measures to be coordinated at european level so as to " exploit synergies and avoid negative spillovers , " almunia said .
the commission also wants to mobilize resources in favour of troubled sectors such as the car industry , which has asked for 40 billion euros -lrb- $ 51 billion -rrb- in cheap loans to help it meet the eu 's latest environmental standards .
however , with no new eu money being promised , the amount of funds available from brussels is likely to be limited .
eu : funds must be efficiently used bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : existing eu funds must be better managed instead , officials are expected to call for a more efficient use of resources , such as the existing 500-million-euro globalization fund , which is aimed at retraining workers who have lost their jobs to non-eu countries , and the 11-billion-euro european social fund , which is aimed at boosting employment more generally .
they are also expected to call for a more rapid and effective use of the eu 's massive " cohesion " budget , which is designed to bring the standard of living in its poorest areas up to western levels , and which is set to cost 347 billion euros between 2007 and 2013 .
the eu executive will also urge eu member states to push for more economic reform and modernization in areas from energy efficiency to research and development and waste management - sectors long highlighted as the key to making europe 's economy more competitive .
at the same time , almunia has cautioned governments against seeking to spend their way out of the economic slowdown , saying " we need to reduce public debt over the medium term . "
dark times ahead for recession-hit bloc commission figures out earlier this month showed that the 15- member eurozone has officially slumped into recession .
the prospects for 2009 remain gloomy .

26 aimed at jolting european union economies out of a recession .
the european commission said it wanted 200 billion euros of extra spending and tax cuts over the next two years .
" exceptional times call for exceptional measures , " european commission president jose manuel barroso said as the details of the plan were announced .
the plan would represent 1.5 percent of the eu 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
around 170 billion euros needed to finance the plan would come from national governments and the rest from eu funds and the european investment bank .
the european plan follows a us federal reserve announcement on tuesday that it would spend up to $ 600 billion to purchase mortgage securities and $ 200 billion for asset-backed securities to help get credit to consumers .
that money is in addition to the $ 700 billion rescue package already approved by congress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would a tax cut get europeans spending again ?
in an attempt to bridge the differences of opinion , eu leaders put forward a proposal that gives member countries a set of options for dealing with the crisis , but steers clear of a one-size-fits-all solution .
the commission said that the stimulus measures will need to be quick , targeted and temporary .
they will be a mix of revenue and spending instruments and will be accompanied by structural reforms .
eu leaders will formally vote on the proposal at a summit in december .
" i expect this package to receive strong support from european governments , " barroso said .
eu wants to coordinate actions the commission suggested that member countries consider temporary vat rate cuts , temporary increases in benefits to low-income households and the unemployed as well as temporary extensions of benefit pay-out periods .
it also suggested that governments could offer guarantees and loan subsidies to companies to help them attain credit .
the proposal also looks at increasing investments in infrastructure and in key sectors such as the automobile sector - where an additional five billion euros in extra funding is planned .
while the commission stopped short of mandating solutions , it wants all fiscal measures to be coordinated at the european level so as to " exploit synergies and avoid negative spillovers , " economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia tuesday in a speech in brussels .
spending up , deficits up one of the biggest points of disagreement is whether european countries should temporarily cut vat rates .
current vat rates on goods and services vary from 25 percent in sweden and denmark to 15 percent in cyprus and luxembourg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france and germany have come out against a vat cut on monday , britain became the first european country to announce a vat cut , with leaders saying it would reduce the vat by 2.5 percentage points to 15 percent through the end of 2009 .
the move is aimed at boosting consumer spending .
germany and france ruled out similar vat rate cuts .
president nicolas sarkozy said tuesday he would unveil an economic stimulus package within the next 10 days to help france 's key sectors resist the global slowdown .

25 was meant to underscore a partnership between the two continents .
but african governments view the shift in eu policy with trepidation , concerned that a " fortress europe " is toughening its stance on immigration , as african nations struggle with food and environmental crises , as well as the global economic downturn .
the meeting follows an agreement by eu leaders last month to adopt new immigration rules , which seek to tailor policies to meet the bloc 's labor needs , while slapping additional restrictions on illegal residents .
" neither bunker nor sieve " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african immigrants seeking a better life arrive almost daily in europe in an effort to ease those concerns , french immigration minister brice hortefeux reassured his african counterparts at the meeting in paris , saying " a policy on migration can not be defined without or against africa , but rather with africa . "
" the objective of the european pact , " hortefeux said , " is to avoid a europe that is a bunker or a sieve . "
the ministers are expected to adopt a cooperation program for the next three years to step up the fight against illegal immigration and also look at development programs to create work opportunities for africans at home .
morocco 's foreign minister taieb fassi fihri called on europeans to be " realistic , " arguing that tough immigration laws would not discourage migrants from trying to reach europe .
alain bedouma yoda , the foreign minister of burkina faso , said more development projects were needed to bolster prospects at home , while easing entry regulations to combat human trafficking .
ngos call eu pact " too repressive " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a growing number of african immigrants now have german citizenship in the run-up to the meeting , a coalition of 300 non-governmental organizations called " bridges , not walls " denounced the eu 's new immigration stance as " essentially security-driven and self-serving . "
rights groups charged that the new pact is repressive and puts too much emphasis on regulating immigration flows to allow more skilled workers and fewer refugees .
echoing those concerns , morocco 's foreign minister fihri was quoted as saying that " europe most certainly should not be a sieve , but it should recognize that in the coming years it is going to need 30 million immigrants from non-eu states - with and without qualifications . "
a recent report by the french office of statistics , insee , said that immigrants make up about ten percent of the labor force in europe .
the report found that immigrants remain vital for europe 's labor market and provide at least part of the solution to the problem of the continent 's aging workforce . dw staff -lrb- gb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

auto analysts say that it 's high time for the currently solvent opel car manufacturer to separate from its nearly bankrupt us parent general motors .
scenarios for the german firm 's future are the subject of speculation . general motors is burning cash so fast that it is likely to go bankrupt before the inauguration of barack obama as us president in january , but its opel division in germany , known as vauxhall in the uk , is still liquid .
opel 's mid-size insignia was even voted as 2009 european car of the year by the trade press . gm and opel have been bound together ever since adam opel ’ s heirs sold what was then germany ’ s biggest carmaker for the princely sum of $ 33 million -lrb- 26 million euros -rrb- during the great depression of the 1930s . however , the german press is now talking about divorce before detroit brings them both down . " opel is not for sale " last week , a gm spokesman in the us told afp news agency told that “ opel is not for sale . ” but , gm 's zurich-based european works council head klaus franz told reporters “ gm won ’ t let us go , ” explaining that opel ’ s r & d center in ruesselsheim , which develops an entire range of gm models , is too valuable for the parent company . bildunterschrift : in mid-november opel became the europe 's first carmaker to seek loan guarantees franz had even gone on to say that gm owed opel over one billion euros in cash , the same amount opel seeks from a german government bailout .
should gm fail , berlin has been asked to guarantee loans of up to one billion euros for 2009 . back in ruesselsheim , opel head hans demant denied franz ’ s statement to the frankfurter rundschau newspaper . divorce recommended the flip-flop is only one sign of contradictions and turmoil at gm ’ s european operations , according to christoph stuermer , an auto analyst at global insight gmbh in frankfurt , adding that he would recommend a divorce from gm for opel ’ s sake . “ the problem is that opel still makes money for gm , ” said stuermer , who believes that gm could be prepared to let go of one of its more prized assets if the price was right . last week , germany ’ s flamboyant sun king frank asbeck of the green energy firm solarworld had offered gm one billion euros in cash and guaranteed credit lines to take over opel 's four production plants in germany that was promptly turned down by gm . solar king 's offer for opel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asbeck 's offer to buy opel was turned down although stuermer characterized asbeck ’ s extremely low sum as “ a slap in the face ” and other auto experts dismiss the offer as a “ publicity stunt , ” the move triggered speculation about opel ’ s future and how inextricably the 100 percent owned subsidiary is bound to its parent company . “ gm and opel have been together for nearly 80 years .
they are woven so tightly together that it would be extremely difficult to separate them , ” said juergen pieper , a transport analyst at the private banking firm bankhaus metzler in frankfurt . ferdinand dudenhoeffer , director of the center for automotive research -lrb- car -rrb- in gelsenkirchen dismissed the longstanding relationship between gm and opel . " what man has put together can always be torn asunder , ” he said , pointing out that ford had recently divested itself of the long-held , but financially troubled , luxury brand aston martin bought by a consortium of kuwaiti investors , a texas banker and british rally driver . rocky marriage between gm and opel besides the marriage between gm and opel has been a rocky one to say the least in the last decades , according to wolfgang meinig of the center for automotive research -lrb- faw -rrb- in bamberg . “ it would be sensible for gm to let opel go before it might be forced to file for chapter 11 bankruptcy , ” said meinig , who added he could also see opel being bought out by equity investors . shortly after asbeck publicised his offer last wednesday , 1,000 opel dealers banded together to propose a buyout .
the problem is that those franchises are struggling financially themselves , according to stuermer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel 's mid-size insignia was voted european car of the year “ but it is a good sign that dealers out there are willing to stand up for opel , that there is still life left in the brand , ” said stuermer , who had also slammed opel ’ s downscale image .
“ in an image-driven market , many germany don ’ t want to be associated with some of opel ’ s uninspired brands - astra , omega , corsa , ” he said . gm blamed for opel 's problems “ image problems don ’ t fall from the sky , ” said pieper , who explained that other german manufacturers simply produced better quality cars in the last decade or so .
opel ’ s market share in western europe has tumbled in the last 15 years from 13.2 percent in 1993 to an estimated 8.6 percent for 2008 .
during the same period , opel ’ s chief rival in the mass market , volkswagen , climbed from 16.3 percent to what is expected to be above 20 percent for this year , said pieper . the analysts all pin at least part of opel ’ s problems on general motors .
“ in the last decades , gm has been so grossly mismanaged , ” said pieper , who believes it serves gm right if the us congress allows america ’ s biggest automaker to file for chapter 11 bankruptcy , which might not be the end of the world .
“ who knows ?
gm could emerge healthier from it , ” he said . but even if gm was to fail and took opel down with it , pieper thinks that the demise would not be tragic for the saturated european car industry .
“ opel is just another brand .
it ’ s up to the market to regulate which brands survive , ” he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is what 's good for gm good for america ?
opel is " worth saving " but stuermer says that opel is worth saving .
“ they ’ re making money , so they don ’ t deserve to go under .
they ought to have a chance at survival -lrb- without gm -rrb- , ” he said . dudenhoeffer believes that potential buyers could even be waiting for opel to come on the auction block if gm enters chapter 11 , which even could be one of the conditions of a federal bailout . " then opel could be a real bargain for , say , the chinese , who would n't mind the technology that comes with it and a foothold in the european car market , " he said , adding that us congressional approval to bail out gm is not guaranteed . " the us did n't save chrysler in the end either .
why should gm be a sacred cow ?
what 's more important : detroit or america ?

auto analysts say that it 's high time for the currently solvent opel car manufacturer to separate from its nearly bankrupt us parent general motors .
scenarios for the german firm 's future are the subject of speculation . general motors is burning cash so fast that it is likely to go bankrupt before the inauguration of barack obama as us president in january , but its opel division in germany , known as vauxhall in the uk , is still liquid .

" opel is not for sale " last week , a gm spokesman in the us told afp news agency told that “ opel is not for sale . ” but , gm 's zurich-based european works council head klaus franz told reporters “ gm won ’ t let us go , ” explaining that opel ’ s r & d center in ruesselsheim , which develops an entire range of gm models , is too valuable for the parent company . bildunterschrift : in mid-november opel became the europe 's first carmaker to seek loan guarantees franz had even gone on to say that gm owed opel over one billion euros in cash , the same amount opel seeks from a german government bailout .

the problem is that those franchises are struggling financially themselves , according to stuermer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel 's mid-size insignia was voted european car of the year “ but it is a good sign that dealers out there are willing to stand up for opel , that there is still life left in the brand , ” said stuermer , who had also slammed opel ’ s downscale image .
“ in an image-driven market , many germany don ’ t want to be associated with some of opel ’ s uninspired brands - astra , omega , corsa , ” he said . gm blamed for opel 's problems “ image problems don ’ t fall from the sky , ” said pieper , who explained that other german manufacturers simply produced better quality cars in the last decade or so .
opel ’ s market share in western europe has tumbled in the last 15 years from 13.2 percent in 1993 to an estimated 8.6 percent for 2008 .
during the same period , opel ’ s chief rival in the mass market , volkswagen , climbed from 16.3 percent to what is expected to be above 20 percent for this year , said pieper . the analysts all pin at least part of opel ’ s problems on general motors .

25 was meant to underscore a partnership between the two continents .
but african governments view the shift in eu policy with trepidation , concerned that a " fortress europe " is toughening its stance on immigration , as african nations struggle with food and environmental crises , as well as the global economic downturn .
the meeting follows an agreement by eu leaders last month to adopt new immigration rules , which seek to tailor policies to meet the bloc 's labor needs , while slapping additional restrictions on illegal residents .
" neither bunker nor sieve " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african immigrants seeking a better life arrive almost daily in europe in an effort to ease those concerns , french immigration minister brice hortefeux reassured his african counterparts at the meeting in paris , saying " a policy on migration can not be defined without or against africa , but rather with africa . "
" the objective of the european pact , " hortefeux said , " is to avoid a europe that is a bunker or a sieve . "
the ministers are expected to adopt a cooperation program for the next three years to step up the fight against illegal immigration and also look at development programs to create work opportunities for africans at home .
morocco 's foreign minister taieb fassi fihri called on europeans to be " realistic , " arguing that tough immigration laws would not discourage migrants from trying to reach europe .
alain bedouma yoda , the foreign minister of burkina faso , said more development projects were needed to bolster prospects at home , while easing entry regulations to combat human trafficking .
ngos call eu pact " too repressive " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a growing number of african immigrants now have german citizenship in the run-up to the meeting , a coalition of 300 non-governmental organizations called " bridges , not walls " denounced the eu 's new immigration stance as " essentially security-driven and self-serving . "
rights groups charged that the new pact is repressive and puts too much emphasis on regulating immigration flows to allow more skilled workers and fewer refugees .
echoing those concerns , morocco 's foreign minister fihri was quoted as saying that " europe most certainly should not be a sieve , but it should recognize that in the coming years it is going to need 30 million immigrants from non-eu states - with and without qualifications . "
a recent report by the french office of statistics , insee , said that immigrants make up about ten percent of the labor force in europe .
the report found that immigrants remain vital for europe 's labor market and provide at least part of the solution to the problem of the continent 's aging workforce . dw staff -lrb- gb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

cologne have said they 're starting an all-out push to bring local boy and former cologne star lukas podolski back to the team .
but can the bundesliga minnow afford bayern munich 's asking price ? cologne president wolfgang overath and general manager michael meier confirmed on tuesday , nov .
25 , that they have spoken with both the 23-year-old striker and his current club bayern munich about a possible transfer .
" we have done our homework , " overath said at the club 's annual meeting .
" we 'll be doing everything - and i mean everything - in our power to bring the boy back home . "
podolski grew up near cologne and began his career with the team 's amateurs .
he played for the professional team from 2003 to 2006 , scoring 46 goals in 81 first- and second-division matches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ... though he 's largely been a flop for bayern that spell of success established podolski , who was born in poland , as one of the bright young stars of the german national team .
he has won 60 caps in the past four years .
in 2006 he transferred to bayern munich for 12 million euros -lrb- $ 15.5 million -rrb- .
but he 's had difficulty cracking the starting line-up there , despite being reunited this season with juergen klinsmann , his coach with germany at the 2006 world cup .
earlier this week , podolski said he planned to leave bayern during the winter break , although klinsmann has denied that he will let the striker go .
a possible transfer fee of 15 million euros -lrb- 19.6 million -rrb- has been batted about in the media .
cologne is reportedly negotiating with local investors to raise money to buy " prince poldi , " as he 's known .
" you talk to the player , the advisors , the club he wants to leave and the boards , " michael meier .
" all of that has happened .

aubry vows to take the socialists further to the left than the more centrist royal . the current mayor of the northern city lille has been chosen as the new leader of the french socialists , ending the infighting that left the party unable to provide effective opposition to president nicolas sarkozy 's right of center ump party .
martine aubry , 58 , won by a razor thin margin of only 102 votes out of 134,800 cast , the former socialist presidential candidate segolene royal according to official ballot results made public on wednesday , nov .
26 .
aubry , a former labor minister best known for introducing the controversial 35 hour work week in france , is also the daughter of jacques delors , the former president of the european commission .
over the weekend , aubry had claimed victory with an initial lead of only 42 votes out of nearly 137,000 cast , prompting royal to cry foul and demand verification of the vote count .
then on monday , a party commission convened to look at claims by both camps and by tuesday , decided which candidate was the winner .
rivalry between candidates splits party further bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal was the socialist candidate against sarkozy in last year 's presidential elections the vote count clash splits the deeply divided party even further between a more traditional leftist faction backing aubry and the more centrist members supporting royal .
many party leaders voted for aubry not based on her politics , but because of their intense dislike of her glamorous rival .
royal has been accused of lacking depth and the consistency of her convictions .
this became apparent during the presidential campaign last year when she switched her position on issues several times .
the bitterly contested leadership battle has also left the socialists in even more disarray and weaker in opposing sarkozy , who has undermined the party by poaching some its most prominent leaders , such as foreign minister bernard kouchner , into his conservative government .
infighting must stop aubry , who succeeds francois hollande , royal 's former partner and father of their four children , will first need to restore the socialist party 's credibility and unite the warring factions .
jean-marc ayrault , who is the party 's parliamentary leader , had urged the two women to call a truce .
" we must stop this totally ridiculous soap opera , " ayrault said on french television .
" whoever leads the socialist party tomorrow will not be able to do so without the others . "
aubry , for her part , even gave her rival a peck on the cheek .
" i want to tell segolene that together we will win for the french people , " she said .
aubry vows to steer socialists further left at the same time , aubry has also vowed to steer the party further to the left , warning that royal 's shift towards the middle would alienate the party 's traditional working class voter base .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last french socialist to serve as president was francois mitterrand , right a bva opinion poll published on tuesday found that most leftist voters viewed aubry 's victory as party leader in a positive light . but 30 percent had said they still preferred royal as the party 's the candidate in the 2012 presidential elections compared to only 20 percent for aubry , suggesting that a more centrist candidate had a better chance of winning .
the last time france had a president from the socialist party , was when francois mitterrand served from 1981 to 1995 .
still , the party controls nearly all of frances 22 regional councils as well as key cities such as paris , lyon and toulouse , even though it has minority representation in the national parliament .
royal wo n't fade away some socialists had even warned of that the party would be unable to overcome the personal loathing between aubry and royal , who has no intention of fading away . " we managed the exploit of convincing half , and maybe a little over half , of the socialist party even though we had the entire party establishment against us , " royal told reporters .

aubry vows to take the socialists further to the left than the more centrist royal . the current mayor of the northern city lille has been chosen as the new leader of the french socialists , ending the infighting that left the party unable to provide effective opposition to president nicolas sarkozy 's right of center ump party .
martine aubry , 58 , won by a razor thin margin of only 102 votes out of 134,800 cast , the former socialist presidential candidate segolene royal according to official ballot results made public on wednesday , nov .
26 .
aubry , a former labor minister best known for introducing the controversial 35 hour work week in france , is also the daughter of jacques delors , the former president of the european commission .
over the weekend , aubry had claimed victory with an initial lead of only 42 votes out of nearly 137,000 cast , prompting royal to cry foul and demand verification of the vote count .
then on monday , a party commission convened to look at claims by both camps and by tuesday , decided which candidate was the winner .
rivalry between candidates splits party further bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal was the socialist candidate against sarkozy in last year 's presidential elections the vote count clash splits the deeply divided party even further between a more traditional leftist faction backing aubry and the more centrist members supporting royal .
many party leaders voted for aubry not based on her politics , but because of their intense dislike of her glamorous rival .
royal has been accused of lacking depth and the consistency of her convictions .
this became apparent during the presidential campaign last year when she switched her position on issues several times .
the bitterly contested leadership battle has also left the socialists in even more disarray and weaker in opposing sarkozy , who has undermined the party by poaching some its most prominent leaders , such as foreign minister bernard kouchner , into his conservative government .
infighting must stop aubry , who succeeds francois hollande , royal 's former partner and father of their four children , will first need to restore the socialist party 's credibility and unite the warring factions .
jean-marc ayrault , who is the party 's parliamentary leader , had urged the two women to call a truce .
" we must stop this totally ridiculous soap opera , " ayrault said on french television .
" whoever leads the socialist party tomorrow will not be able to do so without the others . "
aubry , for her part , even gave her rival a peck on the cheek .
" i want to tell segolene that together we will win for the french people , " she said .
aubry vows to steer socialists further left at the same time , aubry has also vowed to steer the party further to the left , warning that royal 's shift towards the middle would alienate the party 's traditional working class voter base .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last french socialist to serve as president was francois mitterrand , right a bva opinion poll published on tuesday found that most leftist voters viewed aubry 's victory as party leader in a positive light . but 30 percent had said they still preferred royal as the party 's the candidate in the 2012 presidential elections compared to only 20 percent for aubry , suggesting that a more centrist candidate had a better chance of winning .
the last time france had a president from the socialist party , was when francois mitterrand served from 1981 to 1995 .
still , the party controls nearly all of frances 22 regional councils as well as key cities such as paris , lyon and toulouse , even though it has minority representation in the national parliament .
royal wo n't fade away some socialists had even warned of that the party would be unable to overcome the personal loathing between aubry and royal , who has no intention of fading away . " we managed the exploit of convincing half , and maybe a little over half , of the socialist party even though we had the entire party establishment against us , " royal told reporters .
" we have waged a fine battle to renovate the party and that battle continues , " she said . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 26.11.2008 after 80 years of marriage , gm and opel face possible divorce großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the clock keep ticking for germany 's opel , one of general motor 's most prized assets ?
auto analysts say that it 's high time for the currently solvent opel car manufacturer to separate from its nearly bankrupt us parent general motors .
scenarios for the german firm 's future are the subject of speculation . general motors is burning cash so fast that it is likely to go bankrupt before the inauguration of barack obama as us president in january , but its opel division in germany , known as vauxhall in the uk , is still liquid .
opel 's mid-size insignia was even voted as 2009 european car of the year by the trade press . gm and opel have been bound together ever since adam opel ’ s heirs sold what was then germany ’ s biggest carmaker for the princely sum of $ 33 million -lrb- 26 million euros -rrb- during the great depression of the 1930s . however , the german press is now talking about divorce before detroit brings them both down . " opel is not for sale " last week , a gm spokesman in the us told afp news agency told that “ opel is not for sale . ” but , gm 's zurich-based european works council head klaus franz told reporters “ gm won ’ t let us go , ” explaining that opel ’ s r & d center in ruesselsheim , which develops an entire range of gm models , is too valuable for the parent company . bildunterschrift : in mid-november opel became the europe 's first carmaker to seek loan guarantees franz had even gone on to say that gm owed opel over one billion euros in cash , the same amount opel seeks from a german government bailout .
should gm fail , berlin has been asked to guarantee loans of up to one billion euros for 2009 . back in ruesselsheim , opel head hans demant denied franz ’ s statement to the frankfurter rundschau newspaper . divorce recommended the flip-flop is only one sign of contradictions and turmoil at gm ’ s european operations , according to christoph stuermer , an auto analyst at global insight gmbh in frankfurt , adding that he would recommend a divorce from gm for opel ’ s sake . “ the problem is that opel still makes money for gm , ” said stuermer , who believes that gm could be prepared to let go of one of its more prized assets if the price was right . last week , germany ’ s flamboyant sun king frank asbeck of the green energy firm solarworld had offered gm one billion euros in cash and guaranteed credit lines to take over opel 's four production plants in germany that was promptly turned down by gm . solar king 's offer for opel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : asbeck 's offer to buy opel was turned down although stuermer characterized asbeck ’ s extremely low sum as “ a slap in the face ” and other auto experts dismiss the offer as a “ publicity stunt , ” the move triggered speculation about opel ’ s future and how inextricably the 100 percent owned subsidiary is bound to its parent company . “ gm and opel have been together for nearly 80 years .
they are woven so tightly together that it would be extremely difficult to separate them , ” said juergen pieper , a transport analyst at the private banking firm bankhaus metzler in frankfurt . ferdinand dudenhoeffer , director of the center for automotive research -lrb- car -rrb- in gelsenkirchen dismissed the longstanding relationship between gm and opel . " what man has put together can always be torn asunder , ” he said , pointing out that ford had recently divested itself of the long-held , but financially troubled , luxury brand aston martin bought by a consortium of kuwaiti investors , a texas banker and british rally driver . rocky marriage between gm and opel besides the marriage between gm and opel has been a rocky one to say the least in the last decades , according to wolfgang meinig of the center for automotive research -lrb- faw -rrb- in bamberg . “ it would be sensible for gm to let opel go before it might be forced to file for chapter 11 bankruptcy , ” said meinig , who added he could also see opel being bought out by equity investors . shortly after asbeck publicised his offer last wednesday , 1,000 opel dealers banded together to propose a buyout .
the problem is that those franchises are struggling financially themselves , according to stuermer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel 's mid-size insignia was voted european car of the year “ but it is a good sign that dealers out there are willing to stand up for opel , that there is still life left in the brand , ” said stuermer , who had also slammed opel ’ s downscale image .
“ in an image-driven market , many germany don ’ t want to be associated with some of opel ’ s uninspired brands - astra , omega , corsa , ” he said . gm blamed for opel 's problems “ image problems don ’ t fall from the sky , ” said pieper , who explained that other german manufacturers simply produced better quality cars in the last decade or so .
opel ’ s market share in western europe has tumbled in the last 15 years from 13.2 percent in 1993 to an estimated 8.6 percent for 2008 .
during the same period , opel ’ s chief rival in the mass market , volkswagen , climbed from 16.3 percent to what is expected to be above 20 percent for this year , said pieper . the analysts all pin at least part of opel ’ s problems on general motors .
“ in the last decades , gm has been so grossly mismanaged , ” said pieper , who believes it serves gm right if the us congress allows america ’ s biggest automaker to file for chapter 11 bankruptcy , which might not be the end of the world .
“ who knows ?
gm could emerge healthier from it , ” he said . but even if gm was to fail and took opel down with it , pieper thinks that the demise would not be tragic for the saturated european car industry .
“ opel is just another brand .
it ’ s up to the market to regulate which brands survive , ” he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is what 's good for gm good for america ?
opel is " worth saving " but stuermer says that opel is worth saving .
“ they ’ re making money , so they don ’ t deserve to go under .
they ought to have a chance at survival -lrb- without gm -rrb- , ” he said . dudenhoeffer believes that potential buyers could even be waiting for opel to come on the auction block if gm enters chapter 11 , which even could be one of the conditions of a federal bailout . " then opel could be a real bargain for , say , the chinese , who would n't mind the technology that comes with it and a foothold in the european car market , " he said , adding that us congressional approval to bail out gm is not guaranteed . " the us did n't save chrysler in the end either .
why should gm be a sacred cow ?
what 's more important : detroit or america ?
they are not necessarily the same , " asked dudenhoeffer , disputing the gm motto " what 's good for gm is good for america . " diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 26.11.2008 brussels gives members ' vat reduction plans the green light großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a number of eu states are considering vat cuts while others are against them the european commission is to allow member states to reduce their value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- rates to boost consumption during the recession , officials in brussels said tuesday , nov 25 . the european union 's executive arm will also propose increasing investments in infrastructure and in key sectors such as cars , construction and green technologies as part of its economic stimulus package , due to be unveiled on wednesday .
" tomorrow we propose a coordinated eu fiscal stimulus , we will offer guidance to member states on the kind of measures to adopt , " said economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia tuesday in a speech in brussels .
officials told the dpa news agency this means giving governments a free hand in reducing their vat rates - but only as long as these cuts are temporary and that the standard rate is kept above the bloc 's minimum level of 15 percent .
current vat rates on goods and services vary from 25 percent in sweden and denmark to 15 percent in cyprus and luxembourg .
member states can also apply reduced rates on certain products .
british vat cut leads the way bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's chancellor alistair darling takes the credit the decision follows a move by the british government , which on monday announced that it would next month cut the country 's vat on consumer goods from 17.5 percent to 15 percent until the end of 2009 .
the vat measure , which is estimated to put 12.5 billion pounds -lrb- $ 18.75 billion -rrb- in consumers ' pockets , is part of a massive fiscal and financial package of 20 billion pounds to stimulate the economy in the face of a looming recession .
the european commission wants any fiscal measures to be coordinated at european level so as to " exploit synergies and avoid negative spillovers , " almunia said .
the commission also wants to mobilize resources in favour of troubled sectors such as the car industry , which has asked for 40 billion euros -lrb- $ 51 billion -rrb- in cheap loans to help it meet the eu 's latest environmental standards .
however , with no new eu money being promised , the amount of funds available from brussels is likely to be limited .
eu : funds must be efficiently used bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : existing eu funds must be better managed instead , officials are expected to call for a more efficient use of resources , such as the existing 500-million-euro globalization fund , which is aimed at retraining workers who have lost their jobs to non-eu countries , and the 11-billion-euro european social fund , which is aimed at boosting employment more generally .
they are also expected to call for a more rapid and effective use of the eu 's massive " cohesion " budget , which is designed to bring the standard of living in its poorest areas up to western levels , and which is set to cost 347 billion euros between 2007 and 2013 .
the eu executive will also urge eu member states to push for more economic reform and modernization in areas from energy efficiency to research and development and waste management - sectors long highlighted as the key to making europe 's economy more competitive .
at the same time , almunia has cautioned governments against seeking to spend their way out of the economic slowdown , saying " we need to reduce public debt over the medium term . "
dark times ahead for recession-hit bloc commission figures out earlier this month showed that the 15- member eurozone has officially slumped into recession .
the prospects for 2009 remain gloomy .
among the worst-performing eu economies are those of britain , germany , ireland , spain , and italy .

kosovo is worried it would end up dividing the country along ethnic lines . shortly after kosovo declared independence from serbia in february , the european union agreed to send police , customs and judicial experts to kosovo in an attempt to bring stability to the region .
but with kosovo 's independence still being challenged by serbia , the eu 's so-called eulex mission remains on hold .
the 2,000-member eulex force was supposed to have fully deployed by early december .
it was to take over for the un , which has governed kosovo since serbian forces were ousted by nato in 1999 .
the un is now trying to broker a compromise that would allow the mission to go forward , but kosovo has refused to budge , rejecting a plan proposed by un secretary general ban ki-moon and agreed to by serbia .
" the six point plan , for the institutions of kosovo and for the people of kosovo , was , is and will be unacceptable and inapplicable , " thaci told kosovo 's parliament on tuesday , nov .
25 .
serbia wants un to remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thaci does not want kosovo to be divided serbia , which has russian backing on the kosovo issue , has demanded that eulex view kosovo 's status as neutral , meaning that its presence is not a recognition of the country 's independence .
it also wants the un to maintain control over northern kosovo , which is dominated by ethnic serbs .
police , customs officers and judges in areas with an albanian majority would work with eulex , according to the compromise proposal .
kosovo 's population is 90 percent ethnic albanian .
the remaining 120,000 serbs live in the north of the country .

25 was meant to underscore a partnership between the two continents .
but african governments view the shift in eu policy with trepidation , concerned that a " fortress europe " is toughening its stance on immigration , as african nations struggle with food and environmental crises , as well as the global economic downturn .
the meeting follows an agreement by eu leaders last month to adopt new immigration rules , which seek to tailor policies to meet the bloc 's labor needs , while slapping additional restrictions on illegal residents .
" neither bunker nor sieve " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african immigrants seeking a better life arrive almost daily in europe in an effort to ease those concerns , french immigration minister brice hortefeux reassured his african counterparts at the meeting in paris , saying " a policy on migration can not be defined without or against africa , but rather with africa . "
" the objective of the european pact , " hortefeux said , " is to avoid a europe that is a bunker or a sieve . "
the ministers are expected to adopt a cooperation program for the next three years to step up the fight against illegal immigration and also look at development programs to create work opportunities for africans at home .
morocco 's foreign minister taieb fassi fihri called on europeans to be " realistic , " arguing that tough immigration laws would not discourage migrants from trying to reach europe .
alain bedouma yoda , the foreign minister of burkina faso , said more development projects were needed to bolster prospects at home , while easing entry regulations to combat human trafficking .
ngos call eu pact " too repressive " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a growing number of african immigrants now have german citizenship in the run-up to the meeting , a coalition of 300 non-governmental organizations called " bridges , not walls " denounced the eu 's new immigration stance as " essentially security-driven and self-serving . "
rights groups charged that the new pact is repressive and puts too much emphasis on regulating immigration flows to allow more skilled workers and fewer refugees .
echoing those concerns , morocco 's foreign minister fihri was quoted as saying that " europe most certainly should not be a sieve , but it should recognize that in the coming years it is going to need 30 million immigrants from non-eu states - with and without qualifications . "
a recent report by the french office of statistics , insee , said that immigrants make up about ten percent of the labor force in europe .
the report found that immigrants remain vital for europe 's labor market and provide at least part of the solution to the problem of the continent 's aging workforce . dw staff -lrb- gb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

25 was meant to underscore a partnership between the two continents .
but african governments view the shift in eu policy with trepidation , concerned that a " fortress europe " is toughening its stance on immigration , as african nations struggle with food and environmental crises , as well as the global economic downturn .
the meeting follows an agreement by eu leaders last month to adopt new immigration rules , which seek to tailor policies to meet the bloc 's labor needs , while slapping additional restrictions on illegal residents .
" neither bunker nor sieve " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african immigrants seeking a better life arrive almost daily in europe in an effort to ease those concerns , french immigration minister brice hortefeux reassured his african counterparts at the meeting in paris , saying " a policy on migration can not be defined without or against africa , but rather with africa . "
" the objective of the european pact , " hortefeux said , " is to avoid a europe that is a bunker or a sieve . "
the ministers are expected to adopt a cooperation program for the next three years to step up the fight against illegal immigration and also look at development programs to create work opportunities for africans at home .
morocco 's foreign minister taieb fassi fihri called on europeans to be " realistic , " arguing that tough immigration laws would not discourage migrants from trying to reach europe .
alain bedouma yoda , the foreign minister of burkina faso , said more development projects were needed to bolster prospects at home , while easing entry regulations to combat human trafficking .
ngos call eu pact " too repressive " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a growing number of african immigrants now have german citizenship in the run-up to the meeting , a coalition of 300 non-governmental organizations called " bridges , not walls " denounced the eu 's new immigration stance as " essentially security-driven and self-serving . "
rights groups charged that the new pact is repressive and puts too much emphasis on regulating immigration flows to allow more skilled workers and fewer refugees .
echoing those concerns , morocco 's foreign minister fihri was quoted as saying that " europe most certainly should not be a sieve , but it should recognize that in the coming years it is going to need 30 million immigrants from non-eu states - with and without qualifications . "
a recent report by the french office of statistics , insee , said that immigrants make up about ten percent of the labor force in europe .

25 was meant to underscore a partnership between the two continents .
but african governments view the shift in eu policy with trepidation , concerned that a " fortress europe " is toughening its stance on immigration , as african nations struggle with food and environmental crises , as well as the global economic downturn .
the meeting follows an agreement by eu leaders last month to adopt new immigration rules , which seek to tailor policies to meet the bloc 's labor needs , while slapping additional restrictions on illegal residents .
" neither bunker nor sieve " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : african immigrants seeking a better life arrive almost daily in europe in an effort to ease those concerns , french immigration minister brice hortefeux reassured his african counterparts at the meeting in paris , saying " a policy on migration can not be defined without or against africa , but rather with africa . "
" the objective of the european pact , " hortefeux said , " is to avoid a europe that is a bunker or a sieve . "
the ministers are expected to adopt a cooperation program for the next three years to step up the fight against illegal immigration and also look at development programs to create work opportunities for africans at home .
morocco 's foreign minister taieb fassi fihri called on europeans to be " realistic , " arguing that tough immigration laws would not discourage migrants from trying to reach europe .
alain bedouma yoda , the foreign minister of burkina faso , said more development projects were needed to bolster prospects at home , while easing entry regulations to combat human trafficking .
ngos call eu pact " too repressive " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a growing number of african immigrants now have german citizenship in the run-up to the meeting , a coalition of 300 non-governmental organizations called " bridges , not walls " denounced the eu 's new immigration stance as " essentially security-driven and self-serving . "
rights groups charged that the new pact is repressive and puts too much emphasis on regulating immigration flows to allow more skilled workers and fewer refugees .
echoing those concerns , morocco 's foreign minister fihri was quoted as saying that " europe most certainly should not be a sieve , but it should recognize that in the coming years it is going to need 30 million immigrants from non-eu states - with and without qualifications . "
a recent report by the french office of statistics , insee , said that immigrants make up about ten percent of the labor force in europe .
the report found that immigrants remain vital for europe 's labor market and provide at least part of the solution to the problem of the continent 's aging workforce . dw staff -lrb- gb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she said enough aid is there , but it 's not being used . the second day of the bundestag 's budget debates centered on a speech by angela merkel , who laid out the principles behind the budget and admitted that the immediate economic and financial outlook was gloomy .
" 2009 will be year of bad news , " merkel said .
" that 's why we 're building a bridge so that things will get better by 2010 at the latest . "
she also responded to criticism that the budget proposed by the governing conservative-social democratic grand coalition does little to stimulate the economy , compared with plans envisioned by other nations such as the us and britain .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said banks need to shake off their paralysis and get the money flowing merkel said the 480 billion euros -lrb- $ 625 billion -rrb- in financial injections and guarantees for banks was a sufficient stimulus , but that banks had yet to avail themselves of the money .
" confidence between banks is still not at the level that it should be , " merkel said .
" it is the responsibility of financial institutions to give loans to companies that need them . "
the german government made the funds available this fall in response to the global financial crisis that virtual froze lending between financial institutions .

acting on recommendations from economic experts , the governing grand coalition has abandoned its policy of state financial consolidation and included 18.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 24 billion -rrb- in deficit spending in its proposed 2009 budget .

" we have done our homework , " overath said at the club 's annual meeting .
" we 'll be doing everything - and i mean everything - in our power to bring the boy back home . "
podolski grew up near cologne and began his career with the team 's amateurs .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ... though he 's largely been a flop for bayern that spell of success established podolski , who was born in poland , as one of the bright young stars of the german national team .

a possible transfer fee of 15 million euros -lrb- 19.6 million -rrb- has been batted about in the media .
cologne is reportedly negotiating with local investors to raise money to buy " prince poldi , " as he 's known .
" you talk to the player , the advisors , the club he wants to leave and the boards , " michael meier .

kosovo is worried it would end up dividing the country along ethnic lines . shortly after kosovo declared independence from serbia in february , the european union agreed to send police , customs and judicial experts to kosovo in an attempt to bring stability to the region .
but with kosovo 's independence still being challenged by serbia , the eu 's so-called eulex mission remains on hold .
the 2,000-member eulex force was supposed to have fully deployed by early december .
it was to take over for the un , which has governed kosovo since serbian forces were ousted by nato in 1999 .
the un is now trying to broker a compromise that would allow the mission to go forward , but kosovo has refused to budge , rejecting a plan proposed by un secretary general ban ki-moon and agreed to by serbia .
" the six point plan , for the institutions of kosovo and for the people of kosovo , was , is and will be unacceptable and inapplicable , " thaci told kosovo 's parliament on tuesday , nov .
25 .
serbia wants un to remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thaci does not want kosovo to be divided serbia , which has russian backing on the kosovo issue , has demanded that eulex view kosovo 's status as neutral , meaning that its presence is not a recognition of the country 's independence .
it also wants the un to maintain control over northern kosovo , which is dominated by ethnic serbs .
police , customs officers and judges in areas with an albanian majority would work with eulex , according to the compromise proposal .
kosovo 's population is 90 percent ethnic albanian .
the remaining 120,000 serbs live in the north of the country .
kosovo albanian leaders fear that a split chain of command in eulex would cement the existing ethnic partition of kosovo .
kosovo 's independence has been recognized by 52 countries , including the united states and most eu states .
" kosovo 's status is solved and this is a closed issue since feb .

the captain questioned loew 's selection criteria and said he lacked respect for long-time germany players .
ballack 's criticism of loew led to tension between the two and ballack had to fly to germany from london for a few hours last month to personally explain his comments and apologize to loew .
loew accepted the apology and retained the chelsea midfielder as his captain .
frings later also had a private meeting with loew to clear the air .
ballack now says last month 's comments in the german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- were misinterpreted .
he had said , " experienced national players deserve at least some respect and loyalty . "

officials said just over 75 % of voters had supported the plan , which would see greenland take a greater share of its annual oil revenues .
it will also take control of police , courts and coast guard , and have some say in foreign policy .
correspondents say the vote could be a major step towards independence for the arctic island of 57,000 people .
hans enoksen , the head of the local government in the danish self-governing territory , thanked greenlanders for " this overwhelming result " .
" the tears are running down my cheeks , " said an emotional mr enoksen .
final results showed that 75.54 % voted in favour , while 23.57 % said no - in line with predictions before the vote .
turnout was 71.96 % .
regaining rights about 50,000 of the population are native inuit .
greenland gained self-rule in 1979 , after previously being a colony and then a province of denmark .
" it was time for us for to regain our rights and freedoms that were stolen from our ancestors , " david brandt , a former fisherman , told the afp news agency .
under the new arrangement , due to take effect in june next year , the island will take a greater share of its annual oil revenue , and greenlanders will be treated as a separate people under international law .
if the proposals are enacted , kalaallisut would become the official language , instead of danish .
the plan would also see greenland becoming less reliant on subsidies from copenhagen .
currently these provide 30 % of its gdp .
in 1985 , the island left the european union to avoid subjecting its fishing grounds to eu rules .

" the tears are running down my cheeks , " said an emotional mr enoksen .

" it was time for us for to regain our rights and freedoms that were stolen from our ancestors , " david brandt , a former fisherman , told the afp news agency .
under the new arrangement , due to take effect in june next year , the island will take a greater share of its annual oil revenue , and greenlanders will be treated as a separate people under international law .

advertisement the rspb say that a severn ' reef ' would be more energy efficient and better for the environment than a barrage .
conservationists claim building a reef across the severn estuary would be cheaper , less damaging and generate more power than a proposed barrage .
a study for the rspb found a reef would hold back about 2m -lrb- 6ft 6in -rrb- of water and not alter tidal patterns as much .
a feasibility study for the welsh assembly government and the uk government on harnessing the estuary 's tidal power started in january .
a consultation on which projects to shortlist is expected to begin in 2009 .
supporters of a proposal for a 10 mile -lrb- 16km -rrb- barrage between cardiff and weston-super-mare argue it could generate some 17,000 gigawatt hours -lrb- gwh -rrb- of electricity each year , the equivalent of almost 5 % of the uk 's needs .

media requires javascript to play .
the river severn 's tidal power can be seen by surfers taking on the severn bore the rspb asked engineers atkins to examine the feasibility of a " greener " alternative to a barrage .
the research concluded a 12 mile -lrb- 19 km -rrb- reef would cost about £ 2bn less and produce 20,000 gwh .
this proposal would see a reef built across the severn between aberthaw in the vale of glamorgan and minehead in somerset , making it the most westerly option .
like the cardiff-weston barrage , it would generate electricity as water flowed through turbines but it would not hold back the full height of the tide .
the study found that a reef could generate electricity for longer periods than the barrage , and therefore be more be able to meet power needs at peak demand times .
the rspb thinks the tidal reef would be less harmful to birds and fish enlarge image the bird charity said it preferred the plan because a reef would keep intact most of the estuary 's bird feeding ground and a reef 's slower-moving turbines would reduce danger to migrating salmon and eels .
rspb director of conservation mark avery said : " the government must crack the problem of how to use the severn 's tidal power without harming its wildlife .
" we already know a cardiff-weston barrage would cost far more than almost any other form of green energy and seriously damage sites protected by law .
" a tidal reef could reign in that damage , cost the taxpayer much less and be built more quickly , " he said .
report author professor rod rainey said : " we believe this scheme could be more powerful but less costly than other plans being put forward , particularly the cardiff to weston barrage . "
the reef was designed and proposed by evans engineering , a small family company based in cornwall .
proprietor rupert evans said : " it 's much more in tune to the way the estuary works . "
" its construction would mean far less road traffic because of rail connections , and would require less material and cost significantly less than other tidal options or nuclear power . "
" it 's a compromise which works , it 's considerably more efficient than tidal stream turbines but does n't have the environmental impact that great monolithic barrages have . "
in june , a report commissioned by 10 environmental groups who oppose a barrage said renewable energy could be generated more cheaply using other technology .
a spokeswoman for the department for energy and climate change said : " we are still looking at all ten options on our list of potential severn tidal power schemes .
" as part of this work we have been doing our own study in to the tidal reef proposal , but we will also consider this report by the rspb . "

" wiltshire has such an expanse of rural areas within its boundaries that we saw the need to increase and further develop our specialist knowledge within the service . "
two officers based at the service headquarters will support the specialist team by visiting farms , holding talks in the rural community as well as mapping and identifying water sources and other risk critical information such as the presence of gas cylinders , which are extremely dangerous to firefighters when involved in fire .
the wiltshire mid branch of the rspca contributed £ 11,000 towards the equipment , with a further £ 3,000 given in total by the north wiltshire and south wiltshire & district branches .
