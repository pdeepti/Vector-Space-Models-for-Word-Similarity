program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corruption -pipe- 23.09.2008 report presses germany to step up fight against corruption großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : less oversight often means greater corruption , according to the report though germany moved up two spots in corruption rankings to number 14 on the list of 180 , transparency international has urged the government to do more to fight corruption . global anti-corruption watchdog transparency international praised germany 's " increased efforts " to root out corruption sparked by the massive siemens scandal but pointed out that smaller german firms were slower in their commitment to counter graft .
“ the sparks of corruption prevention must spread to the middle class , ” head of the ti 's german chapter sylvia schenk said in a statement on tuesday .
“ whoever thinks that morality is separable put his business at risk and sends a ruinous signal to his personnel .
the awareness of personal responsibility must increase . ”
the group urged the german government to take concerted measures to tackle corruption in politics .
it said the world 's view of germany has been damaged by the country 's unwillingness to ratify un initiatives against corruption , schenk said .
mid-level companies are also hesitant to engage in anti-corruption strategies , she added .
the 2008 report lists 180 nations on a scale from zero -lrb- highly corrupt -rrb- to 10 -lrb- highly clean -rrb- based on expert assessments and opinion surveys of public sector corruption .
denmark , new zealand and sweden share the highest score at 9.3 , followed immediately by singapore at 9.2 .
bringing up the rear is somalia at 1.0 , slightly trailing iraq and myanmar at 1.3 and haiti at 1.4 .
the report noted significant declines in the scores of bulgaria , burundi , norway and britain , while strong improvements over last year were identified in cyprus , georgia , nigeria , qatar , south korea and turkey .
whether in high or low-income countries , the challenge of reigning in corruption requires functioning institutions in government and other sections of society , transparency said .
" a humanitarian disaster " poorer countries are often plagued by corrupt judiciaries and ineffective parliamentary oversight , the group said .
" in the poorest countries , corruption levels can mean the difference between life and death , when money for hospitals or clean water is in play , " the organization 's chairperson , huguette labelle said .
" the continuing high levels of corruption and poverty plaguing many of the world 's societies amount to an ongoing humanitarian disaster and can not be tolerated , " she said in presenting the organization 's annual corruption perceptions index in berlin on monday , sept .
22 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany had less corporate corruption ' strong oversight required ' wealthy countries , on the other hand , show evidence of insufficient regulation of the private sector in terms of addressing overseas bribery by their companies , and weak oversight of financial institutions and transactions , it added .
" stemming corruption requires strong oversight through parliaments , law enforcement , independent media and a vibrant civil society , " said labelle .
" when these institutions are weak , corruption spirals out of control with horrendous consequences for ordinary people , and for justice and equality in societies , " she said .
the anti-corruption guardian also referred to corporate bribery and the questionable methods of companies in acquiring and managing overseas business .
' unacceptable double-standard ' " the continuing emergence of foreign bribery scandals indicates a broader failure by the world 's wealthiest countries to live up to the promise of mutual accountability in the fight against corruption , it said .
" this sort of double standard is unacceptable and disregards international legal standards , " said labelle .
" beyond its corrosive effects on the rule of law and public confidence ... it undermines the credibility of the wealthiest nations in calling for greater action to fight corruption by low-income countries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 23.09.2008 us bailout first step in long reform process , says economist großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us bank bailout may cheer struggling banks but german politicians are n't amused the chaos in the us has europeans believing they 'll have the upper hand in future regulatory negotiations .
not so fast , irwin collier of the john f. kennedy institute at berlin 's free university told dw-world.de. dw-world.de : are european banks going to be able to take advantage of the relief available from the us government ?
irwin collier : the original terms of the bailout were to be limited to domestic us financial institutions .
of course when international financial institutions saw this language , they immediately , as one says , dialed 1-800-paulson , to let the treasury department know that to limit the bailout along national lines is absolutely impossible in a modern globalized economy .
and so the language was changed so that all foreign firms with significant us operations - and there are a lot of them - will be able to participate in the proposed purchase of mortgage-backed securities .
i suspect that might not be the most popular political decision to make in the united states .
the money going toward these foreign financial institutions is us taxpayer money .
looking at the proposed legislation , though , the secretary of the treasury will have enormous discretionary powers to decide which assets will be purchased from which institutions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irwin collier i think one has to remember that the balance of international financial institutions may be eligible , but depending on how many different banks want to feed at the trough at the same time , paulson will have enormous discretion to decide which banks to service first .
german chancellor angela merkel has criticized the bailout plan .
she also said that she had long been trying to push for greater transparency , for tighter regulation in global finance , and that the us and britain had blocked her .
has she been vindicated ?
she certainly has a point , and she was not alone in making it .
there have been many reasonable voices who have been pointing to the fact that financial market contracts and instruments have evolved enormously over the last fifty years , and that the regulatory framework has not kept pace .
but again , having said that , once you have a crisis , it really matters very little who identified the sore points first .
if there 's a financial crisis , in the sense that one bank or one financial institution 's failing could cause another to fail , you have to prop up some of the dominoes so that the crisis does n't get worse .
having principles against bailouts really does n't help you in that situation .
but are the kinds of banking reforms she and others were calling for now going to help cure the situation , or is the sickness too far advanced , so to speak ?
i think the one thing that we can hope for is to see major new kinds of regulation and oversight in the american capital market .
i think what merkel and other leaders have been pushing for is a greater harmonization of regulations , one that would make it more transparent as to what securities issued in one country would be worth in another country .
i think that real harmonization , though , is music of the very far future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel has criticized the us for not implementing more stringent controls the national response on the part of the us will have to come first , and it will certainly be a step in the right direction .
once they do that , we will have a starting point in international negotiations to harmonize regulations .
the financial markets of europe are in a somewhat healthier position than those of the us , at least as yet .
does that mean that europe will have an easier time getting its way in future conversations with us regulators over harmonization ?
i would be very surprised if the relative weights in these sorts of negotiations were to change .
remember , we 're going to see differences between the french , the germans , the british , the italians .
these will come up in a variety of ways , and i just do n't see the initiative passing from new york to a place to be determined in europe .
but could the comparatively conservative practices of german financial institutions , say , be held up as an example of prudence , now that we see how reckless some investors in the us had become ?
i think very much that the rules of prudential banking behavior , these rules that bankers have known and have developed over the years , will be rewarded .
we 'll also see that in the us , the banks that are going to survive this best will be the ones who did n't necessarily push the limits , but rather followed fairly standard procedure , having adequate capital reserves and the like .

not so fast , irwin collier of the john f. kennedy institute at berlin 's free university told dw-world.de. dw-world.de : are european banks going to be able to take advantage of the relief available from the us government ?
irwin collier : the original terms of the bailout were to be limited to domestic us financial institutions .
of course when international financial institutions saw this language , they immediately , as one says , dialed 1-800-paulson , to let the treasury department know that to limit the bailout along national lines is absolutely impossible in a modern globalized economy .
and so the language was changed so that all foreign firms with significant us operations - and there are a lot of them - will be able to participate in the proposed purchase of mortgage-backed securities .
i suspect that might not be the most popular political decision to make in the united states .
the money going toward these foreign financial institutions is us taxpayer money .
looking at the proposed legislation , though , the secretary of the treasury will have enormous discretionary powers to decide which assets will be purchased from which institutions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irwin collier i think one has to remember that the balance of international financial institutions may be eligible , but depending on how many different banks want to feed at the trough at the same time , paulson will have enormous discretion to decide which banks to service first .
german chancellor angela merkel has criticized the bailout plan .
she also said that she had long been trying to push for greater transparency , for tighter regulation in global finance , and that the us and britain had blocked her .
has she been vindicated ?
she certainly has a point , and she was not alone in making it .
there have been many reasonable voices who have been pointing to the fact that financial market contracts and instruments have evolved enormously over the last fifty years , and that the regulatory framework has not kept pace .
but again , having said that , once you have a crisis , it really matters very little who identified the sore points first .
if there 's a financial crisis , in the sense that one bank or one financial institution 's failing could cause another to fail , you have to prop up some of the dominoes so that the crisis does n't get worse .
having principles against bailouts really does n't help you in that situation .
but are the kinds of banking reforms she and others were calling for now going to help cure the situation , or is the sickness too far advanced , so to speak ?
i think the one thing that we can hope for is to see major new kinds of regulation and oversight in the american capital market .
i think what merkel and other leaders have been pushing for is a greater harmonization of regulations , one that would make it more transparent as to what securities issued in one country would be worth in another country .
i think that real harmonization , though , is music of the very far future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel has criticized the us for not implementing more stringent controls the national response on the part of the us will have to come first , and it will certainly be a step in the right direction .
once they do that , we will have a starting point in international negotiations to harmonize regulations .
the financial markets of europe are in a somewhat healthier position than those of the us , at least as yet .
does that mean that europe will have an easier time getting its way in future conversations with us regulators over harmonization ?
i would be very surprised if the relative weights in these sorts of negotiations were to change .
remember , we 're going to see differences between the french , the germans , the british , the italians .
these will come up in a variety of ways , and i just do n't see the initiative passing from new york to a place to be determined in europe .
but could the comparatively conservative practices of german financial institutions , say , be held up as an example of prudence , now that we see how reckless some investors in the us had become ?
i think very much that the rules of prudential banking behavior , these rules that bankers have known and have developed over the years , will be rewarded .
we 'll also see that in the us , the banks that are going to survive this best will be the ones who did n't necessarily push the limits , but rather followed fairly standard procedure , having adequate capital reserves and the like .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 23.09.2008 sarkozy calls for global summit to overhaul financial system großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy used strong words to criticize what he called the excesses of an unchecked financial system french president sarkozy called tuesday for a summit to tackle the global financial crisis and urged world leaders to draw lessons from capitalist excesses in a speech before the un general assembly . in a hard-hitting speech before the un general assembly in new york on tuesday , sept 23 , french president nicolas sarkozy demanded that those responsible for the global financial turbulence be punished and called for a " regulated capitalism . " " today , millions of people across the world fear for their savings , for their apartment , for the funds they have put in banks .
it is our duty to give them clear answers , " the french president , who chairs the eu 's presidency , said .
" who is responsible for this disaster ?
may those who are responsible be punished and held accountable , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the collapse of the venerable lehman brothers investment bank sent shockwaves around the world in his first public statements on the financial crisis which has rattled world markets and sparked a $ 700 billion us rescue package , sarkozy urged major powers to devise a new form of regulated market economics that would prevent the excesses behind the current credit crisis which felled investment bank lehman brothers . he however did not spell out who was responsible for the global upheaval , how the system should be reformed and why governments in europe and the us did not act earlier to stem the crisis . sarkozy calls for world summit to tackle crisis addressing the 63rd session of the un general assembly which has been dominated by the financial upheaval on wall street , sarkozy urged world leaders to draw lessons from the global financial crisis , rebuild a system that regulates the markets , curb speculation , increase transparency and punish the reckless . " it 's the duty of heads of state and government of the countries most directly concerned to meet before the end of the year to examine together the lessons of the most serious financial crisis the world has experienced since that of the 1930s , " sarkozy said . " let us rebuild together a regulated capitalism in which whole swathes of financial activity are not left to the sole judgment of market operators , in which banks do their job , which is to finance economic development rather than engage in speculation , " sarkozy said . the french leader criticized hedge funds and credit ratings agencies for their roles in the current crisis and denounced pay practices in investment banks . in a press conference afterwards , sarkozy called for a summit in november to deal with the crisis , adding he had in mind a " g8 format , " referring to the eight leading economic powers , that could be opened to " emerging countries . " the g8 is made up of the united states , france , britain , germany , italy , japan , canada and russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been unusually critical of us failures in the present financial chaos speaking in french through an interpreter , sarkozy called for " rules that apply to all and serve to avert and soften shocks instead of exacerbating them . " like sarkozy , other european leaders , chiefly germany 's chancellor angela merkel , have voiced annoyance at what they perceive as us failures to implement more stringent financial controls . both sarkozy and merkel have complained that their calls last year for tighter regulation of the markets were shunted aside by the united states and britain . new economic cooperation with russia separately , speaking on behalf of the 27-member european union , sarkozy also appealed for a " continent-wide economic space " between europe and russia . " what europe is telling russia is that we want links with russia , that we want to build a shared future with russia , we want to be russia 's partner , " sarkozy said .
" why not build a continent-wide economic space which would unite russia and europe ? " he asked . at the same time , sarkozy warned russia after its war with georgia that force can not be used to settle disputes . " europe is also telling russia ... it can not compromise on the principle of states ' sovereignty and independence , their territorial integrity , or respect for international law , " he said ´ . sarkozy brokered a ceasefire to end the conflict between georgia and russia last month , although the united states and eu countries have sharply criticized russia for what they described as its excessive use of force . french leader remains firm on iran sarkozy also said the eu would never tolerate a nuclear-armed iran , " which would endanger the peace and stability of an entire region , nor can it tolerate iran calling for the destruction of ...
israel . " he told reporters that paris fully supported a fourth round of sanctions against iran for refusing to suspend its nuclear enrichment program , but acknowledged that western powers would need russia 's support to pass a new un sanctions resolution . tehran denies western allegations that it 's seeking to develop nuclear weapons . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" let us rebuild together a regulated capitalism in which whole swathes of financial activity are not left to the sole judgment of market operators , in which banks do their job , which is to finance economic development rather than engage in speculation , " sarkozy said . the french leader criticized hedge funds and credit ratings agencies for their roles in the current crisis and denounced pay practices in investment banks . in a press conference afterwards , sarkozy called for a summit in november to deal with the crisis , adding he had in mind a " g8 format , " referring to the eight leading economic powers , that could be opened to " emerging countries .

" what europe is telling russia is that we want links with russia , that we want to build a shared future with russia , we want to be russia 's partner , " sarkozy said .
" why not build a continent-wide economic space which would unite russia and europe ? " he asked . at the same time , sarkozy warned russia after its war with georgia that force can not be used to settle disputes . " europe is also telling russia ... it can not compromise on the principle of states ' sovereignty and independence , their territorial integrity , or respect for international law , " he said ´ . sarkozy brokered a ceasefire to end the conflict between georgia and russia last month , although the united states and eu countries have sharply criticized russia for what they described as its excessive use of force . french leader remains firm on iran sarkozy also said the eu would never tolerate a nuclear-armed iran , " which would endanger the peace and stability of an entire region , nor can it tolerate iran calling for the destruction of ...

" " today , millions of people across the world fear for their savings , for their apartment , for the funds they have put in banks .
it is our duty to give them clear answers , " the french president , who chairs the eu 's presidency , said .
" who is responsible for this disaster ?
may those who are responsible be punished and held accountable , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the collapse of the venerable lehman brothers investment bank sent shockwaves around the world in his first public statements on the financial crisis which has rattled world markets and sparked a $ 700 billion us rescue package , sarkozy urged major powers to devise a new form of regulated market economics that would prevent the excesses behind the current credit crisis which felled investment bank lehman brothers . he however did not spell out who was responsible for the global upheaval , how the system should be reformed and why governments in europe and the us did not act earlier to stem the crisis . sarkozy calls for world summit to tackle crisis addressing the 63rd session of the un general assembly which has been dominated by the financial upheaval on wall street , sarkozy urged world leaders to draw lessons from the global financial crisis , rebuild a system that regulates the markets , curb speculation , increase transparency and punish the reckless . " it 's the duty of heads of state and government of the countries most directly concerned to meet before the end of the year to examine together the lessons of the most serious financial crisis the world has experienced since that of the 1930s , " sarkozy said . " let us rebuild together a regulated capitalism in which whole swathes of financial activity are not left to the sole judgment of market operators , in which banks do their job , which is to finance economic development rather than engage in speculation , " sarkozy said . the french leader criticized hedge funds and credit ratings agencies for their roles in the current crisis and denounced pay practices in investment banks . in a press conference afterwards , sarkozy called for a summit in november to deal with the crisis , adding he had in mind a " g8 format , " referring to the eight leading economic powers , that could be opened to " emerging countries . " the g8 is made up of the united states , france , britain , germany , italy , japan , canada and russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been unusually critical of us failures in the present financial chaos speaking in french through an interpreter , sarkozy called for " rules that apply to all and serve to avert and soften shocks instead of exacerbating them . " like sarkozy , other european leaders , chiefly germany 's chancellor angela merkel , have voiced annoyance at what they perceive as us failures to implement more stringent financial controls . both sarkozy and merkel have complained that their calls last year for tighter regulation of the markets were shunted aside by the united states and britain . new economic cooperation with russia separately , speaking on behalf of the 27-member european union , sarkozy also appealed for a " continent-wide economic space " between europe and russia . " what europe is telling russia is that we want links with russia , that we want to build a shared future with russia , we want to be russia 's partner , " sarkozy said .
" why not build a continent-wide economic space which would unite russia and europe ? " he asked . at the same time , sarkozy warned russia after its war with georgia that force can not be used to settle disputes . " europe is also telling russia ... it can not compromise on the principle of states ' sovereignty and independence , their territorial integrity , or respect for international law , " he said ´ . sarkozy brokered a ceasefire to end the conflict between georgia and russia last month , although the united states and eu countries have sharply criticized russia for what they described as its excessive use of force . french leader remains firm on iran sarkozy also said the eu would never tolerate a nuclear-armed iran , " which would endanger the peace and stability of an entire region , nor can it tolerate iran calling for the destruction of ...
israel . " he told reporters that paris fully supported a fourth round of sanctions against iran for refusing to suspend its nuclear enrichment program , but acknowledged that western powers would need russia 's support to pass a new un sanctions resolution . tehran denies western allegations that it 's seeking to develop nuclear weapons . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the premiere on monday , semptember 22 at the rheinisches landesmuseum was attended by deutsche welle director general erik bettermann , as well as the director of the beethovenfest ilona schmiel and the film ’ s director enrique sánchez lansch .
the documentary follows sánchez lansch and his team as they travel with gustavo dudamel , a young , charismatic conductor , and the simón bolívar youth orchestra of venezuela from rehearsal in caracas to their performance at the beethovenfest 2007 in bonn .
the documentary also tells the stories of young musicians and their paths out of poverty and squalor and into the limelight on stages around the world .
“ this is truly a film about miracles occurring , ” says rolf rische , head of society and entertainment at dw-tv .
the team is responsible for this project , just like the prize-winning dw-tv series “ kent nagano conducts classical masterpieces ” -lrb- dvd box , arthaus musik -rrb- .
sánchez lansch has already directed other successful music documentaries like “ rhythm is it ! ” -lrb- 2004 -rrb- , “ sing um dein leben ! ” -lrb- 2005 -rrb- and “ das reichsorchester ” -lrb- 2007 -rrb- .
bernhard fleischer moving images gmbh produced the film on behalf of deutsche welle and unitel classica in cooperation with zdf .
“ classical music is an excellent ambassador for germany around the world and an essential aspect of europe ’ s cultural assets , ” says director general erik bettermann .
“ the film ‘ the promise of music ’ therefore fits perfectly into our cultural mission – just like our commitment to the beethovenfest in bonn . ”
the 220 musicians from the venezuelan youth orchestra come from all over the country .
the youngest was 15 and the oldest 23 .
they all have the “ sistema de orquestas ” to thank for their musical careers .

the lowest rate at which the ecb provided cash to commercial banks was 4.73 percent , a statement said .
on another day which saw strong demand for central bank cash , the ecb 's move showed that tension remained high on money markets used by banks to lend to one another , since the average rate at last week 's auction was 4.58 percent .

more than half that amount was provided at a favorable rate of 3.3 percent , the ecb said , adding that demand for the funds was nearly double the amount available .
the central bank 's benchmark lending rate is 4.25 percent .
the offers came as the us congress studied a $ 700-billion rescue plan designed to bail out the country 's troubled financial industry , which is reeling under the weight of bad mortgage loans .
in london , the bank of england also renewed on tuesday its one-day , or overnight , loan offer of $ 40 billion to banking institutions that face funding problems of their own because of the credit crunch .

the end of financial quarters are often times of stress for banks as they close their books and balance their accounts .
last week , the ecb injected a total of 125 billion euros into money markets via three rapid refinancing operations after the us investment bank lehman brothers went into bankruptcy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 23.09.2008 eu anti-terror chief says data sharing is key großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the use of the internet to incite and recruit terrorists is growing dw talked with eu counterterrorism coordinator gilles de kerchove about the successes and pitfalls of europe 's fight against terror , which increasingly involves the internet . the european parliament is debating new plans to combat terrorism , including the creation of new offenses such as recruiting and training terrorists .
the discussion is increasingly focused on the growing use of the internet as a terror tool , and the threat to data-protection standards in the eu .
dw-world : what are the priorities in the eu 's fight against terrorism at the moment ?
gilles de kerchove : the strategy we adopted in 2005 foresees four main pillars : to prevent people from being radicalized ; to pursue actors and prosecute them ; improve protection of borders ; and improve ways member states respond to a major attack .
for me , the priorities are to emphasize prevention and to work on consequence of a major attack .
on tuesday the european parliament will debate creating new offenses , like incitement to commit terror over the internet .
has this problem grown in the past few years ?
indeed .
it is very important and i am very much in favor of this piece of legislation .
if it is implemented by the member states , it will allow them to start prosecuting those who mainly use the internet to try to incite hatred and commit terrorist acts .
there are something like 5,000 web sites that call for violence and for committing terrorist acts .
it 's important that we can handle that through criminal law .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de kerchove : eu is fighting for hearts and minds and it is not only that .
we have to develop a counter-narrative as well .
we need to explain that the first victims of all this are the muslims themselves , and that it is a war of ideas .
we have to counter the hijacking of the muslim religion for political purposes .
is germany playing a big role ?
a project where germany has taken a very interesting lead is in monitoring the internet .
it has led to the creation of a portal at europol .
the project is called " check-the-web , " where we try to pull all our information together , and make it accessible to police and intelligence services from all the member states .
i 'm currently working with my german colleagues to see what we can do to speed up that project , and reinforce what we can do together in monitoring the internet .
the internet is vast , fluid , and difficult to control .
can you really get a handle on terror sites overall ?
it is a difficult exercise indeed .
as i said , it is a war of ideas , and we have to win the hearts and minds at the same time .
one thing that is developing on the web - its interesting to see on youtube for instance - more and more people are putting up videos that denigrate osama bin laden .
and in some polls of the muslim world , the support for bin laden , for al qaeda , is declining .
that is something we have to invest in .
you speak about sharing data within europe .
but there are those who argue that could lead to data security problems .
could innocent people become targets of europol or secret services ?
yes , but if it 's the case , i think it will be easily detected .
i recently visited a private company that worked for intelligence services , where they tried to enter into certain chat rooms .
and you know , you do n't enter those chat rooms easily .
you have to build trust , and it can take months before getting a password .
so users who wait for months to get this password are n't innocent people .
how do european institutions , like investigative arm europol and the enforcement arm eurojust , working together ?
it is improving , but a lot more needs to be done .
for instance , not all cases of prosecution or investigation are sent to europol or eurojust , respectively .
so it is important for me to remind member states of this obligation .
it is important for europol and eurojust to be associated with as many joint investigation teams as possible .
they have to show member states their added value , which is important .
and i think in two or three years this will have changed significantly .
does cooperation between european member states work as well as it should ?
there is certainly room for improvement .
but the cooperation is much better than it was five years ago .
just take the recent plots that have been foiled in europe - in barcelona , in denmark , in germany , and in belgium .
in many of these cases it 's due to a closer cooperation between the different intelligence services and police .
we still have to improve the way all the players are sharing information .
it is not that that obvious at the level of the european union , between the intelligence community and the police community .
it does happen at the national level .
in germany you have a platform within which all the players are sharing information . … i am trying to convince all 27 states to all set up a similar platform .
and after that , we need to improve the network between these 27 platforms .
that is an indirect way to implement the concept of availability , the information-sharing environment that the report of the 9/11 commission in the united states considered to be the top lesson learned from 9/11 . interview : anke hagedorn -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the discussion is increasingly focused on the growing use of the internet as a terror tool , and the threat to data-protection standards in the eu .
dw-world : what are the priorities in the eu 's fight against terrorism at the moment ?
gilles de kerchove : the strategy we adopted in 2005 foresees four main pillars : to prevent people from being radicalized ; to pursue actors and prosecute them ; improve protection of borders ; and improve ways member states respond to a major attack .
for me , the priorities are to emphasize prevention and to work on consequence of a major attack .
on tuesday the european parliament will debate creating new offenses , like incitement to commit terror over the internet .
has this problem grown in the past few years ?
indeed .
it is very important and i am very much in favor of this piece of legislation .
if it is implemented by the member states , it will allow them to start prosecuting those who mainly use the internet to try to incite hatred and commit terrorist acts .
there are something like 5,000 web sites that call for violence and for committing terrorist acts .
it 's important that we can handle that through criminal law .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de kerchove : eu is fighting for hearts and minds and it is not only that .
we have to develop a counter-narrative as well .
we need to explain that the first victims of all this are the muslims themselves , and that it is a war of ideas .
we have to counter the hijacking of the muslim religion for political purposes .
is germany playing a big role ?
a project where germany has taken a very interesting lead is in monitoring the internet .
it has led to the creation of a portal at europol .
the project is called " check-the-web , " where we try to pull all our information together , and make it accessible to police and intelligence services from all the member states .
i 'm currently working with my german colleagues to see what we can do to speed up that project , and reinforce what we can do together in monitoring the internet .
the internet is vast , fluid , and difficult to control .
can you really get a handle on terror sites overall ?
it is a difficult exercise indeed .
as i said , it is a war of ideas , and we have to win the hearts and minds at the same time .
one thing that is developing on the web - its interesting to see on youtube for instance - more and more people are putting up videos that denigrate osama bin laden .
and in some polls of the muslim world , the support for bin laden , for al qaeda , is declining .
that is something we have to invest in .
you speak about sharing data within europe .
but there are those who argue that could lead to data security problems .
could innocent people become targets of europol or secret services ?
yes , but if it 's the case , i think it will be easily detected .
i recently visited a private company that worked for intelligence services , where they tried to enter into certain chat rooms .
and you know , you do n't enter those chat rooms easily .
you have to build trust , and it can take months before getting a password .
so users who wait for months to get this password are n't innocent people .
how do european institutions , like investigative arm europol and the enforcement arm eurojust , working together ?
it is improving , but a lot more needs to be done .
for instance , not all cases of prosecution or investigation are sent to europol or eurojust , respectively .
so it is important for me to remind member states of this obligation .
it is important for europol and eurojust to be associated with as many joint investigation teams as possible .
they have to show member states their added value , which is important .
and i think in two or three years this will have changed significantly .
does cooperation between european member states work as well as it should ?
there is certainly room for improvement .
but the cooperation is much better than it was five years ago .
just take the recent plots that have been foiled in europe - in barcelona , in denmark , in germany , and in belgium .
in many of these cases it 's due to a closer cooperation between the different intelligence services and police .
we still have to improve the way all the players are sharing information .
it is not that that obvious at the level of the european union , between the intelligence community and the police community .
it does happen at the national level .
in germany you have a platform within which all the players are sharing information . … i am trying to convince all 27 states to all set up a similar platform .
and after that , we need to improve the network between these 27 platforms .

the discussion is increasingly focused on the growing use of the internet as a terror tool , and the threat to data-protection standards in the eu .
dw-world : what are the priorities in the eu 's fight against terrorism at the moment ?
gilles de kerchove : the strategy we adopted in 2005 foresees four main pillars : to prevent people from being radicalized ; to pursue actors and prosecute them ; improve protection of borders ; and improve ways member states respond to a major attack .
for me , the priorities are to emphasize prevention and to work on consequence of a major attack .
on tuesday the european parliament will debate creating new offenses , like incitement to commit terror over the internet .
has this problem grown in the past few years ?
indeed .
it is very important and i am very much in favor of this piece of legislation .
if it is implemented by the member states , it will allow them to start prosecuting those who mainly use the internet to try to incite hatred and commit terrorist acts .
there are something like 5,000 web sites that call for violence and for committing terrorist acts .
it 's important that we can handle that through criminal law .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de kerchove : eu is fighting for hearts and minds and it is not only that .
we have to develop a counter-narrative as well .
we need to explain that the first victims of all this are the muslims themselves , and that it is a war of ideas .
we have to counter the hijacking of the muslim religion for political purposes .
is germany playing a big role ?
a project where germany has taken a very interesting lead is in monitoring the internet .
it has led to the creation of a portal at europol .
the project is called " check-the-web , " where we try to pull all our information together , and make it accessible to police and intelligence services from all the member states .
i 'm currently working with my german colleagues to see what we can do to speed up that project , and reinforce what we can do together in monitoring the internet .
the internet is vast , fluid , and difficult to control .
can you really get a handle on terror sites overall ?
it is a difficult exercise indeed .
as i said , it is a war of ideas , and we have to win the hearts and minds at the same time .
one thing that is developing on the web - its interesting to see on youtube for instance - more and more people are putting up videos that denigrate osama bin laden .
and in some polls of the muslim world , the support for bin laden , for al qaeda , is declining .
that is something we have to invest in .
you speak about sharing data within europe .
but there are those who argue that could lead to data security problems .
could innocent people become targets of europol or secret services ?
yes , but if it 's the case , i think it will be easily detected .
i recently visited a private company that worked for intelligence services , where they tried to enter into certain chat rooms .
and you know , you do n't enter those chat rooms easily .
you have to build trust , and it can take months before getting a password .
so users who wait for months to get this password are n't innocent people .
how do european institutions , like investigative arm europol and the enforcement arm eurojust , working together ?
it is improving , but a lot more needs to be done .
for instance , not all cases of prosecution or investigation are sent to europol or eurojust , respectively .
so it is important for me to remind member states of this obligation .
it is important for europol and eurojust to be associated with as many joint investigation teams as possible .
they have to show member states their added value , which is important .
and i think in two or three years this will have changed significantly .
does cooperation between european member states work as well as it should ?
there is certainly room for improvement .
but the cooperation is much better than it was five years ago .
just take the recent plots that have been foiled in europe - in barcelona , in denmark , in germany , and in belgium .
in many of these cases it 's due to a closer cooperation between the different intelligence services and police .
we still have to improve the way all the players are sharing information .
it is not that that obvious at the level of the european union , between the intelligence community and the police community .
it does happen at the national level .
in germany you have a platform within which all the players are sharing information . … i am trying to convince all 27 states to all set up a similar platform .

“ the sparks of corruption prevention must spread to the middle class , ” head of the ti 's german chapter sylvia schenk said in a statement on tuesday .
“ whoever thinks that morality is separable put his business at risk and sends a ruinous signal to his personnel .
the awareness of personal responsibility must increase . ”
the group urged the german government to take concerted measures to tackle corruption in politics .
it said the world 's view of germany has been damaged by the country 's unwillingness to ratify un initiatives against corruption , schenk said .
mid-level companies are also hesitant to engage in anti-corruption strategies , she added .
the 2008 report lists 180 nations on a scale from zero -lrb- highly corrupt -rrb- to 10 -lrb- highly clean -rrb- based on expert assessments and opinion surveys of public sector corruption .
denmark , new zealand and sweden share the highest score at 9.3 , followed immediately by singapore at 9.2 .
bringing up the rear is somalia at 1.0 , slightly trailing iraq and myanmar at 1.3 and haiti at 1.4 .
the report noted significant declines in the scores of bulgaria , burundi , norway and britain , while strong improvements over last year were identified in cyprus , georgia , nigeria , qatar , south korea and turkey .

" in the poorest countries , corruption levels can mean the difference between life and death , when money for hospitals or clean water is in play , " the organization 's chairperson , huguette labelle said .
" the continuing high levels of corruption and poverty plaguing many of the world 's societies amount to an ongoing humanitarian disaster and can not be tolerated , " she said in presenting the organization 's annual corruption perceptions index in berlin on monday , sept .

" when these institutions are weak , corruption spirals out of control with horrendous consequences for ordinary people , and for justice and equality in societies , " she said .
the anti-corruption guardian also referred to corporate bribery and the questionable methods of companies in acquiring and managing overseas business .

23 .
the lowest rate at which the ecb provided cash to commercial banks was 4.73 percent , a statement said .
on another day which saw strong demand for central bank cash , the ecb 's move showed that tension remained high on money markets used by banks to lend to one another , since the average rate at last week 's auction was 4.58 percent .
ecb rolls over $ 40 billion in one-day loans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a currency swap with the us federal reserve freed up cash the $ 40 billion the ecb provided on tuesday was heading for euro zone banks after the ecb rolled over a one-day loan of us currency obtained in a swap with the us federal reserve .
more than half that amount was provided at a favorable rate of 3.3 percent , the ecb said , adding that demand for the funds was nearly double the amount available .
the central bank 's benchmark lending rate is 4.25 percent .
the offers came as the us congress studied a $ 700-billion rescue plan designed to bail out the country 's troubled financial industry , which is reeling under the weight of bad mortgage loans .
in london , the bank of england also renewed on tuesday its one-day , or overnight , loan offer of $ 40 billion to banking institutions that face funding problems of their own because of the credit crunch .
more instability to come at quarter 's end the ecb announced monday that it forecast renewed tension on euro zone money markets as the end of the third quarter nears and pledges to inject more cash if necessary to keep inter-bank lending on track .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world markets eye the end of the quarter nervously " the ecb continues to closely monitor liquidity conditions and notes some tensions in money market rates over the end-of-quarter , " a statement said .
" as on previous occasions the ecb stands ready to allocate additional liquidity , also by means of additional operations , if needed , " it added .
the end of financial quarters are often times of stress for banks as they close their books and balance their accounts .
last week , the ecb injected a total of 125 billion euros into money markets via three rapid refinancing operations after the us investment bank lehman brothers went into bankruptcy .
on monday , the ecb estimated euro zone banks would need 119 billion euros to meet minimum reserve requirements for the coming week . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not so fast , irwin collier of the john f. kennedy institute at berlin 's free university told dw-world.de. dw-world.de : are european banks going to be able to take advantage of the relief available from the us government ?
irwin collier : the original terms of the bailout were to be limited to domestic us financial institutions .
of course when international financial institutions saw this language , they immediately , as one says , dialed 1-800-paulson , to let the treasury department know that to limit the bailout along national lines is absolutely impossible in a modern globalized economy .
and so the language was changed so that all foreign firms with significant us operations - and there are a lot of them - will be able to participate in the proposed purchase of mortgage-backed securities .
i suspect that might not be the most popular political decision to make in the united states .
the money going toward these foreign financial institutions is us taxpayer money .
looking at the proposed legislation , though , the secretary of the treasury will have enormous discretionary powers to decide which assets will be purchased from which institutions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irwin collier i think one has to remember that the balance of international financial institutions may be eligible , but depending on how many different banks want to feed at the trough at the same time , paulson will have enormous discretion to decide which banks to service first .
german chancellor angela merkel has criticized the bailout plan .
she also said that she had long been trying to push for greater transparency , for tighter regulation in global finance , and that the us and britain had blocked her .
has she been vindicated ?
she certainly has a point , and she was not alone in making it .
there have been many reasonable voices who have been pointing to the fact that financial market contracts and instruments have evolved enormously over the last fifty years , and that the regulatory framework has not kept pace .
but again , having said that , once you have a crisis , it really matters very little who identified the sore points first .
if there 's a financial crisis , in the sense that one bank or one financial institution 's failing could cause another to fail , you have to prop up some of the dominoes so that the crisis does n't get worse .
having principles against bailouts really does n't help you in that situation .
but are the kinds of banking reforms she and others were calling for now going to help cure the situation , or is the sickness too far advanced , so to speak ?
i think the one thing that we can hope for is to see major new kinds of regulation and oversight in the american capital market .
i think what merkel and other leaders have been pushing for is a greater harmonization of regulations , one that would make it more transparent as to what securities issued in one country would be worth in another country .
i think that real harmonization , though , is music of the very far future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel has criticized the us for not implementing more stringent controls the national response on the part of the us will have to come first , and it will certainly be a step in the right direction .
once they do that , we will have a starting point in international negotiations to harmonize regulations .
the financial markets of europe are in a somewhat healthier position than those of the us , at least as yet .
does that mean that europe will have an easier time getting its way in future conversations with us regulators over harmonization ?
i would be very surprised if the relative weights in these sorts of negotiations were to change .
remember , we 're going to see differences between the french , the germans , the british , the italians .
these will come up in a variety of ways , and i just do n't see the initiative passing from new york to a place to be determined in europe .
but could the comparatively conservative practices of german financial institutions , say , be held up as an example of prudence , now that we see how reckless some investors in the us had become ?
i think very much that the rules of prudential banking behavior , these rules that bankers have known and have developed over the years , will be rewarded .
we 'll also see that in the us , the banks that are going to survive this best will be the ones who did n't necessarily push the limits , but rather followed fairly standard procedure , having adequate capital reserves and the like .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 23.09.2008 us bailout first step in long reform process , says economist großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us bank bailout may cheer struggling banks but german politicians are n't amused the chaos in the us has europeans believing they 'll have the upper hand in future regulatory negotiations .
not so fast , irwin collier of the john f. kennedy institute at berlin 's free university told dw-world.de. dw-world.de : are european banks going to be able to take advantage of the relief available from the us government ?
irwin collier : the original terms of the bailout were to be limited to domestic us financial institutions .
of course when international financial institutions saw this language , they immediately , as one says , dialed 1-800-paulson , to let the treasury department know that to limit the bailout along national lines is absolutely impossible in a modern globalized economy .
and so the language was changed so that all foreign firms with significant us operations - and there are a lot of them - will be able to participate in the proposed purchase of mortgage-backed securities .
i suspect that might not be the most popular political decision to make in the united states .
the money going toward these foreign financial institutions is us taxpayer money .
looking at the proposed legislation , though , the secretary of the treasury will have enormous discretionary powers to decide which assets will be purchased from which institutions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irwin collier i think one has to remember that the balance of international financial institutions may be eligible , but depending on how many different banks want to feed at the trough at the same time , paulson will have enormous discretion to decide which banks to service first .
german chancellor angela merkel has criticized the bailout plan .
she also said that she had long been trying to push for greater transparency , for tighter regulation in global finance , and that the us and britain had blocked her .
has she been vindicated ?
she certainly has a point , and she was not alone in making it .
there have been many reasonable voices who have been pointing to the fact that financial market contracts and instruments have evolved enormously over the last fifty years , and that the regulatory framework has not kept pace .
but again , having said that , once you have a crisis , it really matters very little who identified the sore points first .
if there 's a financial crisis , in the sense that one bank or one financial institution 's failing could cause another to fail , you have to prop up some of the dominoes so that the crisis does n't get worse .
having principles against bailouts really does n't help you in that situation .
but are the kinds of banking reforms she and others were calling for now going to help cure the situation , or is the sickness too far advanced , so to speak ?
i think the one thing that we can hope for is to see major new kinds of regulation and oversight in the american capital market .
i think what merkel and other leaders have been pushing for is a greater harmonization of regulations , one that would make it more transparent as to what securities issued in one country would be worth in another country .
i think that real harmonization , though , is music of the very far future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel has criticized the us for not implementing more stringent controls the national response on the part of the us will have to come first , and it will certainly be a step in the right direction .
once they do that , we will have a starting point in international negotiations to harmonize regulations .
the financial markets of europe are in a somewhat healthier position than those of the us , at least as yet .
does that mean that europe will have an easier time getting its way in future conversations with us regulators over harmonization ?
i would be very surprised if the relative weights in these sorts of negotiations were to change .
remember , we 're going to see differences between the french , the germans , the british , the italians .
these will come up in a variety of ways , and i just do n't see the initiative passing from new york to a place to be determined in europe .
but could the comparatively conservative practices of german financial institutions , say , be held up as an example of prudence , now that we see how reckless some investors in the us had become ?
i think very much that the rules of prudential banking behavior , these rules that bankers have known and have developed over the years , will be rewarded .
we 'll also see that in the us , the banks that are going to survive this best will be the ones who did n't necessarily push the limits , but rather followed fairly standard procedure , having adequate capital reserves and the like .
this is not rocket science by a long shot , but is part and parcel of working in markets where trust is absolutely essential . interview : matt hermann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 23.09.2008 sarkozy calls for global summit to overhaul financial system großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy used strong words to criticize what he called the excesses of an unchecked financial system french president sarkozy called tuesday for a summit to tackle the global financial crisis and urged world leaders to draw lessons from capitalist excesses in a speech before the un general assembly . in a hard-hitting speech before the un general assembly in new york on tuesday , sept 23 , french president nicolas sarkozy demanded that those responsible for the global financial turbulence be punished and called for a " regulated capitalism . " " today , millions of people across the world fear for their savings , for their apartment , for the funds they have put in banks .
it is our duty to give them clear answers , " the french president , who chairs the eu 's presidency , said .
" who is responsible for this disaster ?
may those who are responsible be punished and held accountable , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the collapse of the venerable lehman brothers investment bank sent shockwaves around the world in his first public statements on the financial crisis which has rattled world markets and sparked a $ 700 billion us rescue package , sarkozy urged major powers to devise a new form of regulated market economics that would prevent the excesses behind the current credit crisis which felled investment bank lehman brothers . he however did not spell out who was responsible for the global upheaval , how the system should be reformed and why governments in europe and the us did not act earlier to stem the crisis . sarkozy calls for world summit to tackle crisis addressing the 63rd session of the un general assembly which has been dominated by the financial upheaval on wall street , sarkozy urged world leaders to draw lessons from the global financial crisis , rebuild a system that regulates the markets , curb speculation , increase transparency and punish the reckless . " it 's the duty of heads of state and government of the countries most directly concerned to meet before the end of the year to examine together the lessons of the most serious financial crisis the world has experienced since that of the 1930s , " sarkozy said . " let us rebuild together a regulated capitalism in which whole swathes of financial activity are not left to the sole judgment of market operators , in which banks do their job , which is to finance economic development rather than engage in speculation , " sarkozy said . the french leader criticized hedge funds and credit ratings agencies for their roles in the current crisis and denounced pay practices in investment banks . in a press conference afterwards , sarkozy called for a summit in november to deal with the crisis , adding he had in mind a " g8 format , " referring to the eight leading economic powers , that could be opened to " emerging countries . " the g8 is made up of the united states , france , britain , germany , italy , japan , canada and russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been unusually critical of us failures in the present financial chaos speaking in french through an interpreter , sarkozy called for " rules that apply to all and serve to avert and soften shocks instead of exacerbating them . " like sarkozy , other european leaders , chiefly germany 's chancellor angela merkel , have voiced annoyance at what they perceive as us failures to implement more stringent financial controls . both sarkozy and merkel have complained that their calls last year for tighter regulation of the markets were shunted aside by the united states and britain . new economic cooperation with russia separately , speaking on behalf of the 27-member european union , sarkozy also appealed for a " continent-wide economic space " between europe and russia . " what europe is telling russia is that we want links with russia , that we want to build a shared future with russia , we want to be russia 's partner , " sarkozy said .
" why not build a continent-wide economic space which would unite russia and europe ? " he asked . at the same time , sarkozy warned russia after its war with georgia that force can not be used to settle disputes . " europe is also telling russia ... it can not compromise on the principle of states ' sovereignty and independence , their territorial integrity , or respect for international law , " he said ´ . sarkozy brokered a ceasefire to end the conflict between georgia and russia last month , although the united states and eu countries have sharply criticized russia for what they described as its excessive use of force . french leader remains firm on iran sarkozy also said the eu would never tolerate a nuclear-armed iran , " which would endanger the peace and stability of an entire region , nor can it tolerate iran calling for the destruction of ...
israel . " he told reporters that paris fully supported a fourth round of sanctions against iran for refusing to suspend its nuclear enrichment program , but acknowledged that western powers would need russia 's support to pass a new un sanctions resolution . tehran denies western allegations that it 's seeking to develop nuclear weapons . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is our duty to give them clear answers , " the french president , who chairs the eu 's presidency , said .

may those who are responsible be punished and held accountable , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the collapse of the venerable lehman brothers investment bank sent shockwaves around the world in his first public statements on the financial crisis which has rattled world markets and sparked a $ 700 billion us rescue package , sarkozy urged major powers to devise a new form of regulated market economics that would prevent the excesses behind the current credit crisis which felled investment bank lehman brothers . he however did not spell out who was responsible for the global upheaval , how the system should be reformed and why governments in europe and the us did not act earlier to stem the crisis . sarkozy calls for world summit to tackle crisis addressing the 63rd session of the un general assembly which has been dominated by the financial upheaval on wall street , sarkozy urged world leaders to draw lessons from the global financial crisis , rebuild a system that regulates the markets , curb speculation , increase transparency and punish the reckless . " it 's the duty of heads of state and government of the countries most directly concerned to meet before the end of the year to examine together the lessons of the most serious financial crisis the world has experienced since that of the 1930s , " sarkozy said . " let us rebuild together a regulated capitalism in which whole swathes of financial activity are not left to the sole judgment of market operators , in which banks do their job , which is to finance economic development rather than engage in speculation , " sarkozy said . the french leader criticized hedge funds and credit ratings agencies for their roles in the current crisis and denounced pay practices in investment banks . in a press conference afterwards , sarkozy called for a summit in november to deal with the crisis , adding he had in mind a " g8 format , " referring to the eight leading economic powers , that could be opened to " emerging countries .

" what europe is telling russia is that we want links with russia , that we want to build a shared future with russia , we want to be russia 's partner , " sarkozy said .
" why not build a continent-wide economic space which would unite russia and europe ?

" europe is also telling russia ... it can not compromise on the principle of states ' sovereignty and independence , their territorial integrity , or respect for international law , " he said ´ . sarkozy brokered a ceasefire to end the conflict between georgia and russia last month , although the united states and eu countries have sharply criticized russia for what they described as its excessive use of force . french leader remains firm on iran sarkozy also said the eu would never tolerate a nuclear-armed iran , " which would endanger the peace and stability of an entire region , nor can it tolerate iran calling for the destruction of ...

22 , that the financial crisis enveloping advanced economies was no reason to slash foreign aid commitments to the african continent , which is in danger of falling far short of a series of un goals on reducing poverty .
their advice came as world leaders promised a renewed effort to pull africa out of poverty and into the " mainstream of the global economy , " after a one-day united nations conference taking stock of the continent 's progress .
" eradicating poverty , particularly in africa , is the greatest global challenge facing the world today , " read a declaration adopted by the un general assembly monday evening .
more than 40 world leaders took part in the un conference in new york , which came one day before heads of state begin speeches to mark the annual opening of the general assembly .
un secretary general ban ki-moon earlier warned that not one african country was on track to meet all of the un 's millennium development goals , a series of poverty-reducing targets that were adopted in 2000 and were to be met by 2015 .
ban issued a plea for $ 72 billion per year in foreign aid if africa was to have any hope of reaching the un goals .
" this price tag may look daunting .
but it is affordable and falls within existing aid commitments , " ban said , urging the developed world to meet a 2005 pledge to double aid to the continent .
africa rises to challenge but needs help african leaders promised to take the initiative in tackling the continent 's many ongoing problems but warned that they would not be able to get on track without outside help .

kikwete warned that the financial crisis could have " serious implications " on foreign aid commitments but added that he expected the turmoil in the us banking sector to calm down over the coming months .
a series of bankruptcies and massive government bailouts of financial institutions last week in the united states led global stock markets on a roller-coaster ride and sparked concerns that the credit crisis could have far-reaching effects for the global economy .
" we need to prevent our development efforts from being swept away by the tide of financial markets , " said heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , germany 's minister for economic cooperation and development .
africa in urgent need a seven-page political declaration monday evening underlined the " urgency " of meeting africa 's challenges and promised fresh resolve on everything from tackling regional conflicts and disease to addressing food shortages , improving infrastructure and combating the effects of global warming .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy said african and eu stability were intrinsically linked donald kaberuka , president of the african development bank , said that the ongoing financial turmoil showed just how interconnected the world has become .
he quipped that new york 's losses last week showed africa may be a better place to do business than many investors think .
" many more people have lost money in this city than in africa over the past couple of weeks , " kaberuka said .
the evening declaration called on the developed world to meet its 2015 target of committing 0.7 percent of its government budget to development aid .
eu committed to meeting goals french president nicolas sarkozy said that africa had " found its way back to growth " over the last decade , but that the european union heeded the un 's warnings and was committed to meeting the 2015 goal . # b # " the globalized world needs a developed africa , " sarkozy said , adding that europe was " deluding " itself if it believed security and stability were possible for itself without bolstering the economies of its african neighbors .
ban warned that climate change was already having a serious impact on africa .
local conflicts over dwindling natural resources " could spin out of control " if left unchecked , he said .
the world food program issued an appeal monday for nearly $ 500 million to assist 9.6 million ethiopians affected by drought and food prices , which have soared in recent years on world markets .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 23.09.2008 eu anti-terror chief says data sharing is key großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the use of the internet to incite and recruit terrorists is growing dw talked with eu counterterrorism coordinator gilles de kerchove about the successes and pitfalls of europe 's fight against terror , which increasingly involves the internet . the european parliament is debating new plans to combat terrorism , including the creation of new offenses such as recruiting and training terrorists .
the discussion is increasingly focused on the growing use of the internet as a terror tool , and the threat to data-protection standards in the eu .
dw-world : what are the priorities in the eu 's fight against terrorism at the moment ?
gilles de kerchove : the strategy we adopted in 2005 foresees four main pillars : to prevent people from being radicalized ; to pursue actors and prosecute them ; improve protection of borders ; and improve ways member states respond to a major attack .
for me , the priorities are to emphasize prevention and to work on consequence of a major attack .
on tuesday the european parliament will debate creating new offenses , like incitement to commit terror over the internet .
has this problem grown in the past few years ?
indeed .
it is very important and i am very much in favor of this piece of legislation .
if it is implemented by the member states , it will allow them to start prosecuting those who mainly use the internet to try to incite hatred and commit terrorist acts .
there are something like 5,000 web sites that call for violence and for committing terrorist acts .
it 's important that we can handle that through criminal law .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de kerchove : eu is fighting for hearts and minds and it is not only that .
we have to develop a counter-narrative as well .
we need to explain that the first victims of all this are the muslims themselves , and that it is a war of ideas .
we have to counter the hijacking of the muslim religion for political purposes .
is germany playing a big role ?
a project where germany has taken a very interesting lead is in monitoring the internet .
it has led to the creation of a portal at europol .
the project is called " check-the-web , " where we try to pull all our information together , and make it accessible to police and intelligence services from all the member states .
i 'm currently working with my german colleagues to see what we can do to speed up that project , and reinforce what we can do together in monitoring the internet .
the internet is vast , fluid , and difficult to control .
can you really get a handle on terror sites overall ?
it is a difficult exercise indeed .
as i said , it is a war of ideas , and we have to win the hearts and minds at the same time .
one thing that is developing on the web - its interesting to see on youtube for instance - more and more people are putting up videos that denigrate osama bin laden .
and in some polls of the muslim world , the support for bin laden , for al qaeda , is declining .
that is something we have to invest in .
you speak about sharing data within europe .
but there are those who argue that could lead to data security problems .
could innocent people become targets of europol or secret services ?
yes , but if it 's the case , i think it will be easily detected .
i recently visited a private company that worked for intelligence services , where they tried to enter into certain chat rooms .
and you know , you do n't enter those chat rooms easily .
you have to build trust , and it can take months before getting a password .
so users who wait for months to get this password are n't innocent people .
how do european institutions , like investigative arm europol and the enforcement arm eurojust , working together ?
it is improving , but a lot more needs to be done .
for instance , not all cases of prosecution or investigation are sent to europol or eurojust , respectively .
so it is important for me to remind member states of this obligation .
it is important for europol and eurojust to be associated with as many joint investigation teams as possible .
they have to show member states their added value , which is important .
and i think in two or three years this will have changed significantly .
does cooperation between european member states work as well as it should ?
there is certainly room for improvement .
but the cooperation is much better than it was five years ago .
just take the recent plots that have been foiled in europe - in barcelona , in denmark , in germany , and in belgium .
in many of these cases it 's due to a closer cooperation between the different intelligence services and police .
we still have to improve the way all the players are sharing information .
it is not that that obvious at the level of the european union , between the intelligence community and the police community .
it does happen at the national level .
in germany you have a platform within which all the players are sharing information . … i am trying to convince all 27 states to all set up a similar platform .
and after that , we need to improve the network between these 27 platforms .

the discussion is increasingly focused on the growing use of the internet as a terror tool , and the threat to data-protection standards in the eu .
dw-world : what are the priorities in the eu 's fight against terrorism at the moment ?
gilles de kerchove : the strategy we adopted in 2005 foresees four main pillars : to prevent people from being radicalized ; to pursue actors and prosecute them ; improve protection of borders ; and improve ways member states respond to a major attack .
for me , the priorities are to emphasize prevention and to work on consequence of a major attack .
on tuesday the european parliament will debate creating new offenses , like incitement to commit terror over the internet .
has this problem grown in the past few years ?
indeed .
it is very important and i am very much in favor of this piece of legislation .
if it is implemented by the member states , it will allow them to start prosecuting those who mainly use the internet to try to incite hatred and commit terrorist acts .
there are something like 5,000 web sites that call for violence and for committing terrorist acts .
it 's important that we can handle that through criminal law .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de kerchove : eu is fighting for hearts and minds and it is not only that .
we have to develop a counter-narrative as well .
we need to explain that the first victims of all this are the muslims themselves , and that it is a war of ideas .
we have to counter the hijacking of the muslim religion for political purposes .
is germany playing a big role ?
a project where germany has taken a very interesting lead is in monitoring the internet .
it has led to the creation of a portal at europol .
the project is called " check-the-web , " where we try to pull all our information together , and make it accessible to police and intelligence services from all the member states .
i 'm currently working with my german colleagues to see what we can do to speed up that project , and reinforce what we can do together in monitoring the internet .
the internet is vast , fluid , and difficult to control .
can you really get a handle on terror sites overall ?
it is a difficult exercise indeed .
as i said , it is a war of ideas , and we have to win the hearts and minds at the same time .
one thing that is developing on the web - its interesting to see on youtube for instance - more and more people are putting up videos that denigrate osama bin laden .
and in some polls of the muslim world , the support for bin laden , for al qaeda , is declining .
that is something we have to invest in .
you speak about sharing data within europe .
but there are those who argue that could lead to data security problems .
could innocent people become targets of europol or secret services ?
yes , but if it 's the case , i think it will be easily detected .
i recently visited a private company that worked for intelligence services , where they tried to enter into certain chat rooms .
and you know , you do n't enter those chat rooms easily .
you have to build trust , and it can take months before getting a password .
so users who wait for months to get this password are n't innocent people .
how do european institutions , like investigative arm europol and the enforcement arm eurojust , working together ?
it is improving , but a lot more needs to be done .
for instance , not all cases of prosecution or investigation are sent to europol or eurojust , respectively .
so it is important for me to remind member states of this obligation .
it is important for europol and eurojust to be associated with as many joint investigation teams as possible .
they have to show member states their added value , which is important .
and i think in two or three years this will have changed significantly .
does cooperation between european member states work as well as it should ?
there is certainly room for improvement .
but the cooperation is much better than it was five years ago .
just take the recent plots that have been foiled in europe - in barcelona , in denmark , in germany , and in belgium .
in many of these cases it 's due to a closer cooperation between the different intelligence services and police .
we still have to improve the way all the players are sharing information .
it is not that that obvious at the level of the european union , between the intelligence community and the police community .
it does happen at the national level .
in germany you have a platform within which all the players are sharing information . … i am trying to convince all 27 states to all set up a similar platform .
and after that , we need to improve the network between these 27 platforms .

" the federal government is on the side of vw , " the chancellor told an assembly of 18,000 workers at the company 's main plant in wolfsburg , lower saxony on tuesday , sept 23 .
merkel said the state must be allowed to retain its veto rights .
" we will present this view forcefully and in all clarity to the european commission , " she said .
the german government and trade unions see political influence at the huge company as a guarantor of jobs .
lower saxony state premier christian wolf , who was present at the assembly , said volkswagen had become " germany 's most valuable company , " partly as a result of participation by his state .

23 .
the lowest rate at which the ecb provided cash to commercial banks was 4.73 percent , a statement said .
on another day which saw strong demand for central bank cash , the ecb 's move showed that tension remained high on money markets used by banks to lend to one another , since the average rate at last week 's auction was 4.58 percent .
ecb rolls over $ 40 billion in one-day loans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a currency swap with the us federal reserve freed up cash the $ 40 billion the ecb provided on tuesday was heading for euro zone banks after the ecb rolled over a one-day loan of us currency obtained in a swap with the us federal reserve .
more than half that amount was provided at a favorable rate of 3.3 percent , the ecb said , adding that demand for the funds was nearly double the amount available .
the central bank 's benchmark lending rate is 4.25 percent .
the offers came as the us congress studied a $ 700-billion rescue plan designed to bail out the country 's troubled financial industry , which is reeling under the weight of bad mortgage loans .
in london , the bank of england also renewed on tuesday its one-day , or overnight , loan offer of $ 40 billion to banking institutions that face funding problems of their own because of the credit crunch .
more instability to come at quarter 's end the ecb announced monday that it forecast renewed tension on euro zone money markets as the end of the third quarter nears and pledges to inject more cash if necessary to keep inter-bank lending on track .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world markets eye the end of the quarter nervously " the ecb continues to closely monitor liquidity conditions and notes some tensions in money market rates over the end-of-quarter , " a statement said .
" as on previous occasions the ecb stands ready to allocate additional liquidity , also by means of additional operations , if needed , " it added .
the end of financial quarters are often times of stress for banks as they close their books and balance their accounts .
last week , the ecb injected a total of 125 billion euros into money markets via three rapid refinancing operations after the us investment bank lehman brothers went into bankruptcy .
on monday , the ecb estimated euro zone banks would need 119 billion euros to meet minimum reserve requirements for the coming week . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

“ the sparks of corruption prevention must spread to the middle class , ” head of the ti 's german chapter sylvia schenk said in a statement on tuesday .
“ whoever thinks that morality is separable put his business at risk and sends a ruinous signal to his personnel .

the group urged the german government to take concerted measures to tackle corruption in politics .

bringing up the rear is somalia at 1.0 , slightly trailing iraq and myanmar at 1.3 and haiti at 1.4 .
the report noted significant declines in the scores of bulgaria , burundi , norway and britain , while strong improvements over last year were identified in cyprus , georgia , nigeria , qatar , south korea and turkey .

" stemming corruption requires strong oversight through parliaments , law enforcement , independent media and a vibrant civil society , " said labelle .
" when these institutions are weak , corruption spirals out of control with horrendous consequences for ordinary people , and for justice and equality in societies , " she said .
the anti-corruption guardian also referred to corporate bribery and the questionable methods of companies in acquiring and managing overseas business .
' unacceptable double-standard ' " the continuing emergence of foreign bribery scandals indicates a broader failure by the world 's wealthiest countries to live up to the promise of mutual accountability in the fight against corruption , it said .
" this sort of double standard is unacceptable and disregards international legal standards , " said labelle .
" beyond its corrosive effects on the rule of law and public confidence ... it undermines the credibility of the wealthiest nations in calling for greater action to fight corruption by low-income countries .

23 .
the lowest rate at which the ecb provided cash to commercial banks was 4.73 percent , a statement said .
on another day which saw strong demand for central bank cash , the ecb 's move showed that tension remained high on money markets used by banks to lend to one another , since the average rate at last week 's auction was 4.58 percent .
ecb rolls over $ 40 billion in one-day loans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a currency swap with the us federal reserve freed up cash the $ 40 billion the ecb provided on tuesday was heading for euro zone banks after the ecb rolled over a one-day loan of us currency obtained in a swap with the us federal reserve .
more than half that amount was provided at a favorable rate of 3.3 percent , the ecb said , adding that demand for the funds was nearly double the amount available .
the central bank 's benchmark lending rate is 4.25 percent .
the offers came as the us congress studied a $ 700-billion rescue plan designed to bail out the country 's troubled financial industry , which is reeling under the weight of bad mortgage loans .
in london , the bank of england also renewed on tuesday its one-day , or overnight , loan offer of $ 40 billion to banking institutions that face funding problems of their own because of the credit crunch .
more instability to come at quarter 's end the ecb announced monday that it forecast renewed tension on euro zone money markets as the end of the third quarter nears and pledges to inject more cash if necessary to keep inter-bank lending on track .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world markets eye the end of the quarter nervously " the ecb continues to closely monitor liquidity conditions and notes some tensions in money market rates over the end-of-quarter , " a statement said .
" as on previous occasions the ecb stands ready to allocate additional liquidity , also by means of additional operations , if needed , " it added .
the end of financial quarters are often times of stress for banks as they close their books and balance their accounts .
last week , the ecb injected a total of 125 billion euros into money markets via three rapid refinancing operations after the us investment bank lehman brothers went into bankruptcy .
on monday , the ecb estimated euro zone banks would need 119 billion euros to meet minimum reserve requirements for the coming week . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 23.09.2008 eu anti-terror chief says data sharing is key großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the use of the internet to incite and recruit terrorists is growing dw talked with eu counterterrorism coordinator gilles de kerchove about the successes and pitfalls of europe 's fight against terror , which increasingly involves the internet . the european parliament is debating new plans to combat terrorism , including the creation of new offenses such as recruiting and training terrorists .
the discussion is increasingly focused on the growing use of the internet as a terror tool , and the threat to data-protection standards in the eu .
dw-world : what are the priorities in the eu 's fight against terrorism at the moment ?
gilles de kerchove : the strategy we adopted in 2005 foresees four main pillars : to prevent people from being radicalized ; to pursue actors and prosecute them ; improve protection of borders ; and improve ways member states respond to a major attack .
for me , the priorities are to emphasize prevention and to work on consequence of a major attack .
on tuesday the european parliament will debate creating new offenses , like incitement to commit terror over the internet .
has this problem grown in the past few years ?
indeed .
it is very important and i am very much in favor of this piece of legislation .
if it is implemented by the member states , it will allow them to start prosecuting those who mainly use the internet to try to incite hatred and commit terrorist acts .
there are something like 5,000 web sites that call for violence and for committing terrorist acts .
it 's important that we can handle that through criminal law .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de kerchove : eu is fighting for hearts and minds and it is not only that .
we have to develop a counter-narrative as well .
we need to explain that the first victims of all this are the muslims themselves , and that it is a war of ideas .
we have to counter the hijacking of the muslim religion for political purposes .
is germany playing a big role ?
a project where germany has taken a very interesting lead is in monitoring the internet .
it has led to the creation of a portal at europol .
the project is called " check-the-web , " where we try to pull all our information together , and make it accessible to police and intelligence services from all the member states .
i 'm currently working with my german colleagues to see what we can do to speed up that project , and reinforce what we can do together in monitoring the internet .
the internet is vast , fluid , and difficult to control .
can you really get a handle on terror sites overall ?
it is a difficult exercise indeed .
as i said , it is a war of ideas , and we have to win the hearts and minds at the same time .
one thing that is developing on the web - its interesting to see on youtube for instance - more and more people are putting up videos that denigrate osama bin laden .
and in some polls of the muslim world , the support for bin laden , for al qaeda , is declining .
that is something we have to invest in .
you speak about sharing data within europe .
but there are those who argue that could lead to data security problems .
could innocent people become targets of europol or secret services ?
yes , but if it 's the case , i think it will be easily detected .
i recently visited a private company that worked for intelligence services , where they tried to enter into certain chat rooms .
and you know , you do n't enter those chat rooms easily .
you have to build trust , and it can take months before getting a password .
so users who wait for months to get this password are n't innocent people .
how do european institutions , like investigative arm europol and the enforcement arm eurojust , working together ?
it is improving , but a lot more needs to be done .
for instance , not all cases of prosecution or investigation are sent to europol or eurojust , respectively .
so it is important for me to remind member states of this obligation .
it is important for europol and eurojust to be associated with as many joint investigation teams as possible .
they have to show member states their added value , which is important .
and i think in two or three years this will have changed significantly .
does cooperation between european member states work as well as it should ?
there is certainly room for improvement .
but the cooperation is much better than it was five years ago .
just take the recent plots that have been foiled in europe - in barcelona , in denmark , in germany , and in belgium .
in many of these cases it 's due to a closer cooperation between the different intelligence services and police .
we still have to improve the way all the players are sharing information .
it is not that that obvious at the level of the european union , between the intelligence community and the police community .
it does happen at the national level .
in germany you have a platform within which all the players are sharing information . … i am trying to convince all 27 states to all set up a similar platform .
and after that , we need to improve the network between these 27 platforms .
that is an indirect way to implement the concept of availability , the information-sharing environment that the report of the 9/11 commission in the united states considered to be the top lesson learned from 9/11 . interview : anke hagedorn -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

gilles de kerchove : the strategy we adopted in 2005 foresees four main pillars : to prevent people from being radicalized ; to pursue actors and prosecute them ; improve protection of borders ; and improve ways member states respond to a major attack .
for me , the priorities are to emphasize prevention and to work on consequence of a major attack .
on tuesday the european parliament will debate creating new offenses , like incitement to commit terror over the internet .
has this problem grown in the past few years ?
indeed .
it is very important and i am very much in favor of this piece of legislation .
if it is implemented by the member states , it will allow them to start prosecuting those who mainly use the internet to try to incite hatred and commit terrorist acts .
there are something like 5,000 web sites that call for violence and for committing terrorist acts .
it 's important that we can handle that through criminal law .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de kerchove : eu is fighting for hearts and minds and it is not only that .
we have to develop a counter-narrative as well .
we need to explain that the first victims of all this are the muslims themselves , and that it is a war of ideas .
we have to counter the hijacking of the muslim religion for political purposes .
is germany playing a big role ?
a project where germany has taken a very interesting lead is in monitoring the internet .
it has led to the creation of a portal at europol .
the project is called " check-the-web , " where we try to pull all our information together , and make it accessible to police and intelligence services from all the member states .
i 'm currently working with my german colleagues to see what we can do to speed up that project , and reinforce what we can do together in monitoring the internet .
the internet is vast , fluid , and difficult to control .
can you really get a handle on terror sites overall ?
it is a difficult exercise indeed .
as i said , it is a war of ideas , and we have to win the hearts and minds at the same time .
one thing that is developing on the web - its interesting to see on youtube for instance - more and more people are putting up videos that denigrate osama bin laden .
and in some polls of the muslim world , the support for bin laden , for al qaeda , is declining .
that is something we have to invest in .
you speak about sharing data within europe .
but there are those who argue that could lead to data security problems .
could innocent people become targets of europol or secret services ?
yes , but if it 's the case , i think it will be easily detected .
i recently visited a private company that worked for intelligence services , where they tried to enter into certain chat rooms .
and you know , you do n't enter those chat rooms easily .
you have to build trust , and it can take months before getting a password .
so users who wait for months to get this password are n't innocent people .
how do european institutions , like investigative arm europol and the enforcement arm eurojust , working together ?
it is improving , but a lot more needs to be done .
for instance , not all cases of prosecution or investigation are sent to europol or eurojust , respectively .
so it is important for me to remind member states of this obligation .
it is important for europol and eurojust to be associated with as many joint investigation teams as possible .
they have to show member states their added value , which is important .
and i think in two or three years this will have changed significantly .
does cooperation between european member states work as well as it should ?
there is certainly room for improvement .
but the cooperation is much better than it was five years ago .
just take the recent plots that have been foiled in europe - in barcelona , in denmark , in germany , and in belgium .
in many of these cases it 's due to a closer cooperation between the different intelligence services and police .
we still have to improve the way all the players are sharing information .
it is not that that obvious at the level of the european union , between the intelligence community and the police community .
it does happen at the national level .
in germany you have a platform within which all the players are sharing information . … i am trying to convince all 27 states to all set up a similar platform .
and after that , we need to improve the network between these 27 platforms .

the discussion is increasingly focused on the growing use of the internet as a terror tool , and the threat to data-protection standards in the eu .
dw-world : what are the priorities in the eu 's fight against terrorism at the moment ?
gilles de kerchove : the strategy we adopted in 2005 foresees four main pillars : to prevent people from being radicalized ; to pursue actors and prosecute them ; improve protection of borders ; and improve ways member states respond to a major attack .
for me , the priorities are to emphasize prevention and to work on consequence of a major attack .
on tuesday the european parliament will debate creating new offenses , like incitement to commit terror over the internet .
has this problem grown in the past few years ?
indeed .
it is very important and i am very much in favor of this piece of legislation .
if it is implemented by the member states , it will allow them to start prosecuting those who mainly use the internet to try to incite hatred and commit terrorist acts .
there are something like 5,000 web sites that call for violence and for committing terrorist acts .
it 's important that we can handle that through criminal law .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de kerchove : eu is fighting for hearts and minds and it is not only that .
we have to develop a counter-narrative as well .
we need to explain that the first victims of all this are the muslims themselves , and that it is a war of ideas .
we have to counter the hijacking of the muslim religion for political purposes .
is germany playing a big role ?
a project where germany has taken a very interesting lead is in monitoring the internet .
it has led to the creation of a portal at europol .
the project is called " check-the-web , " where we try to pull all our information together , and make it accessible to police and intelligence services from all the member states .
i 'm currently working with my german colleagues to see what we can do to speed up that project , and reinforce what we can do together in monitoring the internet .
the internet is vast , fluid , and difficult to control .
can you really get a handle on terror sites overall ?
it is a difficult exercise indeed .
as i said , it is a war of ideas , and we have to win the hearts and minds at the same time .
one thing that is developing on the web - its interesting to see on youtube for instance - more and more people are putting up videos that denigrate osama bin laden .
and in some polls of the muslim world , the support for bin laden , for al qaeda , is declining .
that is something we have to invest in .
you speak about sharing data within europe .
but there are those who argue that could lead to data security problems .
could innocent people become targets of europol or secret services ?
yes , but if it 's the case , i think it will be easily detected .
i recently visited a private company that worked for intelligence services , where they tried to enter into certain chat rooms .
and you know , you do n't enter those chat rooms easily .
you have to build trust , and it can take months before getting a password .
so users who wait for months to get this password are n't innocent people .
how do european institutions , like investigative arm europol and the enforcement arm eurojust , working together ?
it is improving , but a lot more needs to be done .
for instance , not all cases of prosecution or investigation are sent to europol or eurojust , respectively .
so it is important for me to remind member states of this obligation .
it is important for europol and eurojust to be associated with as many joint investigation teams as possible .
they have to show member states their added value , which is important .
and i think in two or three years this will have changed significantly .
does cooperation between european member states work as well as it should ?
there is certainly room for improvement .
but the cooperation is much better than it was five years ago .
just take the recent plots that have been foiled in europe - in barcelona , in denmark , in germany , and in belgium .
in many of these cases it 's due to a closer cooperation between the different intelligence services and police .
we still have to improve the way all the players are sharing information .
it is not that that obvious at the level of the european union , between the intelligence community and the police community .
it does happen at the national level .
in germany you have a platform within which all the players are sharing information . … i am trying to convince all 27 states to all set up a similar platform .
and after that , we need to improve the network between these 27 platforms .

22 , that the financial crisis enveloping advanced economies was no reason to slash foreign aid commitments to the african continent , which is in danger of falling far short of a series of un goals on reducing poverty .
their advice came as world leaders promised a renewed effort to pull africa out of poverty and into the " mainstream of the global economy , " after a one-day united nations conference taking stock of the continent 's progress .
" eradicating poverty , particularly in africa , is the greatest global challenge facing the world today , " read a declaration adopted by the un general assembly monday evening .
more than 40 world leaders took part in the un conference in new york , which came one day before heads of state begin speeches to mark the annual opening of the general assembly .
un secretary general ban ki-moon earlier warned that not one african country was on track to meet all of the un 's millennium development goals , a series of poverty-reducing targets that were adopted in 2000 and were to be met by 2015 .
ban issued a plea for $ 72 billion per year in foreign aid if africa was to have any hope of reaching the un goals .
" this price tag may look daunting .
but it is affordable and falls within existing aid commitments , " ban said , urging the developed world to meet a 2005 pledge to double aid to the continent .
africa rises to challenge but needs help african leaders promised to take the initiative in tackling the continent 's many ongoing problems but warned that they would not be able to get on track without outside help .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the effects of the financial crash have been felt globally " we want developed countries to deliver " on their promises of more aid , tanzanian president jakaya kikwete , chairman of the african union , said at a press conference in new york .
kikwete warned that the financial crisis could have " serious implications " on foreign aid commitments but added that he expected the turmoil in the us banking sector to calm down over the coming months .
a series of bankruptcies and massive government bailouts of financial institutions last week in the united states led global stock markets on a roller-coaster ride and sparked concerns that the credit crisis could have far-reaching effects for the global economy .
" we need to prevent our development efforts from being swept away by the tide of financial markets , " said heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , germany 's minister for economic cooperation and development .
africa in urgent need a seven-page political declaration monday evening underlined the " urgency " of meeting africa 's challenges and promised fresh resolve on everything from tackling regional conflicts and disease to addressing food shortages , improving infrastructure and combating the effects of global warming .
" now comes the hard part - keeping the promises , " said miguel d 'escoto brockmann , the general assembly 's new president .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy said african and eu stability were intrinsically linked donald kaberuka , president of the african development bank , said that the ongoing financial turmoil showed just how interconnected the world has become .
he quipped that new york 's losses last week showed africa may be a better place to do business than many investors think .
" many more people have lost money in this city than in africa over the past couple of weeks , " kaberuka said .
the evening declaration called on the developed world to meet its 2015 target of committing 0.7 percent of its government budget to development aid .
eu committed to meeting goals french president nicolas sarkozy said that africa had " found its way back to growth " over the last decade , but that the european union heeded the un 's warnings and was committed to meeting the 2015 goal . # b # " the globalized world needs a developed africa , " sarkozy said , adding that europe was " deluding " itself if it believed security and stability were possible for itself without bolstering the economies of its african neighbors .
ban warned that climate change was already having a serious impact on africa .
local conflicts over dwindling natural resources " could spin out of control " if left unchecked , he said .
the world food program issued an appeal monday for nearly $ 500 million to assist 9.6 million ethiopians affected by drought and food prices , which have soared in recent years on world markets .

" " today , millions of people across the world fear for their savings , for their apartment , for the funds they have put in banks .
it is our duty to give them clear answers , " the french president , who chairs the eu 's presidency , said .
" who is responsible for this disaster ?
may those who are responsible be punished and held accountable , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the collapse of the venerable lehman brothers investment bank sent shockwaves around the world in his first public statements on the financial crisis which has rattled world markets and sparked a $ 700 billion us rescue package , sarkozy urged major powers to devise a new form of regulated market economics that would prevent the excesses behind the current credit crisis which felled investment bank lehman brothers . he however did not spell out who was responsible for the global upheaval , how the system should be reformed and why governments in europe and the us did not act earlier to stem the crisis . sarkozy calls for world summit to tackle crisis addressing the 63rd session of the un general assembly which has been dominated by the financial upheaval on wall street , sarkozy urged world leaders to draw lessons from the global financial crisis , rebuild a system that regulates the markets , curb speculation , increase transparency and punish the reckless . " it 's the duty of heads of state and government of the countries most directly concerned to meet before the end of the year to examine together the lessons of the most serious financial crisis the world has experienced since that of the 1930s , " sarkozy said . " let us rebuild together a regulated capitalism in which whole swathes of financial activity are not left to the sole judgment of market operators , in which banks do their job , which is to finance economic development rather than engage in speculation , " sarkozy said . the french leader criticized hedge funds and credit ratings agencies for their roles in the current crisis and denounced pay practices in investment banks . in a press conference afterwards , sarkozy called for a summit in november to deal with the crisis , adding he had in mind a " g8 format , " referring to the eight leading economic powers , that could be opened to " emerging countries . " the g8 is made up of the united states , france , britain , germany , italy , japan , canada and russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been unusually critical of us failures in the present financial chaos speaking in french through an interpreter , sarkozy called for " rules that apply to all and serve to avert and soften shocks instead of exacerbating them . " like sarkozy , other european leaders , chiefly germany 's chancellor angela merkel , have voiced annoyance at what they perceive as us failures to implement more stringent financial controls . both sarkozy and merkel have complained that their calls last year for tighter regulation of the markets were shunted aside by the united states and britain . new economic cooperation with russia separately , speaking on behalf of the 27-member european union , sarkozy also appealed for a " continent-wide economic space " between europe and russia . " what europe is telling russia is that we want links with russia , that we want to build a shared future with russia , we want to be russia 's partner , " sarkozy said .
" why not build a continent-wide economic space which would unite russia and europe ? " he asked . at the same time , sarkozy warned russia after its war with georgia that force can not be used to settle disputes . " europe is also telling russia ... it can not compromise on the principle of states ' sovereignty and independence , their territorial integrity , or respect for international law , " he said ´ . sarkozy brokered a ceasefire to end the conflict between georgia and russia last month , although the united states and eu countries have sharply criticized russia for what they described as its excessive use of force . french leader remains firm on iran sarkozy also said the eu would never tolerate a nuclear-armed iran , " which would endanger the peace and stability of an entire region , nor can it tolerate iran calling for the destruction of ...

" " today , millions of people across the world fear for their savings , for their apartment , for the funds they have put in banks .
it is our duty to give them clear answers , " the french president , who chairs the eu 's presidency , said .

" it 's the duty of heads of state and government of the countries most directly concerned to meet before the end of the year to examine together the lessons of the most serious financial crisis the world has experienced since that of the 1930s , " sarkozy said . " let us rebuild together a regulated capitalism in which whole swathes of financial activity are not left to the sole judgment of market operators , in which banks do their job , which is to finance economic development rather than engage in speculation , " sarkozy said . the french leader criticized hedge funds and credit ratings agencies for their roles in the current crisis and denounced pay practices in investment banks . in a press conference afterwards , sarkozy called for a summit in november to deal with the crisis , adding he had in mind a " g8 format , " referring to the eight leading economic powers , that could be opened to " emerging countries .

" like sarkozy , other european leaders , chiefly germany 's chancellor angela merkel , have voiced annoyance at what they perceive as us failures to implement more stringent financial controls . both sarkozy and merkel have complained that their calls last year for tighter regulation of the markets were shunted aside by the united states and britain . new economic cooperation with russia separately , speaking on behalf of the 27-member european union , sarkozy also appealed for a " continent-wide economic space " between europe and russia . " what europe is telling russia is that we want links with russia , that we want to build a shared future with russia , we want to be russia 's partner , " sarkozy said .
" why not build a continent-wide economic space which would unite russia and europe ? " he asked . at the same time , sarkozy warned russia after its war with georgia that force can not be used to settle disputes . " europe is also telling russia ... it can not compromise on the principle of states ' sovereignty and independence , their territorial integrity , or respect for international law , " he said ´ . sarkozy brokered a ceasefire to end the conflict between georgia and russia last month , although the united states and eu countries have sharply criticized russia for what they described as its excessive use of force . french leader remains firm on iran sarkozy also said the eu would never tolerate a nuclear-armed iran , " which would endanger the peace and stability of an entire region , nor can it tolerate iran calling for the destruction of ...

not so fast , irwin collier of the john f. kennedy institute at berlin 's free university told dw-world.de. dw-world.de : are european banks going to be able to take advantage of the relief available from the us government ?
irwin collier : the original terms of the bailout were to be limited to domestic us financial institutions .
of course when international financial institutions saw this language , they immediately , as one says , dialed 1-800-paulson , to let the treasury department know that to limit the bailout along national lines is absolutely impossible in a modern globalized economy .
and so the language was changed so that all foreign firms with significant us operations - and there are a lot of them - will be able to participate in the proposed purchase of mortgage-backed securities .
i suspect that might not be the most popular political decision to make in the united states .
the money going toward these foreign financial institutions is us taxpayer money .
looking at the proposed legislation , though , the secretary of the treasury will have enormous discretionary powers to decide which assets will be purchased from which institutions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irwin collier i think one has to remember that the balance of international financial institutions may be eligible , but depending on how many different banks want to feed at the trough at the same time , paulson will have enormous discretion to decide which banks to service first .
german chancellor angela merkel has criticized the bailout plan .
she also said that she had long been trying to push for greater transparency , for tighter regulation in global finance , and that the us and britain had blocked her .
has she been vindicated ?
she certainly has a point , and she was not alone in making it .
there have been many reasonable voices who have been pointing to the fact that financial market contracts and instruments have evolved enormously over the last fifty years , and that the regulatory framework has not kept pace .
but again , having said that , once you have a crisis , it really matters very little who identified the sore points first .
if there 's a financial crisis , in the sense that one bank or one financial institution 's failing could cause another to fail , you have to prop up some of the dominoes so that the crisis does n't get worse .
having principles against bailouts really does n't help you in that situation .
but are the kinds of banking reforms she and others were calling for now going to help cure the situation , or is the sickness too far advanced , so to speak ?
i think the one thing that we can hope for is to see major new kinds of regulation and oversight in the american capital market .
i think what merkel and other leaders have been pushing for is a greater harmonization of regulations , one that would make it more transparent as to what securities issued in one country would be worth in another country .
i think that real harmonization , though , is music of the very far future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel has criticized the us for not implementing more stringent controls the national response on the part of the us will have to come first , and it will certainly be a step in the right direction .
once they do that , we will have a starting point in international negotiations to harmonize regulations .
the financial markets of europe are in a somewhat healthier position than those of the us , at least as yet .
does that mean that europe will have an easier time getting its way in future conversations with us regulators over harmonization ?
i would be very surprised if the relative weights in these sorts of negotiations were to change .
remember , we 're going to see differences between the french , the germans , the british , the italians .
these will come up in a variety of ways , and i just do n't see the initiative passing from new york to a place to be determined in europe .
but could the comparatively conservative practices of german financial institutions , say , be held up as an example of prudence , now that we see how reckless some investors in the us had become ?
i think very much that the rules of prudential banking behavior , these rules that bankers have known and have developed over the years , will be rewarded .
we 'll also see that in the us , the banks that are going to survive this best will be the ones who did n't necessarily push the limits , but rather followed fairly standard procedure , having adequate capital reserves and the like .
this is not rocket science by a long shot , but is part and parcel of working in markets where trust is absolutely essential . interview : matt hermann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

of course when international financial institutions saw this language , they immediately , as one says , dialed 1-800-paulson , to let the treasury department know that to limit the bailout along national lines is absolutely impossible in a modern globalized economy .

not so fast , irwin collier of the john f. kennedy institute at berlin 's free university told dw-world.de. dw-world.de : are european banks going to be able to take advantage of the relief available from the us government ?
irwin collier : the original terms of the bailout were to be limited to domestic us financial institutions .
of course when international financial institutions saw this language , they immediately , as one says , dialed 1-800-paulson , to let the treasury department know that to limit the bailout along national lines is absolutely impossible in a modern globalized economy .
and so the language was changed so that all foreign firms with significant us operations - and there are a lot of them - will be able to participate in the proposed purchase of mortgage-backed securities .
i suspect that might not be the most popular political decision to make in the united states .
the money going toward these foreign financial institutions is us taxpayer money .
looking at the proposed legislation , though , the secretary of the treasury will have enormous discretionary powers to decide which assets will be purchased from which institutions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irwin collier i think one has to remember that the balance of international financial institutions may be eligible , but depending on how many different banks want to feed at the trough at the same time , paulson will have enormous discretion to decide which banks to service first .
german chancellor angela merkel has criticized the bailout plan .
she also said that she had long been trying to push for greater transparency , for tighter regulation in global finance , and that the us and britain had blocked her .
has she been vindicated ?
she certainly has a point , and she was not alone in making it .
there have been many reasonable voices who have been pointing to the fact that financial market contracts and instruments have evolved enormously over the last fifty years , and that the regulatory framework has not kept pace .
but again , having said that , once you have a crisis , it really matters very little who identified the sore points first .
if there 's a financial crisis , in the sense that one bank or one financial institution 's failing could cause another to fail , you have to prop up some of the dominoes so that the crisis does n't get worse .
having principles against bailouts really does n't help you in that situation .
but are the kinds of banking reforms she and others were calling for now going to help cure the situation , or is the sickness too far advanced , so to speak ?
i think the one thing that we can hope for is to see major new kinds of regulation and oversight in the american capital market .
i think what merkel and other leaders have been pushing for is a greater harmonization of regulations , one that would make it more transparent as to what securities issued in one country would be worth in another country .
i think that real harmonization , though , is music of the very far future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel has criticized the us for not implementing more stringent controls the national response on the part of the us will have to come first , and it will certainly be a step in the right direction .

23 .
the lowest rate at which the ecb provided cash to commercial banks was 4.73 percent , a statement said .
on another day which saw strong demand for central bank cash , the ecb 's move showed that tension remained high on money markets used by banks to lend to one another , since the average rate at last week 's auction was 4.58 percent .
ecb rolls over $ 40 billion in one-day loans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a currency swap with the us federal reserve freed up cash the $ 40 billion the ecb provided on tuesday was heading for euro zone banks after the ecb rolled over a one-day loan of us currency obtained in a swap with the us federal reserve .
more than half that amount was provided at a favorable rate of 3.3 percent , the ecb said , adding that demand for the funds was nearly double the amount available .
the central bank 's benchmark lending rate is 4.25 percent .
the offers came as the us congress studied a $ 700-billion rescue plan designed to bail out the country 's troubled financial industry , which is reeling under the weight of bad mortgage loans .
in london , the bank of england also renewed on tuesday its one-day , or overnight , loan offer of $ 40 billion to banking institutions that face funding problems of their own because of the credit crunch .
more instability to come at quarter 's end the ecb announced monday that it forecast renewed tension on euro zone money markets as the end of the third quarter nears and pledges to inject more cash if necessary to keep inter-bank lending on track .

" as on previous occasions the ecb stands ready to allocate additional liquidity , also by means of additional operations , if needed , " it added .
the end of financial quarters are often times of stress for banks as they close their books and balance their accounts .
last week , the ecb injected a total of 125 billion euros into money markets via three rapid refinancing operations after the us investment bank lehman brothers went into bankruptcy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 23.09.2008 us bailout first step in long reform process , says economist großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us bank bailout may cheer struggling banks but german politicians are n't amused the chaos in the us has europeans believing they 'll have the upper hand in future regulatory negotiations .
not so fast , irwin collier of the john f. kennedy institute at berlin 's free university told dw-world.de. dw-world.de : are european banks going to be able to take advantage of the relief available from the us government ?
irwin collier : the original terms of the bailout were to be limited to domestic us financial institutions .
of course when international financial institutions saw this language , they immediately , as one says , dialed 1-800-paulson , to let the treasury department know that to limit the bailout along national lines is absolutely impossible in a modern globalized economy .
and so the language was changed so that all foreign firms with significant us operations - and there are a lot of them - will be able to participate in the proposed purchase of mortgage-backed securities .
i suspect that might not be the most popular political decision to make in the united states .
the money going toward these foreign financial institutions is us taxpayer money .
looking at the proposed legislation , though , the secretary of the treasury will have enormous discretionary powers to decide which assets will be purchased from which institutions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irwin collier i think one has to remember that the balance of international financial institutions may be eligible , but depending on how many different banks want to feed at the trough at the same time , paulson will have enormous discretion to decide which banks to service first .
german chancellor angela merkel has criticized the bailout plan .
she also said that she had long been trying to push for greater transparency , for tighter regulation in global finance , and that the us and britain had blocked her .
has she been vindicated ?
she certainly has a point , and she was not alone in making it .
there have been many reasonable voices who have been pointing to the fact that financial market contracts and instruments have evolved enormously over the last fifty years , and that the regulatory framework has not kept pace .
but again , having said that , once you have a crisis , it really matters very little who identified the sore points first .
if there 's a financial crisis , in the sense that one bank or one financial institution 's failing could cause another to fail , you have to prop up some of the dominoes so that the crisis does n't get worse .
having principles against bailouts really does n't help you in that situation .
but are the kinds of banking reforms she and others were calling for now going to help cure the situation , or is the sickness too far advanced , so to speak ?
i think the one thing that we can hope for is to see major new kinds of regulation and oversight in the american capital market .
i think what merkel and other leaders have been pushing for is a greater harmonization of regulations , one that would make it more transparent as to what securities issued in one country would be worth in another country .
i think that real harmonization , though , is music of the very far future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel has criticized the us for not implementing more stringent controls the national response on the part of the us will have to come first , and it will certainly be a step in the right direction .
once they do that , we will have a starting point in international negotiations to harmonize regulations .
the financial markets of europe are in a somewhat healthier position than those of the us , at least as yet .

not so fast , irwin collier of the john f. kennedy institute at berlin 's free university told dw-world.de. dw-world.de : are european banks going to be able to take advantage of the relief available from the us government ?
irwin collier : the original terms of the bailout were to be limited to domestic us financial institutions .
of course when international financial institutions saw this language , they immediately , as one says , dialed 1-800-paulson , to let the treasury department know that to limit the bailout along national lines is absolutely impossible in a modern globalized economy .
and so the language was changed so that all foreign firms with significant us operations - and there are a lot of them - will be able to participate in the proposed purchase of mortgage-backed securities .
i suspect that might not be the most popular political decision to make in the united states .
the money going toward these foreign financial institutions is us taxpayer money .
looking at the proposed legislation , though , the secretary of the treasury will have enormous discretionary powers to decide which assets will be purchased from which institutions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irwin collier i think one has to remember that the balance of international financial institutions may be eligible , but depending on how many different banks want to feed at the trough at the same time , paulson will have enormous discretion to decide which banks to service first .
german chancellor angela merkel has criticized the bailout plan .
she also said that she had long been trying to push for greater transparency , for tighter regulation in global finance , and that the us and britain had blocked her .
has she been vindicated ?
she certainly has a point , and she was not alone in making it .
there have been many reasonable voices who have been pointing to the fact that financial market contracts and instruments have evolved enormously over the last fifty years , and that the regulatory framework has not kept pace .
but again , having said that , once you have a crisis , it really matters very little who identified the sore points first .
if there 's a financial crisis , in the sense that one bank or one financial institution 's failing could cause another to fail , you have to prop up some of the dominoes so that the crisis does n't get worse .
having principles against bailouts really does n't help you in that situation .
but are the kinds of banking reforms she and others were calling for now going to help cure the situation , or is the sickness too far advanced , so to speak ?
i think the one thing that we can hope for is to see major new kinds of regulation and oversight in the american capital market .
i think what merkel and other leaders have been pushing for is a greater harmonization of regulations , one that would make it more transparent as to what securities issued in one country would be worth in another country .
i think that real harmonization , though , is music of the very far future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel has criticized the us for not implementing more stringent controls the national response on the part of the us will have to come first , and it will certainly be a step in the right direction .
once they do that , we will have a starting point in international negotiations to harmonize regulations .
the financial markets of europe are in a somewhat healthier position than those of the us , at least as yet .
does that mean that europe will have an easier time getting its way in future conversations with us regulators over harmonization ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 23.09.2008 us bailout first step in long reform process , says economist großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us bank bailout may cheer struggling banks but german politicians are n't amused the chaos in the us has europeans believing they 'll have the upper hand in future regulatory negotiations .
not so fast , irwin collier of the john f. kennedy institute at berlin 's free university told dw-world.de. dw-world.de : are european banks going to be able to take advantage of the relief available from the us government ?
irwin collier : the original terms of the bailout were to be limited to domestic us financial institutions .
of course when international financial institutions saw this language , they immediately , as one says , dialed 1-800-paulson , to let the treasury department know that to limit the bailout along national lines is absolutely impossible in a modern globalized economy .
and so the language was changed so that all foreign firms with significant us operations - and there are a lot of them - will be able to participate in the proposed purchase of mortgage-backed securities .
i suspect that might not be the most popular political decision to make in the united states .
the money going toward these foreign financial institutions is us taxpayer money .
looking at the proposed legislation , though , the secretary of the treasury will have enormous discretionary powers to decide which assets will be purchased from which institutions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irwin collier i think one has to remember that the balance of international financial institutions may be eligible , but depending on how many different banks want to feed at the trough at the same time , paulson will have enormous discretion to decide which banks to service first .
german chancellor angela merkel has criticized the bailout plan .
she also said that she had long been trying to push for greater transparency , for tighter regulation in global finance , and that the us and britain had blocked her .
has she been vindicated ?
she certainly has a point , and she was not alone in making it .
there have been many reasonable voices who have been pointing to the fact that financial market contracts and instruments have evolved enormously over the last fifty years , and that the regulatory framework has not kept pace .
but again , having said that , once you have a crisis , it really matters very little who identified the sore points first .
if there 's a financial crisis , in the sense that one bank or one financial institution 's failing could cause another to fail , you have to prop up some of the dominoes so that the crisis does n't get worse .
having principles against bailouts really does n't help you in that situation .
but are the kinds of banking reforms she and others were calling for now going to help cure the situation , or is the sickness too far advanced , so to speak ?
i think the one thing that we can hope for is to see major new kinds of regulation and oversight in the american capital market .
i think what merkel and other leaders have been pushing for is a greater harmonization of regulations , one that would make it more transparent as to what securities issued in one country would be worth in another country .
i think that real harmonization , though , is music of the very far future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel has criticized the us for not implementing more stringent controls the national response on the part of the us will have to come first , and it will certainly be a step in the right direction .
once they do that , we will have a starting point in international negotiations to harmonize regulations .
the financial markets of europe are in a somewhat healthier position than those of the us , at least as yet .
does that mean that europe will have an easier time getting its way in future conversations with us regulators over harmonization ?
i would be very surprised if the relative weights in these sorts of negotiations were to change .
remember , we 're going to see differences between the french , the germans , the british , the italians .
these will come up in a variety of ways , and i just do n't see the initiative passing from new york to a place to be determined in europe .
but could the comparatively conservative practices of german financial institutions , say , be held up as an example of prudence , now that we see how reckless some investors in the us had become ?
i think very much that the rules of prudential banking behavior , these rules that bankers have known and have developed over the years , will be rewarded .
we 'll also see that in the us , the banks that are going to survive this best will be the ones who did n't necessarily push the limits , but rather followed fairly standard procedure , having adequate capital reserves and the like .

22 , that the financial crisis enveloping advanced economies was no reason to slash foreign aid commitments to the african continent , which is in danger of falling far short of a series of un goals on reducing poverty .
their advice came as world leaders promised a renewed effort to pull africa out of poverty and into the " mainstream of the global economy , " after a one-day united nations conference taking stock of the continent 's progress .
" eradicating poverty , particularly in africa , is the greatest global challenge facing the world today , " read a declaration adopted by the un general assembly monday evening .
more than 40 world leaders took part in the un conference in new york , which came one day before heads of state begin speeches to mark the annual opening of the general assembly .
un secretary general ban ki-moon earlier warned that not one african country was on track to meet all of the un 's millennium development goals , a series of poverty-reducing targets that were adopted in 2000 and were to be met by 2015 .
ban issued a plea for $ 72 billion per year in foreign aid if africa was to have any hope of reaching the un goals .
" this price tag may look daunting .

kikwete warned that the financial crisis could have " serious implications " on foreign aid commitments but added that he expected the turmoil in the us banking sector to calm down over the coming months .
a series of bankruptcies and massive government bailouts of financial institutions last week in the united states led global stock markets on a roller-coaster ride and sparked concerns that the credit crisis could have far-reaching effects for the global economy .

" many more people have lost money in this city than in africa over the past couple of weeks , " kaberuka said .
the evening declaration called on the developed world to meet its 2015 target of committing 0.7 percent of its government budget to development aid .
eu committed to meeting goals french president nicolas sarkozy said that africa had " found its way back to growth " over the last decade , but that the european union heeded the un 's warnings and was committed to meeting the 2015 goal . # b # " the globalized world needs a developed africa , " sarkozy said , adding that europe was " deluding " itself if it believed security and stability were possible for itself without bolstering the economies of its african neighbors .

22 , that the financial crisis enveloping advanced economies was no reason to slash foreign aid commitments to the african continent , which is in danger of falling far short of a series of un goals on reducing poverty .
their advice came as world leaders promised a renewed effort to pull africa out of poverty and into the " mainstream of the global economy , " after a one-day united nations conference taking stock of the continent 's progress .
" eradicating poverty , particularly in africa , is the greatest global challenge facing the world today , " read a declaration adopted by the un general assembly monday evening .
more than 40 world leaders took part in the un conference in new york , which came one day before heads of state begin speeches to mark the annual opening of the general assembly .
un secretary general ban ki-moon earlier warned that not one african country was on track to meet all of the un 's millennium development goals , a series of poverty-reducing targets that were adopted in 2000 and were to be met by 2015 .
ban issued a plea for $ 72 billion per year in foreign aid if africa was to have any hope of reaching the un goals .
" this price tag may look daunting .
but it is affordable and falls within existing aid commitments , " ban said , urging the developed world to meet a 2005 pledge to double aid to the continent .
africa rises to challenge but needs help african leaders promised to take the initiative in tackling the continent 's many ongoing problems but warned that they would not be able to get on track without outside help .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the effects of the financial crash have been felt globally " we want developed countries to deliver " on their promises of more aid , tanzanian president jakaya kikwete , chairman of the african union , said at a press conference in new york .
kikwete warned that the financial crisis could have " serious implications " on foreign aid commitments but added that he expected the turmoil in the us banking sector to calm down over the coming months .
a series of bankruptcies and massive government bailouts of financial institutions last week in the united states led global stock markets on a roller-coaster ride and sparked concerns that the credit crisis could have far-reaching effects for the global economy .
" we need to prevent our development efforts from being swept away by the tide of financial markets , " said heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , germany 's minister for economic cooperation and development .
africa in urgent need a seven-page political declaration monday evening underlined the " urgency " of meeting africa 's challenges and promised fresh resolve on everything from tackling regional conflicts and disease to addressing food shortages , improving infrastructure and combating the effects of global warming .
" now comes the hard part - keeping the promises , " said miguel d 'escoto brockmann , the general assembly 's new president .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy said african and eu stability were intrinsically linked donald kaberuka , president of the african development bank , said that the ongoing financial turmoil showed just how interconnected the world has become .
he quipped that new york 's losses last week showed africa may be a better place to do business than many investors think .
" many more people have lost money in this city than in africa over the past couple of weeks , " kaberuka said .
the evening declaration called on the developed world to meet its 2015 target of committing 0.7 percent of its government budget to development aid .
eu committed to meeting goals french president nicolas sarkozy said that africa had " found its way back to growth " over the last decade , but that the european union heeded the un 's warnings and was committed to meeting the 2015 goal . # b # " the globalized world needs a developed africa , " sarkozy said , adding that europe was " deluding " itself if it believed security and stability were possible for itself without bolstering the economies of its african neighbors .
ban warned that climate change was already having a serious impact on africa .
local conflicts over dwindling natural resources " could spin out of control " if left unchecked , he said .
the world food program issued an appeal monday for nearly $ 500 million to assist 9.6 million ethiopians affected by drought and food prices , which have soared in recent years on world markets .
the conference on africa comes at the half-way point of the un 's 2015 target date for meeting the millennium development goals .

the discussion is increasingly focused on the growing use of the internet as a terror tool , and the threat to data-protection standards in the eu .
dw-world : what are the priorities in the eu 's fight against terrorism at the moment ?
gilles de kerchove : the strategy we adopted in 2005 foresees four main pillars : to prevent people from being radicalized ; to pursue actors and prosecute them ; improve protection of borders ; and improve ways member states respond to a major attack .
for me , the priorities are to emphasize prevention and to work on consequence of a major attack .
on tuesday the european parliament will debate creating new offenses , like incitement to commit terror over the internet .
has this problem grown in the past few years ?
indeed .
it is very important and i am very much in favor of this piece of legislation .
if it is implemented by the member states , it will allow them to start prosecuting those who mainly use the internet to try to incite hatred and commit terrorist acts .
there are something like 5,000 web sites that call for violence and for committing terrorist acts .
it 's important that we can handle that through criminal law .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de kerchove : eu is fighting for hearts and minds and it is not only that .
we have to develop a counter-narrative as well .
we need to explain that the first victims of all this are the muslims themselves , and that it is a war of ideas .
we have to counter the hijacking of the muslim religion for political purposes .
is germany playing a big role ?
a project where germany has taken a very interesting lead is in monitoring the internet .
it has led to the creation of a portal at europol .
the project is called " check-the-web , " where we try to pull all our information together , and make it accessible to police and intelligence services from all the member states .
i 'm currently working with my german colleagues to see what we can do to speed up that project , and reinforce what we can do together in monitoring the internet .
the internet is vast , fluid , and difficult to control .
can you really get a handle on terror sites overall ?
it is a difficult exercise indeed .
as i said , it is a war of ideas , and we have to win the hearts and minds at the same time .
one thing that is developing on the web - its interesting to see on youtube for instance - more and more people are putting up videos that denigrate osama bin laden .
and in some polls of the muslim world , the support for bin laden , for al qaeda , is declining .
that is something we have to invest in .
you speak about sharing data within europe .
but there are those who argue that could lead to data security problems .
could innocent people become targets of europol or secret services ?
yes , but if it 's the case , i think it will be easily detected .
i recently visited a private company that worked for intelligence services , where they tried to enter into certain chat rooms .
and you know , you do n't enter those chat rooms easily .
you have to build trust , and it can take months before getting a password .
so users who wait for months to get this password are n't innocent people .
how do european institutions , like investigative arm europol and the enforcement arm eurojust , working together ?
it is improving , but a lot more needs to be done .
for instance , not all cases of prosecution or investigation are sent to europol or eurojust , respectively .
so it is important for me to remind member states of this obligation .
it is important for europol and eurojust to be associated with as many joint investigation teams as possible .
they have to show member states their added value , which is important .
and i think in two or three years this will have changed significantly .
does cooperation between european member states work as well as it should ?
there is certainly room for improvement .
but the cooperation is much better than it was five years ago .
just take the recent plots that have been foiled in europe - in barcelona , in denmark , in germany , and in belgium .
in many of these cases it 's due to a closer cooperation between the different intelligence services and police .
we still have to improve the way all the players are sharing information .
it is not that that obvious at the level of the european union , between the intelligence community and the police community .
it does happen at the national level .
in germany you have a platform within which all the players are sharing information . … i am trying to convince all 27 states to all set up a similar platform .
and after that , we need to improve the network between these 27 platforms .

the discussion is increasingly focused on the growing use of the internet as a terror tool , and the threat to data-protection standards in the eu .
dw-world : what are the priorities in the eu 's fight against terrorism at the moment ?
gilles de kerchove : the strategy we adopted in 2005 foresees four main pillars : to prevent people from being radicalized ; to pursue actors and prosecute them ; improve protection of borders ; and improve ways member states respond to a major attack .
for me , the priorities are to emphasize prevention and to work on consequence of a major attack .
on tuesday the european parliament will debate creating new offenses , like incitement to commit terror over the internet .
has this problem grown in the past few years ?
indeed .
it is very important and i am very much in favor of this piece of legislation .
if it is implemented by the member states , it will allow them to start prosecuting those who mainly use the internet to try to incite hatred and commit terrorist acts .
there are something like 5,000 web sites that call for violence and for committing terrorist acts .
it 's important that we can handle that through criminal law .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de kerchove : eu is fighting for hearts and minds and it is not only that .
we have to develop a counter-narrative as well .
we need to explain that the first victims of all this are the muslims themselves , and that it is a war of ideas .
we have to counter the hijacking of the muslim religion for political purposes .
is germany playing a big role ?
a project where germany has taken a very interesting lead is in monitoring the internet .
it has led to the creation of a portal at europol .
the project is called " check-the-web , " where we try to pull all our information together , and make it accessible to police and intelligence services from all the member states .
i 'm currently working with my german colleagues to see what we can do to speed up that project , and reinforce what we can do together in monitoring the internet .
the internet is vast , fluid , and difficult to control .
can you really get a handle on terror sites overall ?
it is a difficult exercise indeed .
as i said , it is a war of ideas , and we have to win the hearts and minds at the same time .
one thing that is developing on the web - its interesting to see on youtube for instance - more and more people are putting up videos that denigrate osama bin laden .

you speak about sharing data within europe .
but there are those who argue that could lead to data security problems .
could innocent people become targets of europol or secret services ?
yes , but if it 's the case , i think it will be easily detected .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corruption -pipe- 23.09.2008 report presses germany to step up fight against corruption großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : less oversight often means greater corruption , according to the report though germany moved up two spots in corruption rankings to number 14 on the list of 180 , transparency international has urged the government to do more to fight corruption . global anti-corruption watchdog transparency international praised germany 's " increased efforts " to root out corruption sparked by the massive siemens scandal but pointed out that smaller german firms were slower in their commitment to counter graft .
“ the sparks of corruption prevention must spread to the middle class , ” head of the ti 's german chapter sylvia schenk said in a statement on tuesday .
“ whoever thinks that morality is separable put his business at risk and sends a ruinous signal to his personnel .
the awareness of personal responsibility must increase . ”
the group urged the german government to take concerted measures to tackle corruption in politics .
it said the world 's view of germany has been damaged by the country 's unwillingness to ratify un initiatives against corruption , schenk said .
mid-level companies are also hesitant to engage in anti-corruption strategies , she added .
the 2008 report lists 180 nations on a scale from zero -lrb- highly corrupt -rrb- to 10 -lrb- highly clean -rrb- based on expert assessments and opinion surveys of public sector corruption .
denmark , new zealand and sweden share the highest score at 9.3 , followed immediately by singapore at 9.2 .
bringing up the rear is somalia at 1.0 , slightly trailing iraq and myanmar at 1.3 and haiti at 1.4 .
the report noted significant declines in the scores of bulgaria , burundi , norway and britain , while strong improvements over last year were identified in cyprus , georgia , nigeria , qatar , south korea and turkey .
whether in high or low-income countries , the challenge of reigning in corruption requires functioning institutions in government and other sections of society , transparency said .
" a humanitarian disaster " poorer countries are often plagued by corrupt judiciaries and ineffective parliamentary oversight , the group said .
" in the poorest countries , corruption levels can mean the difference between life and death , when money for hospitals or clean water is in play , " the organization 's chairperson , huguette labelle said .
" the continuing high levels of corruption and poverty plaguing many of the world 's societies amount to an ongoing humanitarian disaster and can not be tolerated , " she said in presenting the organization 's annual corruption perceptions index in berlin on monday , sept .
22 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany had less corporate corruption ' strong oversight required ' wealthy countries , on the other hand , show evidence of insufficient regulation of the private sector in terms of addressing overseas bribery by their companies , and weak oversight of financial institutions and transactions , it added .
" stemming corruption requires strong oversight through parliaments , law enforcement , independent media and a vibrant civil society , " said labelle .
" when these institutions are weak , corruption spirals out of control with horrendous consequences for ordinary people , and for justice and equality in societies , " she said .
the anti-corruption guardian also referred to corporate bribery and the questionable methods of companies in acquiring and managing overseas business .
' unacceptable double-standard ' " the continuing emergence of foreign bribery scandals indicates a broader failure by the world 's wealthiest countries to live up to the promise of mutual accountability in the fight against corruption , it said .

23 .
the lowest rate at which the ecb provided cash to commercial banks was 4.73 percent , a statement said .
on another day which saw strong demand for central bank cash , the ecb 's move showed that tension remained high on money markets used by banks to lend to one another , since the average rate at last week 's auction was 4.58 percent .
ecb rolls over $ 40 billion in one-day loans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a currency swap with the us federal reserve freed up cash the $ 40 billion the ecb provided on tuesday was heading for euro zone banks after the ecb rolled over a one-day loan of us currency obtained in a swap with the us federal reserve .
more than half that amount was provided at a favorable rate of 3.3 percent , the ecb said , adding that demand for the funds was nearly double the amount available .
the central bank 's benchmark lending rate is 4.25 percent .
the offers came as the us congress studied a $ 700-billion rescue plan designed to bail out the country 's troubled financial industry , which is reeling under the weight of bad mortgage loans .
in london , the bank of england also renewed on tuesday its one-day , or overnight , loan offer of $ 40 billion to banking institutions that face funding problems of their own because of the credit crunch .
more instability to come at quarter 's end the ecb announced monday that it forecast renewed tension on euro zone money markets as the end of the third quarter nears and pledges to inject more cash if necessary to keep inter-bank lending on track .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world markets eye the end of the quarter nervously " the ecb continues to closely monitor liquidity conditions and notes some tensions in money market rates over the end-of-quarter , " a statement said .
" as on previous occasions the ecb stands ready to allocate additional liquidity , also by means of additional operations , if needed , " it added .

" it 's the duty of heads of state and government of the countries most directly concerned to meet before the end of the year to examine together the lessons of the most serious financial crisis the world has experienced since that of the 1930s , " sarkozy said . " let us rebuild together a regulated capitalism in which whole swathes of financial activity are not left to the sole judgment of market operators , in which banks do their job , which is to finance economic development rather than engage in speculation , " sarkozy said . the french leader criticized hedge funds and credit ratings agencies for their roles in the current crisis and denounced pay practices in investment banks . in a press conference afterwards , sarkozy called for a summit in november to deal with the crisis , adding he had in mind a " g8 format , " referring to the eight leading economic powers , that could be opened to " emerging countries .

" the federal government is on the side of vw , " the chancellor told an assembly of 18,000 workers at the company 's main plant in wolfsburg , lower saxony on tuesday , sept 23 .
merkel said the state must be allowed to retain its veto rights .
" we will present this view forcefully and in all clarity to the european commission , " she said .
the german government and trade unions see political influence at the huge company as a guarantor of jobs .
lower saxony state premier christian wolf , who was present at the assembly , said volkswagen had become " germany 's most valuable company , " partly as a result of participation by his state .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corruption -pipe- 23.09.2008 report presses germany to step up fight against corruption großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : less oversight often means greater corruption , according to the report though germany moved up two spots in corruption rankings to number 14 on the list of 180 , transparency international has urged the government to do more to fight corruption . global anti-corruption watchdog transparency international praised germany 's " increased efforts " to root out corruption sparked by the massive siemens scandal but pointed out that smaller german firms were slower in their commitment to counter graft .
“ the sparks of corruption prevention must spread to the middle class , ” head of the ti 's german chapter sylvia schenk said in a statement on tuesday .
“ whoever thinks that morality is separable put his business at risk and sends a ruinous signal to his personnel .
the awareness of personal responsibility must increase . ”
the group urged the german government to take concerted measures to tackle corruption in politics .
it said the world 's view of germany has been damaged by the country 's unwillingness to ratify un initiatives against corruption , schenk said .
mid-level companies are also hesitant to engage in anti-corruption strategies , she added .
the 2008 report lists 180 nations on a scale from zero -lrb- highly corrupt -rrb- to 10 -lrb- highly clean -rrb- based on expert assessments and opinion surveys of public sector corruption .
denmark , new zealand and sweden share the highest score at 9.3 , followed immediately by singapore at 9.2 .
bringing up the rear is somalia at 1.0 , slightly trailing iraq and myanmar at 1.3 and haiti at 1.4 .
the report noted significant declines in the scores of bulgaria , burundi , norway and britain , while strong improvements over last year were identified in cyprus , georgia , nigeria , qatar , south korea and turkey .
whether in high or low-income countries , the challenge of reigning in corruption requires functioning institutions in government and other sections of society , transparency said .
" a humanitarian disaster " poorer countries are often plagued by corrupt judiciaries and ineffective parliamentary oversight , the group said .
" in the poorest countries , corruption levels can mean the difference between life and death , when money for hospitals or clean water is in play , " the organization 's chairperson , huguette labelle said .
" the continuing high levels of corruption and poverty plaguing many of the world 's societies amount to an ongoing humanitarian disaster and can not be tolerated , " she said in presenting the organization 's annual corruption perceptions index in berlin on monday , sept .
22 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany had less corporate corruption ' strong oversight required ' wealthy countries , on the other hand , show evidence of insufficient regulation of the private sector in terms of addressing overseas bribery by their companies , and weak oversight of financial institutions and transactions , it added .
" stemming corruption requires strong oversight through parliaments , law enforcement , independent media and a vibrant civil society , " said labelle .
" when these institutions are weak , corruption spirals out of control with horrendous consequences for ordinary people , and for justice and equality in societies , " she said .
the anti-corruption guardian also referred to corporate bribery and the questionable methods of companies in acquiring and managing overseas business .
' unacceptable double-standard ' " the continuing emergence of foreign bribery scandals indicates a broader failure by the world 's wealthiest countries to live up to the promise of mutual accountability in the fight against corruption , it said .
" this sort of double standard is unacceptable and disregards international legal standards , " said labelle .
" beyond its corrosive effects on the rule of law and public confidence ... it undermines the credibility of the wealthiest nations in calling for greater action to fight corruption by low-income countries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 23.09.2008 us bailout first step in long reform process , says economist großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us bank bailout may cheer struggling banks but german politicians are n't amused the chaos in the us has europeans believing they 'll have the upper hand in future regulatory negotiations .
not so fast , irwin collier of the john f. kennedy institute at berlin 's free university told dw-world.de. dw-world.de : are european banks going to be able to take advantage of the relief available from the us government ?
irwin collier : the original terms of the bailout were to be limited to domestic us financial institutions .
of course when international financial institutions saw this language , they immediately , as one says , dialed 1-800-paulson , to let the treasury department know that to limit the bailout along national lines is absolutely impossible in a modern globalized economy .
and so the language was changed so that all foreign firms with significant us operations - and there are a lot of them - will be able to participate in the proposed purchase of mortgage-backed securities .
i suspect that might not be the most popular political decision to make in the united states .
the money going toward these foreign financial institutions is us taxpayer money .
looking at the proposed legislation , though , the secretary of the treasury will have enormous discretionary powers to decide which assets will be purchased from which institutions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irwin collier i think one has to remember that the balance of international financial institutions may be eligible , but depending on how many different banks want to feed at the trough at the same time , paulson will have enormous discretion to decide which banks to service first .
german chancellor angela merkel has criticized the bailout plan .
she also said that she had long been trying to push for greater transparency , for tighter regulation in global finance , and that the us and britain had blocked her .
has she been vindicated ?
she certainly has a point , and she was not alone in making it .
there have been many reasonable voices who have been pointing to the fact that financial market contracts and instruments have evolved enormously over the last fifty years , and that the regulatory framework has not kept pace .
but again , having said that , once you have a crisis , it really matters very little who identified the sore points first .
if there 's a financial crisis , in the sense that one bank or one financial institution 's failing could cause another to fail , you have to prop up some of the dominoes so that the crisis does n't get worse .
having principles against bailouts really does n't help you in that situation .
but are the kinds of banking reforms she and others were calling for now going to help cure the situation , or is the sickness too far advanced , so to speak ?
i think the one thing that we can hope for is to see major new kinds of regulation and oversight in the american capital market .
i think what merkel and other leaders have been pushing for is a greater harmonization of regulations , one that would make it more transparent as to what securities issued in one country would be worth in another country .
i think that real harmonization , though , is music of the very far future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel has criticized the us for not implementing more stringent controls the national response on the part of the us will have to come first , and it will certainly be a step in the right direction .
once they do that , we will have a starting point in international negotiations to harmonize regulations .
the financial markets of europe are in a somewhat healthier position than those of the us , at least as yet .
does that mean that europe will have an easier time getting its way in future conversations with us regulators over harmonization ?
i would be very surprised if the relative weights in these sorts of negotiations were to change .
remember , we 're going to see differences between the french , the germans , the british , the italians .
these will come up in a variety of ways , and i just do n't see the initiative passing from new york to a place to be determined in europe .
but could the comparatively conservative practices of german financial institutions , say , be held up as an example of prudence , now that we see how reckless some investors in the us had become ?
i think very much that the rules of prudential banking behavior , these rules that bankers have known and have developed over the years , will be rewarded .
we 'll also see that in the us , the banks that are going to survive this best will be the ones who did n't necessarily push the limits , but rather followed fairly standard procedure , having adequate capital reserves and the like .
this is not rocket science by a long shot , but is part and parcel of working in markets where trust is absolutely essential . interview : matt hermann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the discussion is increasingly focused on the growing use of the internet as a terror tool , and the threat to data-protection standards in the eu .
dw-world : what are the priorities in the eu 's fight against terrorism at the moment ?
gilles de kerchove : the strategy we adopted in 2005 foresees four main pillars : to prevent people from being radicalized ; to pursue actors and prosecute them ; improve protection of borders ; and improve ways member states respond to a major attack .
for me , the priorities are to emphasize prevention and to work on consequence of a major attack .
on tuesday the european parliament will debate creating new offenses , like incitement to commit terror over the internet .
has this problem grown in the past few years ?
indeed .
it is very important and i am very much in favor of this piece of legislation .
if it is implemented by the member states , it will allow them to start prosecuting those who mainly use the internet to try to incite hatred and commit terrorist acts .
there are something like 5,000 web sites that call for violence and for committing terrorist acts .
it 's important that we can handle that through criminal law .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de kerchove : eu is fighting for hearts and minds and it is not only that .
we have to develop a counter-narrative as well .
we need to explain that the first victims of all this are the muslims themselves , and that it is a war of ideas .
we have to counter the hijacking of the muslim religion for political purposes .
is germany playing a big role ?
a project where germany has taken a very interesting lead is in monitoring the internet .
it has led to the creation of a portal at europol .
the project is called " check-the-web , " where we try to pull all our information together , and make it accessible to police and intelligence services from all the member states .
i 'm currently working with my german colleagues to see what we can do to speed up that project , and reinforce what we can do together in monitoring the internet .
the internet is vast , fluid , and difficult to control .
can you really get a handle on terror sites overall ?
it is a difficult exercise indeed .
as i said , it is a war of ideas , and we have to win the hearts and minds at the same time .
one thing that is developing on the web - its interesting to see on youtube for instance - more and more people are putting up videos that denigrate osama bin laden .
and in some polls of the muslim world , the support for bin laden , for al qaeda , is declining .
that is something we have to invest in .
you speak about sharing data within europe .
but there are those who argue that could lead to data security problems .
could innocent people become targets of europol or secret services ?
yes , but if it 's the case , i think it will be easily detected .
i recently visited a private company that worked for intelligence services , where they tried to enter into certain chat rooms .
and you know , you do n't enter those chat rooms easily .
you have to build trust , and it can take months before getting a password .
so users who wait for months to get this password are n't innocent people .
how do european institutions , like investigative arm europol and the enforcement arm eurojust , working together ?
it is improving , but a lot more needs to be done .
for instance , not all cases of prosecution or investigation are sent to europol or eurojust , respectively .
so it is important for me to remind member states of this obligation .
it is important for europol and eurojust to be associated with as many joint investigation teams as possible .
they have to show member states their added value , which is important .
and i think in two or three years this will have changed significantly .
does cooperation between european member states work as well as it should ?
there is certainly room for improvement .
but the cooperation is much better than it was five years ago .
just take the recent plots that have been foiled in europe - in barcelona , in denmark , in germany , and in belgium .
in many of these cases it 's due to a closer cooperation between the different intelligence services and police .
we still have to improve the way all the players are sharing information .
it is not that that obvious at the level of the european union , between the intelligence community and the police community .
it does happen at the national level .
in germany you have a platform within which all the players are sharing information . … i am trying to convince all 27 states to all set up a similar platform .
and after that , we need to improve the network between these 27 platforms .
that is an indirect way to implement the concept of availability , the information-sharing environment that the report of the 9/11 commission in the united states considered to be the top lesson learned from 9/11 . interview : anke hagedorn -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de kerchove : eu is fighting for hearts and minds and it is not only that .
we have to develop a counter-narrative as well .
we need to explain that the first victims of all this are the muslims themselves , and that it is a war of ideas .
we have to counter the hijacking of the muslim religion for political purposes .
is germany playing a big role ?
a project where germany has taken a very interesting lead is in monitoring the internet .
it has led to the creation of a portal at europol .
the project is called " check-the-web , " where we try to pull all our information together , and make it accessible to police and intelligence services from all the member states .
i 'm currently working with my german colleagues to see what we can do to speed up that project , and reinforce what we can do together in monitoring the internet .
the internet is vast , fluid , and difficult to control .
can you really get a handle on terror sites overall ?
it is a difficult exercise indeed .
as i said , it is a war of ideas , and we have to win the hearts and minds at the same time .
one thing that is developing on the web - its interesting to see on youtube for instance - more and more people are putting up videos that denigrate osama bin laden .
and in some polls of the muslim world , the support for bin laden , for al qaeda , is declining .
that is something we have to invest in .
you speak about sharing data within europe .
but there are those who argue that could lead to data security problems .
could innocent people become targets of europol or secret services ?
yes , but if it 's the case , i think it will be easily detected .
i recently visited a private company that worked for intelligence services , where they tried to enter into certain chat rooms .
and you know , you do n't enter those chat rooms easily .
you have to build trust , and it can take months before getting a password .
so users who wait for months to get this password are n't innocent people .
how do european institutions , like investigative arm europol and the enforcement arm eurojust , working together ?
it is improving , but a lot more needs to be done .
for instance , not all cases of prosecution or investigation are sent to europol or eurojust , respectively .
so it is important for me to remind member states of this obligation .
it is important for europol and eurojust to be associated with as many joint investigation teams as possible .
they have to show member states their added value , which is important .
and i think in two or three years this will have changed significantly .
does cooperation between european member states work as well as it should ?
there is certainly room for improvement .
but the cooperation is much better than it was five years ago .
just take the recent plots that have been foiled in europe - in barcelona , in denmark , in germany , and in belgium .
in many of these cases it 's due to a closer cooperation between the different intelligence services and police .
we still have to improve the way all the players are sharing information .
it is not that that obvious at the level of the european union , between the intelligence community and the police community .
it does happen at the national level .
in germany you have a platform within which all the players are sharing information . … i am trying to convince all 27 states to all set up a similar platform .

gilles de kerchove : the strategy we adopted in 2005 foresees four main pillars : to prevent people from being radicalized ; to pursue actors and prosecute them ; improve protection of borders ; and improve ways member states respond to a major attack .

gilles de kerchove : the strategy we adopted in 2005 foresees four main pillars : to prevent people from being radicalized ; to pursue actors and prosecute them ; improve protection of borders ; and improve ways member states respond to a major attack .
for me , the priorities are to emphasize prevention and to work on consequence of a major attack .
on tuesday the european parliament will debate creating new offenses , like incitement to commit terror over the internet .
has this problem grown in the past few years ?
indeed .
it is very important and i am very much in favor of this piece of legislation .
if it is implemented by the member states , it will allow them to start prosecuting those who mainly use the internet to try to incite hatred and commit terrorist acts .
there are something like 5,000 web sites that call for violence and for committing terrorist acts .
it 's important that we can handle that through criminal law .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de kerchove : eu is fighting for hearts and minds and it is not only that .
we have to develop a counter-narrative as well .
we need to explain that the first victims of all this are the muslims themselves , and that it is a war of ideas .
we have to counter the hijacking of the muslim religion for political purposes .
is germany playing a big role ?
a project where germany has taken a very interesting lead is in monitoring the internet .
it has led to the creation of a portal at europol .
the project is called " check-the-web , " where we try to pull all our information together , and make it accessible to police and intelligence services from all the member states .
i 'm currently working with my german colleagues to see what we can do to speed up that project , and reinforce what we can do together in monitoring the internet .
the internet is vast , fluid , and difficult to control .
can you really get a handle on terror sites overall ?
it is a difficult exercise indeed .
as i said , it is a war of ideas , and we have to win the hearts and minds at the same time .
one thing that is developing on the web - its interesting to see on youtube for instance - more and more people are putting up videos that denigrate osama bin laden .
and in some polls of the muslim world , the support for bin laden , for al qaeda , is declining .
that is something we have to invest in .
you speak about sharing data within europe .
but there are those who argue that could lead to data security problems .
could innocent people become targets of europol or secret services ?
yes , but if it 's the case , i think it will be easily detected .
i recently visited a private company that worked for intelligence services , where they tried to enter into certain chat rooms .
and you know , you do n't enter those chat rooms easily .
you have to build trust , and it can take months before getting a password .
so users who wait for months to get this password are n't innocent people .
how do european institutions , like investigative arm europol and the enforcement arm eurojust , working together ?
it is improving , but a lot more needs to be done .
for instance , not all cases of prosecution or investigation are sent to europol or eurojust , respectively .
so it is important for me to remind member states of this obligation .
it is important for europol and eurojust to be associated with as many joint investigation teams as possible .
they have to show member states their added value , which is important .
and i think in two or three years this will have changed significantly .
does cooperation between european member states work as well as it should ?
there is certainly room for improvement .
but the cooperation is much better than it was five years ago .
just take the recent plots that have been foiled in europe - in barcelona , in denmark , in germany , and in belgium .
in many of these cases it 's due to a closer cooperation between the different intelligence services and police .
we still have to improve the way all the players are sharing information .
it is not that that obvious at the level of the european union , between the intelligence community and the police community .
it does happen at the national level .
in germany you have a platform within which all the players are sharing information . … i am trying to convince all 27 states to all set up a similar platform .
and after that , we need to improve the network between these 27 platforms .
that is an indirect way to implement the concept of availability , the information-sharing environment that the report of the 9/11 commission in the united states considered to be the top lesson learned from 9/11 . interview : anke hagedorn -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not so fast , irwin collier of the john f. kennedy institute at berlin 's free university told dw-world.de. dw-world.de : are european banks going to be able to take advantage of the relief available from the us government ?
irwin collier : the original terms of the bailout were to be limited to domestic us financial institutions .
of course when international financial institutions saw this language , they immediately , as one says , dialed 1-800-paulson , to let the treasury department know that to limit the bailout along national lines is absolutely impossible in a modern globalized economy .
and so the language was changed so that all foreign firms with significant us operations - and there are a lot of them - will be able to participate in the proposed purchase of mortgage-backed securities .
i suspect that might not be the most popular political decision to make in the united states .
the money going toward these foreign financial institutions is us taxpayer money .
looking at the proposed legislation , though , the secretary of the treasury will have enormous discretionary powers to decide which assets will be purchased from which institutions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irwin collier i think one has to remember that the balance of international financial institutions may be eligible , but depending on how many different banks want to feed at the trough at the same time , paulson will have enormous discretion to decide which banks to service first .
german chancellor angela merkel has criticized the bailout plan .
she also said that she had long been trying to push for greater transparency , for tighter regulation in global finance , and that the us and britain had blocked her .
has she been vindicated ?
she certainly has a point , and she was not alone in making it .
there have been many reasonable voices who have been pointing to the fact that financial market contracts and instruments have evolved enormously over the last fifty years , and that the regulatory framework has not kept pace .
but again , having said that , once you have a crisis , it really matters very little who identified the sore points first .
if there 's a financial crisis , in the sense that one bank or one financial institution 's failing could cause another to fail , you have to prop up some of the dominoes so that the crisis does n't get worse .
having principles against bailouts really does n't help you in that situation .
but are the kinds of banking reforms she and others were calling for now going to help cure the situation , or is the sickness too far advanced , so to speak ?
i think the one thing that we can hope for is to see major new kinds of regulation and oversight in the american capital market .
i think what merkel and other leaders have been pushing for is a greater harmonization of regulations , one that would make it more transparent as to what securities issued in one country would be worth in another country .
i think that real harmonization , though , is music of the very far future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel has criticized the us for not implementing more stringent controls the national response on the part of the us will have to come first , and it will certainly be a step in the right direction .
once they do that , we will have a starting point in international negotiations to harmonize regulations .
the financial markets of europe are in a somewhat healthier position than those of the us , at least as yet .
does that mean that europe will have an easier time getting its way in future conversations with us regulators over harmonization ?
i would be very surprised if the relative weights in these sorts of negotiations were to change .
remember , we 're going to see differences between the french , the germans , the british , the italians .
these will come up in a variety of ways , and i just do n't see the initiative passing from new york to a place to be determined in europe .
but could the comparatively conservative practices of german financial institutions , say , be held up as an example of prudence , now that we see how reckless some investors in the us had become ?
i think very much that the rules of prudential banking behavior , these rules that bankers have known and have developed over the years , will be rewarded .
we 'll also see that in the us , the banks that are going to survive this best will be the ones who did n't necessarily push the limits , but rather followed fairly standard procedure , having adequate capital reserves and the like .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 23.09.2008 sarkozy calls for global summit to overhaul financial system großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy used strong words to criticize what he called the excesses of an unchecked financial system french president sarkozy called tuesday for a summit to tackle the global financial crisis and urged world leaders to draw lessons from capitalist excesses in a speech before the un general assembly . in a hard-hitting speech before the un general assembly in new york on tuesday , sept 23 , french president nicolas sarkozy demanded that those responsible for the global financial turbulence be punished and called for a " regulated capitalism . " " today , millions of people across the world fear for their savings , for their apartment , for the funds they have put in banks .
it is our duty to give them clear answers , " the french president , who chairs the eu 's presidency , said .
" who is responsible for this disaster ?
may those who are responsible be punished and held accountable , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the collapse of the venerable lehman brothers investment bank sent shockwaves around the world in his first public statements on the financial crisis which has rattled world markets and sparked a $ 700 billion us rescue package , sarkozy urged major powers to devise a new form of regulated market economics that would prevent the excesses behind the current credit crisis which felled investment bank lehman brothers . he however did not spell out who was responsible for the global upheaval , how the system should be reformed and why governments in europe and the us did not act earlier to stem the crisis . sarkozy calls for world summit to tackle crisis addressing the 63rd session of the un general assembly which has been dominated by the financial upheaval on wall street , sarkozy urged world leaders to draw lessons from the global financial crisis , rebuild a system that regulates the markets , curb speculation , increase transparency and punish the reckless . " it 's the duty of heads of state and government of the countries most directly concerned to meet before the end of the year to examine together the lessons of the most serious financial crisis the world has experienced since that of the 1930s , " sarkozy said . " let us rebuild together a regulated capitalism in which whole swathes of financial activity are not left to the sole judgment of market operators , in which banks do their job , which is to finance economic development rather than engage in speculation , " sarkozy said . the french leader criticized hedge funds and credit ratings agencies for their roles in the current crisis and denounced pay practices in investment banks . in a press conference afterwards , sarkozy called for a summit in november to deal with the crisis , adding he had in mind a " g8 format , " referring to the eight leading economic powers , that could be opened to " emerging countries . " the g8 is made up of the united states , france , britain , germany , italy , japan , canada and russia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been unusually critical of us failures in the present financial chaos speaking in french through an interpreter , sarkozy called for " rules that apply to all and serve to avert and soften shocks instead of exacerbating them . " like sarkozy , other european leaders , chiefly germany 's chancellor angela merkel , have voiced annoyance at what they perceive as us failures to implement more stringent financial controls . both sarkozy and merkel have complained that their calls last year for tighter regulation of the markets were shunted aside by the united states and britain . new economic cooperation with russia separately , speaking on behalf of the 27-member european union , sarkozy also appealed for a " continent-wide economic space " between europe and russia . " what europe is telling russia is that we want links with russia , that we want to build a shared future with russia , we want to be russia 's partner , " sarkozy said .
" why not build a continent-wide economic space which would unite russia and europe ? " he asked . at the same time , sarkozy warned russia after its war with georgia that force can not be used to settle disputes . " europe is also telling russia ... it can not compromise on the principle of states ' sovereignty and independence , their territorial integrity , or respect for international law , " he said ´ . sarkozy brokered a ceasefire to end the conflict between georgia and russia last month , although the united states and eu countries have sharply criticized russia for what they described as its excessive use of force . french leader remains firm on iran sarkozy also said the eu would never tolerate a nuclear-armed iran , " which would endanger the peace and stability of an entire region , nor can it tolerate iran calling for the destruction of ...
israel . " he told reporters that paris fully supported a fourth round of sanctions against iran for refusing to suspend its nuclear enrichment program , but acknowledged that western powers would need russia 's support to pass a new un sanctions resolution . tehran denies western allegations that it 's seeking to develop nuclear weapons . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

22 , that the financial crisis enveloping advanced economies was no reason to slash foreign aid commitments to the african continent , which is in danger of falling far short of a series of un goals on reducing poverty .
their advice came as world leaders promised a renewed effort to pull africa out of poverty and into the " mainstream of the global economy , " after a one-day united nations conference taking stock of the continent 's progress .
" eradicating poverty , particularly in africa , is the greatest global challenge facing the world today , " read a declaration adopted by the un general assembly monday evening .
more than 40 world leaders took part in the un conference in new york , which came one day before heads of state begin speeches to mark the annual opening of the general assembly .
un secretary general ban ki-moon earlier warned that not one african country was on track to meet all of the un 's millennium development goals , a series of poverty-reducing targets that were adopted in 2000 and were to be met by 2015 .
ban issued a plea for $ 72 billion per year in foreign aid if africa was to have any hope of reaching the un goals .

“ the sparks of corruption prevention must spread to the middle class , ” head of the ti 's german chapter sylvia schenk said in a statement on tuesday .
“ whoever thinks that morality is separable put his business at risk and sends a ruinous signal to his personnel .
the awareness of personal responsibility must increase . ”
the group urged the german government to take concerted measures to tackle corruption in politics .
it said the world 's view of germany has been damaged by the country 's unwillingness to ratify un initiatives against corruption , schenk said .
mid-level companies are also hesitant to engage in anti-corruption strategies , she added .
the 2008 report lists 180 nations on a scale from zero -lrb- highly corrupt -rrb- to 10 -lrb- highly clean -rrb- based on expert assessments and opinion surveys of public sector corruption .
denmark , new zealand and sweden share the highest score at 9.3 , followed immediately by singapore at 9.2 .
bringing up the rear is somalia at 1.0 , slightly trailing iraq and myanmar at 1.3 and haiti at 1.4 .
the report noted significant declines in the scores of bulgaria , burundi , norway and britain , while strong improvements over last year were identified in cyprus , georgia , nigeria , qatar , south korea and turkey .
whether in high or low-income countries , the challenge of reigning in corruption requires functioning institutions in government and other sections of society , transparency said .
" a humanitarian disaster " poorer countries are often plagued by corrupt judiciaries and ineffective parliamentary oversight , the group said .
" in the poorest countries , corruption levels can mean the difference between life and death , when money for hospitals or clean water is in play , " the organization 's chairperson , huguette labelle said .

the anti-corruption guardian also referred to corporate bribery and the questionable methods of companies in acquiring and managing overseas business .
' unacceptable double-standard ' " the continuing emergence of foreign bribery scandals indicates a broader failure by the world 's wealthiest countries to live up to the promise of mutual accountability in the fight against corruption , it said .
" this sort of double standard is unacceptable and disregards international legal standards , " said labelle .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corruption -pipe- 23.09.2008 report presses germany to step up fight against corruption großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : less oversight often means greater corruption , according to the report though germany moved up two spots in corruption rankings to number 14 on the list of 180 , transparency international has urged the government to do more to fight corruption . global anti-corruption watchdog transparency international praised germany 's " increased efforts " to root out corruption sparked by the massive siemens scandal but pointed out that smaller german firms were slower in their commitment to counter graft .
“ the sparks of corruption prevention must spread to the middle class , ” head of the ti 's german chapter sylvia schenk said in a statement on tuesday .
“ whoever thinks that morality is separable put his business at risk and sends a ruinous signal to his personnel .
the awareness of personal responsibility must increase . ”
the group urged the german government to take concerted measures to tackle corruption in politics .
it said the world 's view of germany has been damaged by the country 's unwillingness to ratify un initiatives against corruption , schenk said .
mid-level companies are also hesitant to engage in anti-corruption strategies , she added .
the 2008 report lists 180 nations on a scale from zero -lrb- highly corrupt -rrb- to 10 -lrb- highly clean -rrb- based on expert assessments and opinion surveys of public sector corruption .
denmark , new zealand and sweden share the highest score at 9.3 , followed immediately by singapore at 9.2 .
bringing up the rear is somalia at 1.0 , slightly trailing iraq and myanmar at 1.3 and haiti at 1.4 .
the report noted significant declines in the scores of bulgaria , burundi , norway and britain , while strong improvements over last year were identified in cyprus , georgia , nigeria , qatar , south korea and turkey .
whether in high or low-income countries , the challenge of reigning in corruption requires functioning institutions in government and other sections of society , transparency said .
" a humanitarian disaster " poorer countries are often plagued by corrupt judiciaries and ineffective parliamentary oversight , the group said .
" in the poorest countries , corruption levels can mean the difference between life and death , when money for hospitals or clean water is in play , " the organization 's chairperson , huguette labelle said .
" the continuing high levels of corruption and poverty plaguing many of the world 's societies amount to an ongoing humanitarian disaster and can not be tolerated , " she said in presenting the organization 's annual corruption perceptions index in berlin on monday , sept .
22 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany had less corporate corruption ' strong oversight required ' wealthy countries , on the other hand , show evidence of insufficient regulation of the private sector in terms of addressing overseas bribery by their companies , and weak oversight of financial institutions and transactions , it added .
" stemming corruption requires strong oversight through parliaments , law enforcement , independent media and a vibrant civil society , " said labelle .
" when these institutions are weak , corruption spirals out of control with horrendous consequences for ordinary people , and for justice and equality in societies , " she said .

23 .
the lowest rate at which the ecb provided cash to commercial banks was 4.73 percent , a statement said .
on another day which saw strong demand for central bank cash , the ecb 's move showed that tension remained high on money markets used by banks to lend to one another , since the average rate at last week 's auction was 4.58 percent .
ecb rolls over $ 40 billion in one-day loans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a currency swap with the us federal reserve freed up cash the $ 40 billion the ecb provided on tuesday was heading for euro zone banks after the ecb rolled over a one-day loan of us currency obtained in a swap with the us federal reserve .
more than half that amount was provided at a favorable rate of 3.3 percent , the ecb said , adding that demand for the funds was nearly double the amount available .
the central bank 's benchmark lending rate is 4.25 percent .
the offers came as the us congress studied a $ 700-billion rescue plan designed to bail out the country 's troubled financial industry , which is reeling under the weight of bad mortgage loans .
in london , the bank of england also renewed on tuesday its one-day , or overnight , loan offer of $ 40 billion to banking institutions that face funding problems of their own because of the credit crunch .
more instability to come at quarter 's end the ecb announced monday that it forecast renewed tension on euro zone money markets as the end of the third quarter nears and pledges to inject more cash if necessary to keep inter-bank lending on track .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world markets eye the end of the quarter nervously " the ecb continues to closely monitor liquidity conditions and notes some tensions in money market rates over the end-of-quarter , " a statement said .
" as on previous occasions the ecb stands ready to allocate additional liquidity , also by means of additional operations , if needed , " it added .
the end of financial quarters are often times of stress for banks as they close their books and balance their accounts .
last week , the ecb injected a total of 125 billion euros into money markets via three rapid refinancing operations after the us investment bank lehman brothers went into bankruptcy .
on monday , the ecb estimated euro zone banks would need 119 billion euros to meet minimum reserve requirements for the coming week . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

23 .
the lowest rate at which the ecb provided cash to commercial banks was 4.73 percent , a statement said .
on another day which saw strong demand for central bank cash , the ecb 's move showed that tension remained high on money markets used by banks to lend to one another , since the average rate at last week 's auction was 4.58 percent .
ecb rolls over $ 40 billion in one-day loans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a currency swap with the us federal reserve freed up cash the $ 40 billion the ecb provided on tuesday was heading for euro zone banks after the ecb rolled over a one-day loan of us currency obtained in a swap with the us federal reserve .
more than half that amount was provided at a favorable rate of 3.3 percent , the ecb said , adding that demand for the funds was nearly double the amount available .
the central bank 's benchmark lending rate is 4.25 percent .
the offers came as the us congress studied a $ 700-billion rescue plan designed to bail out the country 's troubled financial industry , which is reeling under the weight of bad mortgage loans .
in london , the bank of england also renewed on tuesday its one-day , or overnight , loan offer of $ 40 billion to banking institutions that face funding problems of their own because of the credit crunch .
more instability to come at quarter 's end the ecb announced monday that it forecast renewed tension on euro zone money markets as the end of the third quarter nears and pledges to inject more cash if necessary to keep inter-bank lending on track .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world markets eye the end of the quarter nervously " the ecb continues to closely monitor liquidity conditions and notes some tensions in money market rates over the end-of-quarter , " a statement said .
" as on previous occasions the ecb stands ready to allocate additional liquidity , also by means of additional operations , if needed , " it added .
the end of financial quarters are often times of stress for banks as they close their books and balance their accounts .
last week , the ecb injected a total of 125 billion euros into money markets via three rapid refinancing operations after the us investment bank lehman brothers went into bankruptcy .
on monday , the ecb estimated euro zone banks would need 119 billion euros to meet minimum reserve requirements for the coming week . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" eradicating poverty , particularly in africa , is the greatest global challenge facing the world today , " read a declaration adopted by the un general assembly monday evening .
more than 40 world leaders took part in the un conference in new york , which came one day before heads of state begin speeches to mark the annual opening of the general assembly .
un secretary general ban ki-moon earlier warned that not one african country was on track to meet all of the un 's millennium development goals , a series of poverty-reducing targets that were adopted in 2000 and were to be met by 2015 .
ban issued a plea for $ 72 billion per year in foreign aid if africa was to have any hope of reaching the un goals .

" many more people have lost money in this city than in africa over the past couple of weeks , " kaberuka said .
the evening declaration called on the developed world to meet its 2015 target of committing 0.7 percent of its government budget to development aid .
eu committed to meeting goals french president nicolas sarkozy said that africa had " found its way back to growth " over the last decade , but that the european union heeded the un 's warnings and was committed to meeting the 2015 goal . # b # " the globalized world needs a developed africa , " sarkozy said , adding that europe was " deluding " itself if it believed security and stability were possible for itself without bolstering the economies of its african neighbors .

22 , that the financial crisis enveloping advanced economies was no reason to slash foreign aid commitments to the african continent , which is in danger of falling far short of a series of un goals on reducing poverty .
their advice came as world leaders promised a renewed effort to pull africa out of poverty and into the " mainstream of the global economy , " after a one-day united nations conference taking stock of the continent 's progress .
" eradicating poverty , particularly in africa , is the greatest global challenge facing the world today , " read a declaration adopted by the un general assembly monday evening .
more than 40 world leaders took part in the un conference in new york , which came one day before heads of state begin speeches to mark the annual opening of the general assembly .
un secretary general ban ki-moon earlier warned that not one african country was on track to meet all of the un 's millennium development goals , a series of poverty-reducing targets that were adopted in 2000 and were to be met by 2015 .
ban issued a plea for $ 72 billion per year in foreign aid if africa was to have any hope of reaching the un goals .
" this price tag may look daunting .
but it is affordable and falls within existing aid commitments , " ban said , urging the developed world to meet a 2005 pledge to double aid to the continent .
africa rises to challenge but needs help african leaders promised to take the initiative in tackling the continent 's many ongoing problems but warned that they would not be able to get on track without outside help .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the effects of the financial crash have been felt globally " we want developed countries to deliver " on their promises of more aid , tanzanian president jakaya kikwete , chairman of the african union , said at a press conference in new york .
kikwete warned that the financial crisis could have " serious implications " on foreign aid commitments but added that he expected the turmoil in the us banking sector to calm down over the coming months .
a series of bankruptcies and massive government bailouts of financial institutions last week in the united states led global stock markets on a roller-coaster ride and sparked concerns that the credit crisis could have far-reaching effects for the global economy .
" we need to prevent our development efforts from being swept away by the tide of financial markets , " said heidemarie wieczorek-zeul , germany 's minister for economic cooperation and development .
africa in urgent need a seven-page political declaration monday evening underlined the " urgency " of meeting africa 's challenges and promised fresh resolve on everything from tackling regional conflicts and disease to addressing food shortages , improving infrastructure and combating the effects of global warming .
" now comes the hard part - keeping the promises , " said miguel d 'escoto brockmann , the general assembly 's new president .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy said african and eu stability were intrinsically linked donald kaberuka , president of the african development bank , said that the ongoing financial turmoil showed just how interconnected the world has become .
he quipped that new york 's losses last week showed africa may be a better place to do business than many investors think .
" many more people have lost money in this city than in africa over the past couple of weeks , " kaberuka said .
the evening declaration called on the developed world to meet its 2015 target of committing 0.7 percent of its government budget to development aid .
eu committed to meeting goals french president nicolas sarkozy said that africa had " found its way back to growth " over the last decade , but that the european union heeded the un 's warnings and was committed to meeting the 2015 goal . # b # " the globalized world needs a developed africa , " sarkozy said , adding that europe was " deluding " itself if it believed security and stability were possible for itself without bolstering the economies of its african neighbors .
ban warned that climate change was already having a serious impact on africa .
local conflicts over dwindling natural resources " could spin out of control " if left unchecked , he said .
the world food program issued an appeal monday for nearly $ 500 million to assist 9.6 million ethiopians affected by drought and food prices , which have soared in recent years on world markets .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 23.09.2008 eu anti-terror chief says data sharing is key großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the use of the internet to incite and recruit terrorists is growing dw talked with eu counterterrorism coordinator gilles de kerchove about the successes and pitfalls of europe 's fight against terror , which increasingly involves the internet . the european parliament is debating new plans to combat terrorism , including the creation of new offenses such as recruiting and training terrorists .
the discussion is increasingly focused on the growing use of the internet as a terror tool , and the threat to data-protection standards in the eu .
dw-world : what are the priorities in the eu 's fight against terrorism at the moment ?
gilles de kerchove : the strategy we adopted in 2005 foresees four main pillars : to prevent people from being radicalized ; to pursue actors and prosecute them ; improve protection of borders ; and improve ways member states respond to a major attack .
for me , the priorities are to emphasize prevention and to work on consequence of a major attack .
on tuesday the european parliament will debate creating new offenses , like incitement to commit terror over the internet .
has this problem grown in the past few years ?
indeed .
it is very important and i am very much in favor of this piece of legislation .
if it is implemented by the member states , it will allow them to start prosecuting those who mainly use the internet to try to incite hatred and commit terrorist acts .
there are something like 5,000 web sites that call for violence and for committing terrorist acts .
it 's important that we can handle that through criminal law .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : de kerchove : eu is fighting for hearts and minds and it is not only that .
we have to develop a counter-narrative as well .
we need to explain that the first victims of all this are the muslims themselves , and that it is a war of ideas .
we have to counter the hijacking of the muslim religion for political purposes .
is germany playing a big role ?
a project where germany has taken a very interesting lead is in monitoring the internet .
it has led to the creation of a portal at europol .
the project is called " check-the-web , " where we try to pull all our information together , and make it accessible to police and intelligence services from all the member states .
i 'm currently working with my german colleagues to see what we can do to speed up that project , and reinforce what we can do together in monitoring the internet .
the internet is vast , fluid , and difficult to control .
can you really get a handle on terror sites overall ?
it is a difficult exercise indeed .
as i said , it is a war of ideas , and we have to win the hearts and minds at the same time .
one thing that is developing on the web - its interesting to see on youtube for instance - more and more people are putting up videos that denigrate osama bin laden .
and in some polls of the muslim world , the support for bin laden , for al qaeda , is declining .
that is something we have to invest in .
you speak about sharing data within europe .
but there are those who argue that could lead to data security problems .
could innocent people become targets of europol or secret services ?
yes , but if it 's the case , i think it will be easily detected .
i recently visited a private company that worked for intelligence services , where they tried to enter into certain chat rooms .
and you know , you do n't enter those chat rooms easily .
you have to build trust , and it can take months before getting a password .
so users who wait for months to get this password are n't innocent people .
how do european institutions , like investigative arm europol and the enforcement arm eurojust , working together ?
it is improving , but a lot more needs to be done .
for instance , not all cases of prosecution or investigation are sent to europol or eurojust , respectively .
so it is important for me to remind member states of this obligation .
it is important for europol and eurojust to be associated with as many joint investigation teams as possible .
they have to show member states their added value , which is important .
and i think in two or three years this will have changed significantly .
does cooperation between european member states work as well as it should ?
there is certainly room for improvement .
but the cooperation is much better than it was five years ago .
just take the recent plots that have been foiled in europe - in barcelona , in denmark , in germany , and in belgium .
in many of these cases it 's due to a closer cooperation between the different intelligence services and police .
we still have to improve the way all the players are sharing information .
it is not that that obvious at the level of the european union , between the intelligence community and the police community .
it does happen at the national level .
in germany you have a platform within which all the players are sharing information . … i am trying to convince all 27 states to all set up a similar platform .
and after that , we need to improve the network between these 27 platforms .
that is an indirect way to implement the concept of availability , the information-sharing environment that the report of the 9/11 commission in the united states considered to be the top lesson learned from 9/11 . interview : anke hagedorn -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

“ the sparks of corruption prevention must spread to the middle class , ” head of the ti 's german chapter sylvia schenk said in a statement on tuesday .
“ whoever thinks that morality is separable put his business at risk and sends a ruinous signal to his personnel .
the awareness of personal responsibility must increase . ”
the group urged the german government to take concerted measures to tackle corruption in politics .
it said the world 's view of germany has been damaged by the country 's unwillingness to ratify un initiatives against corruption , schenk said .
mid-level companies are also hesitant to engage in anti-corruption strategies , she added .
the 2008 report lists 180 nations on a scale from zero -lrb- highly corrupt -rrb- to 10 -lrb- highly clean -rrb- based on expert assessments and opinion surveys of public sector corruption .
denmark , new zealand and sweden share the highest score at 9.3 , followed immediately by singapore at 9.2 .
bringing up the rear is somalia at 1.0 , slightly trailing iraq and myanmar at 1.3 and haiti at 1.4 .
the report noted significant declines in the scores of bulgaria , burundi , norway and britain , while strong improvements over last year were identified in cyprus , georgia , nigeria , qatar , south korea and turkey .
whether in high or low-income countries , the challenge of reigning in corruption requires functioning institutions in government and other sections of society , transparency said .
" a humanitarian disaster " poorer countries are often plagued by corrupt judiciaries and ineffective parliamentary oversight , the group said .
" in the poorest countries , corruption levels can mean the difference between life and death , when money for hospitals or clean water is in play , " the organization 's chairperson , huguette labelle said .
" the continuing high levels of corruption and poverty plaguing many of the world 's societies amount to an ongoing humanitarian disaster and can not be tolerated , " she said in presenting the organization 's annual corruption perceptions index in berlin on monday , sept .
22 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany had less corporate corruption ' strong oversight required ' wealthy countries , on the other hand , show evidence of insufficient regulation of the private sector in terms of addressing overseas bribery by their companies , and weak oversight of financial institutions and transactions , it added .
" stemming corruption requires strong oversight through parliaments , law enforcement , independent media and a vibrant civil society , " said labelle .
" when these institutions are weak , corruption spirals out of control with horrendous consequences for ordinary people , and for justice and equality in societies , " she said .
the anti-corruption guardian also referred to corporate bribery and the questionable methods of companies in acquiring and managing overseas business .
' unacceptable double-standard ' " the continuing emergence of foreign bribery scandals indicates a broader failure by the world 's wealthiest countries to live up to the promise of mutual accountability in the fight against corruption , it said .
" this sort of double standard is unacceptable and disregards international legal standards , " said labelle .
" beyond its corrosive effects on the rule of law and public confidence ... it undermines the credibility of the wealthiest nations in calling for greater action to fight corruption by low-income countries .

health minister edwina hart wants to gauge public opinion on whether the assembly government should seek a legislative change .
last week ms hart rejected the assembly health committee 's recommendation that ministers should not seek powers to bring in such a system .
events will be held and a discussion document will also be issued .
unlike the current ' opt-in ' system , presumed consent is an ' opt-out ' system where it would be presumed organs would be available for transplant unless an individual had formally registered against it .
ms hart said : " around 470 people in wales are currently waiting for an organ transplant , but with a desperate shortage of donors many face the reality of having to wait years and the possibility they may even die while waiting .
" although the assembly government is already funding campaigns to increase the number of donors , a shortage of organs still remains so it is my belief that we should examine more closely the issue of introducing a system of presumed consent . "
in july , the nine-member health , wellbeing and local government committee rejected the idea of adopting the system of presumed consent for organ donation .
they voted down a proposal to apply for a legislative competence order -lrb- lco -rrb- , which would give the assembly the power to bring in such a system in wales , by six votes to three .
ms hart said she did not believe the committee 's report " adequately reflected the evidence it received in relation to presumed consent " .
ms hart said she was committed to increasing capacity in transplant services nearly half of the people surveyed for the report said they would like their organs taken automatically after their death to save a life .
" however , i recognise that any changes to legislation would require further wide-ranging consultation and testing of public opinion as this is a sensitive and emotive issue , " ms hart added .
the debates and discussion paper will examine the public 's view of a range of systems such as ' hard ' and ' soft ' presumed consent .
a distinction is often drawn between ' soft ' and ' hard ' versions of an opt-out system .
in the ' soft ' version relatives are allowed to veto the removal of the organs of their relative , and in the ' hard ' version , this veto is not present .
the soft version can be found in belgium and spain , and the hard version in austria .
the public will also be asked whether certain organs should be excluded from any new system .
mrs hart added : " regardless of whether we go down the route of introducing a system of presumed consent , we are committed to encouraging more people to become organ donors .
" we are also committed to increasing capacity in transplant services , as shown by our investment in a new renal transplant facility in south wales . "
prime minister gordon brown has spoken in favour of presumed consent and a uk government taskforce is due to report on the issue over the next few months .

health minister edwina hart wants to gauge public opinion on whether the assembly government should seek a legislative change .
last week ms hart rejected the assembly health committee 's recommendation that ministers should not seek powers to bring in such a system .
events will be held and a discussion document will also be issued .
unlike the current ' opt-in ' system , presumed consent is an ' opt-out ' system where it would be presumed organs would be available for transplant unless an individual had formally registered against it .
ms hart said : " around 470 people in wales are currently waiting for an organ transplant , but with a desperate shortage of donors many face the reality of having to wait years and the possibility they may even die while waiting .
" although the assembly government is already funding campaigns to increase the number of donors , a shortage of organs still remains so it is my belief that we should examine more closely the issue of introducing a system of presumed consent . "
in july , the nine-member health , wellbeing and local government committee rejected the idea of adopting the system of presumed consent for organ donation .
they voted down a proposal to apply for a legislative competence order -lrb- lco -rrb- , which would give the assembly the power to bring in such a system in wales , by six votes to three .
ms hart said she did not believe the committee 's report " adequately reflected the evidence it received in relation to presumed consent " .
ms hart said she was committed to increasing capacity in transplant services nearly half of the people surveyed for the report said they would like their organs taken automatically after their death to save a life .
" however , i recognise that any changes to legislation would require further wide-ranging consultation and testing of public opinion as this is a sensitive and emotive issue , " ms hart added .
the debates and discussion paper will examine the public 's view of a range of systems such as ' hard ' and ' soft ' presumed consent .
a distinction is often drawn between ' soft ' and ' hard ' versions of an opt-out system .
in the ' soft ' version relatives are allowed to veto the removal of the organs of their relative , and in the ' hard ' version , this veto is not present .
the soft version can be found in belgium and spain , and the hard version in austria .
the public will also be asked whether certain organs should be excluded from any new system .
mrs hart added : " regardless of whether we go down the route of introducing a system of presumed consent , we are committed to encouraging more people to become organ donors .
" we are also committed to increasing capacity in transplant services , as shown by our investment in a new renal transplant facility in south wales . "
prime minister gordon brown has spoken in favour of presumed consent and a uk government taskforce is due to report on the issue over the next few months .

matt lucas first rose to fame on comedy quiz show shooting stars he is now more widely known for his partnership with david walliams in creating the hit bbc comedy little britain .
its huge success has since spawned a us series , little britain usa , featuring new and existing characters like the much-loved vicky pollard .
the pair are now spearheading the uk launch of comedy website funny or die , which was founded by us actor will ferrell in 2007 .
when did you first discover funny or die and how did you get involved ?
my friend emailed a link to the american site and in particular the will ferrell sketches and it was really funny .
then we were approached to work on the british version and we were really excited .
it 's an interesting site because it mixes material from established comedians with that of aspiring comedians and newcomers .
it 's something we 're really excited to be part of .
what can we expect to see on the site from you ?
the site is going to feature some material from the forthcoming little britain usa show and have some behind the scenes stuff .
and then over the next few months david and me will film some exclusive stuff for the site and the idea is to get other comedians to add stuff to the site , and to have as much material as possible from members of the public .
the aim is to make a dedicated comedy platform .
so how can aspiring comedians get involved ?
you can visit the website and it 'll explain how you can upload material .
tom and mark are some of the new characters created for little britain usa and you 'll also have a blog i hear ?
yes , we 'll be blogging away and letting people know what we 're up to .
we do n't really have a matt and david website so it 'll be our way of communicating outside of the shows themselves .
lots of us stars have appeared on us funny or die - can we expect a list of uk celebs to flex their comedy muscles ?
that 's the idea , we 're just beginning the process of that now .
we have a wish list of comedians but i dare n't mention any as we have n't tied any of them up yet , but i know peter serafinowicz is doing some stuff .
the nice thing about it is if you look at the sort of stuff will ferrell does on the us site , they do stuff in a kind of immediate , relatively lo-fi kind of way .
so whereas little britain requires scripts and re-writes and a big production team , on funny or die if you get an idea you whip out a video camera and muck about and upload it to the site , so there 's a kind of instant , immediate nature to it .
speaking of little britain , on your us show you had a lot of guest stars .
who was the best to work with and why ?
we enjoyed very much working with rosie o 'donnell , who appeared in a marjorie dawes sketch .
she 's great fun to work with and when she walked out the live studio audience were thrilled .
she started off as a stand up comedian so her comic sensibility was very well honed so she knew how to play the sketch .
we also had sting - who we had met on a flight bizarrely a few months earlier , so we were cheeky enough to ask .
we thought he could only say no , but fortunately he said yes so david got to kiss him .
sting had a big beard at the time so i do n't know if david had stubble rash or not .
were you nervous about performing in front of a us audience ?
yes , because we honestly did n't know if anyone would turn up !
we thought no one knows us out here but we were wrong because they had to turn people away .
the audiences were fantastic and unanimously positive .
i was nervous but it faded away once we were in front of them .
the other thing we had was david schwimmer -lsb- of friends fame -rsb- directing .
there 's no better director to work with than someone who 's had experience himself of performing in front of an audience .
we 'd love to work with him again - he 's got a fantastic comedy mind .
rosie o 'donnell features in a sketch with marjorie dawes in little britain usa how does it feel having your catchphrases from the show used in every day language now ?
it 's odd because when we began doing the show it was on radio and then went to bbc three , then bbc two , then bbc one and is now in the us and shown around the world .
yesterday , i was at an airport in budapest and the woman at the check in desk was doing catchphrases at me .
it 's strange to think you 've been involved in the creation of something that 's affected so many people but it 's nice to think you can make people laugh .
i 'm chuffed to bits when i hear somebody do a catchphrase - it puts a smile on my face .
last year you were placed eighth in the list of the uk 's 100 most influential gays and lesbians , how does it feel to be so powerful ?
it 's a power i hope i can wield with responsibility and it 's a power i hope does n't go to my head .
i know that recently we genuinely were named as the people that britain would most like to have a barbecue with .
but i would warn people if they do intend to have a barbecue with us i do have quite a hearty appetite so i 'm not necessarily the most ideal person to invite to a barbecue because i do like my sausages , i do like my burgers and i do like my chicken drumsticks , so you have been warned .

matt lucas first rose to fame on comedy quiz show shooting stars he is now more widely known for his partnership with david walliams in creating the hit bbc comedy little britain .
its huge success has since spawned a us series , little britain usa , featuring new and existing characters like the much-loved vicky pollard .
the pair are now spearheading the uk launch of comedy website funny or die , which was founded by us actor will ferrell in 2007 .
when did you first discover funny or die and how did you get involved ?
my friend emailed a link to the american site and in particular the will ferrell sketches and it was really funny .
then we were approached to work on the british version and we were really excited .
it 's an interesting site because it mixes material from established comedians with that of aspiring comedians and newcomers .
it 's something we 're really excited to be part of .
what can we expect to see on the site from you ?
the site is going to feature some material from the forthcoming little britain usa show and have some behind the scenes stuff .
and then over the next few months david and me will film some exclusive stuff for the site and the idea is to get other comedians to add stuff to the site , and to have as much material as possible from members of the public .
the aim is to make a dedicated comedy platform .
so how can aspiring comedians get involved ?
you can visit the website and it 'll explain how you can upload material .
tom and mark are some of the new characters created for little britain usa and you 'll also have a blog i hear ?
yes , we 'll be blogging away and letting people know what we 're up to .
we do n't really have a matt and david website so it 'll be our way of communicating outside of the shows themselves .
lots of us stars have appeared on us funny or die - can we expect a list of uk celebs to flex their comedy muscles ?
that 's the idea , we 're just beginning the process of that now .
we have a wish list of comedians but i dare n't mention any as we have n't tied any of them up yet , but i know peter serafinowicz is doing some stuff .
the nice thing about it is if you look at the sort of stuff will ferrell does on the us site , they do stuff in a kind of immediate , relatively lo-fi kind of way .
so whereas little britain requires scripts and re-writes and a big production team , on funny or die if you get an idea you whip out a video camera and muck about and upload it to the site , so there 's a kind of instant , immediate nature to it .
speaking of little britain , on your us show you had a lot of guest stars .
who was the best to work with and why ?
we enjoyed very much working with rosie o 'donnell , who appeared in a marjorie dawes sketch .
she 's great fun to work with and when she walked out the live studio audience were thrilled .
she started off as a stand up comedian so her comic sensibility was very well honed so she knew how to play the sketch .
we also had sting - who we had met on a flight bizarrely a few months earlier , so we were cheeky enough to ask .
we thought he could only say no , but fortunately he said yes so david got to kiss him .
sting had a big beard at the time so i do n't know if david had stubble rash or not .
were you nervous about performing in front of a us audience ?
yes , because we honestly did n't know if anyone would turn up !
we thought no one knows us out here but we were wrong because they had to turn people away .
the audiences were fantastic and unanimously positive .
i was nervous but it faded away once we were in front of them .
the other thing we had was david schwimmer -lsb- of friends fame -rsb- directing .
there 's no better director to work with than someone who 's had experience himself of performing in front of an audience .
we 'd love to work with him again - he 's got a fantastic comedy mind .

he went on to form an enduring comic partnership with mel smith .
they were last seen together in a 2005 reunion .
jones has gone on to front a number of factual programmes , including restoration and mountain .
his latest documentary , losing it , takes a look at anger , while he has recently taken over as host of it 'll be alright on the night .
was making a documentary about anger quite a personal journey ?
i offered to use myself as a guinea pig as i 'm a middle-aged man and i lose my temper .
not all the time - i was called " britain 's angriest man " in a preview for the programme , but i very much doubt that !
i decided to use that as a basis to talk to other people about it , but a lot of people did n't want it - it 's a sort of taboo .
a lot of famous people refused point blank to talk about it .
i know there are people in television who 've got themselves into such bad moods that they 've torn down everything around them .
i worry about the effect losing control has on me and other people , but we do have the right to protest .
what experience of anger have you had during your career ?
i 've spent a lot of time working with quite high octane teams of people , and sometimes people do get het up about what 's working or not working - you want them to care about the end result !
the most annoying state of affairs is to find yourself in a situation where people around you do n't care and just want to finish it and get home .
and is there anything specific that really winds you up ?
i get steamed up about taking on too much , things that are beyond my control that means i ca n't fulfil my obligations to people .
i get agitated and tetchy at myself but i do n't get hugely depressed .
how do you juggle your multi-faceted career , including taking over as host of it 'll be alright on the night ?
i 've always had too many strings to my bow but have been moderately competent at what i do .
if i write a book i write it competently and am asked to do another one .
as long as it works , people say ' do some more ' .
it 's strange to find myself doing a saturday night show on itv when a week before i was doing a documentary about thomas hardy .
is there one strand of your career that you particularly enjoy ?
it 's taken a bit of time to become a presenter of documentaries , but i 'm doing quite a lot of that and i really love doing it .
has comedy and straight acting been put on the back burner for the time being ?
i 've been so busy over the past five years that it just has n't happened , but that 's just the way my life has gone .
i do n't go off and twiddle my thumbs but just pick up one of the other things that i do and carried on with that .
are there any plans to get together with mel smith ?
i might push myself to go and say hello !
i see him on a regular basis every couple of months these days .
he 's directing films and i 'm doing what i do , so we do n't do things together very much .
if someone really wanted us to do something , we would .
a dvd collector 's edition of all our work is coming out soon , so it 'll give everyone a chance to decide if it 's best to see the back of us or " why do n't we see more of those two ? "
losing it presented by griff rhys jones begins on 23 september on bbc two at 2100 bst .
he talked to bbc news entertainment reporter michael osborn .

i offered to use myself as a guinea pig as i 'm a middle-aged man and i lose my temper .

he went on to form an enduring comic partnership with mel smith .
they were last seen together in a 2005 reunion .
jones has gone on to front a number of factual programmes , including restoration and mountain .
his latest documentary , losing it , takes a look at anger , while he has recently taken over as host of it 'll be alright on the night .
was making a documentary about anger quite a personal journey ?
i offered to use myself as a guinea pig as i 'm a middle-aged man and i lose my temper .
not all the time - i was called " britain 's angriest man " in a preview for the programme , but i very much doubt that !
i decided to use that as a basis to talk to other people about it , but a lot of people did n't want it - it 's a sort of taboo .
a lot of famous people refused point blank to talk about it .
i know there are people in television who 've got themselves into such bad moods that they 've torn down everything around them .
i worry about the effect losing control has on me and other people , but we do have the right to protest .

advertisement griff loses his temper with builders what experience of anger have you had during your career ?
i 've spent a lot of time working with quite high octane teams of people , and sometimes people do get het up about what 's working or not working - you want them to care about the end result !
the most annoying state of affairs is to find yourself in a situation where people around you do n't care and just want to finish it and get home .
and is there anything specific that really winds you up ?
i get steamed up about taking on too much , things that are beyond my control that means i ca n't fulfil my obligations to people .
i get agitated and tetchy at myself but i do n't get hugely depressed .
how do you juggle your multi-faceted career , including taking over as host of it 'll be alright on the night ?
i 've always had too many strings to my bow but have been moderately competent at what i do .
if i write a book i write it competently and am asked to do another one .
as long as it works , people say ' do some more ' .
it 's strange to find myself doing a saturday night show on itv when a week before i was doing a documentary about thomas hardy .
is there one strand of your career that you particularly enjoy ?
jones has stepped into the shoes of denis norden on itv 's outtake show it 's taken a bit of time to become a presenter of documentaries , but i 'm doing quite a lot of that and i really love doing it .
has comedy and straight acting been put on the back burner for the time being ?
i 've been so busy over the past five years that it just has n't happened , but that 's just the way my life has gone .
i do n't go off and twiddle my thumbs but just pick up one of the other things that i do and carried on with that .
are there any plans to get together with mel smith ?
i might push myself to go and say hello !
i see him on a regular basis every couple of months these days .
he 's directing films and i 'm doing what i do , so we do n't do things together very much .
if someone really wanted us to do something , we would .
a dvd collector 's edition of all our work is coming out soon , so it 'll give everyone a chance to decide if it 's best to see the back of us or " why do n't we see more of those two ? "
losing it presented by griff rhys jones begins on 23 september on bbc two at 2100 bst .
he talked to bbc news entertainment reporter michael osborn .

elaine stephenson , 48 , wed her partner chris johnson , 50 , at bury hospice in february .
she died after battling ovarian cancer for a third time .
ms stephenson was a therapist at the bury cancer support centre , where the calendar girls style wall planner was being launched on tuesday .
actor john henshaw and 12 female staff appear in the charity calendar .
" elaine was a lovely , lively woman who was up for anything and we thought she 'd love this cheeky way of honouring her memory , " said felicia pressman , who works at the centre .
" we all miss her but think she 'd be proud to see how the centre is now open three days a week . "
ms stephenson had beaten ovarian cancer twice in 2002 and 2004 , but the disease returned last year .
she was due to marry mr johnson in august but the wedding was brought forward after doctors warned them her condition had suddenly deteriorated .
about 20 friends and family were present for the ceremony , which was carried out by a registrar graeme ramsden at bury hospice .
bury cancer support centre , which is funded through donations , offers support for cancer sufferers , their immediate families and their carers .
support includes complementary therapies , counselling and regular workshops on advice for coping with cancer .
the calendar also commemorates clive o 'hara , one of the centre managers , who died in june .

the bel royal site - also known as goose green marsh - has flooded on many occasions over the years .
campaigners in st lawrence claimed it should not have been rezoned for homes .
the report , by a committee of inquiry , said the planners ' assessment of drainage on the site as " fair " was , " with hindsight " , an understatement .
the original application in september 2005 by dandara was to build 130 homes .
spring storms this was rejected by planners because of concerns about the number of homes for the land 's size .
a subsequent application for 102 homes was approved in march 2007 .
the committee of inquiry report said the majority of parishioners believed the site would be considered unsuitable for housing due to the flooding issues .
" they clearly did not anticipate the states would decide to rezone the land ; yet once the land had been rezoned , as night follows day , planning permission was going to be given for development , " the report said .
the area was flooded during storms in march this year .
the report has also recommended the public consultation process should be made clearer and more precise so islanders had confidence their views were being listened to .

professor linda cardozo , of king 's college hospital , london , says little evidence exists to advise women on the safety or effectiveness of procedures .
these include operations to make the external appearance more " attractive " and reshaping the vagina to counter laxity after childbirth , for example .
she discussed the issues at a medical meeting in montreal , canada . "
women want to emulate the supermodel .
it 's part of a trend " professor cardozo a google search showed over 45,000 references to cosmetic vaginal surgery , yet on medical databases such as pubmed or medline there were fewer than 100 .
professor cardozo said the most established vaginal cosmetic procedure was reduction labioplasty - a procedure to make the labia smaller - which is requested by women either for aesthetic reasons or to alleviate physical discomfort .
" women want to emulate the supermodel .
it 's part of a trend .
but they should know that all surgery can be risky .
" most of the procedures are done in the private sector and it 's totally unregulated . "
the exact numbers of procedures carried out are unknown .
in the past five years there has been a doubling of the number of labial reductions carried out on the nhs from 400 in 2000/1 to 800 in 2004/5 .
growing trend the evidence from existing case studies shows that the procedure , which costs about £ 2,000 at a private clinic , does have positive aesthetic results but it is unclear whether it resolves feelings of psychological distress or improves sexual functioning , she said .

she said robust research was needed so that doctors could properly advise their patients .
in the meantime , she urged surgeons to remain cautious and operate only as a last resort .
in her presentation at the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists 7th international scientific meeting , professor cardozo said : " cosmetic vaginal procedures raise a number of serious ethical questions .
