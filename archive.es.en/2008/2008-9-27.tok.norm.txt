every stone contains an urn and reservations can be made online .
if demand is low , the height of the pyramid will be reduced .
dutch star architect rem koolhaas is supporting the project that forms part of the architectural contribution updating germany at the venice biennale , which runs until november 23 .
locals were not exactly enthusiastic when plans for such a colossal piece of architecture were first presented several months ago .
despite the prospect of new jobs and pyramid-related tourism , there were protests against the " mass grave . "
nevertheless , supporters of the pyramid are not giving up and are seeking approval for its construction from the dessau city council .
" reasons given by opponents so far have been very irrational , " said thomas busch , an architect and city councilor .
" the region can not afford to let go of such an idea . "
dessau has a reputation as a design and architectural center and is famous for its bauhaus designers like marcel breuer or walter gropius .
concerns over effects of pyramid on local culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : critics say the landscape will be spoit by the tomb critics also see unecso world heritage area gartenreich dessau-woertlitz at risk , just like the rural idyll of streetz village , a possible site for the pyramid .
" that is a divisive issue , " a spokesperson for the local authorities said .
" the village council and the city council oppose the idea . "
the initiators , economist jens thiel and writer ingo niermann , believe in the location , but do not intend to bury their idea if local politics reject it .
" in principle , the pyramid could be built anywhere in the world , " thiel said , adding that the plan had already caused worldwide interest .
the pyramid 's homepage promises that members of all nations and religions , peacefully side by side , could become part of possibly the largest building of humankind .
architects and undertakers see feasibility of project bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch architect rem koolhaas supports the project the german federal cultural foundation supported a simulated version of the project , which might now become reality .
renowned architects have also provided ideas for the project , which ultimately aims to earn money from millions of deceased .
the german association of undertakers believes it 's a feasible idea .
" it 's a community burial ground like any other , " said general manager rolf lichtner .
" if local authorities oversee it , then it 's possible . "
to allay fears , the pyramid supporters are now planning to build a model - " around 15-18 meters high . "
inventor thiel admits that concerns about the size of the building could be one factor causing the resentment and puts it into perspective .
" with 5 million urns the pyramid would be 150 meters high , " he said .
that still is substantially smaller than cologne 's famous cathedral , which stands at 157 meters .
but 5 million urns still were a " hypothetical number that could possibly be reached in 20 or 39 years ' time , " he said .
so far , 1,400 people from 800 countries have stated their interest in the east german pyramid as their final resting place . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 27.09.2008 german eu politician : elections in belarus can not be fair großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lukaschenko is promising the nation a democratic election ahead of sunday 's elections in belarus , the country 's autocratic president hopes to move closer to the eu and has promised fair voting .
but german eu parliamentarian elmar brok says that 's unlikely to happen . a diplomatic ice age currently exists between the eu and belarus .
alexander lukaschenko has been ruling the country autocratically for 14 years .
after the presidential elections in 2006 , which were classified by election observers as manipulated , the eu imposed sanctions on belarus .
since then , " europe 's last dictator " has been denied entry into the eu .
this could change on sunday , sept .
28 , 2008 , when a new parliament is elected in belarus .
lukaschenko has promised a transparent and democratic election .
the belarus government has even invited the organization for security and co-operation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- to monitor the polls .
some 300 osce election monitors will be on site on sunday .
doubtful promise the belarusian opposition does not trust lukaschenko , though .
it is taking part in the election - but only in order to be able to document manipulation .
the eu is also skeptical .
it is expected that the elections " will be pluralistic and will represent a real advance on the way to respecting international and european standards , " eu foreign minister said in a statement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brok is adamant that the eu wo n't recognize an unfair election european parliamentarian elmar brok , a member of german chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union , had greater doubts .
" the term ' fair elections ' can not be used here , not only due to the opposition 's lack of information sources , but also on account of the political pressure on the opposition , " brok told dw-world.de in an interview .
" the opposition is in a much worse starting position than the government . "
tactical games ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smart tactics ?
observers think lukashenko will cozy up to russia if his attempt to get closer to the eu fails lukaschenko has assiduously presented himself as a democrat .
in one of his very few interviews with the western media , he recently emphasized that he has no dictatorial ambitions but rather puts his trust in the will of the belarusian people .
" i would be happy if you could deliver this honest message to the people in europe , " lukaschenko told the british financial times and the german frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
at the same time , lukaschenko threatened to break off all connections with the eu .
if the eu does n't relax its strong position , belarus will look for other allies , he said , naming venezuela and iran in particular .
russia , whose approach in the georgian war was recently applauded by lukaschenko , is a traditional ally .
up to now belarus has yet to recognize the breakaway states of south ossetia and abkhazia .
the new belarus parliament will decide on this , lukaschenko said .
observers see this as a sign that lukaschenko is trying to get closer with to the west , but is still keeping a back door open to russia .
how is europe reacting ? after the elections the eu will also have to decide if it wants to uphold its sanctions against lukaschenko .
in principle , the eu is ready to " review its restrictive measures against the belarusian leadership and take positive and concrete steps , which could lead to a gradual rapprochement with belarus , " eu foreign ministers said .
a requirement could be that the appropriate standards with regard to the election are adhered to .
brussels was also pleased that lukaschenko released three prominent dissenters in august .
among them was the former presidential candidate alexander kosulin .
after the 2006 elections he was sentenced to five and a half years of imprisonment .
the foreign affairs committee of the european parliament has nominated him for this year 's sacharow prize for human rights .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander kosulin " he sat in prison , he showed courage against this repressive , authoritarian regime , " said brok , who is a member of the committee .
the prize winner will be decided upon in october by the executive committee of the european parliament . brok rejects lukaschenko 's threat to sever all ties .
" the eu can not let lukaschenko dictate what the eu views as standards for a democratic election , " he said , adding that the eu should only accept elections which are considered as fair by the osce .
" we will not change our standards on democratic elections based on tactical , opportunistic reasons , " brok said . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this has german investors worried . kgalema motlanthe was sworn in as the new president of south africa on friday , sept 26 . the former trade union leader and deputy leader of the anc -lrb- african national congress -rrb- is widely seen as a caretaker president until next year 's elections , when african national congress leader jacob zuma is expected to take the helm .
the charismatic zuma is a deeply controversial and polarizing figure in south africa .
while the country 's poor celebrate zuma as a savior , the south african business community as well as foreign investors fear a tilt toward the left and away from pro-business policies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kgalema motlanthe has been sworn in as new south african president germany , which is south africa 's biggest trading partner on the african continent , is closely following political developments since the recent exit of president thabo mbeki , who presided over south africa 's longest period of economic growth before the ruling african national congress forced him to resign .
in 2006 , trade between the two countries amounted to 11.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 16.8 billion -rrb- .
around 600 german firms have a presence in the country , hiring a total of 90,000 workers , predominantly in the automobile sector , chemical industry , engineering and electronics .
investors wary of zuma 's left-leaning allies it 's easy to see why foreign investors are drawn to south africa .
the country boasts modern infrastructure , a well-developed banking and financial services sector , a rich supply of raw materials and cheap energy and electricity prices .
but one thing missing on that long list is political and macro stability , the subject of heated debate in south africa .
it 's not just zuma 's deep involvement in a corruption affair that 's rattled investors .
his close links to the powerful cosatu trade union , the south african communist party -lrb- sacp -rrb- as well as to the traditionally influential youth league of the anc have all sparked unease among the country 's foreign trading partners .
andreas wenzel , commissioner for south africa at the hamburg-based africa association , said german companies were jittery about political developments in south africa and closely monitoring the situation , in particular how ministers close to the business-friendly mbeki were reacting .
" they -lrb- german firms -rrb- are adopting a wait-and-see attitude about whether they will continue to have a say in south africa 's business policies or whether the government is going down a new path , " said wenzel , who is currently in south africa with a delegation of german mid-sized companies .
a blessing in disguise ?
in an apparent move to reassure investors rattled by the crisis , president motlanthe on friday reappointed respected finance minister trevor manuel .
manuel is largely considered as a guarantor for south africa 's stable economy with average growth rates of five percent .
that is certain to sooth markets .
some , however , are n't so worried about the economic fallout of the changes in the country 's political leadership , saying it could be a blessing in disguise .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flag-making can be a lucrative business for investors in south africa " i do n't see a fundamental change of course in financial policies when i look at the shadow cabinet that zuma 's presented , " said joergen vogt , ceo of german flag-maker fahnenfleck that 's been in south africa for two years .
the company , which employs 80 people in a factory in pinneberg in northern germany , has four distributors in cape town and johannesburg for south africa 's rainbow-colored national flag and emblems .
" it 's possible that trevor manuel 's stringent financial policies may be weakened but it remains to be seen whether that hurts us as a company that makes and distributes products for the south african market or whether it works to our advantage by allowing us to sell our products to a larger consumer base , " vogt said .
electricity crisis a huge hurdle to investment others point out that mbeki 's business-friendly image and the perception that he ensured south africa 's economic stability and growth during his rule are deceptive .
" a maximum of five percent growth in a country rich in natural reserves during a raw material boom is really the minimum you would expect , " said wolfgang drechsler , long-time correspondent for german business daily handelsblatt in the region .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mbeki 's business-friendly image was n't all it was made out to be , critics say mbeki actually failed in a lot of things , particularly in the electricity crisis , drechsler said .
" when he -lrb- mbeki -rrb- and nelson mandela came to power in 1994 , the country had electricity reserves of 31 percent .
that 's completely melted away today because the government just twiddled its thumbs and did nothing for 10 years , " he added .
the massive electricity crisis , in addition to mounting violent crime and a recent spate of xenophobic attacks , remains the biggest impediment to foreign investment in south africa .
the country 's national electricity provider eskom does n't come close to filling the huge demand for it , ensuring that blackouts are a near daily occurrence .
vogt , the optimistic german investor , agreed that electricity was the single-biggest challenge to his business .
" that 's a key factor we need to consider when we think of building an energy-intensive plant in south africa , " he said .
ironically , south africa 's electricity crisis could provide a big chance for german energy firms .
the country has plans to drastically expand its electricity production by 2012 .
wenzel said he was in south africa with a delegation commissioned by the german economics ministry to size up opportunities for german firms to help the country boost its energy supply .
" south africa needs reconciliation " despite its economic challenges , it 's not just business policies that will seal the fate of the rainbow nation but rather the ability to unite the deeply divided country , some say .
" zuma is certainly no angel , " drechsler said .
" he 's a man with a lot of flaws but he 's shown that he 's pragmatic in everything that he 's done and he has a high emotional intelligence which means he 's someone who can heal divisions - that 's exactly what south africa needs . "
south africa does n't need business gurus because it 's a country that 's disciplined by the markets , the journalist said .
" what south africa still needs - particularly now after thabo mbeki so deeply divided society - is reconciliation , " drechsler said . ludger schadomsky -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bbc news website took a look to see whether or not they were telling the whole truth .
kissinger 's position on talks with iran claim : barack obama said : " senator mccain mentioned henry kissinger , who 's one of his advisers , who , along with five recent secretaries of state , just said that we should meet with iran - guess what - without precondition . "
mr mccain countered by saying : " dr kissinger did not say that he would approve of face-to-face meetings between the president of the united states and the president - and ahmadinejad . "
fact : cbs news spoke to henry kissinger on 25 september and asked him to clarify his position on us talks with iran .
he told them he " supports talks , if not with ahmadinejad , then with high level iranian officials ... without preconditions " .
and dr kissinger , shortly after the debate , issued a statement saying : " senator mccain is right .
i would not recommend the next president of the united states engage in talks with iran at the presidential level .
my views on this issue are entirely compatible with the views of my friend senator john mccain .
we do not agree on everything , but we do agree that any negotiations with iran must be geared to reality . "
verdict : mr obama was correct to note that dr kissinger favours talks with iran , but , since he was making his remarks in response to a question about his policy of meeting the leader of iran , he could have made it clearer that the former secretary of state did not favour talks at the presidential level .
obama 's position on taxes claim : john mccain said mr obama " has voted in the united states senate to increase taxes on people who make as low as $ 42,000 a year " , to which mr obama replied : " that 's not true " .
fact : to back up their claim , the mccain team has pointed to two votes mr obama made on budget resolutions , one in march 2008 and another in june 2008 .
but budget resolutions are not legally binding - they merely set targets for the committees that write the actual legislation on taxes and spending .
mr obama did vote in favour of a resolution calling for the repeal of george w bush 's tax-cuts , which if enacted would have raised taxes on everyone , including those earning $ 42,000 or more .
but he has made it clear that , as president , he would only increase taxes on couples making $ 250,000 per year , or single people earning $ 200,000 .
verdict : john mccain 's claim is technically accurate , but not a fair reflection of mr obama 's actual policy on taxation .
tax breaks for oil companies claim : mr obama said that " oil companies would get an additional $ 4bn in tax breaks " under john mccain 's tax plan .
fact : john mccain does support a cut in the maximum rate of corporate taxes from 35 % to 25 % .
a study from the center for american progress action fund estimated that such a cut would save the five largest oil companies some $ 3.8bn.
but mr mccain 's corporate tax cut would apply to all companies - not just oil firms .
verdict : mr obama was correct to say that mr mccain would give $ 4bn in tax breaks to oil companies , but it was misleading for him to suggest that only oil companies would get the tax break .
obama 's ' liberal ' ranking claim : john mccain said that barack obama " has the most liberal voting record in the united states senate " .
fact : the non-partisan political magazine , the national journal , conducts an annual study into the voting records of us senators .
in january 2008 , the magazine published its 2007 rankings , concluding that mr obama had been " the most liberal senator in 2007 " .
this ranking was based on analysis of 99 key votes , 33 of which mr obama had missed .
and mr obama had not been rated " most liberal " in 2006 or 2005 -lrb- he ranked 10th in 2006 and 16th in 2005 -rrb- .
verdict : mr mccain has some basis for describing mr obama as the " most liberal " senator - but only in 2007 .
and even that ranking is based on a much smaller sample of votes than many of his fellow senators were rated on .
