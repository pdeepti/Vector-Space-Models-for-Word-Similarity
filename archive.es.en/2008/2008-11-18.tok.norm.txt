17 , marking the occasion , neumann said the restitution was a sign of improving relations between the former wartime foes . " now that the last of the 117 windows from the marienkirche can finally return to their proper place it is a further sign of reconciliation and the friendship between our two countries , " he said . the panels had been removed from the marienkirche during the war to protect them from bombing .
they were stored in the basement of the potsdam neues palais , where they were seized by red army soldiers in 1945 .
the soviet union claimed them as war booty and shipped them back to russia . at the ceremony , kotenev also noted that nazi germany had been guilty of wanton looting during the war and stressed that the process of restoring property to its original owners must be reciprocal . " i would like to stress the word ' mutual ' because there are still harsh critics and the issue of looted art is often treated in the media as one in which it is the russians who owe a debt , " he said .
" it is often carelessly - or intentionally - forgotten that during the raids of the wehrmacht many russian museums were systematically plundered . " nonetheless , he hailed the return of the panels as " a milestone in a process begun fifty years ago . " " a homecoming is always a special experience , " said kotenev .
" especially when that homecoming follows a long absence . " war booty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the panels depict biblical stories such as noah 's ark in 1958 , some 1,5 million works of art were returned to east germany by the soviet union after the hague convention for the protection of cultural property made it illegal to use cultural property as war reparations . previously , moscow declared that art seized by the red army was retribution for the 27 million soviet lives lost during the second world war . however , disputes over art seized during and after the war continued to overshadow german-russian relations since the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 . recent years have seen some of the russian cultural treasures looted by the nazis returned to russia .
russian deputies passed a measure in 1997 declaring artwork seized from germany to be rightful spoils of war to compensate for the sacking of its own collections . but germany has refused to relinquish its claims .
experts say that there are still some 2.5 million objects missing from germany believed to be in the former soviet union . meanwhile in frankfurt , mayor martin patzelt announced that the missing panes in marienkirche 's stained glass windows will now undergo restoration and are expected to be returned to their original position by next year . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we are confident that the banks and the corporation will find a solution , " pfister told dpa after that meeting .
baden-wuerttemberg 's state premier guenther oettinger has said his government is monitoring the situation .
" we 'll be following this topic intensely but prudently , " oettinger said .
" the employees ca n't be left standing there like idiots for something that 's the fault of company directors . "
ludwig merckle said the company had discussed its need for capital with some 40 banks .
" various options are being examined in order to ensure that debts are reduced responsibly , " merckle told the daily suedwest-presse newspaper .
the plans could include selling off some of the merckle group 's prime subsidiaries - in a sign that not even the super-rich can avoid tightening their belts during the economic crisis . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

17 , that the eu members states should develop a common rescue package to help those car manufacturers stricken by the current economic crisis . " if we agree on a common direction forward , we will remain strong within europe and in our competition with other sectors in the world , " steinmeier , the social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- candidate for chancellor , said after meeting with the heads of germany 's largest auto manufacturers on monday . juncker , in an interview with germany 's bild newspaper , agreed . " i agree with the idea of a rescue plan for the automobile industry on a european level , " he said .
" if the us government is prepared to gives billions of dollars to save ford , general motors and chrysler before they fail , then we can not simply watch and abandon our manufacturers in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker sees no sense in individual rescue packages " it now makes little sense for germany , france or italy to try to protect their automobile industry individually .
that can only be done together , " juncker said . european commission chief jose manuel barroso said friday that the eu is ready to take action at the world trade organization if it judges that us aid for its struggling auto industry is " illegal .

" therefore , we must fight to keep the structures which made the automobile industry so strong in germany from disintegrating . " steinmeier 's statements came as the european investment bank -lrb- eib -rrb- , the eu 's lending arm , proposed to increase loans to europe 's ailing auto sector as part of a broader financing plan .

" one of the biggest threats to the auto industry is the current shyness of the banks to take risks , " he said , adding that the financial package provided by the government for german banks was created for such purposes . however , peter bofinger , a member of the german council of economic experts , said the german government should consider putting the ailing manufacturer opel under state control with a view to attracting private investors to support it once the financial crisis has abated . bofinger claimed that the fears that the nationalization of opel could lead to calls for other companies to come under state protection was unfounded .

17 , marking the occasion , neumann said the restitution was a sign of improving relations between the former wartime foes . " now that the last of the 117 windows from the marienkirche can finally return to their proper place it is a further sign of reconciliation and the friendship between our two countries , " he said . the panels had been removed from the marienkirche during the war to protect them from bombing .
they were stored in the basement of the potsdam neues palais , where they were seized by red army soldiers in 1945 .
the soviet union claimed them as war booty and shipped them back to russia . at the ceremony , kotenev also noted that nazi germany had been guilty of wanton looting during the war and stressed that the process of restoring property to its original owners must be reciprocal . " i would like to stress the word ' mutual ' because there are still harsh critics and the issue of looted art is often treated in the media as one in which it is the russians who owe a debt , " he said .
" it is often carelessly - or intentionally - forgotten that during the raids of the wehrmacht many russian museums were systematically plundered . " nonetheless , he hailed the return of the panels as " a milestone in a process begun fifty years ago . " " a homecoming is always a special experience , " said kotenev .
" especially when that homecoming follows a long absence . " war booty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the panels depict biblical stories such as noah 's ark in 1958 , some 1,5 million works of art were returned to east germany by the soviet union after the hague convention for the protection of cultural property made it illegal to use cultural property as war reparations . previously , moscow declared that art seized by the red army was retribution for the 27 million soviet lives lost during the second world war . however , disputes over art seized during and after the war continued to overshadow german-russian relations since the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 . recent years have seen some of the russian cultural treasures looted by the nazis returned to russia .
russian deputies passed a measure in 1997 declaring artwork seized from germany to be rightful spoils of war to compensate for the sacking of its own collections . but germany has refused to relinquish its claims .
experts say that there are still some 2.5 million objects missing from germany believed to be in the former soviet union . meanwhile in frankfurt , mayor martin patzelt announced that the missing panes in marienkirche 's stained glass windows will now undergo restoration and are expected to be returned to their original position by next year . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 18.11.2008 opinion : bailouts fine in moderation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government is set to decide whether to grant ailing german carmaker opel 1 billion euros in credit guarantees .
dw 's karl zawadzky asks whether state support is really the way to go . the government in berlin responded to opel 's cry for help by saying it would study the plea - unlike hessen 's state premier roland koch , who immediately called for a " protective shield " in the form of comprehensive state support for germany 's entire automotive industry and government help totalling 500 million euros -lrb- $ 632 million -rrb- of the state budget .
the government 's more measured response is an eminently sensible one , since the german company owned by general motors is not actually at immediate risk of bankruptcy .
and if regional governments start bailing out individual companies facing insolvency - for whatever reasons - then who knows where that could lead ?
worst-case scenarios executives and union leaders at gm subsidiary opel turned to berlin and the regional governments in the states where opel has factories out of fear that parent company general motors might go bust and will no longer be able to pay back the loans it owes its german subsidiary .
but this would be a worst-case scenario - and an unlikely one , given that in the us , congress is currently working out the details of a $ 25 billion rescue package for america 's big three carmakers general motors , ford , and chrysler .
so there clearly is enough time to weigh the options , instead of acting rashly , and the options do need to be weighed .
for example , it makes no sense to use german taxpayers ' money given the risk that funding will simply end up in the pockets of the american parent company - especially since several years ago , general motors turned opel from a joint stock company into a limited liability company , not least in order to boost control of its subsidiary . after merkel held talks in berlin with carl-peter forster , ceo of general motors europe , hans demant , opel ceo and klaus franz , president of the works council , it became clear that berlin and the regional governments where opel 's factories are based do not intend to abandon the company .

he talked to dw-world about the g20 financial summit and the global economic crisis . dw-world.de : most economists have called the g20 summit a success .
what is your opinion on the summit as a ceo of a global company ? martin richenhagen : the most positive aspect of the summit for agco is that the political leaders first of all identified a problem and secondly started to harmonize and coordinate the action plan .
for a global company , it is very important that you have stable rules and conditions .
for me , it looks likely as that this will happen now . let 's talk briefly about the global financial crisis .
in the us , but also in europe , increasing numbers of companies are suffering , and its not just banks .
how is the agriculture industry affected by the financial meltdown and do you fear that the crisis will spread to more sectors of the economy ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agriculture is n't like most other businesses , according to richenhagen first of all , the farm business is following a slightly different logic .
the farm business is driven by the growing world population .
about 70 million people a year are added to the population .
second , the sector is driven by renewable fuels and third by changing diets in emerging markets like china and india .
therefore , agricultural demand is actually higher than supply and will be higher than supply for many years to come . as far as our company is concerned , we have managed things more carefully over the last few years and our debt-to-capital is down to zero .
we also expect a cash position of $ 600 million for the end of this year .
we work together with pretty good banks , and for many years we have had an agco finance bank helping customers with financing .
with that in mind , i think we are pretty well prepared for this crisis and we will not suffer too much from it . in the united states and in europe there is a heated debate whether the government should bail out giant companies like car manufacturers .
should the government rescue giant companies or let them go bust ? this is a difficult one .
the same managers who do n't normally ask for state or governmental support or partial support are all of a sudden starting to cry for help .
i personally believe companies that have not been managed well , like general motors , should go bankrupt .
their problem is that they have a very bloated organization , they are really not lean enough and this has been the case for at least 20 or 30 years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 18.11.2008 opinion : bailouts fine in moderation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government is set to decide whether to grant ailing german carmaker opel 1 billion euros in credit guarantees .
dw 's karl zawadzky asks whether state support is really the way to go . the government in berlin responded to opel 's cry for help by saying it would study the plea - unlike hessen 's state premier roland koch , who immediately called for a " protective shield " in the form of comprehensive state support for germany 's entire automotive industry and government help totalling 500 million euros -lrb- $ 632 million -rrb- of the state budget .
the government 's more measured response is an eminently sensible one , since the german company owned by general motors is not actually at immediate risk of bankruptcy .
and if regional governments start bailing out individual companies facing insolvency - for whatever reasons - then who knows where that could lead ?
worst-case scenarios executives and union leaders at gm subsidiary opel turned to berlin and the regional governments in the states where opel has factories out of fear that parent company general motors might go bust and will no longer be able to pay back the loans it owes its german subsidiary .
but this would be a worst-case scenario - and an unlikely one , given that in the us , congress is currently working out the details of a $ 25 billion rescue package for america 's big three carmakers general motors , ford , and chrysler .
so there clearly is enough time to weigh the options , instead of acting rashly , and the options do need to be weighed .
for example , it makes no sense to use german taxpayers ' money given the risk that funding will simply end up in the pockets of the american parent company - especially since several years ago , general motors turned opel from a joint stock company into a limited liability company , not least in order to boost control of its subsidiary . after merkel held talks in berlin with carl-peter forster , ceo of general motors europe , hans demant , opel ceo and klaus franz , president of the works council , it became clear that berlin and the regional governments where opel 's factories are based do not intend to abandon the company .
but a bailout will come with strings attached .
and no one has any intention of introducing state support for the entire automotive industry .
many companies , after all , including daimler , bmw , vw and porsche , are currently doing very nicely indeed .
they are certainly not suffering from an acute lack of cash - although a lack of customers is a growing problem .

" workers from new -lrb- eu -rrb- member states have satisfied demand in receiving countries ... without creating any major disruption to unemployment or to the salaries of native workers , " spidla said . and since the free movement of people is " a fundamental right " , governments should " lift their restrictions as soon as possible , " the commissioner said . spidla made his comments while presenting a report showing that the eu 's recent enlargement has not , as some had feared , led to a massive influx of polish plumbers - a symbol of cheap labor - to the eu 's 15 oldest and richest members -lrb- eu-15 -rrb- . the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , poland , slovakia and slovenia , as well as cyprus and malta , all joined the eu in 2004 , while bulgaria and romania followed in 2007 . the commission 's latest estimates show that the share of nationals from the 10 countries that joined in 2004 and who have decided to relocate elsewhere in the eu has risen from 0.2 percent in 2003 to 0.5 percent in 2007 , with most of them heading to britain or ireland . the share of bulgarians and romanians now living in the eu-15 , meanwhile , has increased from 0.2 percent to 0.4 percent over the same period , with most heading for spain or italy . more benefits than problems such migrations have , on balance , brought more benefits than problems by satisfying demand and by meeting skill shortages in the receiving countries , spidla said . officials in brussels also noted that the arrival of workers from new member states tends to increase productivity and ease inflationary pressure , since these workers send part of their salaries back home rather than spending it in their new country of residence . and unlike many illegal immigrants arriving from asia , africa or latin america , eu workers tend to enjoy regular contracts and thus pay taxes . restrictions remain in place when the eu agreed to enlarge its borders , the eu executive in brussels sought to allay the concerns of many by granting " old " eu governments the ability to temporarily restrict the influx of workers from new member states . such restrictions must however be abolished entirely by 2011 for workers from the eight central and eastern european countries that joined in 2004 - and by 2013 for bulgarians and romanians . at the moment , only austria , belgium , denmark and germany maintain some restrictions on workers from the eight countries that joined in 2004 , while workers from bulgaria and romania still face barriers to entry in most eu-15 countries . germany should open up asked whether europe 's biggest employer - germany - should now lift its restrictions , spidla said the commission 's report " shows quite clearly that all countries that have opened up -lrb- their labor markets -rrb- have found it to be a good thing . " the commissioner also noted that since migrant workers tend to go where jobs are available , the current recession would not lead to a major increase in the influx of such workers . governments now have until the end of april to communicate to the commission whether they intend to extend their restrictions .
however , they can only do so if they can show that lifting them would lead to " serious disturbances " to their labor markets . polish migration poles meanwhile do make up the largest immigrant group in the european union , followed by romanians and moroccans , an eu report said tuesday . out of some 3 million immigrants that settled in the eu , some 290,000 were poles , said the eurostat statistics based on 2006 . some 2 million poles went to work in other eu countries since poland joined the european union in 2004 .
poles working abroad have contributed to the ex-communist nation 's prosperity , sending home more than $ 8 billion -lrb- 6.32 billion euros -rrb- in 2007 while helping to cut the jobless rate . about 40 percent of all eu immigrants were eu citizens migrating to another member state .
the remaining 60 percent were from european non-member states , asia , the united states and africa , the report said . spain , followed by germany and britain , saw the largest number of immigrants in 2006 .
luxembourg had the highest rate of immigrants with 28.8 per 1,000 inhabitants . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

17 , that the eu members states should develop a common rescue package to help those car manufacturers stricken by the current economic crisis . " if we agree on a common direction forward , we will remain strong within europe and in our competition with other sectors in the world , " steinmeier , the social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- candidate for chancellor , said after meeting with the heads of germany 's largest auto manufacturers on monday . juncker , in an interview with germany 's bild newspaper , agreed . " i agree with the idea of a rescue plan for the automobile industry on a european level , " he said .
" if the us government is prepared to gives billions of dollars to save ford , general motors and chrysler before they fail , then we can not simply watch and abandon our manufacturers in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker sees no sense in individual rescue packages " it now makes little sense for germany , france or italy to try to protect their automobile industry individually .
that can only be done together , " juncker said . european commission chief jose manuel barroso said friday that the eu is ready to take action at the world trade organization if it judges that us aid for its struggling auto industry is " illegal . " the us congress approved an aid package worth $ 25 billion -lrb- 19.7 billion euros -rrb- in september to help the auto industry invest in new generation technology but no timetable was fixed for payments to be made . meanwhile , european automakers - who have cast an envious eye at the us plan and called for similar action at home - have been forced to close factories and cut jobs . protection needed to support healthy firms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier wants to protect firms from becoming affected " we must prevent healthy enterprises from becoming affected -lrb- by this crisis -rrb- , " steinmeier said .
" therefore , we must fight to keep the structures which made the automobile industry so strong in germany from disintegrating . " steinmeier 's statements came as the european investment bank -lrb- eib -rrb- , the eu 's lending arm , proposed to increase loans to europe 's ailing auto sector as part of a broader financing plan . " the eib will propose -lrb- to eu finance ministers -rrb- an increase of 20-30 percent , and that corresponds to 10 to 15 billion euros , " more money for both 2009 and 2010 - including help to small- and medium-sized businesses - a spokesman for the luxembourg-based bank told reporters . the eib has handed out an average of 2 billion euros in loans to the automobile sector in the past three years . french finance minister christine lagarde , whose country currently holds the eu rotating presidency , said monday that support for the sector was first of all a matter for the eib , which was working on the dossier . steinmeier : german banks should use bailout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin bailed-out the banks so other sectors could benefit steinmeier also urged the banking sector to provide more support for the car industry by being more generous in its granting of credit . " one of the biggest threats to the auto industry is the current shyness of the banks to take risks , " he said , adding that the financial package provided by the government for german banks was created for such purposes . however , peter bofinger , a member of the german council of economic experts , said the german government should consider putting the ailing manufacturer opel under state control with a view to attracting private investors to support it once the financial crisis has abated . bofinger claimed that the fears that the nationalization of opel could lead to calls for other companies to come under state protection was unfounded . " with a temporary nationalization , i see little danger that other companies would follow , " he said in an interview with the munich 's merkur newspaper .
" most german carmakers and suppliers would have no interest in being temporarily taken into state ownership . " german chancellor angela merkel spent most of monday locked in discussions with opel bosses but emerged from the lengthy negotiations without reaching a decision on potential state aid .
merkel told reporters that the issue would be debated again and that a decision would be made before christmas . economic experts suspicious of nationalization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel is still waiting for a green light for its state aid otto kentzler , the president of the german confederation of skilled crafts -lrb- zdh -rrb- supported the idea of temporarily nationalizing opel , as it would " support and protect many jobs , not only in the automobile industry but in the manufacturing sector and supply industry . " but mario ohoven , the president of the federal association of medium-size enterprises -lrb- bvmw -rrb- said he believes that smaller companies would suffer should the government support opel . " medium-size enterprises die quietly and unnoticed while large-scale enterprises are saved by the state , " he said , adding that merkel risked making a huge mistake by providing the automakers with a billion-euro emergency parachute as more companies would then demand the same . volker treier , chief economist for the german chamber of commerce and industry -lrb- dihk -rrb- , said nationalization should only be used when there are no other options . " government interference should only be necessary in a crisis as the last resort and then only if areas of the national economy are in danger without this nationalization , " he said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he talked to dw-world about the g20 financial summit and the global economic crisis . dw-world.de : most economists have called the g20 summit a success .
what is your opinion on the summit as a ceo of a global company ? martin richenhagen : the most positive aspect of the summit for agco is that the political leaders first of all identified a problem and secondly started to harmonize and coordinate the action plan .
for a global company , it is very important that you have stable rules and conditions .
for me , it looks likely as that this will happen now . let 's talk briefly about the global financial crisis .
in the us , but also in europe , increasing numbers of companies are suffering , and its not just banks .
how is the agriculture industry affected by the financial meltdown and do you fear that the crisis will spread to more sectors of the economy ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agriculture is n't like most other businesses , according to richenhagen first of all , the farm business is following a slightly different logic .
the farm business is driven by the growing world population .
about 70 million people a year are added to the population .
second , the sector is driven by renewable fuels and third by changing diets in emerging markets like china and india .
therefore , agricultural demand is actually higher than supply and will be higher than supply for many years to come . as far as our company is concerned , we have managed things more carefully over the last few years and our debt-to-capital is down to zero .
we also expect a cash position of $ 600 million for the end of this year .
we work together with pretty good banks , and for many years we have had an agco finance bank helping customers with financing .
with that in mind , i think we are pretty well prepared for this crisis and we will not suffer too much from it . in the united states and in europe there is a heated debate whether the government should bail out giant companies like car manufacturers .
should the government rescue giant companies or let them go bust ? this is a difficult one .
the same managers who do n't normally ask for state or governmental support or partial support are all of a sudden starting to cry for help .
i personally believe companies that have not been managed well , like general motors , should go bankrupt .
their problem is that they have a very bloated organization , they are really not lean enough and this has been the case for at least 20 or 30 years .
they are just a weak management team and therefore the consequence is that they should go bankrupt . interview : michael knigge -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the plan , if approved by the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament , could go into effect in early 2009 . among the most contentious points in the bill are those addressing the expansion of surreptitious online search capabilities and an increase in the bka 's powers to access information from the computers , telephone conversations and homes of suspected terrorists . if enacted the plan would allow " remote forensic software " to search secretly through hard drives and send potentially incriminating evidence back to investigators .
the measure does not , however , allow the police to enter a home in order to install monitoring equipment or software on a computer . unions : constitutional approval needed critics of the law say that it infringes upon privacy rights guaranteed by the constitution . the bka needs a nationally accepted law approved by the federal constitutional court before its measures could go into effect , rainer wendt , the chairman of the german police trade union -lrb- dpolg -rrb- , told the osnabrücker zeitung newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bka president joerg ziercke is a strong advocate of the law konrad freiberg , the chairman of the trade union of the police -lrb- gdp -rrb- , criticized the government for focusing on the " cheap solution " of online searches and failing to address more serious reforms necessary for the bka to fulfill its anti-terror mandate . " it is obvious that the bka is not ready for the creation of these new online searches , " he said , according to the osnabrücker zeitung article . klaus jansen , the head of the federation of german criminal investigative officers , accused the ruling coalition of conservatives and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- of making " putrid political compromises " and bowing to the bka 's demands . he also criticized the measure which would allow the bka to undertake emergency online activities without immediate court approval if such approval is obtained within three days . state parliamentarians agree to reject law the police criticism comes after the spd party congress in the state of saxony agreed over the weekend to reject the proposed law when it comes before the bundesrat .
the spd congress in neighboring saxony-anhalt also agreed to reject the law .
at least one of the states would have to change it position for the bill to be enacted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition to interior minister schaeuble 's plan is growing ralf stegner , the regional chairman of the spd parliamentary group in schleswig-holstein , demanded amendments to the plan before christmas .
the bill had originally been scheduled for vote at the end of november . however , with party rebellions gathering pace around the country and privacy rights advocates joining the police unions in condemning the law , the bill could first go before the federal constitutional court to be judged on its constitutional merits . german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble said he wants to discuss the measure 's necessity - as currently written - with his state interior ministers during a meeting on wednesday . opposition fears unconstitutional " super police " critics in opposition parties have come out against the creation of a " super police force " whose expanded powers , they say , would infringe on privacy and human rights . as well as the online measures , the bill allows the bka to bug , film or photograph the homes of suspected terrorists or places where they are staying .
the tapping of suspects ' telephones and cell phones as well as tracking the location of mobile phone calls would also be permissible . additionally , the bka would be able to perform data-mining searches as a preventative measure rather than as part of criminal proceedings following terrorist attacks .
in certain cases , such data-mining , which would require court approval , can also include the use of data seized from private institutions . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw 's karl zawadzky asks whether state support is really the way to go . the government in berlin responded to opel 's cry for help by saying it would study the plea - unlike hessen 's state premier roland koch , who immediately called for a " protective shield " in the form of comprehensive state support for germany 's entire automotive industry and government help totalling 500 million euros -lrb- $ 632 million -rrb- of the state budget .
the government 's more measured response is an eminently sensible one , since the german company owned by general motors is not actually at immediate risk of bankruptcy .
and if regional governments start bailing out individual companies facing insolvency - for whatever reasons - then who knows where that could lead ?
worst-case scenarios executives and union leaders at gm subsidiary opel turned to berlin and the regional governments in the states where opel has factories out of fear that parent company general motors might go bust and will no longer be able to pay back the loans it owes its german subsidiary .
but this would be a worst-case scenario - and an unlikely one , given that in the us , congress is currently working out the details of a $ 25 billion rescue package for america 's big three carmakers general motors , ford , and chrysler .
so there clearly is enough time to weigh the options , instead of acting rashly , and the options do need to be weighed .
for example , it makes no sense to use german taxpayers ' money given the risk that funding will simply end up in the pockets of the american parent company - especially since several years ago , general motors turned opel from a joint stock company into a limited liability company , not least in order to boost control of its subsidiary . after merkel held talks in berlin with carl-peter forster , ceo of general motors europe , hans demant , opel ceo and klaus franz , president of the works council , it became clear that berlin and the regional governments where opel 's factories are based do not intend to abandon the company .
but a bailout will come with strings attached .
and no one has any intention of introducing state support for the entire automotive industry .

the carmakers need to wake up and smell the coffee . developing new models that reflect changing consumer habits requires time and effort - and possibly even leads to closures and job cuts .
a number of suppliers have already bitten the dust , and if its parent company goes bankrupt , then heads will also roll at opel .
nonetheless , over-impulsive , sweeping aid packages make no sense .
a credit guarantee should be offered on a case-by-case basis , and only after much deliberation .
not only is it a use of taxpayers ' money , it is also a move that gives the company at stake an unfair competitive advantage .
a state aid package is a more favorable financing solution than those available to other companies .

but it remains to be seen whether the case will ever come to trial . the decision announced by the un highest court in the hague on tuesday , sept .
18 , was a narrow one .
" the court ... by 10 votes to seven finds that ... the court has the jurisdiction to entertain the application by the republic of croatia , " said presiding judge rosalyn higgins .
croatian minister of justice ivan simonovic said he was very happy about the judgement .
" we won in round one , " simonovic told a croatian daily newspaper . " now we have round two and that is to prove genocide in croatia , " croatia lodged its complaint against serbia in 1999 .
zagreb said that serbian participation in the croatian war of 1991-1995 amounted to " a form of genocide which resulted in large numbers of croatian citizens being displaced , killed , tortured , or illegally detained as well as extensive property destruction . "
croatia has estimated that some 20,000 people lost their lives in the conflict .
belgrade had argued that the icj did not have jurisdiction over the complaint .
unsettling history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in october 2008 , former croatian-serb leader milan martic was convicted of war crimes zagreb 's accusations stem from the period immediately after the end of the cold war , which saw the disintegration of the serb-dominated federal republic of yugoslavia .
croatia declared independence from yugoslavia in 1991 .
ethnic serbs , who made up 12 percent of the population in croatia , staged an armed insurrection .
with belgrade 's backing , serbs briefly controlled around 30 percent of what is today croatia , declaring the region known as krajina an independent state .
the ethnic serbian forces were later defeated by the croatian national army with the help of western nations , chiefly the us .
hundreds of thousands of people were displaced during the course of the fighting before it finally ended for good in 1995 .
croatia is seeking punishment against serbians it considers responsible for the violence as well as monetary reparations and the return of croatian cultural treasures .
but it could take years for an actual case against serbia to come to trial , and even if proceedings are initiated , zagreb is unlikely to get everything it wants .
last year , in a similar case , the icj controversially cleared belgrade of any direct responsibility for the genocide of thousands of men and boys in the town of srebrenica in bosnia-hercegovina .
rehabilitation attempt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : capturing mladic could be a major step for serbia toward joining the eu in another event related to the balkans ' troubled history , the prosecutor of the un 's international tribunal for the former yugoslavia , david brammertz , held talks with serbian president boris tadic and other officials .
the focus was on whether belgrade was doing enough to hunt down serbs suspected of crimes against humanity , most notably former bosnian-serbian general ratko mladic , who is wanted on charges of genocide .
brammertz declined to give a public statement , but the serbian government said the talks had gone well .
" brammertz underlined the very good cooperation in the past few months with serbia 's institutions , " the cabinet of the serbian prime minister said in a statement .
serbian cooperation with international efforts to bring war criminals to justice is seen as key to belgrade 's bid to join the eu .
serbia hopes to begin the process of accession next year , but some member states like the netherlands want to see belgrade apprehend suspects like mladic before starting any official procedures . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they say the proposed law 's aggressive online evidence-gathering measures are ill-conceived and open to abuse . less than a week after germany 's lower house of parliament approved new anti-terrorism legislation that would vastly expand the cyber-spying powers of the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- , two police trade unions and the german judicial federation demanded that amendments be made to the so-called federal bureau of criminal investigations bill . the bill , backed strongly by chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition government , was passed in the bundestag last week with 375 parliamentarians in favor and 168 against .
the plan , if approved by the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament , could go into effect in early 2009 . among the most contentious points in the bill are those addressing the expansion of surreptitious online search capabilities and an increase in the bka 's powers to access information from the computers , telephone conversations and homes of suspected terrorists . if enacted the plan would allow " remote forensic software " to search secretly through hard drives and send potentially incriminating evidence back to investigators .
the measure does not , however , allow the police to enter a home in order to install monitoring equipment or software on a computer . unions : constitutional approval needed critics of the law say that it infringes upon privacy rights guaranteed by the constitution . the bka needs a nationally accepted law approved by the federal constitutional court before its measures could go into effect , rainer wendt , the chairman of the german police trade union -lrb- dpolg -rrb- , told the osnabrücker zeitung newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bka president joerg ziercke is a strong advocate of the law konrad freiberg , the chairman of the trade union of the police -lrb- gdp -rrb- , criticized the government for focusing on the " cheap solution " of online searches and failing to address more serious reforms necessary for the bka to fulfill its anti-terror mandate . " it is obvious that the bka is not ready for the creation of these new online searches , " he said , according to the osnabrücker zeitung article . klaus jansen , the head of the federation of german criminal investigative officers , accused the ruling coalition of conservatives and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- of making " putrid political compromises " and bowing to the bka 's demands . he also criticized the measure which would allow the bka to undertake emergency online activities without immediate court approval if such approval is obtained within three days . state parliamentarians agree to reject law the police criticism comes after the spd party congress in the state of saxony agreed over the weekend to reject the proposed law when it comes before the bundesrat .
the spd congress in neighboring saxony-anhalt also agreed to reject the law .
at least one of the states would have to change it position for the bill to be enacted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition to interior minister schaeuble 's plan is growing ralf stegner , the regional chairman of the spd parliamentary group in schleswig-holstein , demanded amendments to the plan before christmas .
the bill had originally been scheduled for vote at the end of november . however , with party rebellions gathering pace around the country and privacy rights advocates joining the police unions in condemning the law , the bill could first go before the federal constitutional court to be judged on its constitutional merits . german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble said he wants to discuss the measure 's necessity - as currently written - with his state interior ministers during a meeting on wednesday . opposition fears unconstitutional " super police " critics in opposition parties have come out against the creation of a " super police force " whose expanded powers , they say , would infringe on privacy and human rights . as well as the online measures , the bill allows the bka to bug , film or photograph the homes of suspected terrorists or places where they are staying .
the tapping of suspects ' telephones and cell phones as well as tracking the location of mobile phone calls would also be permissible . additionally , the bka would be able to perform data-mining searches as a preventative measure rather than as part of criminal proceedings following terrorist attacks .
in certain cases , such data-mining , which would require court approval , can also include the use of data seized from private institutions . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in these tough times , even the super-wealthy are n't protected against getting soaked . vw stocks went on a wild ride at the end of october , at one point breaking the 1000-euro -lrb- $ 1,264 -rrb- mark before plummeting back down to earth .
but adolf merckle and his family , who had bought options predicated on the idea of vw share prices falling , got run over .
now the family holding company is trouble .
" the -lsb- holding company -rsb- too has suffered under the extreme turbulence in the financial markets in the past few weeks , " merckle 's son ludwig confirmed to dpa press agency on tuesday , nov .
18 .
the family is reported to have lost as much as one billion euros as it was forced to buy up inflated vw shares .
adolf merckle 's personal wealth has been estimated at $ 9.2 billion .
adding to the family 's woes is the fact that the merkel group , a consortium that includes major cement and pharmaceuticals companies , is reported to be in debt to the tune of 16 billion euros .
now one of germany 's top billionaires is facing the unusual challenge of a personal cash crunch - and the state is not yet stepping in .
no deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : billionaire merckle is now trying to see about a loan adolf merckle met with the economics minister of the state of baden-wuerttemberg , ernst pfister , to discuss the financial troubles of the consortium , which employs some 100,000 people .
but if it was a loan he was after , he was disappointed .
" we are confident that the banks and the corporation will find a solution , " pfister told dpa after that meeting .
baden-wuerttemberg 's state premier guenther oettinger has said his government is monitoring the situation .
" we 'll be following this topic intensely but prudently , " oettinger said .
" the employees ca n't be left standing there like idiots for something that 's the fault of company directors . "
ludwig merckle said the company had discussed its need for capital with some 40 banks .
" various options are being examined in order to ensure that debts are reduced responsibly , " merckle told the daily suedwest-presse newspaper .
the plans could include selling off some of the merckle group 's prime subsidiaries - in a sign that not even the super-rich can avoid tightening their belts during the economic crisis . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 18.11.2008 opinion : bailouts fine in moderation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government is set to decide whether to grant ailing german carmaker opel 1 billion euros in credit guarantees .
dw 's karl zawadzky asks whether state support is really the way to go . the government in berlin responded to opel 's cry for help by saying it would study the plea - unlike hessen 's state premier roland koch , who immediately called for a " protective shield " in the form of comprehensive state support for germany 's entire automotive industry and government help totalling 500 million euros -lrb- $ 632 million -rrb- of the state budget .
the government 's more measured response is an eminently sensible one , since the german company owned by general motors is not actually at immediate risk of bankruptcy .
and if regional governments start bailing out individual companies facing insolvency - for whatever reasons - then who knows where that could lead ?
worst-case scenarios executives and union leaders at gm subsidiary opel turned to berlin and the regional governments in the states where opel has factories out of fear that parent company general motors might go bust and will no longer be able to pay back the loans it owes its german subsidiary .
but this would be a worst-case scenario - and an unlikely one , given that in the us , congress is currently working out the details of a $ 25 billion rescue package for america 's big three carmakers general motors , ford , and chrysler .
so there clearly is enough time to weigh the options , instead of acting rashly , and the options do need to be weighed .
for example , it makes no sense to use german taxpayers ' money given the risk that funding will simply end up in the pockets of the american parent company - especially since several years ago , general motors turned opel from a joint stock company into a limited liability company , not least in order to boost control of its subsidiary . after merkel held talks in berlin with carl-peter forster , ceo of general motors europe , hans demant , opel ceo and klaus franz , president of the works council , it became clear that berlin and the regional governments where opel 's factories are based do not intend to abandon the company .
but a bailout will come with strings attached .
and no one has any intention of introducing state support for the entire automotive industry .
many companies , after all , including daimler , bmw , vw and porsche , are currently doing very nicely indeed .
they are certainly not suffering from an acute lack of cash - although a lack of customers is a growing problem .
out of touch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky partly to blame is a product range that reflects neither the financial crisis nor environmental concerns . with their enormous gas guzzlers , state support would not be enough to pull these companies through a financial crisis .
they need more than bailouts , credit guarantees and stimulus packages .
the consumers simply do n't want these kinds of cars any more - not even in the us , traditionally home to low gas prices and a somewhat undeveloped environmental awareness .
the carmakers need to wake up and smell the coffee . developing new models that reflect changing consumer habits requires time and effort - and possibly even leads to closures and job cuts .
a number of suppliers have already bitten the dust , and if its parent company goes bankrupt , then heads will also roll at opel .
nonetheless , over-impulsive , sweeping aid packages make no sense .
a credit guarantee should be offered on a case-by-case basis , and only after much deliberation .
not only is it a use of taxpayers ' money , it is also a move that gives the company at stake an unfair competitive advantage .
a state aid package is a more favorable financing solution than those available to other companies .
were even financially stable companies which could actually weather the financial crisis under their own steam to start considering this an option , they would all want credit guarantees .
the government needs to avoid companies enjoying what is known as windfall gains - and it also needs to avoid its support ending up in the wrong place .
when it comes to internal funds , after all , multinationals in particular tend to be very " flexible . "
just one cog in the wheel the automotive industry is important , but its role in the economy is not nearly as important as that of the banks .
even so , the state will do what it can to extend lifelines to carmakers facing the abyss .
too many jobs are at stake .
in germany , opel employs 25,000 people , its suppliers another 50,000 .
for the time being , opel 's future appears safe .
but everything depends on general motors .
the government in berlin by all means needs to address the crisis in the automotive industry - and especially opel 's case .
but other economic sectors are also hard hit by the troubled economy .
and while the government might be able to help out the odd company with an occasional loan guarantee , it ca n't afford to rescue entire sectors .

" workers from new -lrb- eu -rrb- member states have satisfied demand in receiving countries ... without creating any major disruption to unemployment or to the salaries of native workers , " spidla said . and since the free movement of people is " a fundamental right " , governments should " lift their restrictions as soon as possible , " the commissioner said . spidla made his comments while presenting a report showing that the eu 's recent enlargement has not , as some had feared , led to a massive influx of polish plumbers - a symbol of cheap labor - to the eu 's 15 oldest and richest members -lrb- eu-15 -rrb- . the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , poland , slovakia and slovenia , as well as cyprus and malta , all joined the eu in 2004 , while bulgaria and romania followed in 2007 . the commission 's latest estimates show that the share of nationals from the 10 countries that joined in 2004 and who have decided to relocate elsewhere in the eu has risen from 0.2 percent in 2003 to 0.5 percent in 2007 , with most of them heading to britain or ireland . the share of bulgarians and romanians now living in the eu-15 , meanwhile , has increased from 0.2 percent to 0.4 percent over the same period , with most heading for spain or italy . more benefits than problems such migrations have , on balance , brought more benefits than problems by satisfying demand and by meeting skill shortages in the receiving countries , spidla said . officials in brussels also noted that the arrival of workers from new member states tends to increase productivity and ease inflationary pressure , since these workers send part of their salaries back home rather than spending it in their new country of residence . and unlike many illegal immigrants arriving from asia , africa or latin america , eu workers tend to enjoy regular contracts and thus pay taxes . restrictions remain in place when the eu agreed to enlarge its borders , the eu executive in brussels sought to allay the concerns of many by granting " old " eu governments the ability to temporarily restrict the influx of workers from new member states . such restrictions must however be abolished entirely by 2011 for workers from the eight central and eastern european countries that joined in 2004 - and by 2013 for bulgarians and romanians . at the moment , only austria , belgium , denmark and germany maintain some restrictions on workers from the eight countries that joined in 2004 , while workers from bulgaria and romania still face barriers to entry in most eu-15 countries . germany should open up asked whether europe 's biggest employer - germany - should now lift its restrictions , spidla said the commission 's report " shows quite clearly that all countries that have opened up -lrb- their labor markets -rrb- have found it to be a good thing . " the commissioner also noted that since migrant workers tend to go where jobs are available , the current recession would not lead to a major increase in the influx of such workers . governments now have until the end of april to communicate to the commission whether they intend to extend their restrictions .
however , they can only do so if they can show that lifting them would lead to " serious disturbances " to their labor markets . polish migration poles meanwhile do make up the largest immigrant group in the european union , followed by romanians and moroccans , an eu report said tuesday . out of some 3 million immigrants that settled in the eu , some 290,000 were poles , said the eurostat statistics based on 2006 . some 2 million poles went to work in other eu countries since poland joined the european union in 2004 .
poles working abroad have contributed to the ex-communist nation 's prosperity , sending home more than $ 8 billion -lrb- 6.32 billion euros -rrb- in 2007 while helping to cut the jobless rate . about 40 percent of all eu immigrants were eu citizens migrating to another member state .
the remaining 60 percent were from european non-member states , asia , the united states and africa , the report said . spain , followed by germany and britain , saw the largest number of immigrants in 2006 .

" workers from new -lrb- eu -rrb- member states have satisfied demand in receiving countries ... without creating any major disruption to unemployment or to the salaries of native workers , " spidla said . and since the free movement of people is " a fundamental right " , governments should " lift their restrictions as soon as possible , " the commissioner said . spidla made his comments while presenting a report showing that the eu 's recent enlargement has not , as some had feared , led to a massive influx of polish plumbers - a symbol of cheap labor - to the eu 's 15 oldest and richest members -lrb- eu-15 -rrb- . the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , poland , slovakia and slovenia , as well as cyprus and malta , all joined the eu in 2004 , while bulgaria and romania followed in 2007 . the commission 's latest estimates show that the share of nationals from the 10 countries that joined in 2004 and who have decided to relocate elsewhere in the eu has risen from 0.2 percent in 2003 to 0.5 percent in 2007 , with most of them heading to britain or ireland . the share of bulgarians and romanians now living in the eu-15 , meanwhile , has increased from 0.2 percent to 0.4 percent over the same period , with most heading for spain or italy . more benefits than problems such migrations have , on balance , brought more benefits than problems by satisfying demand and by meeting skill shortages in the receiving countries , spidla said . officials in brussels also noted that the arrival of workers from new member states tends to increase productivity and ease inflationary pressure , since these workers send part of their salaries back home rather than spending it in their new country of residence . and unlike many illegal immigrants arriving from asia , africa or latin america , eu workers tend to enjoy regular contracts and thus pay taxes . restrictions remain in place when the eu agreed to enlarge its borders , the eu executive in brussels sought to allay the concerns of many by granting " old " eu governments the ability to temporarily restrict the influx of workers from new member states . such restrictions must however be abolished entirely by 2011 for workers from the eight central and eastern european countries that joined in 2004 - and by 2013 for bulgarians and romanians . at the moment , only austria , belgium , denmark and germany maintain some restrictions on workers from the eight countries that joined in 2004 , while workers from bulgaria and romania still face barriers to entry in most eu-15 countries . germany should open up asked whether europe 's biggest employer - germany - should now lift its restrictions , spidla said the commission 's report " shows quite clearly that all countries that have opened up -lrb- their labor markets -rrb- have found it to be a good thing . " the commissioner also noted that since migrant workers tend to go where jobs are available , the current recession would not lead to a major increase in the influx of such workers . governments now have until the end of april to communicate to the commission whether they intend to extend their restrictions .
however , they can only do so if they can show that lifting them would lead to " serious disturbances " to their labor markets . polish migration poles meanwhile do make up the largest immigrant group in the european union , followed by romanians and moroccans , an eu report said tuesday . out of some 3 million immigrants that settled in the eu , some 290,000 were poles , said the eurostat statistics based on 2006 . some 2 million poles went to work in other eu countries since poland joined the european union in 2004 .
poles working abroad have contributed to the ex-communist nation 's prosperity , sending home more than $ 8 billion -lrb- 6.32 billion euros -rrb- in 2007 while helping to cut the jobless rate . about 40 percent of all eu immigrants were eu citizens migrating to another member state .
the remaining 60 percent were from european non-member states , asia , the united states and africa , the report said . spain , followed by germany and britain , saw the largest number of immigrants in 2006 .
luxembourg had the highest rate of immigrants with 28.8 per 1,000 inhabitants . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

17 , marking the occasion , neumann said the restitution was a sign of improving relations between the former wartime foes . " now that the last of the 117 windows from the marienkirche can finally return to their proper place it is a further sign of reconciliation and the friendship between our two countries , " he said . the panels had been removed from the marienkirche during the war to protect them from bombing .
they were stored in the basement of the potsdam neues palais , where they were seized by red army soldiers in 1945 .
the soviet union claimed them as war booty and shipped them back to russia . at the ceremony , kotenev also noted that nazi germany had been guilty of wanton looting during the war and stressed that the process of restoring property to its original owners must be reciprocal . " i would like to stress the word ' mutual ' because there are still harsh critics and the issue of looted art is often treated in the media as one in which it is the russians who owe a debt , " he said .
" it is often carelessly - or intentionally - forgotten that during the raids of the wehrmacht many russian museums were systematically plundered . " nonetheless , he hailed the return of the panels as " a milestone in a process begun fifty years ago . " " a homecoming is always a special experience , " said kotenev .
" especially when that homecoming follows a long absence . " war booty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the panels depict biblical stories such as noah 's ark in 1958 , some 1,5 million works of art were returned to east germany by the soviet union after the hague convention for the protection of cultural property made it illegal to use cultural property as war reparations . previously , moscow declared that art seized by the red army was retribution for the 27 million soviet lives lost during the second world war . however , disputes over art seized during and after the war continued to overshadow german-russian relations since the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 . recent years have seen some of the russian cultural treasures looted by the nazis returned to russia .
russian deputies passed a measure in 1997 declaring artwork seized from germany to be rightful spoils of war to compensate for the sacking of its own collections . but germany has refused to relinquish its claims .
experts say that there are still some 2.5 million objects missing from germany believed to be in the former soviet union . meanwhile in frankfurt , mayor martin patzelt announced that the missing panes in marienkirche 's stained glass windows will now undergo restoration and are expected to be returned to their original position by next year . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the plan , if approved by the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament , could go into effect in early 2009 . among the most contentious points in the bill are those addressing the expansion of surreptitious online search capabilities and an increase in the bka 's powers to access information from the computers , telephone conversations and homes of suspected terrorists . if enacted the plan would allow " remote forensic software " to search secretly through hard drives and send potentially incriminating evidence back to investigators .
the measure does not , however , allow the police to enter a home in order to install monitoring equipment or software on a computer . unions : constitutional approval needed critics of the law say that it infringes upon privacy rights guaranteed by the constitution . the bka needs a nationally accepted law approved by the federal constitutional court before its measures could go into effect , rainer wendt , the chairman of the german police trade union -lrb- dpolg -rrb- , told the osnabrücker zeitung newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bka president joerg ziercke is a strong advocate of the law konrad freiberg , the chairman of the trade union of the police -lrb- gdp -rrb- , criticized the government for focusing on the " cheap solution " of online searches and failing to address more serious reforms necessary for the bka to fulfill its anti-terror mandate . " it is obvious that the bka is not ready for the creation of these new online searches , " he said , according to the osnabrücker zeitung article . klaus jansen , the head of the federation of german criminal investigative officers , accused the ruling coalition of conservatives and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- of making " putrid political compromises " and bowing to the bka 's demands . he also criticized the measure which would allow the bka to undertake emergency online activities without immediate court approval if such approval is obtained within three days . state parliamentarians agree to reject law the police criticism comes after the spd party congress in the state of saxony agreed over the weekend to reject the proposed law when it comes before the bundesrat .
the spd congress in neighboring saxony-anhalt also agreed to reject the law .
at least one of the states would have to change it position for the bill to be enacted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition to interior minister schaeuble 's plan is growing ralf stegner , the regional chairman of the spd parliamentary group in schleswig-holstein , demanded amendments to the plan before christmas .
the bill had originally been scheduled for vote at the end of november . however , with party rebellions gathering pace around the country and privacy rights advocates joining the police unions in condemning the law , the bill could first go before the federal constitutional court to be judged on its constitutional merits . german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble said he wants to discuss the measure 's necessity - as currently written - with his state interior ministers during a meeting on wednesday . opposition fears unconstitutional " super police " critics in opposition parties have come out against the creation of a " super police force " whose expanded powers , they say , would infringe on privacy and human rights . as well as the online measures , the bill allows the bka to bug , film or photograph the homes of suspected terrorists or places where they are staying .
the tapping of suspects ' telephones and cell phones as well as tracking the location of mobile phone calls would also be permissible . additionally , the bka would be able to perform data-mining searches as a preventative measure rather than as part of criminal proceedings following terrorist attacks .
in certain cases , such data-mining , which would require court approval , can also include the use of data seized from private institutions . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

17 , that the eu members states should develop a common rescue package to help those car manufacturers stricken by the current economic crisis . " if we agree on a common direction forward , we will remain strong within europe and in our competition with other sectors in the world , " steinmeier , the social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- candidate for chancellor , said after meeting with the heads of germany 's largest auto manufacturers on monday . juncker , in an interview with germany 's bild newspaper , agreed . " i agree with the idea of a rescue plan for the automobile industry on a european level , " he said .
" if the us government is prepared to gives billions of dollars to save ford , general motors and chrysler before they fail , then we can not simply watch and abandon our manufacturers in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker sees no sense in individual rescue packages " it now makes little sense for germany , france or italy to try to protect their automobile industry individually .
that can only be done together , " juncker said . european commission chief jose manuel barroso said friday that the eu is ready to take action at the world trade organization if it judges that us aid for its struggling auto industry is " illegal . " the us congress approved an aid package worth $ 25 billion -lrb- 19.7 billion euros -rrb- in september to help the auto industry invest in new generation technology but no timetable was fixed for payments to be made . meanwhile , european automakers - who have cast an envious eye at the us plan and called for similar action at home - have been forced to close factories and cut jobs . protection needed to support healthy firms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier wants to protect firms from becoming affected " we must prevent healthy enterprises from becoming affected -lrb- by this crisis -rrb- , " steinmeier said .
" therefore , we must fight to keep the structures which made the automobile industry so strong in germany from disintegrating . " steinmeier 's statements came as the european investment bank -lrb- eib -rrb- , the eu 's lending arm , proposed to increase loans to europe 's ailing auto sector as part of a broader financing plan . " the eib will propose -lrb- to eu finance ministers -rrb- an increase of 20-30 percent , and that corresponds to 10 to 15 billion euros , " more money for both 2009 and 2010 - including help to small- and medium-sized businesses - a spokesman for the luxembourg-based bank told reporters . the eib has handed out an average of 2 billion euros in loans to the automobile sector in the past three years . french finance minister christine lagarde , whose country currently holds the eu rotating presidency , said monday that support for the sector was first of all a matter for the eib , which was working on the dossier . steinmeier : german banks should use bailout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin bailed-out the banks so other sectors could benefit steinmeier also urged the banking sector to provide more support for the car industry by being more generous in its granting of credit . " one of the biggest threats to the auto industry is the current shyness of the banks to take risks , " he said , adding that the financial package provided by the government for german banks was created for such purposes . however , peter bofinger , a member of the german council of economic experts , said the german government should consider putting the ailing manufacturer opel under state control with a view to attracting private investors to support it once the financial crisis has abated . bofinger claimed that the fears that the nationalization of opel could lead to calls for other companies to come under state protection was unfounded . " with a temporary nationalization , i see little danger that other companies would follow , " he said in an interview with the munich 's merkur newspaper .
" most german carmakers and suppliers would have no interest in being temporarily taken into state ownership . " german chancellor angela merkel spent most of monday locked in discussions with opel bosses but emerged from the lengthy negotiations without reaching a decision on potential state aid .
merkel told reporters that the issue would be debated again and that a decision would be made before christmas . economic experts suspicious of nationalization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel is still waiting for a green light for its state aid otto kentzler , the president of the german confederation of skilled crafts -lrb- zdh -rrb- supported the idea of temporarily nationalizing opel , as it would " support and protect many jobs , not only in the automobile industry but in the manufacturing sector and supply industry . " but mario ohoven , the president of the federal association of medium-size enterprises -lrb- bvmw -rrb- said he believes that smaller companies would suffer should the government support opel . " medium-size enterprises die quietly and unnoticed while large-scale enterprises are saved by the state , " he said , adding that merkel risked making a huge mistake by providing the automakers with a billion-euro emergency parachute as more companies would then demand the same . volker treier , chief economist for the german chamber of commerce and industry -lrb- dihk -rrb- , said nationalization should only be used when there are no other options . " government interference should only be necessary in a crisis as the last resort and then only if areas of the national economy are in danger without this nationalization , " he said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it remains to be seen whether the case will ever come to trial . the decision announced by the un highest court in the hague on tuesday , sept .
18 , was a narrow one .
" the court ... by 10 votes to seven finds that ... the court has the jurisdiction to entertain the application by the republic of croatia , " said presiding judge rosalyn higgins .
croatian minister of justice ivan simonovic said he was very happy about the judgement .
" we won in round one , " simonovic told a croatian daily newspaper . " now we have round two and that is to prove genocide in croatia , " croatia lodged its complaint against serbia in 1999 .
zagreb said that serbian participation in the croatian war of 1991-1995 amounted to " a form of genocide which resulted in large numbers of croatian citizens being displaced , killed , tortured , or illegally detained as well as extensive property destruction . "
croatia has estimated that some 20,000 people lost their lives in the conflict .
belgrade had argued that the icj did not have jurisdiction over the complaint .
unsettling history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in october 2008 , former croatian-serb leader milan martic was convicted of war crimes zagreb 's accusations stem from the period immediately after the end of the cold war , which saw the disintegration of the serb-dominated federal republic of yugoslavia .
croatia declared independence from yugoslavia in 1991 .
ethnic serbs , who made up 12 percent of the population in croatia , staged an armed insurrection .
with belgrade 's backing , serbs briefly controlled around 30 percent of what is today croatia , declaring the region known as krajina an independent state .
the ethnic serbian forces were later defeated by the croatian national army with the help of western nations , chiefly the us .
hundreds of thousands of people were displaced during the course of the fighting before it finally ended for good in 1995 .
croatia is seeking punishment against serbians it considers responsible for the violence as well as monetary reparations and the return of croatian cultural treasures .
but it could take years for an actual case against serbia to come to trial , and even if proceedings are initiated , zagreb is unlikely to get everything it wants .
last year , in a similar case , the icj controversially cleared belgrade of any direct responsibility for the genocide of thousands of men and boys in the town of srebrenica in bosnia-hercegovina .
rehabilitation attempt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : capturing mladic could be a major step for serbia toward joining the eu in another event related to the balkans ' troubled history , the prosecutor of the un 's international tribunal for the former yugoslavia , david brammertz , held talks with serbian president boris tadic and other officials .
the focus was on whether belgrade was doing enough to hunt down serbs suspected of crimes against humanity , most notably former bosnian-serbian general ratko mladic , who is wanted on charges of genocide .
brammertz declined to give a public statement , but the serbian government said the talks had gone well .
" brammertz underlined the very good cooperation in the past few months with serbia 's institutions , " the cabinet of the serbian prime minister said in a statement .
serbian cooperation with international efforts to bring war criminals to justice is seen as key to belgrade 's bid to join the eu .

" we won in round one , " simonovic told a croatian daily newspaper . " now we have round two and that is to prove genocide in croatia , " croatia lodged its complaint against serbia in 1999 .
zagreb said that serbian participation in the croatian war of 1991-1995 amounted to " a form of genocide which resulted in large numbers of croatian citizens being displaced , killed , tortured , or illegally detained as well as extensive property destruction . "
croatia has estimated that some 20,000 people lost their lives in the conflict .
belgrade had argued that the icj did not have jurisdiction over the complaint .
unsettling history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in october 2008 , former croatian-serb leader milan martic was convicted of war crimes zagreb 's accusations stem from the period immediately after the end of the cold war , which saw the disintegration of the serb-dominated federal republic of yugoslavia .
croatia declared independence from yugoslavia in 1991 .
ethnic serbs , who made up 12 percent of the population in croatia , staged an armed insurrection .
with belgrade 's backing , serbs briefly controlled around 30 percent of what is today croatia , declaring the region known as krajina an independent state .
the ethnic serbian forces were later defeated by the croatian national army with the help of western nations , chiefly the us .
hundreds of thousands of people were displaced during the course of the fighting before it finally ended for good in 1995 .
croatia is seeking punishment against serbians it considers responsible for the violence as well as monetary reparations and the return of croatian cultural treasures .
but it could take years for an actual case against serbia to come to trial , and even if proceedings are initiated , zagreb is unlikely to get everything it wants .
last year , in a similar case , the icj controversially cleared belgrade of any direct responsibility for the genocide of thousands of men and boys in the town of srebrenica in bosnia-hercegovina .
rehabilitation attempt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : capturing mladic could be a major step for serbia toward joining the eu in another event related to the balkans ' troubled history , the prosecutor of the un 's international tribunal for the former yugoslavia , david brammertz , held talks with serbian president boris tadic and other officials .
the focus was on whether belgrade was doing enough to hunt down serbs suspected of crimes against humanity , most notably former bosnian-serbian general ratko mladic , who is wanted on charges of genocide .
brammertz declined to give a public statement , but the serbian government said the talks had gone well .
" brammertz underlined the very good cooperation in the past few months with serbia 's institutions , " the cabinet of the serbian prime minister said in a statement .
serbian cooperation with international efforts to bring war criminals to justice is seen as key to belgrade 's bid to join the eu .

he talked to dw-world about the g20 financial summit and the global economic crisis . dw-world.de : most economists have called the g20 summit a success .
what is your opinion on the summit as a ceo of a global company ? martin richenhagen : the most positive aspect of the summit for agco is that the political leaders first of all identified a problem and secondly started to harmonize and coordinate the action plan .
for a global company , it is very important that you have stable rules and conditions .
for me , it looks likely as that this will happen now . let 's talk briefly about the global financial crisis .
in the us , but also in europe , increasing numbers of companies are suffering , and its not just banks .
how is the agriculture industry affected by the financial meltdown and do you fear that the crisis will spread to more sectors of the economy ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agriculture is n't like most other businesses , according to richenhagen first of all , the farm business is following a slightly different logic .
the farm business is driven by the growing world population .
about 70 million people a year are added to the population .
second , the sector is driven by renewable fuels and third by changing diets in emerging markets like china and india .
therefore , agricultural demand is actually higher than supply and will be higher than supply for many years to come . as far as our company is concerned , we have managed things more carefully over the last few years and our debt-to-capital is down to zero .
we also expect a cash position of $ 600 million for the end of this year .
we work together with pretty good banks , and for many years we have had an agco finance bank helping customers with financing .
with that in mind , i think we are pretty well prepared for this crisis and we will not suffer too much from it . in the united states and in europe there is a heated debate whether the government should bail out giant companies like car manufacturers .
should the government rescue giant companies or let them go bust ? this is a difficult one .
the same managers who do n't normally ask for state or governmental support or partial support are all of a sudden starting to cry for help .
i personally believe companies that have not been managed well , like general motors , should go bankrupt .
their problem is that they have a very bloated organization , they are really not lean enough and this has been the case for at least 20 or 30 years .
they are just a weak management team and therefore the consequence is that they should go bankrupt . interview : michael knigge -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it remains to be seen whether the case will ever come to trial . the decision announced by the un highest court in the hague on tuesday , sept .
18 , was a narrow one .
" the court ... by 10 votes to seven finds that ... the court has the jurisdiction to entertain the application by the republic of croatia , " said presiding judge rosalyn higgins .
croatian minister of justice ivan simonovic said he was very happy about the judgement .
" we won in round one , " simonovic told a croatian daily newspaper . " now we have round two and that is to prove genocide in croatia , " croatia lodged its complaint against serbia in 1999 .
zagreb said that serbian participation in the croatian war of 1991-1995 amounted to " a form of genocide which resulted in large numbers of croatian citizens being displaced , killed , tortured , or illegally detained as well as extensive property destruction . "
croatia has estimated that some 20,000 people lost their lives in the conflict .
belgrade had argued that the icj did not have jurisdiction over the complaint .
unsettling history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in october 2008 , former croatian-serb leader milan martic was convicted of war crimes zagreb 's accusations stem from the period immediately after the end of the cold war , which saw the disintegration of the serb-dominated federal republic of yugoslavia .
croatia declared independence from yugoslavia in 1991 .
ethnic serbs , who made up 12 percent of the population in croatia , staged an armed insurrection .
with belgrade 's backing , serbs briefly controlled around 30 percent of what is today croatia , declaring the region known as krajina an independent state .
the ethnic serbian forces were later defeated by the croatian national army with the help of western nations , chiefly the us .
hundreds of thousands of people were displaced during the course of the fighting before it finally ended for good in 1995 .
croatia is seeking punishment against serbians it considers responsible for the violence as well as monetary reparations and the return of croatian cultural treasures .
but it could take years for an actual case against serbia to come to trial , and even if proceedings are initiated , zagreb is unlikely to get everything it wants .
last year , in a similar case , the icj controversially cleared belgrade of any direct responsibility for the genocide of thousands of men and boys in the town of srebrenica in bosnia-hercegovina .
rehabilitation attempt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : capturing mladic could be a major step for serbia toward joining the eu in another event related to the balkans ' troubled history , the prosecutor of the un 's international tribunal for the former yugoslavia , david brammertz , held talks with serbian president boris tadic and other officials .
the focus was on whether belgrade was doing enough to hunt down serbs suspected of crimes against humanity , most notably former bosnian-serbian general ratko mladic , who is wanted on charges of genocide .
brammertz declined to give a public statement , but the serbian government said the talks had gone well .
" brammertz underlined the very good cooperation in the past few months with serbia 's institutions , " the cabinet of the serbian prime minister said in a statement .
serbian cooperation with international efforts to bring war criminals to justice is seen as key to belgrade 's bid to join the eu .
serbia hopes to begin the process of accession next year , but some member states like the netherlands want to see belgrade apprehend suspects like mladic before starting any official procedures . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

17 , that the eu members states should develop a common rescue package to help those car manufacturers stricken by the current economic crisis . " if we agree on a common direction forward , we will remain strong within europe and in our competition with other sectors in the world , " steinmeier , the social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- candidate for chancellor , said after meeting with the heads of germany 's largest auto manufacturers on monday . juncker , in an interview with germany 's bild newspaper , agreed . " i agree with the idea of a rescue plan for the automobile industry on a european level , " he said .
" if the us government is prepared to gives billions of dollars to save ford , general motors and chrysler before they fail , then we can not simply watch and abandon our manufacturers in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker sees no sense in individual rescue packages " it now makes little sense for germany , france or italy to try to protect their automobile industry individually .
that can only be done together , " juncker said . european commission chief jose manuel barroso said friday that the eu is ready to take action at the world trade organization if it judges that us aid for its struggling auto industry is " illegal . " the us congress approved an aid package worth $ 25 billion -lrb- 19.7 billion euros -rrb- in september to help the auto industry invest in new generation technology but no timetable was fixed for payments to be made . meanwhile , european automakers - who have cast an envious eye at the us plan and called for similar action at home - have been forced to close factories and cut jobs . protection needed to support healthy firms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier wants to protect firms from becoming affected " we must prevent healthy enterprises from becoming affected -lrb- by this crisis -rrb- , " steinmeier said .
" therefore , we must fight to keep the structures which made the automobile industry so strong in germany from disintegrating . " steinmeier 's statements came as the european investment bank -lrb- eib -rrb- , the eu 's lending arm , proposed to increase loans to europe 's ailing auto sector as part of a broader financing plan . " the eib will propose -lrb- to eu finance ministers -rrb- an increase of 20-30 percent , and that corresponds to 10 to 15 billion euros , " more money for both 2009 and 2010 - including help to small- and medium-sized businesses - a spokesman for the luxembourg-based bank told reporters . the eib has handed out an average of 2 billion euros in loans to the automobile sector in the past three years . french finance minister christine lagarde , whose country currently holds the eu rotating presidency , said monday that support for the sector was first of all a matter for the eib , which was working on the dossier . steinmeier : german banks should use bailout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin bailed-out the banks so other sectors could benefit steinmeier also urged the banking sector to provide more support for the car industry by being more generous in its granting of credit . " one of the biggest threats to the auto industry is the current shyness of the banks to take risks , " he said , adding that the financial package provided by the government for german banks was created for such purposes . however , peter bofinger , a member of the german council of economic experts , said the german government should consider putting the ailing manufacturer opel under state control with a view to attracting private investors to support it once the financial crisis has abated . bofinger claimed that the fears that the nationalization of opel could lead to calls for other companies to come under state protection was unfounded . " with a temporary nationalization , i see little danger that other companies would follow , " he said in an interview with the munich 's merkur newspaper .
" most german carmakers and suppliers would have no interest in being temporarily taken into state ownership . " german chancellor angela merkel spent most of monday locked in discussions with opel bosses but emerged from the lengthy negotiations without reaching a decision on potential state aid .
merkel told reporters that the issue would be debated again and that a decision would be made before christmas . economic experts suspicious of nationalization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel is still waiting for a green light for its state aid otto kentzler , the president of the german confederation of skilled crafts -lrb- zdh -rrb- supported the idea of temporarily nationalizing opel , as it would " support and protect many jobs , not only in the automobile industry but in the manufacturing sector and supply industry . " but mario ohoven , the president of the federal association of medium-size enterprises -lrb- bvmw -rrb- said he believes that smaller companies would suffer should the government support opel . " medium-size enterprises die quietly and unnoticed while large-scale enterprises are saved by the state , " he said , adding that merkel risked making a huge mistake by providing the automakers with a billion-euro emergency parachute as more companies would then demand the same . volker treier , chief economist for the german chamber of commerce and industry -lrb- dihk -rrb- , said nationalization should only be used when there are no other options . " government interference should only be necessary in a crisis as the last resort and then only if areas of the national economy are in danger without this nationalization , " he said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

18 .
the family is reported to have lost as much as one billion euros as it was forced to buy up inflated vw shares .
adolf merckle 's personal wealth has been estimated at $ 9.2 billion .
adding to the family 's woes is the fact that the merkel group , a consortium that includes major cement and pharmaceuticals companies , is reported to be in debt to the tune of 16 billion euros .
now one of germany 's top billionaires is facing the unusual challenge of a personal cash crunch - and the state is not yet stepping in .
no deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : billionaire merckle is now trying to see about a loan adolf merckle met with the economics minister of the state of baden-wuerttemberg , ernst pfister , to discuss the financial troubles of the consortium , which employs some 100,000 people .
but if it was a loan he was after , he was disappointed .
" we are confident that the banks and the corporation will find a solution , " pfister told dpa after that meeting .
baden-wuerttemberg 's state premier guenther oettinger has said his government is monitoring the situation .
" we 'll be following this topic intensely but prudently , " oettinger said .
" the employees ca n't be left standing there like idiots for something that 's the fault of company directors . "
ludwig merckle said the company had discussed its need for capital with some 40 banks .
" various options are being examined in order to ensure that debts are reduced responsibly , " merckle told the daily suedwest-presse newspaper .
the plans could include selling off some of the merckle group 's prime subsidiaries - in a sign that not even the super-rich can avoid tightening their belts during the economic crisis . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

17 , marking the occasion , neumann said the restitution was a sign of improving relations between the former wartime foes . " now that the last of the 117 windows from the marienkirche can finally return to their proper place it is a further sign of reconciliation and the friendship between our two countries , " he said . the panels had been removed from the marienkirche during the war to protect them from bombing .
they were stored in the basement of the potsdam neues palais , where they were seized by red army soldiers in 1945 .
the soviet union claimed them as war booty and shipped them back to russia . at the ceremony , kotenev also noted that nazi germany had been guilty of wanton looting during the war and stressed that the process of restoring property to its original owners must be reciprocal . " i would like to stress the word ' mutual ' because there are still harsh critics and the issue of looted art is often treated in the media as one in which it is the russians who owe a debt , " he said .
" it is often carelessly - or intentionally - forgotten that during the raids of the wehrmacht many russian museums were systematically plundered . " nonetheless , he hailed the return of the panels as " a milestone in a process begun fifty years ago . " " a homecoming is always a special experience , " said kotenev .
" especially when that homecoming follows a long absence . " war booty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the panels depict biblical stories such as noah 's ark in 1958 , some 1,5 million works of art were returned to east germany by the soviet union after the hague convention for the protection of cultural property made it illegal to use cultural property as war reparations . previously , moscow declared that art seized by the red army was retribution for the 27 million soviet lives lost during the second world war . however , disputes over art seized during and after the war continued to overshadow german-russian relations since the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 . recent years have seen some of the russian cultural treasures looted by the nazis returned to russia .
russian deputies passed a measure in 1997 declaring artwork seized from germany to be rightful spoils of war to compensate for the sacking of its own collections . but germany has refused to relinquish its claims .
experts say that there are still some 2.5 million objects missing from germany believed to be in the former soviet union . meanwhile in frankfurt , mayor martin patzelt announced that the missing panes in marienkirche 's stained glass windows will now undergo restoration and are expected to be returned to their original position by next year . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they say the proposed law 's aggressive online evidence-gathering measures are ill-conceived and open to abuse . less than a week after germany 's lower house of parliament approved new anti-terrorism legislation that would vastly expand the cyber-spying powers of the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- , two police trade unions and the german judicial federation demanded that amendments be made to the so-called federal bureau of criminal investigations bill . the bill , backed strongly by chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition government , was passed in the bundestag last week with 375 parliamentarians in favor and 168 against .
the plan , if approved by the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament , could go into effect in early 2009 . among the most contentious points in the bill are those addressing the expansion of surreptitious online search capabilities and an increase in the bka 's powers to access information from the computers , telephone conversations and homes of suspected terrorists . if enacted the plan would allow " remote forensic software " to search secretly through hard drives and send potentially incriminating evidence back to investigators .
the measure does not , however , allow the police to enter a home in order to install monitoring equipment or software on a computer . unions : constitutional approval needed critics of the law say that it infringes upon privacy rights guaranteed by the constitution . the bka needs a nationally accepted law approved by the federal constitutional court before its measures could go into effect , rainer wendt , the chairman of the german police trade union -lrb- dpolg -rrb- , told the osnabrücker zeitung newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bka president joerg ziercke is a strong advocate of the law konrad freiberg , the chairman of the trade union of the police -lrb- gdp -rrb- , criticized the government for focusing on the " cheap solution " of online searches and failing to address more serious reforms necessary for the bka to fulfill its anti-terror mandate . " it is obvious that the bka is not ready for the creation of these new online searches , " he said , according to the osnabrücker zeitung article . klaus jansen , the head of the federation of german criminal investigative officers , accused the ruling coalition of conservatives and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- of making " putrid political compromises " and bowing to the bka 's demands . he also criticized the measure which would allow the bka to undertake emergency online activities without immediate court approval if such approval is obtained within three days . state parliamentarians agree to reject law the police criticism comes after the spd party congress in the state of saxony agreed over the weekend to reject the proposed law when it comes before the bundesrat .
the spd congress in neighboring saxony-anhalt also agreed to reject the law .
at least one of the states would have to change it position for the bill to be enacted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition to interior minister schaeuble 's plan is growing ralf stegner , the regional chairman of the spd parliamentary group in schleswig-holstein , demanded amendments to the plan before christmas .
the bill had originally been scheduled for vote at the end of november . however , with party rebellions gathering pace around the country and privacy rights advocates joining the police unions in condemning the law , the bill could first go before the federal constitutional court to be judged on its constitutional merits . german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble said he wants to discuss the measure 's necessity - as currently written - with his state interior ministers during a meeting on wednesday . opposition fears unconstitutional " super police " critics in opposition parties have come out against the creation of a " super police force " whose expanded powers , they say , would infringe on privacy and human rights . as well as the online measures , the bill allows the bka to bug , film or photograph the homes of suspected terrorists or places where they are staying .
the tapping of suspects ' telephones and cell phones as well as tracking the location of mobile phone calls would also be permissible . additionally , the bka would be able to perform data-mining searches as a preventative measure rather than as part of criminal proceedings following terrorist attacks .
in certain cases , such data-mining , which would require court approval , can also include the use of data seized from private institutions . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw 's karl zawadzky asks whether state support is really the way to go . the government in berlin responded to opel 's cry for help by saying it would study the plea - unlike hessen 's state premier roland koch , who immediately called for a " protective shield " in the form of comprehensive state support for germany 's entire automotive industry and government help totalling 500 million euros -lrb- $ 632 million -rrb- of the state budget .
the government 's more measured response is an eminently sensible one , since the german company owned by general motors is not actually at immediate risk of bankruptcy .
and if regional governments start bailing out individual companies facing insolvency - for whatever reasons - then who knows where that could lead ?
worst-case scenarios executives and union leaders at gm subsidiary opel turned to berlin and the regional governments in the states where opel has factories out of fear that parent company general motors might go bust and will no longer be able to pay back the loans it owes its german subsidiary .
but this would be a worst-case scenario - and an unlikely one , given that in the us , congress is currently working out the details of a $ 25 billion rescue package for america 's big three carmakers general motors , ford , and chrysler .
so there clearly is enough time to weigh the options , instead of acting rashly , and the options do need to be weighed .
for example , it makes no sense to use german taxpayers ' money given the risk that funding will simply end up in the pockets of the american parent company - especially since several years ago , general motors turned opel from a joint stock company into a limited liability company , not least in order to boost control of its subsidiary . after merkel held talks in berlin with carl-peter forster , ceo of general motors europe , hans demant , opel ceo and klaus franz , president of the works council , it became clear that berlin and the regional governments where opel 's factories are based do not intend to abandon the company .

but it remains to be seen whether the case will ever come to trial . the decision announced by the un highest court in the hague on tuesday , sept .
18 , was a narrow one .
" the court ... by 10 votes to seven finds that ... the court has the jurisdiction to entertain the application by the republic of croatia , " said presiding judge rosalyn higgins .
croatian minister of justice ivan simonovic said he was very happy about the judgement .
" we won in round one , " simonovic told a croatian daily newspaper . " now we have round two and that is to prove genocide in croatia , " croatia lodged its complaint against serbia in 1999 .
zagreb said that serbian participation in the croatian war of 1991-1995 amounted to " a form of genocide which resulted in large numbers of croatian citizens being displaced , killed , tortured , or illegally detained as well as extensive property destruction . "
croatia has estimated that some 20,000 people lost their lives in the conflict .
belgrade had argued that the icj did not have jurisdiction over the complaint .
unsettling history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in october 2008 , former croatian-serb leader milan martic was convicted of war crimes zagreb 's accusations stem from the period immediately after the end of the cold war , which saw the disintegration of the serb-dominated federal republic of yugoslavia .
croatia declared independence from yugoslavia in 1991 .
ethnic serbs , who made up 12 percent of the population in croatia , staged an armed insurrection .
with belgrade 's backing , serbs briefly controlled around 30 percent of what is today croatia , declaring the region known as krajina an independent state .
the ethnic serbian forces were later defeated by the croatian national army with the help of western nations , chiefly the us .
hundreds of thousands of people were displaced during the course of the fighting before it finally ended for good in 1995 .
croatia is seeking punishment against serbians it considers responsible for the violence as well as monetary reparations and the return of croatian cultural treasures .
but it could take years for an actual case against serbia to come to trial , and even if proceedings are initiated , zagreb is unlikely to get everything it wants .
last year , in a similar case , the icj controversially cleared belgrade of any direct responsibility for the genocide of thousands of men and boys in the town of srebrenica in bosnia-hercegovina .
rehabilitation attempt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : capturing mladic could be a major step for serbia toward joining the eu in another event related to the balkans ' troubled history , the prosecutor of the un 's international tribunal for the former yugoslavia , david brammertz , held talks with serbian president boris tadic and other officials .
the focus was on whether belgrade was doing enough to hunt down serbs suspected of crimes against humanity , most notably former bosnian-serbian general ratko mladic , who is wanted on charges of genocide .
brammertz declined to give a public statement , but the serbian government said the talks had gone well .
" brammertz underlined the very good cooperation in the past few months with serbia 's institutions , " the cabinet of the serbian prime minister said in a statement .
serbian cooperation with international efforts to bring war criminals to justice is seen as key to belgrade 's bid to join the eu .

they say the proposed law 's aggressive online evidence-gathering measures are ill-conceived and open to abuse . less than a week after germany 's lower house of parliament approved new anti-terrorism legislation that would vastly expand the cyber-spying powers of the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- , two police trade unions and the german judicial federation demanded that amendments be made to the so-called federal bureau of criminal investigations bill . the bill , backed strongly by chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition government , was passed in the bundestag last week with 375 parliamentarians in favor and 168 against .
the plan , if approved by the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament , could go into effect in early 2009 . among the most contentious points in the bill are those addressing the expansion of surreptitious online search capabilities and an increase in the bka 's powers to access information from the computers , telephone conversations and homes of suspected terrorists . if enacted the plan would allow " remote forensic software " to search secretly through hard drives and send potentially incriminating evidence back to investigators .
the measure does not , however , allow the police to enter a home in order to install monitoring equipment or software on a computer . unions : constitutional approval needed critics of the law say that it infringes upon privacy rights guaranteed by the constitution . the bka needs a nationally accepted law approved by the federal constitutional court before its measures could go into effect , rainer wendt , the chairman of the german police trade union -lrb- dpolg -rrb- , told the osnabrücker zeitung newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bka president joerg ziercke is a strong advocate of the law konrad freiberg , the chairman of the trade union of the police -lrb- gdp -rrb- , criticized the government for focusing on the " cheap solution " of online searches and failing to address more serious reforms necessary for the bka to fulfill its anti-terror mandate . " it is obvious that the bka is not ready for the creation of these new online searches , " he said , according to the osnabrücker zeitung article . klaus jansen , the head of the federation of german criminal investigative officers , accused the ruling coalition of conservatives and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- of making " putrid political compromises " and bowing to the bka 's demands . he also criticized the measure which would allow the bka to undertake emergency online activities without immediate court approval if such approval is obtained within three days . state parliamentarians agree to reject law the police criticism comes after the spd party congress in the state of saxony agreed over the weekend to reject the proposed law when it comes before the bundesrat .
the spd congress in neighboring saxony-anhalt also agreed to reject the law .
at least one of the states would have to change it position for the bill to be enacted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition to interior minister schaeuble 's plan is growing ralf stegner , the regional chairman of the spd parliamentary group in schleswig-holstein , demanded amendments to the plan before christmas .
the bill had originally been scheduled for vote at the end of november . however , with party rebellions gathering pace around the country and privacy rights advocates joining the police unions in condemning the law , the bill could first go before the federal constitutional court to be judged on its constitutional merits . german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble said he wants to discuss the measure 's necessity - as currently written - with his state interior ministers during a meeting on wednesday . opposition fears unconstitutional " super police " critics in opposition parties have come out against the creation of a " super police force " whose expanded powers , they say , would infringe on privacy and human rights . as well as the online measures , the bill allows the bka to bug , film or photograph the homes of suspected terrorists or places where they are staying .
the tapping of suspects ' telephones and cell phones as well as tracking the location of mobile phone calls would also be permissible . additionally , the bka would be able to perform data-mining searches as a preventative measure rather than as part of criminal proceedings following terrorist attacks .
in certain cases , such data-mining , which would require court approval , can also include the use of data seized from private institutions . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

17 , that the eu members states should develop a common rescue package to help those car manufacturers stricken by the current economic crisis . " if we agree on a common direction forward , we will remain strong within europe and in our competition with other sectors in the world , " steinmeier , the social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- candidate for chancellor , said after meeting with the heads of germany 's largest auto manufacturers on monday . juncker , in an interview with germany 's bild newspaper , agreed . " i agree with the idea of a rescue plan for the automobile industry on a european level , " he said .
" if the us government is prepared to gives billions of dollars to save ford , general motors and chrysler before they fail , then we can not simply watch and abandon our manufacturers in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker sees no sense in individual rescue packages " it now makes little sense for germany , france or italy to try to protect their automobile industry individually .
that can only be done together , " juncker said . european commission chief jose manuel barroso said friday that the eu is ready to take action at the world trade organization if it judges that us aid for its struggling auto industry is " illegal . " the us congress approved an aid package worth $ 25 billion -lrb- 19.7 billion euros -rrb- in september to help the auto industry invest in new generation technology but no timetable was fixed for payments to be made . meanwhile , european automakers - who have cast an envious eye at the us plan and called for similar action at home - have been forced to close factories and cut jobs . protection needed to support healthy firms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier wants to protect firms from becoming affected " we must prevent healthy enterprises from becoming affected -lrb- by this crisis -rrb- , " steinmeier said .
" therefore , we must fight to keep the structures which made the automobile industry so strong in germany from disintegrating . " steinmeier 's statements came as the european investment bank -lrb- eib -rrb- , the eu 's lending arm , proposed to increase loans to europe 's ailing auto sector as part of a broader financing plan . " the eib will propose -lrb- to eu finance ministers -rrb- an increase of 20-30 percent , and that corresponds to 10 to 15 billion euros , " more money for both 2009 and 2010 - including help to small- and medium-sized businesses - a spokesman for the luxembourg-based bank told reporters . the eib has handed out an average of 2 billion euros in loans to the automobile sector in the past three years . french finance minister christine lagarde , whose country currently holds the eu rotating presidency , said monday that support for the sector was first of all a matter for the eib , which was working on the dossier . steinmeier : german banks should use bailout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin bailed-out the banks so other sectors could benefit steinmeier also urged the banking sector to provide more support for the car industry by being more generous in its granting of credit . " one of the biggest threats to the auto industry is the current shyness of the banks to take risks , " he said , adding that the financial package provided by the government for german banks was created for such purposes . however , peter bofinger , a member of the german council of economic experts , said the german government should consider putting the ailing manufacturer opel under state control with a view to attracting private investors to support it once the financial crisis has abated . bofinger claimed that the fears that the nationalization of opel could lead to calls for other companies to come under state protection was unfounded . " with a temporary nationalization , i see little danger that other companies would follow , " he said in an interview with the munich 's merkur newspaper .
" most german carmakers and suppliers would have no interest in being temporarily taken into state ownership . " german chancellor angela merkel spent most of monday locked in discussions with opel bosses but emerged from the lengthy negotiations without reaching a decision on potential state aid .
merkel told reporters that the issue would be debated again and that a decision would be made before christmas . economic experts suspicious of nationalization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel is still waiting for a green light for its state aid otto kentzler , the president of the german confederation of skilled crafts -lrb- zdh -rrb- supported the idea of temporarily nationalizing opel , as it would " support and protect many jobs , not only in the automobile industry but in the manufacturing sector and supply industry . " but mario ohoven , the president of the federal association of medium-size enterprises -lrb- bvmw -rrb- said he believes that smaller companies would suffer should the government support opel . " medium-size enterprises die quietly and unnoticed while large-scale enterprises are saved by the state , " he said , adding that merkel risked making a huge mistake by providing the automakers with a billion-euro emergency parachute as more companies would then demand the same . volker treier , chief economist for the german chamber of commerce and industry -lrb- dihk -rrb- , said nationalization should only be used when there are no other options . " government interference should only be necessary in a crisis as the last resort and then only if areas of the national economy are in danger without this nationalization , " he said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it remains to be seen whether the case will ever come to trial . the decision announced by the un highest court in the hague on tuesday , sept .
18 , was a narrow one .
" the court ... by 10 votes to seven finds that ... the court has the jurisdiction to entertain the application by the republic of croatia , " said presiding judge rosalyn higgins .
croatian minister of justice ivan simonovic said he was very happy about the judgement .
" we won in round one , " simonovic told a croatian daily newspaper . " now we have round two and that is to prove genocide in croatia , " croatia lodged its complaint against serbia in 1999 .
zagreb said that serbian participation in the croatian war of 1991-1995 amounted to " a form of genocide which resulted in large numbers of croatian citizens being displaced , killed , tortured , or illegally detained as well as extensive property destruction . "
croatia has estimated that some 20,000 people lost their lives in the conflict .
belgrade had argued that the icj did not have jurisdiction over the complaint .
unsettling history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in october 2008 , former croatian-serb leader milan martic was convicted of war crimes zagreb 's accusations stem from the period immediately after the end of the cold war , which saw the disintegration of the serb-dominated federal republic of yugoslavia .
croatia declared independence from yugoslavia in 1991 .
ethnic serbs , who made up 12 percent of the population in croatia , staged an armed insurrection .
with belgrade 's backing , serbs briefly controlled around 30 percent of what is today croatia , declaring the region known as krajina an independent state .
the ethnic serbian forces were later defeated by the croatian national army with the help of western nations , chiefly the us .
hundreds of thousands of people were displaced during the course of the fighting before it finally ended for good in 1995 .
croatia is seeking punishment against serbians it considers responsible for the violence as well as monetary reparations and the return of croatian cultural treasures .
but it could take years for an actual case against serbia to come to trial , and even if proceedings are initiated , zagreb is unlikely to get everything it wants .
last year , in a similar case , the icj controversially cleared belgrade of any direct responsibility for the genocide of thousands of men and boys in the town of srebrenica in bosnia-hercegovina .
rehabilitation attempt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : capturing mladic could be a major step for serbia toward joining the eu in another event related to the balkans ' troubled history , the prosecutor of the un 's international tribunal for the former yugoslavia , david brammertz , held talks with serbian president boris tadic and other officials .
the focus was on whether belgrade was doing enough to hunt down serbs suspected of crimes against humanity , most notably former bosnian-serbian general ratko mladic , who is wanted on charges of genocide .
brammertz declined to give a public statement , but the serbian government said the talks had gone well .
" brammertz underlined the very good cooperation in the past few months with serbia 's institutions , " the cabinet of the serbian prime minister said in a statement .
serbian cooperation with international efforts to bring war criminals to justice is seen as key to belgrade 's bid to join the eu .
serbia hopes to begin the process of accession next year , but some member states like the netherlands want to see belgrade apprehend suspects like mladic before starting any official procedures . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they say the proposed law 's aggressive online evidence-gathering measures are ill-conceived and open to abuse . less than a week after germany 's lower house of parliament approved new anti-terrorism legislation that would vastly expand the cyber-spying powers of the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- , two police trade unions and the german judicial federation demanded that amendments be made to the so-called federal bureau of criminal investigations bill . the bill , backed strongly by chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition government , was passed in the bundestag last week with 375 parliamentarians in favor and 168 against .
the plan , if approved by the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament , could go into effect in early 2009 . among the most contentious points in the bill are those addressing the expansion of surreptitious online search capabilities and an increase in the bka 's powers to access information from the computers , telephone conversations and homes of suspected terrorists . if enacted the plan would allow " remote forensic software " to search secretly through hard drives and send potentially incriminating evidence back to investigators .
the measure does not , however , allow the police to enter a home in order to install monitoring equipment or software on a computer . unions : constitutional approval needed critics of the law say that it infringes upon privacy rights guaranteed by the constitution . the bka needs a nationally accepted law approved by the federal constitutional court before its measures could go into effect , rainer wendt , the chairman of the german police trade union -lrb- dpolg -rrb- , told the osnabrücker zeitung newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bka president joerg ziercke is a strong advocate of the law konrad freiberg , the chairman of the trade union of the police -lrb- gdp -rrb- , criticized the government for focusing on the " cheap solution " of online searches and failing to address more serious reforms necessary for the bka to fulfill its anti-terror mandate . " it is obvious that the bka is not ready for the creation of these new online searches , " he said , according to the osnabrücker zeitung article . klaus jansen , the head of the federation of german criminal investigative officers , accused the ruling coalition of conservatives and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- of making " putrid political compromises " and bowing to the bka 's demands . he also criticized the measure which would allow the bka to undertake emergency online activities without immediate court approval if such approval is obtained within three days . state parliamentarians agree to reject law the police criticism comes after the spd party congress in the state of saxony agreed over the weekend to reject the proposed law when it comes before the bundesrat .

17 , that the eu members states should develop a common rescue package to help those car manufacturers stricken by the current economic crisis . " if we agree on a common direction forward , we will remain strong within europe and in our competition with other sectors in the world , " steinmeier , the social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- candidate for chancellor , said after meeting with the heads of germany 's largest auto manufacturers on monday . juncker , in an interview with germany 's bild newspaper , agreed . " i agree with the idea of a rescue plan for the automobile industry on a european level , " he said .
" if the us government is prepared to gives billions of dollars to save ford , general motors and chrysler before they fail , then we can not simply watch and abandon our manufacturers in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker sees no sense in individual rescue packages " it now makes little sense for germany , france or italy to try to protect their automobile industry individually .
that can only be done together , " juncker said . european commission chief jose manuel barroso said friday that the eu is ready to take action at the world trade organization if it judges that us aid for its struggling auto industry is " illegal . " the us congress approved an aid package worth $ 25 billion -lrb- 19.7 billion euros -rrb- in september to help the auto industry invest in new generation technology but no timetable was fixed for payments to be made . meanwhile , european automakers - who have cast an envious eye at the us plan and called for similar action at home - have been forced to close factories and cut jobs . protection needed to support healthy firms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier wants to protect firms from becoming affected " we must prevent healthy enterprises from becoming affected -lrb- by this crisis -rrb- , " steinmeier said .
" therefore , we must fight to keep the structures which made the automobile industry so strong in germany from disintegrating . " steinmeier 's statements came as the european investment bank -lrb- eib -rrb- , the eu 's lending arm , proposed to increase loans to europe 's ailing auto sector as part of a broader financing plan . " the eib will propose -lrb- to eu finance ministers -rrb- an increase of 20-30 percent , and that corresponds to 10 to 15 billion euros , " more money for both 2009 and 2010 - including help to small- and medium-sized businesses - a spokesman for the luxembourg-based bank told reporters . the eib has handed out an average of 2 billion euros in loans to the automobile sector in the past three years . french finance minister christine lagarde , whose country currently holds the eu rotating presidency , said monday that support for the sector was first of all a matter for the eib , which was working on the dossier . steinmeier : german banks should use bailout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin bailed-out the banks so other sectors could benefit steinmeier also urged the banking sector to provide more support for the car industry by being more generous in its granting of credit . " one of the biggest threats to the auto industry is the current shyness of the banks to take risks , " he said , adding that the financial package provided by the government for german banks was created for such purposes . however , peter bofinger , a member of the german council of economic experts , said the german government should consider putting the ailing manufacturer opel under state control with a view to attracting private investors to support it once the financial crisis has abated . bofinger claimed that the fears that the nationalization of opel could lead to calls for other companies to come under state protection was unfounded . " with a temporary nationalization , i see little danger that other companies would follow , " he said in an interview with the munich 's merkur newspaper .
" most german carmakers and suppliers would have no interest in being temporarily taken into state ownership . " german chancellor angela merkel spent most of monday locked in discussions with opel bosses but emerged from the lengthy negotiations without reaching a decision on potential state aid .
merkel told reporters that the issue would be debated again and that a decision would be made before christmas . economic experts suspicious of nationalization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel is still waiting for a green light for its state aid otto kentzler , the president of the german confederation of skilled crafts -lrb- zdh -rrb- supported the idea of temporarily nationalizing opel , as it would " support and protect many jobs , not only in the automobile industry but in the manufacturing sector and supply industry . " but mario ohoven , the president of the federal association of medium-size enterprises -lrb- bvmw -rrb- said he believes that smaller companies would suffer should the government support opel . " medium-size enterprises die quietly and unnoticed while large-scale enterprises are saved by the state , " he said , adding that merkel risked making a huge mistake by providing the automakers with a billion-euro emergency parachute as more companies would then demand the same . volker treier , chief economist for the german chamber of commerce and industry -lrb- dihk -rrb- , said nationalization should only be used when there are no other options . " government interference should only be necessary in a crisis as the last resort and then only if areas of the national economy are in danger without this nationalization , " he said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

17 , marking the occasion , neumann said the restitution was a sign of improving relations between the former wartime foes . " now that the last of the 117 windows from the marienkirche can finally return to their proper place it is a further sign of reconciliation and the friendship between our two countries , " he said . the panels had been removed from the marienkirche during the war to protect them from bombing .
they were stored in the basement of the potsdam neues palais , where they were seized by red army soldiers in 1945 .
the soviet union claimed them as war booty and shipped them back to russia . at the ceremony , kotenev also noted that nazi germany had been guilty of wanton looting during the war and stressed that the process of restoring property to its original owners must be reciprocal . " i would like to stress the word ' mutual ' because there are still harsh critics and the issue of looted art is often treated in the media as one in which it is the russians who owe a debt , " he said .
" it is often carelessly - or intentionally - forgotten that during the raids of the wehrmacht many russian museums were systematically plundered . " nonetheless , he hailed the return of the panels as " a milestone in a process begun fifty years ago . " " a homecoming is always a special experience , " said kotenev .
" especially when that homecoming follows a long absence . " war booty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the panels depict biblical stories such as noah 's ark in 1958 , some 1,5 million works of art were returned to east germany by the soviet union after the hague convention for the protection of cultural property made it illegal to use cultural property as war reparations . previously , moscow declared that art seized by the red army was retribution for the 27 million soviet lives lost during the second world war . however , disputes over art seized during and after the war continued to overshadow german-russian relations since the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 . recent years have seen some of the russian cultural treasures looted by the nazis returned to russia .
russian deputies passed a measure in 1997 declaring artwork seized from germany to be rightful spoils of war to compensate for the sacking of its own collections . but germany has refused to relinquish its claims .
experts say that there are still some 2.5 million objects missing from germany believed to be in the former soviet union . meanwhile in frankfurt , mayor martin patzelt announced that the missing panes in marienkirche 's stained glass windows will now undergo restoration and are expected to be returned to their original position by next year . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

17 , that the eu members states should develop a common rescue package to help those car manufacturers stricken by the current economic crisis . " if we agree on a common direction forward , we will remain strong within europe and in our competition with other sectors in the world , " steinmeier , the social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- candidate for chancellor , said after meeting with the heads of germany 's largest auto manufacturers on monday . juncker , in an interview with germany 's bild newspaper , agreed . " i agree with the idea of a rescue plan for the automobile industry on a european level , " he said .
" if the us government is prepared to gives billions of dollars to save ford , general motors and chrysler before they fail , then we can not simply watch and abandon our manufacturers in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker sees no sense in individual rescue packages " it now makes little sense for germany , france or italy to try to protect their automobile industry individually .
that can only be done together , " juncker said . european commission chief jose manuel barroso said friday that the eu is ready to take action at the world trade organization if it judges that us aid for its struggling auto industry is " illegal . " the us congress approved an aid package worth $ 25 billion -lrb- 19.7 billion euros -rrb- in september to help the auto industry invest in new generation technology but no timetable was fixed for payments to be made . meanwhile , european automakers - who have cast an envious eye at the us plan and called for similar action at home - have been forced to close factories and cut jobs . protection needed to support healthy firms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier wants to protect firms from becoming affected " we must prevent healthy enterprises from becoming affected -lrb- by this crisis -rrb- , " steinmeier said .
" therefore , we must fight to keep the structures which made the automobile industry so strong in germany from disintegrating . " steinmeier 's statements came as the european investment bank -lrb- eib -rrb- , the eu 's lending arm , proposed to increase loans to europe 's ailing auto sector as part of a broader financing plan . " the eib will propose -lrb- to eu finance ministers -rrb- an increase of 20-30 percent , and that corresponds to 10 to 15 billion euros , " more money for both 2009 and 2010 - including help to small- and medium-sized businesses - a spokesman for the luxembourg-based bank told reporters . the eib has handed out an average of 2 billion euros in loans to the automobile sector in the past three years . french finance minister christine lagarde , whose country currently holds the eu rotating presidency , said monday that support for the sector was first of all a matter for the eib , which was working on the dossier . steinmeier : german banks should use bailout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin bailed-out the banks so other sectors could benefit steinmeier also urged the banking sector to provide more support for the car industry by being more generous in its granting of credit . " one of the biggest threats to the auto industry is the current shyness of the banks to take risks , " he said , adding that the financial package provided by the government for german banks was created for such purposes . however , peter bofinger , a member of the german council of economic experts , said the german government should consider putting the ailing manufacturer opel under state control with a view to attracting private investors to support it once the financial crisis has abated . bofinger claimed that the fears that the nationalization of opel could lead to calls for other companies to come under state protection was unfounded . " with a temporary nationalization , i see little danger that other companies would follow , " he said in an interview with the munich 's merkur newspaper .
" most german carmakers and suppliers would have no interest in being temporarily taken into state ownership . " german chancellor angela merkel spent most of monday locked in discussions with opel bosses but emerged from the lengthy negotiations without reaching a decision on potential state aid .
merkel told reporters that the issue would be debated again and that a decision would be made before christmas . economic experts suspicious of nationalization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel is still waiting for a green light for its state aid otto kentzler , the president of the german confederation of skilled crafts -lrb- zdh -rrb- supported the idea of temporarily nationalizing opel , as it would " support and protect many jobs , not only in the automobile industry but in the manufacturing sector and supply industry . " but mario ohoven , the president of the federal association of medium-size enterprises -lrb- bvmw -rrb- said he believes that smaller companies would suffer should the government support opel . " medium-size enterprises die quietly and unnoticed while large-scale enterprises are saved by the state , " he said , adding that merkel risked making a huge mistake by providing the automakers with a billion-euro emergency parachute as more companies would then demand the same . volker treier , chief economist for the german chamber of commerce and industry -lrb- dihk -rrb- , said nationalization should only be used when there are no other options . " government interference should only be necessary in a crisis as the last resort and then only if areas of the national economy are in danger without this nationalization , " he said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the plan , if approved by the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament , could go into effect in early 2009 . among the most contentious points in the bill are those addressing the expansion of surreptitious online search capabilities and an increase in the bka 's powers to access information from the computers , telephone conversations and homes of suspected terrorists . if enacted the plan would allow " remote forensic software " to search secretly through hard drives and send potentially incriminating evidence back to investigators .

17 , that the eu members states should develop a common rescue package to help those car manufacturers stricken by the current economic crisis . " if we agree on a common direction forward , we will remain strong within europe and in our competition with other sectors in the world , " steinmeier , the social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- candidate for chancellor , said after meeting with the heads of germany 's largest auto manufacturers on monday . juncker , in an interview with germany 's bild newspaper , agreed . " i agree with the idea of a rescue plan for the automobile industry on a european level , " he said .
" if the us government is prepared to gives billions of dollars to save ford , general motors and chrysler before they fail , then we can not simply watch and abandon our manufacturers in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker sees no sense in individual rescue packages " it now makes little sense for germany , france or italy to try to protect their automobile industry individually .
that can only be done together , " juncker said . european commission chief jose manuel barroso said friday that the eu is ready to take action at the world trade organization if it judges that us aid for its struggling auto industry is " illegal . " the us congress approved an aid package worth $ 25 billion -lrb- 19.7 billion euros -rrb- in september to help the auto industry invest in new generation technology but no timetable was fixed for payments to be made . meanwhile , european automakers - who have cast an envious eye at the us plan and called for similar action at home - have been forced to close factories and cut jobs . protection needed to support healthy firms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier wants to protect firms from becoming affected " we must prevent healthy enterprises from becoming affected -lrb- by this crisis -rrb- , " steinmeier said .
" therefore , we must fight to keep the structures which made the automobile industry so strong in germany from disintegrating . " steinmeier 's statements came as the european investment bank -lrb- eib -rrb- , the eu 's lending arm , proposed to increase loans to europe 's ailing auto sector as part of a broader financing plan . " the eib will propose -lrb- to eu finance ministers -rrb- an increase of 20-30 percent , and that corresponds to 10 to 15 billion euros , " more money for both 2009 and 2010 - including help to small- and medium-sized businesses - a spokesman for the luxembourg-based bank told reporters . the eib has handed out an average of 2 billion euros in loans to the automobile sector in the past three years . french finance minister christine lagarde , whose country currently holds the eu rotating presidency , said monday that support for the sector was first of all a matter for the eib , which was working on the dossier . steinmeier : german banks should use bailout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin bailed-out the banks so other sectors could benefit steinmeier also urged the banking sector to provide more support for the car industry by being more generous in its granting of credit . " one of the biggest threats to the auto industry is the current shyness of the banks to take risks , " he said , adding that the financial package provided by the government for german banks was created for such purposes . however , peter bofinger , a member of the german council of economic experts , said the german government should consider putting the ailing manufacturer opel under state control with a view to attracting private investors to support it once the financial crisis has abated . bofinger claimed that the fears that the nationalization of opel could lead to calls for other companies to come under state protection was unfounded . " with a temporary nationalization , i see little danger that other companies would follow , " he said in an interview with the munich 's merkur newspaper .
" most german carmakers and suppliers would have no interest in being temporarily taken into state ownership . " german chancellor angela merkel spent most of monday locked in discussions with opel bosses but emerged from the lengthy negotiations without reaching a decision on potential state aid .
merkel told reporters that the issue would be debated again and that a decision would be made before christmas . economic experts suspicious of nationalization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel is still waiting for a green light for its state aid otto kentzler , the president of the german confederation of skilled crafts -lrb- zdh -rrb- supported the idea of temporarily nationalizing opel , as it would " support and protect many jobs , not only in the automobile industry but in the manufacturing sector and supply industry . " but mario ohoven , the president of the federal association of medium-size enterprises -lrb- bvmw -rrb- said he believes that smaller companies would suffer should the government support opel . " medium-size enterprises die quietly and unnoticed while large-scale enterprises are saved by the state , " he said , adding that merkel risked making a huge mistake by providing the automakers with a billion-euro emergency parachute as more companies would then demand the same . volker treier , chief economist for the german chamber of commerce and industry -lrb- dihk -rrb- , said nationalization should only be used when there are no other options . " government interference should only be necessary in a crisis as the last resort and then only if areas of the national economy are in danger without this nationalization , " he said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he talked to dw-world about the g20 financial summit and the global economic crisis . dw-world.de : most economists have called the g20 summit a success .
what is your opinion on the summit as a ceo of a global company ? martin richenhagen : the most positive aspect of the summit for agco is that the political leaders first of all identified a problem and secondly started to harmonize and coordinate the action plan .
for a global company , it is very important that you have stable rules and conditions .
for me , it looks likely as that this will happen now . let 's talk briefly about the global financial crisis .
in the us , but also in europe , increasing numbers of companies are suffering , and its not just banks .
how is the agriculture industry affected by the financial meltdown and do you fear that the crisis will spread to more sectors of the economy ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agriculture is n't like most other businesses , according to richenhagen first of all , the farm business is following a slightly different logic .
the farm business is driven by the growing world population .
about 70 million people a year are added to the population .
second , the sector is driven by renewable fuels and third by changing diets in emerging markets like china and india .
therefore , agricultural demand is actually higher than supply and will be higher than supply for many years to come . as far as our company is concerned , we have managed things more carefully over the last few years and our debt-to-capital is down to zero .
we also expect a cash position of $ 600 million for the end of this year .
we work together with pretty good banks , and for many years we have had an agco finance bank helping customers with financing .
with that in mind , i think we are pretty well prepared for this crisis and we will not suffer too much from it . in the united states and in europe there is a heated debate whether the government should bail out giant companies like car manufacturers .
should the government rescue giant companies or let them go bust ? this is a difficult one .
the same managers who do n't normally ask for state or governmental support or partial support are all of a sudden starting to cry for help .
i personally believe companies that have not been managed well , like general motors , should go bankrupt .
their problem is that they have a very bloated organization , they are really not lean enough and this has been the case for at least 20 or 30 years .
they are just a weak management team and therefore the consequence is that they should go bankrupt . interview : michael knigge -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

17 , marking the occasion , neumann said the restitution was a sign of improving relations between the former wartime foes . " now that the last of the 117 windows from the marienkirche can finally return to their proper place it is a further sign of reconciliation and the friendship between our two countries , " he said . the panels had been removed from the marienkirche during the war to protect them from bombing .
they were stored in the basement of the potsdam neues palais , where they were seized by red army soldiers in 1945 .
the soviet union claimed them as war booty and shipped them back to russia . at the ceremony , kotenev also noted that nazi germany had been guilty of wanton looting during the war and stressed that the process of restoring property to its original owners must be reciprocal . " i would like to stress the word ' mutual ' because there are still harsh critics and the issue of looted art is often treated in the media as one in which it is the russians who owe a debt , " he said .
" it is often carelessly - or intentionally - forgotten that during the raids of the wehrmacht many russian museums were systematically plundered . " nonetheless , he hailed the return of the panels as " a milestone in a process begun fifty years ago . " " a homecoming is always a special experience , " said kotenev .
" especially when that homecoming follows a long absence . " war booty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the panels depict biblical stories such as noah 's ark in 1958 , some 1,5 million works of art were returned to east germany by the soviet union after the hague convention for the protection of cultural property made it illegal to use cultural property as war reparations . previously , moscow declared that art seized by the red army was retribution for the 27 million soviet lives lost during the second world war . however , disputes over art seized during and after the war continued to overshadow german-russian relations since the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 . recent years have seen some of the russian cultural treasures looted by the nazis returned to russia .
russian deputies passed a measure in 1997 declaring artwork seized from germany to be rightful spoils of war to compensate for the sacking of its own collections . but germany has refused to relinquish its claims .
experts say that there are still some 2.5 million objects missing from germany believed to be in the former soviet union . meanwhile in frankfurt , mayor martin patzelt announced that the missing panes in marienkirche 's stained glass windows will now undergo restoration and are expected to be returned to their original position by next year . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

17 , that the eu members states should develop a common rescue package to help those car manufacturers stricken by the current economic crisis . " if we agree on a common direction forward , we will remain strong within europe and in our competition with other sectors in the world , " steinmeier , the social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- candidate for chancellor , said after meeting with the heads of germany 's largest auto manufacturers on monday . juncker , in an interview with germany 's bild newspaper , agreed . " i agree with the idea of a rescue plan for the automobile industry on a european level , " he said .
" if the us government is prepared to gives billions of dollars to save ford , general motors and chrysler before they fail , then we can not simply watch and abandon our manufacturers in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker sees no sense in individual rescue packages " it now makes little sense for germany , france or italy to try to protect their automobile industry individually .
that can only be done together , " juncker said . european commission chief jose manuel barroso said friday that the eu is ready to take action at the world trade organization if it judges that us aid for its struggling auto industry is " illegal . " the us congress approved an aid package worth $ 25 billion -lrb- 19.7 billion euros -rrb- in september to help the auto industry invest in new generation technology but no timetable was fixed for payments to be made . meanwhile , european automakers - who have cast an envious eye at the us plan and called for similar action at home - have been forced to close factories and cut jobs . protection needed to support healthy firms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier wants to protect firms from becoming affected " we must prevent healthy enterprises from becoming affected -lrb- by this crisis -rrb- , " steinmeier said .
" therefore , we must fight to keep the structures which made the automobile industry so strong in germany from disintegrating . " steinmeier 's statements came as the european investment bank -lrb- eib -rrb- , the eu 's lending arm , proposed to increase loans to europe 's ailing auto sector as part of a broader financing plan . " the eib will propose -lrb- to eu finance ministers -rrb- an increase of 20-30 percent , and that corresponds to 10 to 15 billion euros , " more money for both 2009 and 2010 - including help to small- and medium-sized businesses - a spokesman for the luxembourg-based bank told reporters . the eib has handed out an average of 2 billion euros in loans to the automobile sector in the past three years . french finance minister christine lagarde , whose country currently holds the eu rotating presidency , said monday that support for the sector was first of all a matter for the eib , which was working on the dossier . steinmeier : german banks should use bailout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin bailed-out the banks so other sectors could benefit steinmeier also urged the banking sector to provide more support for the car industry by being more generous in its granting of credit . " one of the biggest threats to the auto industry is the current shyness of the banks to take risks , " he said , adding that the financial package provided by the government for german banks was created for such purposes . however , peter bofinger , a member of the german council of economic experts , said the german government should consider putting the ailing manufacturer opel under state control with a view to attracting private investors to support it once the financial crisis has abated . bofinger claimed that the fears that the nationalization of opel could lead to calls for other companies to come under state protection was unfounded . " with a temporary nationalization , i see little danger that other companies would follow , " he said in an interview with the munich 's merkur newspaper .
" most german carmakers and suppliers would have no interest in being temporarily taken into state ownership . " german chancellor angela merkel spent most of monday locked in discussions with opel bosses but emerged from the lengthy negotiations without reaching a decision on potential state aid .
merkel told reporters that the issue would be debated again and that a decision would be made before christmas . economic experts suspicious of nationalization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel is still waiting for a green light for its state aid otto kentzler , the president of the german confederation of skilled crafts -lrb- zdh -rrb- supported the idea of temporarily nationalizing opel , as it would " support and protect many jobs , not only in the automobile industry but in the manufacturing sector and supply industry . " but mario ohoven , the president of the federal association of medium-size enterprises -lrb- bvmw -rrb- said he believes that smaller companies would suffer should the government support opel . " medium-size enterprises die quietly and unnoticed while large-scale enterprises are saved by the state , " he said , adding that merkel risked making a huge mistake by providing the automakers with a billion-euro emergency parachute as more companies would then demand the same . volker treier , chief economist for the german chamber of commerce and industry -lrb- dihk -rrb- , said nationalization should only be used when there are no other options . " government interference should only be necessary in a crisis as the last resort and then only if areas of the national economy are in danger without this nationalization , " he said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw 's karl zawadzky asks whether state support is really the way to go . the government in berlin responded to opel 's cry for help by saying it would study the plea - unlike hessen 's state premier roland koch , who immediately called for a " protective shield " in the form of comprehensive state support for germany 's entire automotive industry and government help totalling 500 million euros -lrb- $ 632 million -rrb- of the state budget .
the government 's more measured response is an eminently sensible one , since the german company owned by general motors is not actually at immediate risk of bankruptcy .
and if regional governments start bailing out individual companies facing insolvency - for whatever reasons - then who knows where that could lead ?
worst-case scenarios executives and union leaders at gm subsidiary opel turned to berlin and the regional governments in the states where opel has factories out of fear that parent company general motors might go bust and will no longer be able to pay back the loans it owes its german subsidiary .
but this would be a worst-case scenario - and an unlikely one , given that in the us , congress is currently working out the details of a $ 25 billion rescue package for america 's big three carmakers general motors , ford , and chrysler .
so there clearly is enough time to weigh the options , instead of acting rashly , and the options do need to be weighed .
for example , it makes no sense to use german taxpayers ' money given the risk that funding will simply end up in the pockets of the american parent company - especially since several years ago , general motors turned opel from a joint stock company into a limited liability company , not least in order to boost control of its subsidiary . after merkel held talks in berlin with carl-peter forster , ceo of general motors europe , hans demant , opel ceo and klaus franz , president of the works council , it became clear that berlin and the regional governments where opel 's factories are based do not intend to abandon the company .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 18.11.2008 opinion : bailouts fine in moderation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government is set to decide whether to grant ailing german carmaker opel 1 billion euros in credit guarantees .
dw 's karl zawadzky asks whether state support is really the way to go . the government in berlin responded to opel 's cry for help by saying it would study the plea - unlike hessen 's state premier roland koch , who immediately called for a " protective shield " in the form of comprehensive state support for germany 's entire automotive industry and government help totalling 500 million euros -lrb- $ 632 million -rrb- of the state budget .
the government 's more measured response is an eminently sensible one , since the german company owned by general motors is not actually at immediate risk of bankruptcy .
and if regional governments start bailing out individual companies facing insolvency - for whatever reasons - then who knows where that could lead ?
worst-case scenarios executives and union leaders at gm subsidiary opel turned to berlin and the regional governments in the states where opel has factories out of fear that parent company general motors might go bust and will no longer be able to pay back the loans it owes its german subsidiary .
but this would be a worst-case scenario - and an unlikely one , given that in the us , congress is currently working out the details of a $ 25 billion rescue package for america 's big three carmakers general motors , ford , and chrysler .
so there clearly is enough time to weigh the options , instead of acting rashly , and the options do need to be weighed .
for example , it makes no sense to use german taxpayers ' money given the risk that funding will simply end up in the pockets of the american parent company - especially since several years ago , general motors turned opel from a joint stock company into a limited liability company , not least in order to boost control of its subsidiary . after merkel held talks in berlin with carl-peter forster , ceo of general motors europe , hans demant , opel ceo and klaus franz , president of the works council , it became clear that berlin and the regional governments where opel 's factories are based do not intend to abandon the company .
but a bailout will come with strings attached .
and no one has any intention of introducing state support for the entire automotive industry .
many companies , after all , including daimler , bmw , vw and porsche , are currently doing very nicely indeed .
they are certainly not suffering from an acute lack of cash - although a lack of customers is a growing problem .
out of touch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky partly to blame is a product range that reflects neither the financial crisis nor environmental concerns . with their enormous gas guzzlers , state support would not be enough to pull these companies through a financial crisis .
they need more than bailouts , credit guarantees and stimulus packages .
the consumers simply do n't want these kinds of cars any more - not even in the us , traditionally home to low gas prices and a somewhat undeveloped environmental awareness .
the carmakers need to wake up and smell the coffee . developing new models that reflect changing consumer habits requires time and effort - and possibly even leads to closures and job cuts .
a number of suppliers have already bitten the dust , and if its parent company goes bankrupt , then heads will also roll at opel .
nonetheless , over-impulsive , sweeping aid packages make no sense .
a credit guarantee should be offered on a case-by-case basis , and only after much deliberation .
not only is it a use of taxpayers ' money , it is also a move that gives the company at stake an unfair competitive advantage .
a state aid package is a more favorable financing solution than those available to other companies .
were even financially stable companies which could actually weather the financial crisis under their own steam to start considering this an option , they would all want credit guarantees .
the government needs to avoid companies enjoying what is known as windfall gains - and it also needs to avoid its support ending up in the wrong place .
when it comes to internal funds , after all , multinationals in particular tend to be very " flexible . "
just one cog in the wheel the automotive industry is important , but its role in the economy is not nearly as important as that of the banks .
even so , the state will do what it can to extend lifelines to carmakers facing the abyss .
too many jobs are at stake .
in germany , opel employs 25,000 people , its suppliers another 50,000 .
for the time being , opel 's future appears safe .
but everything depends on general motors .
the government in berlin by all means needs to address the crisis in the automotive industry - and especially opel 's case .
but other economic sectors are also hard hit by the troubled economy .
and while the government might be able to help out the odd company with an occasional loan guarantee , it ca n't afford to rescue entire sectors .

" now that the last of the 117 windows from the marienkirche can finally return to their proper place it is a further sign of reconciliation and the friendship between our two countries , " he said . the panels had been removed from the marienkirche during the war to protect them from bombing .
they were stored in the basement of the potsdam neues palais , where they were seized by red army soldiers in 1945 .
the soviet union claimed them as war booty and shipped them back to russia . at the ceremony , kotenev also noted that nazi germany had been guilty of wanton looting during the war and stressed that the process of restoring property to its original owners must be reciprocal . " i would like to stress the word ' mutual ' because there are still harsh critics and the issue of looted art is often treated in the media as one in which it is the russians who owe a debt , " he said .
" it is often carelessly - or intentionally - forgotten that during the raids of the wehrmacht many russian museums were systematically plundered .

russian deputies passed a measure in 1997 declaring artwork seized from germany to be rightful spoils of war to compensate for the sacking of its own collections . but germany has refused to relinquish its claims .

" workers from new -lrb- eu -rrb- member states have satisfied demand in receiving countries ... without creating any major disruption to unemployment or to the salaries of native workers , " spidla said . and since the free movement of people is " a fundamental right " , governments should " lift their restrictions as soon as possible , " the commissioner said . spidla made his comments while presenting a report showing that the eu 's recent enlargement has not , as some had feared , led to a massive influx of polish plumbers - a symbol of cheap labor - to the eu 's 15 oldest and richest members -lrb- eu-15 -rrb- . the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , poland , slovakia and slovenia , as well as cyprus and malta , all joined the eu in 2004 , while bulgaria and romania followed in 2007 . the commission 's latest estimates show that the share of nationals from the 10 countries that joined in 2004 and who have decided to relocate elsewhere in the eu has risen from 0.2 percent in 2003 to 0.5 percent in 2007 , with most of them heading to britain or ireland . the share of bulgarians and romanians now living in the eu-15 , meanwhile , has increased from 0.2 percent to 0.4 percent over the same period , with most heading for spain or italy . more benefits than problems such migrations have , on balance , brought more benefits than problems by satisfying demand and by meeting skill shortages in the receiving countries , spidla said . officials in brussels also noted that the arrival of workers from new member states tends to increase productivity and ease inflationary pressure , since these workers send part of their salaries back home rather than spending it in their new country of residence . and unlike many illegal immigrants arriving from asia , africa or latin america , eu workers tend to enjoy regular contracts and thus pay taxes . restrictions remain in place when the eu agreed to enlarge its borders , the eu executive in brussels sought to allay the concerns of many by granting " old " eu governments the ability to temporarily restrict the influx of workers from new member states . such restrictions must however be abolished entirely by 2011 for workers from the eight central and eastern european countries that joined in 2004 - and by 2013 for bulgarians and romanians . at the moment , only austria , belgium , denmark and germany maintain some restrictions on workers from the eight countries that joined in 2004 , while workers from bulgaria and romania still face barriers to entry in most eu-15 countries . germany should open up asked whether europe 's biggest employer - germany - should now lift its restrictions , spidla said the commission 's report " shows quite clearly that all countries that have opened up -lrb- their labor markets -rrb- have found it to be a good thing . " the commissioner also noted that since migrant workers tend to go where jobs are available , the current recession would not lead to a major increase in the influx of such workers . governments now have until the end of april to communicate to the commission whether they intend to extend their restrictions .
however , they can only do so if they can show that lifting them would lead to " serious disturbances " to their labor markets . polish migration poles meanwhile do make up the largest immigrant group in the european union , followed by romanians and moroccans , an eu report said tuesday . out of some 3 million immigrants that settled in the eu , some 290,000 were poles , said the eurostat statistics based on 2006 . some 2 million poles went to work in other eu countries since poland joined the european union in 2004 .
poles working abroad have contributed to the ex-communist nation 's prosperity , sending home more than $ 8 billion -lrb- 6.32 billion euros -rrb- in 2007 while helping to cut the jobless rate . about 40 percent of all eu immigrants were eu citizens migrating to another member state .
the remaining 60 percent were from european non-member states , asia , the united states and africa , the report said . spain , followed by germany and britain , saw the largest number of immigrants in 2006 .
luxembourg had the highest rate of immigrants with 28.8 per 1,000 inhabitants . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" workers from new -lrb- eu -rrb- member states have satisfied demand in receiving countries ... without creating any major disruption to unemployment or to the salaries of native workers , " spidla said . and since the free movement of people is " a fundamental right " , governments should " lift their restrictions as soon as possible , " the commissioner said . spidla made his comments while presenting a report showing that the eu 's recent enlargement has not , as some had feared , led to a massive influx of polish plumbers - a symbol of cheap labor - to the eu 's 15 oldest and richest members -lrb- eu-15 -rrb- . the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , poland , slovakia and slovenia , as well as cyprus and malta , all joined the eu in 2004 , while bulgaria and romania followed in 2007 . the commission 's latest estimates show that the share of nationals from the 10 countries that joined in 2004 and who have decided to relocate elsewhere in the eu has risen from 0.2 percent in 2003 to 0.5 percent in 2007 , with most of them heading to britain or ireland . the share of bulgarians and romanians now living in the eu-15 , meanwhile , has increased from 0.2 percent to 0.4 percent over the same period , with most heading for spain or italy . more benefits than problems such migrations have , on balance , brought more benefits than problems by satisfying demand and by meeting skill shortages in the receiving countries , spidla said . officials in brussels also noted that the arrival of workers from new member states tends to increase productivity and ease inflationary pressure , since these workers send part of their salaries back home rather than spending it in their new country of residence . and unlike many illegal immigrants arriving from asia , africa or latin america , eu workers tend to enjoy regular contracts and thus pay taxes . restrictions remain in place when the eu agreed to enlarge its borders , the eu executive in brussels sought to allay the concerns of many by granting " old " eu governments the ability to temporarily restrict the influx of workers from new member states . such restrictions must however be abolished entirely by 2011 for workers from the eight central and eastern european countries that joined in 2004 - and by 2013 for bulgarians and romanians . at the moment , only austria , belgium , denmark and germany maintain some restrictions on workers from the eight countries that joined in 2004 , while workers from bulgaria and romania still face barriers to entry in most eu-15 countries . germany should open up asked whether europe 's biggest employer - germany - should now lift its restrictions , spidla said the commission 's report " shows quite clearly that all countries that have opened up -lrb- their labor markets -rrb- have found it to be a good thing . " the commissioner also noted that since migrant workers tend to go where jobs are available , the current recession would not lead to a major increase in the influx of such workers . governments now have until the end of april to communicate to the commission whether they intend to extend their restrictions .
however , they can only do so if they can show that lifting them would lead to " serious disturbances " to their labor markets . polish migration poles meanwhile do make up the largest immigrant group in the european union , followed by romanians and moroccans , an eu report said tuesday . out of some 3 million immigrants that settled in the eu , some 290,000 were poles , said the eurostat statistics based on 2006 . some 2 million poles went to work in other eu countries since poland joined the european union in 2004 .
poles working abroad have contributed to the ex-communist nation 's prosperity , sending home more than $ 8 billion -lrb- 6.32 billion euros -rrb- in 2007 while helping to cut the jobless rate . about 40 percent of all eu immigrants were eu citizens migrating to another member state .
the remaining 60 percent were from european non-member states , asia , the united states and africa , the report said . spain , followed by germany and britain , saw the largest number of immigrants in 2006 .
luxembourg had the highest rate of immigrants with 28.8 per 1,000 inhabitants . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he talked to dw-world about the g20 financial summit and the global economic crisis . dw-world.de : most economists have called the g20 summit a success .
what is your opinion on the summit as a ceo of a global company ? martin richenhagen : the most positive aspect of the summit for agco is that the political leaders first of all identified a problem and secondly started to harmonize and coordinate the action plan .
for a global company , it is very important that you have stable rules and conditions .
for me , it looks likely as that this will happen now . let 's talk briefly about the global financial crisis .
in the us , but also in europe , increasing numbers of companies are suffering , and its not just banks .
how is the agriculture industry affected by the financial meltdown and do you fear that the crisis will spread to more sectors of the economy ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agriculture is n't like most other businesses , according to richenhagen first of all , the farm business is following a slightly different logic .
the farm business is driven by the growing world population .
about 70 million people a year are added to the population .
second , the sector is driven by renewable fuels and third by changing diets in emerging markets like china and india .
therefore , agricultural demand is actually higher than supply and will be higher than supply for many years to come . as far as our company is concerned , we have managed things more carefully over the last few years and our debt-to-capital is down to zero .
we also expect a cash position of $ 600 million for the end of this year .
we work together with pretty good banks , and for many years we have had an agco finance bank helping customers with financing .
with that in mind , i think we are pretty well prepared for this crisis and we will not suffer too much from it . in the united states and in europe there is a heated debate whether the government should bail out giant companies like car manufacturers .
should the government rescue giant companies or let them go bust ? this is a difficult one .
the same managers who do n't normally ask for state or governmental support or partial support are all of a sudden starting to cry for help .
i personally believe companies that have not been managed well , like general motors , should go bankrupt .
their problem is that they have a very bloated organization , they are really not lean enough and this has been the case for at least 20 or 30 years .
they are just a weak management team and therefore the consequence is that they should go bankrupt . interview : michael knigge -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it remains to be seen whether the case will ever come to trial . the decision announced by the un highest court in the hague on tuesday , sept .
18 , was a narrow one .
" the court ... by 10 votes to seven finds that ... the court has the jurisdiction to entertain the application by the republic of croatia , " said presiding judge rosalyn higgins .
croatian minister of justice ivan simonovic said he was very happy about the judgement .
" we won in round one , " simonovic told a croatian daily newspaper . " now we have round two and that is to prove genocide in croatia , " croatia lodged its complaint against serbia in 1999 .
zagreb said that serbian participation in the croatian war of 1991-1995 amounted to " a form of genocide which resulted in large numbers of croatian citizens being displaced , killed , tortured , or illegally detained as well as extensive property destruction . "
croatia has estimated that some 20,000 people lost their lives in the conflict .
belgrade had argued that the icj did not have jurisdiction over the complaint .
unsettling history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in october 2008 , former croatian-serb leader milan martic was convicted of war crimes zagreb 's accusations stem from the period immediately after the end of the cold war , which saw the disintegration of the serb-dominated federal republic of yugoslavia .
croatia declared independence from yugoslavia in 1991 .
ethnic serbs , who made up 12 percent of the population in croatia , staged an armed insurrection .
with belgrade 's backing , serbs briefly controlled around 30 percent of what is today croatia , declaring the region known as krajina an independent state .
the ethnic serbian forces were later defeated by the croatian national army with the help of western nations , chiefly the us .
hundreds of thousands of people were displaced during the course of the fighting before it finally ended for good in 1995 .
croatia is seeking punishment against serbians it considers responsible for the violence as well as monetary reparations and the return of croatian cultural treasures .
but it could take years for an actual case against serbia to come to trial , and even if proceedings are initiated , zagreb is unlikely to get everything it wants .
last year , in a similar case , the icj controversially cleared belgrade of any direct responsibility for the genocide of thousands of men and boys in the town of srebrenica in bosnia-hercegovina .
rehabilitation attempt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : capturing mladic could be a major step for serbia toward joining the eu in another event related to the balkans ' troubled history , the prosecutor of the un 's international tribunal for the former yugoslavia , david brammertz , held talks with serbian president boris tadic and other officials .
the focus was on whether belgrade was doing enough to hunt down serbs suspected of crimes against humanity , most notably former bosnian-serbian general ratko mladic , who is wanted on charges of genocide .
brammertz declined to give a public statement , but the serbian government said the talks had gone well .
" brammertz underlined the very good cooperation in the past few months with serbia 's institutions , " the cabinet of the serbian prime minister said in a statement .
serbian cooperation with international efforts to bring war criminals to justice is seen as key to belgrade 's bid to join the eu .
serbia hopes to begin the process of accession next year , but some member states like the netherlands want to see belgrade apprehend suspects like mladic before starting any official procedures . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in these tough times , even the super-wealthy are n't protected against getting soaked . vw stocks went on a wild ride at the end of october , at one point breaking the 1000-euro -lrb- $ 1,264 -rrb- mark before plummeting back down to earth .
but adolf merckle and his family , who had bought options predicated on the idea of vw share prices falling , got run over .
now the family holding company is trouble .
" the -lsb- holding company -rsb- too has suffered under the extreme turbulence in the financial markets in the past few weeks , " merckle 's son ludwig confirmed to dpa press agency on tuesday , nov .
18 .
the family is reported to have lost as much as one billion euros as it was forced to buy up inflated vw shares .
adolf merckle 's personal wealth has been estimated at $ 9.2 billion .
adding to the family 's woes is the fact that the merkel group , a consortium that includes major cement and pharmaceuticals companies , is reported to be in debt to the tune of 16 billion euros .
now one of germany 's top billionaires is facing the unusual challenge of a personal cash crunch - and the state is not yet stepping in .
no deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : billionaire merckle is now trying to see about a loan adolf merckle met with the economics minister of the state of baden-wuerttemberg , ernst pfister , to discuss the financial troubles of the consortium , which employs some 100,000 people .
but if it was a loan he was after , he was disappointed .
" we are confident that the banks and the corporation will find a solution , " pfister told dpa after that meeting .
baden-wuerttemberg 's state premier guenther oettinger has said his government is monitoring the situation .
" we 'll be following this topic intensely but prudently , " oettinger said .
" the employees ca n't be left standing there like idiots for something that 's the fault of company directors . "
ludwig merckle said the company had discussed its need for capital with some 40 banks .
" various options are being examined in order to ensure that debts are reduced responsibly , " merckle told the daily suedwest-presse newspaper .
the plans could include selling off some of the merckle group 's prime subsidiaries - in a sign that not even the super-rich can avoid tightening their belts during the economic crisis . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 18.11.2008 opinion : bailouts fine in moderation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government is set to decide whether to grant ailing german carmaker opel 1 billion euros in credit guarantees .
dw 's karl zawadzky asks whether state support is really the way to go . the government in berlin responded to opel 's cry for help by saying it would study the plea - unlike hessen 's state premier roland koch , who immediately called for a " protective shield " in the form of comprehensive state support for germany 's entire automotive industry and government help totalling 500 million euros -lrb- $ 632 million -rrb- of the state budget .
the government 's more measured response is an eminently sensible one , since the german company owned by general motors is not actually at immediate risk of bankruptcy .
and if regional governments start bailing out individual companies facing insolvency - for whatever reasons - then who knows where that could lead ?
worst-case scenarios executives and union leaders at gm subsidiary opel turned to berlin and the regional governments in the states where opel has factories out of fear that parent company general motors might go bust and will no longer be able to pay back the loans it owes its german subsidiary .
but this would be a worst-case scenario - and an unlikely one , given that in the us , congress is currently working out the details of a $ 25 billion rescue package for america 's big three carmakers general motors , ford , and chrysler .
so there clearly is enough time to weigh the options , instead of acting rashly , and the options do need to be weighed .
for example , it makes no sense to use german taxpayers ' money given the risk that funding will simply end up in the pockets of the american parent company - especially since several years ago , general motors turned opel from a joint stock company into a limited liability company , not least in order to boost control of its subsidiary . after merkel held talks in berlin with carl-peter forster , ceo of general motors europe , hans demant , opel ceo and klaus franz , president of the works council , it became clear that berlin and the regional governments where opel 's factories are based do not intend to abandon the company .
but a bailout will come with strings attached .
and no one has any intention of introducing state support for the entire automotive industry .
many companies , after all , including daimler , bmw , vw and porsche , are currently doing very nicely indeed .
they are certainly not suffering from an acute lack of cash - although a lack of customers is a growing problem .
out of touch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky partly to blame is a product range that reflects neither the financial crisis nor environmental concerns . with their enormous gas guzzlers , state support would not be enough to pull these companies through a financial crisis .
they need more than bailouts , credit guarantees and stimulus packages .
the consumers simply do n't want these kinds of cars any more - not even in the us , traditionally home to low gas prices and a somewhat undeveloped environmental awareness .
the carmakers need to wake up and smell the coffee . developing new models that reflect changing consumer habits requires time and effort - and possibly even leads to closures and job cuts .
a number of suppliers have already bitten the dust , and if its parent company goes bankrupt , then heads will also roll at opel .
nonetheless , over-impulsive , sweeping aid packages make no sense .
a credit guarantee should be offered on a case-by-case basis , and only after much deliberation .
not only is it a use of taxpayers ' money , it is also a move that gives the company at stake an unfair competitive advantage .
a state aid package is a more favorable financing solution than those available to other companies .
were even financially stable companies which could actually weather the financial crisis under their own steam to start considering this an option , they would all want credit guarantees .
the government needs to avoid companies enjoying what is known as windfall gains - and it also needs to avoid its support ending up in the wrong place .
when it comes to internal funds , after all , multinationals in particular tend to be very " flexible . "
just one cog in the wheel the automotive industry is important , but its role in the economy is not nearly as important as that of the banks .
even so , the state will do what it can to extend lifelines to carmakers facing the abyss .
too many jobs are at stake .
in germany , opel employs 25,000 people , its suppliers another 50,000 .
for the time being , opel 's future appears safe .
but everything depends on general motors .
the government in berlin by all means needs to address the crisis in the automotive industry - and especially opel 's case .
but other economic sectors are also hard hit by the troubled economy .
and while the government might be able to help out the odd company with an occasional loan guarantee , it ca n't afford to rescue entire sectors .

but it remains to be seen whether the case will ever come to trial . the decision announced by the un highest court in the hague on tuesday , sept .
18 , was a narrow one .
" the court ... by 10 votes to seven finds that ... the court has the jurisdiction to entertain the application by the republic of croatia , " said presiding judge rosalyn higgins .
croatian minister of justice ivan simonovic said he was very happy about the judgement .
" we won in round one , " simonovic told a croatian daily newspaper . " now we have round two and that is to prove genocide in croatia , " croatia lodged its complaint against serbia in 1999 .
zagreb said that serbian participation in the croatian war of 1991-1995 amounted to " a form of genocide which resulted in large numbers of croatian citizens being displaced , killed , tortured , or illegally detained as well as extensive property destruction . "
croatia has estimated that some 20,000 people lost their lives in the conflict .
belgrade had argued that the icj did not have jurisdiction over the complaint .
unsettling history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in october 2008 , former croatian-serb leader milan martic was convicted of war crimes zagreb 's accusations stem from the period immediately after the end of the cold war , which saw the disintegration of the serb-dominated federal republic of yugoslavia .
croatia declared independence from yugoslavia in 1991 .
ethnic serbs , who made up 12 percent of the population in croatia , staged an armed insurrection .
with belgrade 's backing , serbs briefly controlled around 30 percent of what is today croatia , declaring the region known as krajina an independent state .
the ethnic serbian forces were later defeated by the croatian national army with the help of western nations , chiefly the us .
hundreds of thousands of people were displaced during the course of the fighting before it finally ended for good in 1995 .
croatia is seeking punishment against serbians it considers responsible for the violence as well as monetary reparations and the return of croatian cultural treasures .
but it could take years for an actual case against serbia to come to trial , and even if proceedings are initiated , zagreb is unlikely to get everything it wants .
last year , in a similar case , the icj controversially cleared belgrade of any direct responsibility for the genocide of thousands of men and boys in the town of srebrenica in bosnia-hercegovina .
rehabilitation attempt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : capturing mladic could be a major step for serbia toward joining the eu in another event related to the balkans ' troubled history , the prosecutor of the un 's international tribunal for the former yugoslavia , david brammertz , held talks with serbian president boris tadic and other officials .
the focus was on whether belgrade was doing enough to hunt down serbs suspected of crimes against humanity , most notably former bosnian-serbian general ratko mladic , who is wanted on charges of genocide .
brammertz declined to give a public statement , but the serbian government said the talks had gone well .
" brammertz underlined the very good cooperation in the past few months with serbia 's institutions , " the cabinet of the serbian prime minister said in a statement .
serbian cooperation with international efforts to bring war criminals to justice is seen as key to belgrade 's bid to join the eu .
serbia hopes to begin the process of accession next year , but some member states like the netherlands want to see belgrade apprehend suspects like mladic before starting any official procedures . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he talked to dw-world about the g20 financial summit and the global economic crisis . dw-world.de : most economists have called the g20 summit a success .
what is your opinion on the summit as a ceo of a global company ? martin richenhagen : the most positive aspect of the summit for agco is that the political leaders first of all identified a problem and secondly started to harmonize and coordinate the action plan .
for a global company , it is very important that you have stable rules and conditions .
for me , it looks likely as that this will happen now . let 's talk briefly about the global financial crisis .
in the us , but also in europe , increasing numbers of companies are suffering , and its not just banks .
how is the agriculture industry affected by the financial meltdown and do you fear that the crisis will spread to more sectors of the economy ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agriculture is n't like most other businesses , according to richenhagen first of all , the farm business is following a slightly different logic .
the farm business is driven by the growing world population .
about 70 million people a year are added to the population .
second , the sector is driven by renewable fuels and third by changing diets in emerging markets like china and india .
therefore , agricultural demand is actually higher than supply and will be higher than supply for many years to come . as far as our company is concerned , we have managed things more carefully over the last few years and our debt-to-capital is down to zero .
we also expect a cash position of $ 600 million for the end of this year .
we work together with pretty good banks , and for many years we have had an agco finance bank helping customers with financing .
with that in mind , i think we are pretty well prepared for this crisis and we will not suffer too much from it . in the united states and in europe there is a heated debate whether the government should bail out giant companies like car manufacturers .
should the government rescue giant companies or let them go bust ? this is a difficult one .
the same managers who do n't normally ask for state or governmental support or partial support are all of a sudden starting to cry for help .
i personally believe companies that have not been managed well , like general motors , should go bankrupt .
their problem is that they have a very bloated organization , they are really not lean enough and this has been the case for at least 20 or 30 years .
they are just a weak management team and therefore the consequence is that they should go bankrupt . interview : michael knigge -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in these tough times , even the super-wealthy are n't protected against getting soaked . vw stocks went on a wild ride at the end of october , at one point breaking the 1000-euro -lrb- $ 1,264 -rrb- mark before plummeting back down to earth .
but adolf merckle and his family , who had bought options predicated on the idea of vw share prices falling , got run over .
now the family holding company is trouble .
" the -lsb- holding company -rsb- too has suffered under the extreme turbulence in the financial markets in the past few weeks , " merckle 's son ludwig confirmed to dpa press agency on tuesday , nov .
18 .
the family is reported to have lost as much as one billion euros as it was forced to buy up inflated vw shares .
adolf merckle 's personal wealth has been estimated at $ 9.2 billion .
adding to the family 's woes is the fact that the merkel group , a consortium that includes major cement and pharmaceuticals companies , is reported to be in debt to the tune of 16 billion euros .
now one of germany 's top billionaires is facing the unusual challenge of a personal cash crunch - and the state is not yet stepping in .
no deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : billionaire merckle is now trying to see about a loan adolf merckle met with the economics minister of the state of baden-wuerttemberg , ernst pfister , to discuss the financial troubles of the consortium , which employs some 100,000 people .
but if it was a loan he was after , he was disappointed .
" we are confident that the banks and the corporation will find a solution , " pfister told dpa after that meeting .
baden-wuerttemberg 's state premier guenther oettinger has said his government is monitoring the situation .
" we 'll be following this topic intensely but prudently , " oettinger said .
" the employees ca n't be left standing there like idiots for something that 's the fault of company directors . "
ludwig merckle said the company had discussed its need for capital with some 40 banks .
" various options are being examined in order to ensure that debts are reduced responsibly , " merckle told the daily suedwest-presse newspaper .
the plans could include selling off some of the merckle group 's prime subsidiaries - in a sign that not even the super-rich can avoid tightening their belts during the economic crisis . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

17 , marking the occasion , neumann said the restitution was a sign of improving relations between the former wartime foes . " now that the last of the 117 windows from the marienkirche can finally return to their proper place it is a further sign of reconciliation and the friendship between our two countries , " he said . the panels had been removed from the marienkirche during the war to protect them from bombing .
they were stored in the basement of the potsdam neues palais , where they were seized by red army soldiers in 1945 .
the soviet union claimed them as war booty and shipped them back to russia . at the ceremony , kotenev also noted that nazi germany had been guilty of wanton looting during the war and stressed that the process of restoring property to its original owners must be reciprocal . " i would like to stress the word ' mutual ' because there are still harsh critics and the issue of looted art is often treated in the media as one in which it is the russians who owe a debt , " he said .
" it is often carelessly - or intentionally - forgotten that during the raids of the wehrmacht many russian museums were systematically plundered . " nonetheless , he hailed the return of the panels as " a milestone in a process begun fifty years ago . " " a homecoming is always a special experience , " said kotenev .
" especially when that homecoming follows a long absence . " war booty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the panels depict biblical stories such as noah 's ark in 1958 , some 1,5 million works of art were returned to east germany by the soviet union after the hague convention for the protection of cultural property made it illegal to use cultural property as war reparations . previously , moscow declared that art seized by the red army was retribution for the 27 million soviet lives lost during the second world war . however , disputes over art seized during and after the war continued to overshadow german-russian relations since the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 . recent years have seen some of the russian cultural treasures looted by the nazis returned to russia .
russian deputies passed a measure in 1997 declaring artwork seized from germany to be rightful spoils of war to compensate for the sacking of its own collections . but germany has refused to relinquish its claims .
experts say that there are still some 2.5 million objects missing from germany believed to be in the former soviet union . meanwhile in frankfurt , mayor martin patzelt announced that the missing panes in marienkirche 's stained glass windows will now undergo restoration and are expected to be returned to their original position by next year . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they say the proposed law 's aggressive online evidence-gathering measures are ill-conceived and open to abuse . less than a week after germany 's lower house of parliament approved new anti-terrorism legislation that would vastly expand the cyber-spying powers of the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- , two police trade unions and the german judicial federation demanded that amendments be made to the so-called federal bureau of criminal investigations bill . the bill , backed strongly by chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition government , was passed in the bundestag last week with 375 parliamentarians in favor and 168 against .
the plan , if approved by the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament , could go into effect in early 2009 . among the most contentious points in the bill are those addressing the expansion of surreptitious online search capabilities and an increase in the bka 's powers to access information from the computers , telephone conversations and homes of suspected terrorists . if enacted the plan would allow " remote forensic software " to search secretly through hard drives and send potentially incriminating evidence back to investigators .
the measure does not , however , allow the police to enter a home in order to install monitoring equipment or software on a computer . unions : constitutional approval needed critics of the law say that it infringes upon privacy rights guaranteed by the constitution . the bka needs a nationally accepted law approved by the federal constitutional court before its measures could go into effect , rainer wendt , the chairman of the german police trade union -lrb- dpolg -rrb- , told the osnabrücker zeitung newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bka president joerg ziercke is a strong advocate of the law konrad freiberg , the chairman of the trade union of the police -lrb- gdp -rrb- , criticized the government for focusing on the " cheap solution " of online searches and failing to address more serious reforms necessary for the bka to fulfill its anti-terror mandate . " it is obvious that the bka is not ready for the creation of these new online searches , " he said , according to the osnabrücker zeitung article . klaus jansen , the head of the federation of german criminal investigative officers , accused the ruling coalition of conservatives and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- of making " putrid political compromises " and bowing to the bka 's demands . he also criticized the measure which would allow the bka to undertake emergency online activities without immediate court approval if such approval is obtained within three days . state parliamentarians agree to reject law the police criticism comes after the spd party congress in the state of saxony agreed over the weekend to reject the proposed law when it comes before the bundesrat .
the spd congress in neighboring saxony-anhalt also agreed to reject the law .
at least one of the states would have to change it position for the bill to be enacted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition to interior minister schaeuble 's plan is growing ralf stegner , the regional chairman of the spd parliamentary group in schleswig-holstein , demanded amendments to the plan before christmas .
the bill had originally been scheduled for vote at the end of november . however , with party rebellions gathering pace around the country and privacy rights advocates joining the police unions in condemning the law , the bill could first go before the federal constitutional court to be judged on its constitutional merits . german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble said he wants to discuss the measure 's necessity - as currently written - with his state interior ministers during a meeting on wednesday . opposition fears unconstitutional " super police " critics in opposition parties have come out against the creation of a " super police force " whose expanded powers , they say , would infringe on privacy and human rights . as well as the online measures , the bill allows the bka to bug , film or photograph the homes of suspected terrorists or places where they are staying .
the tapping of suspects ' telephones and cell phones as well as tracking the location of mobile phone calls would also be permissible . additionally , the bka would be able to perform data-mining searches as a preventative measure rather than as part of criminal proceedings following terrorist attacks .
in certain cases , such data-mining , which would require court approval , can also include the use of data seized from private institutions . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they say the proposed law 's aggressive online evidence-gathering measures are ill-conceived and open to abuse . less than a week after germany 's lower house of parliament approved new anti-terrorism legislation that would vastly expand the cyber-spying powers of the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- , two police trade unions and the german judicial federation demanded that amendments be made to the so-called federal bureau of criminal investigations bill . the bill , backed strongly by chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition government , was passed in the bundestag last week with 375 parliamentarians in favor and 168 against .
the plan , if approved by the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament , could go into effect in early 2009 . among the most contentious points in the bill are those addressing the expansion of surreptitious online search capabilities and an increase in the bka 's powers to access information from the computers , telephone conversations and homes of suspected terrorists . if enacted the plan would allow " remote forensic software " to search secretly through hard drives and send potentially incriminating evidence back to investigators .
the measure does not , however , allow the police to enter a home in order to install monitoring equipment or software on a computer . unions : constitutional approval needed critics of the law say that it infringes upon privacy rights guaranteed by the constitution . the bka needs a nationally accepted law approved by the federal constitutional court before its measures could go into effect , rainer wendt , the chairman of the german police trade union -lrb- dpolg -rrb- , told the osnabrücker zeitung newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bka president joerg ziercke is a strong advocate of the law konrad freiberg , the chairman of the trade union of the police -lrb- gdp -rrb- , criticized the government for focusing on the " cheap solution " of online searches and failing to address more serious reforms necessary for the bka to fulfill its anti-terror mandate . " it is obvious that the bka is not ready for the creation of these new online searches , " he said , according to the osnabrücker zeitung article . klaus jansen , the head of the federation of german criminal investigative officers , accused the ruling coalition of conservatives and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- of making " putrid political compromises " and bowing to the bka 's demands . he also criticized the measure which would allow the bka to undertake emergency online activities without immediate court approval if such approval is obtained within three days . state parliamentarians agree to reject law the police criticism comes after the spd party congress in the state of saxony agreed over the weekend to reject the proposed law when it comes before the bundesrat .
the spd congress in neighboring saxony-anhalt also agreed to reject the law .

the bill had originally been scheduled for vote at the end of november . however , with party rebellions gathering pace around the country and privacy rights advocates joining the police unions in condemning the law , the bill could first go before the federal constitutional court to be judged on its constitutional merits . german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble said he wants to discuss the measure 's necessity - as currently written - with his state interior ministers during a meeting on wednesday . opposition fears unconstitutional " super police " critics in opposition parties have come out against the creation of a " super police force " whose expanded powers , they say , would infringe on privacy and human rights . as well as the online measures , the bill allows the bka to bug , film or photograph the homes of suspected terrorists or places where they are staying .
the tapping of suspects ' telephones and cell phones as well as tracking the location of mobile phone calls would also be permissible . additionally , the bka would be able to perform data-mining searches as a preventative measure rather than as part of criminal proceedings following terrorist attacks .

the plan , if approved by the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament , could go into effect in early 2009 . among the most contentious points in the bill are those addressing the expansion of surreptitious online search capabilities and an increase in the bka 's powers to access information from the computers , telephone conversations and homes of suspected terrorists . if enacted the plan would allow " remote forensic software " to search secretly through hard drives and send potentially incriminating evidence back to investigators .
the measure does not , however , allow the police to enter a home in order to install monitoring equipment or software on a computer . unions : constitutional approval needed critics of the law say that it infringes upon privacy rights guaranteed by the constitution . the bka needs a nationally accepted law approved by the federal constitutional court before its measures could go into effect , rainer wendt , the chairman of the german police trade union -lrb- dpolg -rrb- , told the osnabrücker zeitung newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bka president joerg ziercke is a strong advocate of the law konrad freiberg , the chairman of the trade union of the police -lrb- gdp -rrb- , criticized the government for focusing on the " cheap solution " of online searches and failing to address more serious reforms necessary for the bka to fulfill its anti-terror mandate . " it is obvious that the bka is not ready for the creation of these new online searches , " he said , according to the osnabrücker zeitung article . klaus jansen , the head of the federation of german criminal investigative officers , accused the ruling coalition of conservatives and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- of making " putrid political compromises " and bowing to the bka 's demands . he also criticized the measure which would allow the bka to undertake emergency online activities without immediate court approval if such approval is obtained within three days . state parliamentarians agree to reject law the police criticism comes after the spd party congress in the state of saxony agreed over the weekend to reject the proposed law when it comes before the bundesrat .
the spd congress in neighboring saxony-anhalt also agreed to reject the law .
at least one of the states would have to change it position for the bill to be enacted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition to interior minister schaeuble 's plan is growing ralf stegner , the regional chairman of the spd parliamentary group in schleswig-holstein , demanded amendments to the plan before christmas .
the bill had originally been scheduled for vote at the end of november . however , with party rebellions gathering pace around the country and privacy rights advocates joining the police unions in condemning the law , the bill could first go before the federal constitutional court to be judged on its constitutional merits . german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble said he wants to discuss the measure 's necessity - as currently written - with his state interior ministers during a meeting on wednesday . opposition fears unconstitutional " super police " critics in opposition parties have come out against the creation of a " super police force " whose expanded powers , they say , would infringe on privacy and human rights . as well as the online measures , the bill allows the bka to bug , film or photograph the homes of suspected terrorists or places where they are staying .
the tapping of suspects ' telephones and cell phones as well as tracking the location of mobile phone calls would also be permissible . additionally , the bka would be able to perform data-mining searches as a preventative measure rather than as part of criminal proceedings following terrorist attacks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 18.11.2008 opinion : bailouts fine in moderation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government is set to decide whether to grant ailing german carmaker opel 1 billion euros in credit guarantees .
dw 's karl zawadzky asks whether state support is really the way to go . the government in berlin responded to opel 's cry for help by saying it would study the plea - unlike hessen 's state premier roland koch , who immediately called for a " protective shield " in the form of comprehensive state support for germany 's entire automotive industry and government help totalling 500 million euros -lrb- $ 632 million -rrb- of the state budget .
the government 's more measured response is an eminently sensible one , since the german company owned by general motors is not actually at immediate risk of bankruptcy .
and if regional governments start bailing out individual companies facing insolvency - for whatever reasons - then who knows where that could lead ?
worst-case scenarios executives and union leaders at gm subsidiary opel turned to berlin and the regional governments in the states where opel has factories out of fear that parent company general motors might go bust and will no longer be able to pay back the loans it owes its german subsidiary .
but this would be a worst-case scenario - and an unlikely one , given that in the us , congress is currently working out the details of a $ 25 billion rescue package for america 's big three carmakers general motors , ford , and chrysler .
so there clearly is enough time to weigh the options , instead of acting rashly , and the options do need to be weighed .
for example , it makes no sense to use german taxpayers ' money given the risk that funding will simply end up in the pockets of the american parent company - especially since several years ago , general motors turned opel from a joint stock company into a limited liability company , not least in order to boost control of its subsidiary . after merkel held talks in berlin with carl-peter forster , ceo of general motors europe , hans demant , opel ceo and klaus franz , president of the works council , it became clear that berlin and the regional governments where opel 's factories are based do not intend to abandon the company .
but a bailout will come with strings attached .
and no one has any intention of introducing state support for the entire automotive industry .
many companies , after all , including daimler , bmw , vw and porsche , are currently doing very nicely indeed .
they are certainly not suffering from an acute lack of cash - although a lack of customers is a growing problem .
out of touch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky partly to blame is a product range that reflects neither the financial crisis nor environmental concerns . with their enormous gas guzzlers , state support would not be enough to pull these companies through a financial crisis .
they need more than bailouts , credit guarantees and stimulus packages .
the consumers simply do n't want these kinds of cars any more - not even in the us , traditionally home to low gas prices and a somewhat undeveloped environmental awareness .
the carmakers need to wake up and smell the coffee . developing new models that reflect changing consumer habits requires time and effort - and possibly even leads to closures and job cuts .
a number of suppliers have already bitten the dust , and if its parent company goes bankrupt , then heads will also roll at opel .
nonetheless , over-impulsive , sweeping aid packages make no sense .
a credit guarantee should be offered on a case-by-case basis , and only after much deliberation .
not only is it a use of taxpayers ' money , it is also a move that gives the company at stake an unfair competitive advantage .
a state aid package is a more favorable financing solution than those available to other companies .
were even financially stable companies which could actually weather the financial crisis under their own steam to start considering this an option , they would all want credit guarantees .
the government needs to avoid companies enjoying what is known as windfall gains - and it also needs to avoid its support ending up in the wrong place .
when it comes to internal funds , after all , multinationals in particular tend to be very " flexible . "
just one cog in the wheel the automotive industry is important , but its role in the economy is not nearly as important as that of the banks .
even so , the state will do what it can to extend lifelines to carmakers facing the abyss .
too many jobs are at stake .
in germany , opel employs 25,000 people , its suppliers another 50,000 .
for the time being , opel 's future appears safe .
but everything depends on general motors .
the government in berlin by all means needs to address the crisis in the automotive industry - and especially opel 's case .
but other economic sectors are also hard hit by the troubled economy .
and while the government might be able to help out the odd company with an occasional loan guarantee , it ca n't afford to rescue entire sectors .

and no one has any intention of introducing state support for the entire automotive industry .
many companies , after all , including daimler , bmw , vw and porsche , are currently doing very nicely indeed .
they are certainly not suffering from an acute lack of cash - although a lack of customers is a growing problem .
out of touch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky partly to blame is a product range that reflects neither the financial crisis nor environmental concerns . with their enormous gas guzzlers , state support would not be enough to pull these companies through a financial crisis .
they need more than bailouts , credit guarantees and stimulus packages .
the consumers simply do n't want these kinds of cars any more - not even in the us , traditionally home to low gas prices and a somewhat undeveloped environmental awareness .
the carmakers need to wake up and smell the coffee . developing new models that reflect changing consumer habits requires time and effort - and possibly even leads to closures and job cuts .
a number of suppliers have already bitten the dust , and if its parent company goes bankrupt , then heads will also roll at opel .
nonetheless , over-impulsive , sweeping aid packages make no sense .
a credit guarantee should be offered on a case-by-case basis , and only after much deliberation .
not only is it a use of taxpayers ' money , it is also a move that gives the company at stake an unfair competitive advantage .
a state aid package is a more favorable financing solution than those available to other companies .
were even financially stable companies which could actually weather the financial crisis under their own steam to start considering this an option , they would all want credit guarantees .
the government needs to avoid companies enjoying what is known as windfall gains - and it also needs to avoid its support ending up in the wrong place .
when it comes to internal funds , after all , multinationals in particular tend to be very " flexible . "
just one cog in the wheel the automotive industry is important , but its role in the economy is not nearly as important as that of the banks .
even so , the state will do what it can to extend lifelines to carmakers facing the abyss .
too many jobs are at stake .
in germany , opel employs 25,000 people , its suppliers another 50,000 .
for the time being , opel 's future appears safe .
but everything depends on general motors .
the government in berlin by all means needs to address the crisis in the automotive industry - and especially opel 's case .
but other economic sectors are also hard hit by the troubled economy .
and while the government might be able to help out the odd company with an occasional loan guarantee , it ca n't afford to rescue entire sectors .

17 , that the eu members states should develop a common rescue package to help those car manufacturers stricken by the current economic crisis . " if we agree on a common direction forward , we will remain strong within europe and in our competition with other sectors in the world , " steinmeier , the social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- candidate for chancellor , said after meeting with the heads of germany 's largest auto manufacturers on monday . juncker , in an interview with germany 's bild newspaper , agreed . " i agree with the idea of a rescue plan for the automobile industry on a european level , " he said .
" if the us government is prepared to gives billions of dollars to save ford , general motors and chrysler before they fail , then we can not simply watch and abandon our manufacturers in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker sees no sense in individual rescue packages " it now makes little sense for germany , france or italy to try to protect their automobile industry individually .
that can only be done together , " juncker said . european commission chief jose manuel barroso said friday that the eu is ready to take action at the world trade organization if it judges that us aid for its struggling auto industry is " illegal . " the us congress approved an aid package worth $ 25 billion -lrb- 19.7 billion euros -rrb- in september to help the auto industry invest in new generation technology but no timetable was fixed for payments to be made . meanwhile , european automakers - who have cast an envious eye at the us plan and called for similar action at home - have been forced to close factories and cut jobs . protection needed to support healthy firms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier wants to protect firms from becoming affected " we must prevent healthy enterprises from becoming affected -lrb- by this crisis -rrb- , " steinmeier said .
" therefore , we must fight to keep the structures which made the automobile industry so strong in germany from disintegrating . " steinmeier 's statements came as the european investment bank -lrb- eib -rrb- , the eu 's lending arm , proposed to increase loans to europe 's ailing auto sector as part of a broader financing plan . " the eib will propose -lrb- to eu finance ministers -rrb- an increase of 20-30 percent , and that corresponds to 10 to 15 billion euros , " more money for both 2009 and 2010 - including help to small- and medium-sized businesses - a spokesman for the luxembourg-based bank told reporters . the eib has handed out an average of 2 billion euros in loans to the automobile sector in the past three years . french finance minister christine lagarde , whose country currently holds the eu rotating presidency , said monday that support for the sector was first of all a matter for the eib , which was working on the dossier . steinmeier : german banks should use bailout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin bailed-out the banks so other sectors could benefit steinmeier also urged the banking sector to provide more support for the car industry by being more generous in its granting of credit . " one of the biggest threats to the auto industry is the current shyness of the banks to take risks , " he said , adding that the financial package provided by the government for german banks was created for such purposes . however , peter bofinger , a member of the german council of economic experts , said the german government should consider putting the ailing manufacturer opel under state control with a view to attracting private investors to support it once the financial crisis has abated . bofinger claimed that the fears that the nationalization of opel could lead to calls for other companies to come under state protection was unfounded .

17 , that the eu members states should develop a common rescue package to help those car manufacturers stricken by the current economic crisis . " if we agree on a common direction forward , we will remain strong within europe and in our competition with other sectors in the world , " steinmeier , the social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- candidate for chancellor , said after meeting with the heads of germany 's largest auto manufacturers on monday . juncker , in an interview with germany 's bild newspaper , agreed . " i agree with the idea of a rescue plan for the automobile industry on a european level , " he said .
" if the us government is prepared to gives billions of dollars to save ford , general motors and chrysler before they fail , then we can not simply watch and abandon our manufacturers in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker sees no sense in individual rescue packages " it now makes little sense for germany , france or italy to try to protect their automobile industry individually .
that can only be done together , " juncker said . european commission chief jose manuel barroso said friday that the eu is ready to take action at the world trade organization if it judges that us aid for its struggling auto industry is " illegal . " the us congress approved an aid package worth $ 25 billion -lrb- 19.7 billion euros -rrb- in september to help the auto industry invest in new generation technology but no timetable was fixed for payments to be made . meanwhile , european automakers - who have cast an envious eye at the us plan and called for similar action at home - have been forced to close factories and cut jobs . protection needed to support healthy firms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier wants to protect firms from becoming affected " we must prevent healthy enterprises from becoming affected -lrb- by this crisis -rrb- , " steinmeier said .
" therefore , we must fight to keep the structures which made the automobile industry so strong in germany from disintegrating . " steinmeier 's statements came as the european investment bank -lrb- eib -rrb- , the eu 's lending arm , proposed to increase loans to europe 's ailing auto sector as part of a broader financing plan . " the eib will propose -lrb- to eu finance ministers -rrb- an increase of 20-30 percent , and that corresponds to 10 to 15 billion euros , " more money for both 2009 and 2010 - including help to small- and medium-sized businesses - a spokesman for the luxembourg-based bank told reporters . the eib has handed out an average of 2 billion euros in loans to the automobile sector in the past three years . french finance minister christine lagarde , whose country currently holds the eu rotating presidency , said monday that support for the sector was first of all a matter for the eib , which was working on the dossier . steinmeier : german banks should use bailout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin bailed-out the banks so other sectors could benefit steinmeier also urged the banking sector to provide more support for the car industry by being more generous in its granting of credit . " one of the biggest threats to the auto industry is the current shyness of the banks to take risks , " he said , adding that the financial package provided by the government for german banks was created for such purposes . however , peter bofinger , a member of the german council of economic experts , said the german government should consider putting the ailing manufacturer opel under state control with a view to attracting private investors to support it once the financial crisis has abated . bofinger claimed that the fears that the nationalization of opel could lead to calls for other companies to come under state protection was unfounded . " with a temporary nationalization , i see little danger that other companies would follow , " he said in an interview with the munich 's merkur newspaper .
" most german carmakers and suppliers would have no interest in being temporarily taken into state ownership . " german chancellor angela merkel spent most of monday locked in discussions with opel bosses but emerged from the lengthy negotiations without reaching a decision on potential state aid .
merkel told reporters that the issue would be debated again and that a decision would be made before christmas . economic experts suspicious of nationalization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel is still waiting for a green light for its state aid otto kentzler , the president of the german confederation of skilled crafts -lrb- zdh -rrb- supported the idea of temporarily nationalizing opel , as it would " support and protect many jobs , not only in the automobile industry but in the manufacturing sector and supply industry . " but mario ohoven , the president of the federal association of medium-size enterprises -lrb- bvmw -rrb- said he believes that smaller companies would suffer should the government support opel . " medium-size enterprises die quietly and unnoticed while large-scale enterprises are saved by the state , " he said , adding that merkel risked making a huge mistake by providing the automakers with a billion-euro emergency parachute as more companies would then demand the same . volker treier , chief economist for the german chamber of commerce and industry -lrb- dihk -rrb- , said nationalization should only be used when there are no other options .

" one of the biggest threats to the auto industry is the current shyness of the banks to take risks , " he said , adding that the financial package provided by the government for german banks was created for such purposes . however , peter bofinger , a member of the german council of economic experts , said the german government should consider putting the ailing manufacturer opel under state control with a view to attracting private investors to support it once the financial crisis has abated . bofinger claimed that the fears that the nationalization of opel could lead to calls for other companies to come under state protection was unfounded . " with a temporary nationalization , i see little danger that other companies would follow , " he said in an interview with the munich 's merkur newspaper .
" most german carmakers and suppliers would have no interest in being temporarily taken into state ownership . " german chancellor angela merkel spent most of monday locked in discussions with opel bosses but emerged from the lengthy negotiations without reaching a decision on potential state aid .
merkel told reporters that the issue would be debated again and that a decision would be made before christmas . economic experts suspicious of nationalization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel is still waiting for a green light for its state aid otto kentzler , the president of the german confederation of skilled crafts -lrb- zdh -rrb- supported the idea of temporarily nationalizing opel , as it would " support and protect many jobs , not only in the automobile industry but in the manufacturing sector and supply industry . " but mario ohoven , the president of the federal association of medium-size enterprises -lrb- bvmw -rrb- said he believes that smaller companies would suffer should the government support opel . " medium-size enterprises die quietly and unnoticed while large-scale enterprises are saved by the state , " he said , adding that merkel risked making a huge mistake by providing the automakers with a billion-euro emergency parachute as more companies would then demand the same . volker treier , chief economist for the german chamber of commerce and industry -lrb- dihk -rrb- , said nationalization should only be used when there are no other options . " government interference should only be necessary in a crisis as the last resort and then only if areas of the national economy are in danger without this nationalization , " he said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it remains to be seen whether the case will ever come to trial . the decision announced by the un highest court in the hague on tuesday , sept .
18 , was a narrow one .
" the court ... by 10 votes to seven finds that ... the court has the jurisdiction to entertain the application by the republic of croatia , " said presiding judge rosalyn higgins .
croatian minister of justice ivan simonovic said he was very happy about the judgement .
" we won in round one , " simonovic told a croatian daily newspaper . " now we have round two and that is to prove genocide in croatia , " croatia lodged its complaint against serbia in 1999 .
zagreb said that serbian participation in the croatian war of 1991-1995 amounted to " a form of genocide which resulted in large numbers of croatian citizens being displaced , killed , tortured , or illegally detained as well as extensive property destruction . "
croatia has estimated that some 20,000 people lost their lives in the conflict .
belgrade had argued that the icj did not have jurisdiction over the complaint .
unsettling history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in october 2008 , former croatian-serb leader milan martic was convicted of war crimes zagreb 's accusations stem from the period immediately after the end of the cold war , which saw the disintegration of the serb-dominated federal republic of yugoslavia .
croatia declared independence from yugoslavia in 1991 .
ethnic serbs , who made up 12 percent of the population in croatia , staged an armed insurrection .
with belgrade 's backing , serbs briefly controlled around 30 percent of what is today croatia , declaring the region known as krajina an independent state .
the ethnic serbian forces were later defeated by the croatian national army with the help of western nations , chiefly the us .
hundreds of thousands of people were displaced during the course of the fighting before it finally ended for good in 1995 .
croatia is seeking punishment against serbians it considers responsible for the violence as well as monetary reparations and the return of croatian cultural treasures .
but it could take years for an actual case against serbia to come to trial , and even if proceedings are initiated , zagreb is unlikely to get everything it wants .
last year , in a similar case , the icj controversially cleared belgrade of any direct responsibility for the genocide of thousands of men and boys in the town of srebrenica in bosnia-hercegovina .
rehabilitation attempt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : capturing mladic could be a major step for serbia toward joining the eu in another event related to the balkans ' troubled history , the prosecutor of the un 's international tribunal for the former yugoslavia , david brammertz , held talks with serbian president boris tadic and other officials .
the focus was on whether belgrade was doing enough to hunt down serbs suspected of crimes against humanity , most notably former bosnian-serbian general ratko mladic , who is wanted on charges of genocide .
brammertz declined to give a public statement , but the serbian government said the talks had gone well .
" brammertz underlined the very good cooperation in the past few months with serbia 's institutions , " the cabinet of the serbian prime minister said in a statement .
serbian cooperation with international efforts to bring war criminals to justice is seen as key to belgrade 's bid to join the eu .

the family is reported to have lost as much as one billion euros as it was forced to buy up inflated vw shares .
adolf merckle 's personal wealth has been estimated at $ 9.2 billion .
adding to the family 's woes is the fact that the merkel group , a consortium that includes major cement and pharmaceuticals companies , is reported to be in debt to the tune of 16 billion euros .

but if it was a loan he was after , he was disappointed .
" we are confident that the banks and the corporation will find a solution , " pfister told dpa after that meeting .
baden-wuerttemberg 's state premier guenther oettinger has said his government is monitoring the situation .
" we 'll be following this topic intensely but prudently , " oettinger said .
" the employees ca n't be left standing there like idiots for something that 's the fault of company directors . "
ludwig merckle said the company had discussed its need for capital with some 40 banks .
" various options are being examined in order to ensure that debts are reduced responsibly , " merckle told the daily suedwest-presse newspaper .
the plans could include selling off some of the merckle group 's prime subsidiaries - in a sign that not even the super-rich can avoid tightening their belts during the economic crisis . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it remains to be seen whether the case will ever come to trial . the decision announced by the un highest court in the hague on tuesday , sept .
18 , was a narrow one .
" the court ... by 10 votes to seven finds that ... the court has the jurisdiction to entertain the application by the republic of croatia , " said presiding judge rosalyn higgins .
croatian minister of justice ivan simonovic said he was very happy about the judgement .
" we won in round one , " simonovic told a croatian daily newspaper . " now we have round two and that is to prove genocide in croatia , " croatia lodged its complaint against serbia in 1999 .
zagreb said that serbian participation in the croatian war of 1991-1995 amounted to " a form of genocide which resulted in large numbers of croatian citizens being displaced , killed , tortured , or illegally detained as well as extensive property destruction . "
croatia has estimated that some 20,000 people lost their lives in the conflict .
belgrade had argued that the icj did not have jurisdiction over the complaint .
unsettling history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in october 2008 , former croatian-serb leader milan martic was convicted of war crimes zagreb 's accusations stem from the period immediately after the end of the cold war , which saw the disintegration of the serb-dominated federal republic of yugoslavia .
croatia declared independence from yugoslavia in 1991 .
ethnic serbs , who made up 12 percent of the population in croatia , staged an armed insurrection .
with belgrade 's backing , serbs briefly controlled around 30 percent of what is today croatia , declaring the region known as krajina an independent state .
the ethnic serbian forces were later defeated by the croatian national army with the help of western nations , chiefly the us .
hundreds of thousands of people were displaced during the course of the fighting before it finally ended for good in 1995 .
croatia is seeking punishment against serbians it considers responsible for the violence as well as monetary reparations and the return of croatian cultural treasures .
but it could take years for an actual case against serbia to come to trial , and even if proceedings are initiated , zagreb is unlikely to get everything it wants .
last year , in a similar case , the icj controversially cleared belgrade of any direct responsibility for the genocide of thousands of men and boys in the town of srebrenica in bosnia-hercegovina .
rehabilitation attempt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : capturing mladic could be a major step for serbia toward joining the eu in another event related to the balkans ' troubled history , the prosecutor of the un 's international tribunal for the former yugoslavia , david brammertz , held talks with serbian president boris tadic and other officials .
the focus was on whether belgrade was doing enough to hunt down serbs suspected of crimes against humanity , most notably former bosnian-serbian general ratko mladic , who is wanted on charges of genocide .
brammertz declined to give a public statement , but the serbian government said the talks had gone well .
" brammertz underlined the very good cooperation in the past few months with serbia 's institutions , " the cabinet of the serbian prime minister said in a statement .
serbian cooperation with international efforts to bring war criminals to justice is seen as key to belgrade 's bid to join the eu .
serbia hopes to begin the process of accession next year , but some member states like the netherlands want to see belgrade apprehend suspects like mladic before starting any official procedures . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

17 , marking the occasion , neumann said the restitution was a sign of improving relations between the former wartime foes . " now that the last of the 117 windows from the marienkirche can finally return to their proper place it is a further sign of reconciliation and the friendship between our two countries , " he said . the panels had been removed from the marienkirche during the war to protect them from bombing .
they were stored in the basement of the potsdam neues palais , where they were seized by red army soldiers in 1945 .
the soviet union claimed them as war booty and shipped them back to russia . at the ceremony , kotenev also noted that nazi germany had been guilty of wanton looting during the war and stressed that the process of restoring property to its original owners must be reciprocal . " i would like to stress the word ' mutual ' because there are still harsh critics and the issue of looted art is often treated in the media as one in which it is the russians who owe a debt , " he said .
" it is often carelessly - or intentionally - forgotten that during the raids of the wehrmacht many russian museums were systematically plundered . " nonetheless , he hailed the return of the panels as " a milestone in a process begun fifty years ago . " " a homecoming is always a special experience , " said kotenev .
" especially when that homecoming follows a long absence . " war booty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the panels depict biblical stories such as noah 's ark in 1958 , some 1,5 million works of art were returned to east germany by the soviet union after the hague convention for the protection of cultural property made it illegal to use cultural property as war reparations . previously , moscow declared that art seized by the red army was retribution for the 27 million soviet lives lost during the second world war . however , disputes over art seized during and after the war continued to overshadow german-russian relations since the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 . recent years have seen some of the russian cultural treasures looted by the nazis returned to russia .
russian deputies passed a measure in 1997 declaring artwork seized from germany to be rightful spoils of war to compensate for the sacking of its own collections . but germany has refused to relinquish its claims .
experts say that there are still some 2.5 million objects missing from germany believed to be in the former soviet union . meanwhile in frankfurt , mayor martin patzelt announced that the missing panes in marienkirche 's stained glass windows will now undergo restoration and are expected to be returned to their original position by next year . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" workers from new -lrb- eu -rrb- member states have satisfied demand in receiving countries ... without creating any major disruption to unemployment or to the salaries of native workers , " spidla said . and since the free movement of people is " a fundamental right " , governments should " lift their restrictions as soon as possible , " the commissioner said . spidla made his comments while presenting a report showing that the eu 's recent enlargement has not , as some had feared , led to a massive influx of polish plumbers - a symbol of cheap labor - to the eu 's 15 oldest and richest members -lrb- eu-15 -rrb- . the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , poland , slovakia and slovenia , as well as cyprus and malta , all joined the eu in 2004 , while bulgaria and romania followed in 2007 . the commission 's latest estimates show that the share of nationals from the 10 countries that joined in 2004 and who have decided to relocate elsewhere in the eu has risen from 0.2 percent in 2003 to 0.5 percent in 2007 , with most of them heading to britain or ireland . the share of bulgarians and romanians now living in the eu-15 , meanwhile , has increased from 0.2 percent to 0.4 percent over the same period , with most heading for spain or italy . more benefits than problems such migrations have , on balance , brought more benefits than problems by satisfying demand and by meeting skill shortages in the receiving countries , spidla said . officials in brussels also noted that the arrival of workers from new member states tends to increase productivity and ease inflationary pressure , since these workers send part of their salaries back home rather than spending it in their new country of residence . and unlike many illegal immigrants arriving from asia , africa or latin america , eu workers tend to enjoy regular contracts and thus pay taxes . restrictions remain in place when the eu agreed to enlarge its borders , the eu executive in brussels sought to allay the concerns of many by granting " old " eu governments the ability to temporarily restrict the influx of workers from new member states . such restrictions must however be abolished entirely by 2011 for workers from the eight central and eastern european countries that joined in 2004 - and by 2013 for bulgarians and romanians . at the moment , only austria , belgium , denmark and germany maintain some restrictions on workers from the eight countries that joined in 2004 , while workers from bulgaria and romania still face barriers to entry in most eu-15 countries . germany should open up asked whether europe 's biggest employer - germany - should now lift its restrictions , spidla said the commission 's report " shows quite clearly that all countries that have opened up -lrb- their labor markets -rrb- have found it to be a good thing . " the commissioner also noted that since migrant workers tend to go where jobs are available , the current recession would not lead to a major increase in the influx of such workers . governments now have until the end of april to communicate to the commission whether they intend to extend their restrictions .
however , they can only do so if they can show that lifting them would lead to " serious disturbances " to their labor markets . polish migration poles meanwhile do make up the largest immigrant group in the european union , followed by romanians and moroccans , an eu report said tuesday . out of some 3 million immigrants that settled in the eu , some 290,000 were poles , said the eurostat statistics based on 2006 . some 2 million poles went to work in other eu countries since poland joined the european union in 2004 .
poles working abroad have contributed to the ex-communist nation 's prosperity , sending home more than $ 8 billion -lrb- 6.32 billion euros -rrb- in 2007 while helping to cut the jobless rate . about 40 percent of all eu immigrants were eu citizens migrating to another member state .
the remaining 60 percent were from european non-member states , asia , the united states and africa , the report said . spain , followed by germany and britain , saw the largest number of immigrants in 2006 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 18.11.2008 brussels : eu states should let in workers from new members großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some eu countries are still hard to reach for workers from new member states eu governments should lift their restrictions on workers from the bloc 's newer member states , since they bring more gain than pain , employment commissioner vladimir spidla said tuesday . " workers from new -lrb- eu -rrb- member states have satisfied demand in receiving countries ... without creating any major disruption to unemployment or to the salaries of native workers , " spidla said . and since the free movement of people is " a fundamental right " , governments should " lift their restrictions as soon as possible , " the commissioner said . spidla made his comments while presenting a report showing that the eu 's recent enlargement has not , as some had feared , led to a massive influx of polish plumbers - a symbol of cheap labor - to the eu 's 15 oldest and richest members -lrb- eu-15 -rrb- . the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , poland , slovakia and slovenia , as well as cyprus and malta , all joined the eu in 2004 , while bulgaria and romania followed in 2007 . the commission 's latest estimates show that the share of nationals from the 10 countries that joined in 2004 and who have decided to relocate elsewhere in the eu has risen from 0.2 percent in 2003 to 0.5 percent in 2007 , with most of them heading to britain or ireland . the share of bulgarians and romanians now living in the eu-15 , meanwhile , has increased from 0.2 percent to 0.4 percent over the same period , with most heading for spain or italy . more benefits than problems such migrations have , on balance , brought more benefits than problems by satisfying demand and by meeting skill shortages in the receiving countries , spidla said . officials in brussels also noted that the arrival of workers from new member states tends to increase productivity and ease inflationary pressure , since these workers send part of their salaries back home rather than spending it in their new country of residence . and unlike many illegal immigrants arriving from asia , africa or latin america , eu workers tend to enjoy regular contracts and thus pay taxes . restrictions remain in place when the eu agreed to enlarge its borders , the eu executive in brussels sought to allay the concerns of many by granting " old " eu governments the ability to temporarily restrict the influx of workers from new member states . such restrictions must however be abolished entirely by 2011 for workers from the eight central and eastern european countries that joined in 2004 - and by 2013 for bulgarians and romanians . at the moment , only austria , belgium , denmark and germany maintain some restrictions on workers from the eight countries that joined in 2004 , while workers from bulgaria and romania still face barriers to entry in most eu-15 countries . germany should open up asked whether europe 's biggest employer - germany - should now lift its restrictions , spidla said the commission 's report " shows quite clearly that all countries that have opened up -lrb- their labor markets -rrb- have found it to be a good thing . " the commissioner also noted that since migrant workers tend to go where jobs are available , the current recession would not lead to a major increase in the influx of such workers . governments now have until the end of april to communicate to the commission whether they intend to extend their restrictions .

" workers from new -lrb- eu -rrb- member states have satisfied demand in receiving countries ... without creating any major disruption to unemployment or to the salaries of native workers , " spidla said . and since the free movement of people is " a fundamental right " , governments should " lift their restrictions as soon as possible , " the commissioner said . spidla made his comments while presenting a report showing that the eu 's recent enlargement has not , as some had feared , led to a massive influx of polish plumbers - a symbol of cheap labor - to the eu 's 15 oldest and richest members -lrb- eu-15 -rrb- . the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , poland , slovakia and slovenia , as well as cyprus and malta , all joined the eu in 2004 , while bulgaria and romania followed in 2007 . the commission 's latest estimates show that the share of nationals from the 10 countries that joined in 2004 and who have decided to relocate elsewhere in the eu has risen from 0.2 percent in 2003 to 0.5 percent in 2007 , with most of them heading to britain or ireland . the share of bulgarians and romanians now living in the eu-15 , meanwhile , has increased from 0.2 percent to 0.4 percent over the same period , with most heading for spain or italy . more benefits than problems such migrations have , on balance , brought more benefits than problems by satisfying demand and by meeting skill shortages in the receiving countries , spidla said . officials in brussels also noted that the arrival of workers from new member states tends to increase productivity and ease inflationary pressure , since these workers send part of their salaries back home rather than spending it in their new country of residence . and unlike many illegal immigrants arriving from asia , africa or latin america , eu workers tend to enjoy regular contracts and thus pay taxes . restrictions remain in place when the eu agreed to enlarge its borders , the eu executive in brussels sought to allay the concerns of many by granting " old " eu governments the ability to temporarily restrict the influx of workers from new member states . such restrictions must however be abolished entirely by 2011 for workers from the eight central and eastern european countries that joined in 2004 - and by 2013 for bulgarians and romanians . at the moment , only austria , belgium , denmark and germany maintain some restrictions on workers from the eight countries that joined in 2004 , while workers from bulgaria and romania still face barriers to entry in most eu-15 countries . germany should open up asked whether europe 's biggest employer - germany - should now lift its restrictions , spidla said the commission 's report " shows quite clearly that all countries that have opened up -lrb- their labor markets -rrb- have found it to be a good thing . " the commissioner also noted that since migrant workers tend to go where jobs are available , the current recession would not lead to a major increase in the influx of such workers . governments now have until the end of april to communicate to the commission whether they intend to extend their restrictions .
however , they can only do so if they can show that lifting them would lead to " serious disturbances " to their labor markets . polish migration poles meanwhile do make up the largest immigrant group in the european union , followed by romanians and moroccans , an eu report said tuesday . out of some 3 million immigrants that settled in the eu , some 290,000 were poles , said the eurostat statistics based on 2006 . some 2 million poles went to work in other eu countries since poland joined the european union in 2004 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 18.11.2008 brussels : eu states should let in workers from new members großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some eu countries are still hard to reach for workers from new member states eu governments should lift their restrictions on workers from the bloc 's newer member states , since they bring more gain than pain , employment commissioner vladimir spidla said tuesday . " workers from new -lrb- eu -rrb- member states have satisfied demand in receiving countries ... without creating any major disruption to unemployment or to the salaries of native workers , " spidla said . and since the free movement of people is " a fundamental right " , governments should " lift their restrictions as soon as possible , " the commissioner said . spidla made his comments while presenting a report showing that the eu 's recent enlargement has not , as some had feared , led to a massive influx of polish plumbers - a symbol of cheap labor - to the eu 's 15 oldest and richest members -lrb- eu-15 -rrb- . the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , poland , slovakia and slovenia , as well as cyprus and malta , all joined the eu in 2004 , while bulgaria and romania followed in 2007 . the commission 's latest estimates show that the share of nationals from the 10 countries that joined in 2004 and who have decided to relocate elsewhere in the eu has risen from 0.2 percent in 2003 to 0.5 percent in 2007 , with most of them heading to britain or ireland . the share of bulgarians and romanians now living in the eu-15 , meanwhile , has increased from 0.2 percent to 0.4 percent over the same period , with most heading for spain or italy . more benefits than problems such migrations have , on balance , brought more benefits than problems by satisfying demand and by meeting skill shortages in the receiving countries , spidla said . officials in brussels also noted that the arrival of workers from new member states tends to increase productivity and ease inflationary pressure , since these workers send part of their salaries back home rather than spending it in their new country of residence . and unlike many illegal immigrants arriving from asia , africa or latin america , eu workers tend to enjoy regular contracts and thus pay taxes . restrictions remain in place when the eu agreed to enlarge its borders , the eu executive in brussels sought to allay the concerns of many by granting " old " eu governments the ability to temporarily restrict the influx of workers from new member states . such restrictions must however be abolished entirely by 2011 for workers from the eight central and eastern european countries that joined in 2004 - and by 2013 for bulgarians and romanians . at the moment , only austria , belgium , denmark and germany maintain some restrictions on workers from the eight countries that joined in 2004 , while workers from bulgaria and romania still face barriers to entry in most eu-15 countries . germany should open up asked whether europe 's biggest employer - germany - should now lift its restrictions , spidla said the commission 's report " shows quite clearly that all countries that have opened up -lrb- their labor markets -rrb- have found it to be a good thing . " the commissioner also noted that since migrant workers tend to go where jobs are available , the current recession would not lead to a major increase in the influx of such workers . governments now have until the end of april to communicate to the commission whether they intend to extend their restrictions .
however , they can only do so if they can show that lifting them would lead to " serious disturbances " to their labor markets . polish migration poles meanwhile do make up the largest immigrant group in the european union , followed by romanians and moroccans , an eu report said tuesday . out of some 3 million immigrants that settled in the eu , some 290,000 were poles , said the eurostat statistics based on 2006 . some 2 million poles went to work in other eu countries since poland joined the european union in 2004 .
poles working abroad have contributed to the ex-communist nation 's prosperity , sending home more than $ 8 billion -lrb- 6.32 billion euros -rrb- in 2007 while helping to cut the jobless rate . about 40 percent of all eu immigrants were eu citizens migrating to another member state .
the remaining 60 percent were from european non-member states , asia , the united states and africa , the report said . spain , followed by germany and britain , saw the largest number of immigrants in 2006 .
luxembourg had the highest rate of immigrants with 28.8 per 1,000 inhabitants . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in these tough times , even the super-wealthy are n't protected against getting soaked . vw stocks went on a wild ride at the end of october , at one point breaking the 1000-euro -lrb- $ 1,264 -rrb- mark before plummeting back down to earth .
but adolf merckle and his family , who had bought options predicated on the idea of vw share prices falling , got run over .
now the family holding company is trouble .
" the -lsb- holding company -rsb- too has suffered under the extreme turbulence in the financial markets in the past few weeks , " merckle 's son ludwig confirmed to dpa press agency on tuesday , nov .
18 .
the family is reported to have lost as much as one billion euros as it was forced to buy up inflated vw shares .
adolf merckle 's personal wealth has been estimated at $ 9.2 billion .
adding to the family 's woes is the fact that the merkel group , a consortium that includes major cement and pharmaceuticals companies , is reported to be in debt to the tune of 16 billion euros .
now one of germany 's top billionaires is facing the unusual challenge of a personal cash crunch - and the state is not yet stepping in .
no deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : billionaire merckle is now trying to see about a loan adolf merckle met with the economics minister of the state of baden-wuerttemberg , ernst pfister , to discuss the financial troubles of the consortium , which employs some 100,000 people .
but if it was a loan he was after , he was disappointed .
" we are confident that the banks and the corporation will find a solution , " pfister told dpa after that meeting .
baden-wuerttemberg 's state premier guenther oettinger has said his government is monitoring the situation .
" we 'll be following this topic intensely but prudently , " oettinger said .
" the employees ca n't be left standing there like idiots for something that 's the fault of company directors . "
ludwig merckle said the company had discussed its need for capital with some 40 banks .
" various options are being examined in order to ensure that debts are reduced responsibly , " merckle told the daily suedwest-presse newspaper .
the plans could include selling off some of the merckle group 's prime subsidiaries - in a sign that not even the super-rich can avoid tightening their belts during the economic crisis . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 18.11.2008 opinion : bailouts fine in moderation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government is set to decide whether to grant ailing german carmaker opel 1 billion euros in credit guarantees .
dw 's karl zawadzky asks whether state support is really the way to go . the government in berlin responded to opel 's cry for help by saying it would study the plea - unlike hessen 's state premier roland koch , who immediately called for a " protective shield " in the form of comprehensive state support for germany 's entire automotive industry and government help totalling 500 million euros -lrb- $ 632 million -rrb- of the state budget .
the government 's more measured response is an eminently sensible one , since the german company owned by general motors is not actually at immediate risk of bankruptcy .
and if regional governments start bailing out individual companies facing insolvency - for whatever reasons - then who knows where that could lead ?
worst-case scenarios executives and union leaders at gm subsidiary opel turned to berlin and the regional governments in the states where opel has factories out of fear that parent company general motors might go bust and will no longer be able to pay back the loans it owes its german subsidiary .
but this would be a worst-case scenario - and an unlikely one , given that in the us , congress is currently working out the details of a $ 25 billion rescue package for america 's big three carmakers general motors , ford , and chrysler .
so there clearly is enough time to weigh the options , instead of acting rashly , and the options do need to be weighed .
for example , it makes no sense to use german taxpayers ' money given the risk that funding will simply end up in the pockets of the american parent company - especially since several years ago , general motors turned opel from a joint stock company into a limited liability company , not least in order to boost control of its subsidiary . after merkel held talks in berlin with carl-peter forster , ceo of general motors europe , hans demant , opel ceo and klaus franz , president of the works council , it became clear that berlin and the regional governments where opel 's factories are based do not intend to abandon the company .
but a bailout will come with strings attached .
and no one has any intention of introducing state support for the entire automotive industry .
many companies , after all , including daimler , bmw , vw and porsche , are currently doing very nicely indeed .
they are certainly not suffering from an acute lack of cash - although a lack of customers is a growing problem .
out of touch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky partly to blame is a product range that reflects neither the financial crisis nor environmental concerns . with their enormous gas guzzlers , state support would not be enough to pull these companies through a financial crisis .
they need more than bailouts , credit guarantees and stimulus packages .
the consumers simply do n't want these kinds of cars any more - not even in the us , traditionally home to low gas prices and a somewhat undeveloped environmental awareness .
the carmakers need to wake up and smell the coffee . developing new models that reflect changing consumer habits requires time and effort - and possibly even leads to closures and job cuts .
a number of suppliers have already bitten the dust , and if its parent company goes bankrupt , then heads will also roll at opel .
nonetheless , over-impulsive , sweeping aid packages make no sense .
a credit guarantee should be offered on a case-by-case basis , and only after much deliberation .
not only is it a use of taxpayers ' money , it is also a move that gives the company at stake an unfair competitive advantage .
a state aid package is a more favorable financing solution than those available to other companies .
were even financially stable companies which could actually weather the financial crisis under their own steam to start considering this an option , they would all want credit guarantees .
the government needs to avoid companies enjoying what is known as windfall gains - and it also needs to avoid its support ending up in the wrong place .
when it comes to internal funds , after all , multinationals in particular tend to be very " flexible . "
just one cog in the wheel the automotive industry is important , but its role in the economy is not nearly as important as that of the banks .

but it remains to be seen whether the case will ever come to trial . the decision announced by the un highest court in the hague on tuesday , sept .
18 , was a narrow one .
" the court ... by 10 votes to seven finds that ... the court has the jurisdiction to entertain the application by the republic of croatia , " said presiding judge rosalyn higgins .
croatian minister of justice ivan simonovic said he was very happy about the judgement .
" we won in round one , " simonovic told a croatian daily newspaper . " now we have round two and that is to prove genocide in croatia , " croatia lodged its complaint against serbia in 1999 .
zagreb said that serbian participation in the croatian war of 1991-1995 amounted to " a form of genocide which resulted in large numbers of croatian citizens being displaced , killed , tortured , or illegally detained as well as extensive property destruction . "
croatia has estimated that some 20,000 people lost their lives in the conflict .
belgrade had argued that the icj did not have jurisdiction over the complaint .
unsettling history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in october 2008 , former croatian-serb leader milan martic was convicted of war crimes zagreb 's accusations stem from the period immediately after the end of the cold war , which saw the disintegration of the serb-dominated federal republic of yugoslavia .
croatia declared independence from yugoslavia in 1991 .
ethnic serbs , who made up 12 percent of the population in croatia , staged an armed insurrection .
with belgrade 's backing , serbs briefly controlled around 30 percent of what is today croatia , declaring the region known as krajina an independent state .
the ethnic serbian forces were later defeated by the croatian national army with the help of western nations , chiefly the us .
hundreds of thousands of people were displaced during the course of the fighting before it finally ended for good in 1995 .
croatia is seeking punishment against serbians it considers responsible for the violence as well as monetary reparations and the return of croatian cultural treasures .
but it could take years for an actual case against serbia to come to trial , and even if proceedings are initiated , zagreb is unlikely to get everything it wants .
last year , in a similar case , the icj controversially cleared belgrade of any direct responsibility for the genocide of thousands of men and boys in the town of srebrenica in bosnia-hercegovina .
rehabilitation attempt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : capturing mladic could be a major step for serbia toward joining the eu in another event related to the balkans ' troubled history , the prosecutor of the un 's international tribunal for the former yugoslavia , david brammertz , held talks with serbian president boris tadic and other officials .
the focus was on whether belgrade was doing enough to hunt down serbs suspected of crimes against humanity , most notably former bosnian-serbian general ratko mladic , who is wanted on charges of genocide .
brammertz declined to give a public statement , but the serbian government said the talks had gone well .
" brammertz underlined the very good cooperation in the past few months with serbia 's institutions , " the cabinet of the serbian prime minister said in a statement .
serbian cooperation with international efforts to bring war criminals to justice is seen as key to belgrade 's bid to join the eu .
serbia hopes to begin the process of accession next year , but some member states like the netherlands want to see belgrade apprehend suspects like mladic before starting any official procedures . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw 's karl zawadzky asks whether state support is really the way to go . the government in berlin responded to opel 's cry for help by saying it would study the plea - unlike hessen 's state premier roland koch , who immediately called for a " protective shield " in the form of comprehensive state support for germany 's entire automotive industry and government help totalling 500 million euros -lrb- $ 632 million -rrb- of the state budget .
the government 's more measured response is an eminently sensible one , since the german company owned by general motors is not actually at immediate risk of bankruptcy .
and if regional governments start bailing out individual companies facing insolvency - for whatever reasons - then who knows where that could lead ?
worst-case scenarios executives and union leaders at gm subsidiary opel turned to berlin and the regional governments in the states where opel has factories out of fear that parent company general motors might go bust and will no longer be able to pay back the loans it owes its german subsidiary .
but this would be a worst-case scenario - and an unlikely one , given that in the us , congress is currently working out the details of a $ 25 billion rescue package for america 's big three carmakers general motors , ford , and chrysler .
so there clearly is enough time to weigh the options , instead of acting rashly , and the options do need to be weighed .
for example , it makes no sense to use german taxpayers ' money given the risk that funding will simply end up in the pockets of the american parent company - especially since several years ago , general motors turned opel from a joint stock company into a limited liability company , not least in order to boost control of its subsidiary . after merkel held talks in berlin with carl-peter forster , ceo of general motors europe , hans demant , opel ceo and klaus franz , president of the works council , it became clear that berlin and the regional governments where opel 's factories are based do not intend to abandon the company .
but a bailout will come with strings attached .
and no one has any intention of introducing state support for the entire automotive industry .
many companies , after all , including daimler , bmw , vw and porsche , are currently doing very nicely indeed .
they are certainly not suffering from an acute lack of cash - although a lack of customers is a growing problem .
out of touch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky partly to blame is a product range that reflects neither the financial crisis nor environmental concerns . with their enormous gas guzzlers , state support would not be enough to pull these companies through a financial crisis .
they need more than bailouts , credit guarantees and stimulus packages .
the consumers simply do n't want these kinds of cars any more - not even in the us , traditionally home to low gas prices and a somewhat undeveloped environmental awareness .
the carmakers need to wake up and smell the coffee . developing new models that reflect changing consumer habits requires time and effort - and possibly even leads to closures and job cuts .
a number of suppliers have already bitten the dust , and if its parent company goes bankrupt , then heads will also roll at opel .
nonetheless , over-impulsive , sweeping aid packages make no sense .
a credit guarantee should be offered on a case-by-case basis , and only after much deliberation .
not only is it a use of taxpayers ' money , it is also a move that gives the company at stake an unfair competitive advantage .
a state aid package is a more favorable financing solution than those available to other companies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 18.11.2008 opinion : bailouts fine in moderation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government is set to decide whether to grant ailing german carmaker opel 1 billion euros in credit guarantees .
dw 's karl zawadzky asks whether state support is really the way to go . the government in berlin responded to opel 's cry for help by saying it would study the plea - unlike hessen 's state premier roland koch , who immediately called for a " protective shield " in the form of comprehensive state support for germany 's entire automotive industry and government help totalling 500 million euros -lrb- $ 632 million -rrb- of the state budget .
the government 's more measured response is an eminently sensible one , since the german company owned by general motors is not actually at immediate risk of bankruptcy .
and if regional governments start bailing out individual companies facing insolvency - for whatever reasons - then who knows where that could lead ?
worst-case scenarios executives and union leaders at gm subsidiary opel turned to berlin and the regional governments in the states where opel has factories out of fear that parent company general motors might go bust and will no longer be able to pay back the loans it owes its german subsidiary .
but this would be a worst-case scenario - and an unlikely one , given that in the us , congress is currently working out the details of a $ 25 billion rescue package for america 's big three carmakers general motors , ford , and chrysler .
so there clearly is enough time to weigh the options , instead of acting rashly , and the options do need to be weighed .
for example , it makes no sense to use german taxpayers ' money given the risk that funding will simply end up in the pockets of the american parent company - especially since several years ago , general motors turned opel from a joint stock company into a limited liability company , not least in order to boost control of its subsidiary . after merkel held talks in berlin with carl-peter forster , ceo of general motors europe , hans demant , opel ceo and klaus franz , president of the works council , it became clear that berlin and the regional governments where opel 's factories are based do not intend to abandon the company .
but a bailout will come with strings attached .
and no one has any intention of introducing state support for the entire automotive industry .
many companies , after all , including daimler , bmw , vw and porsche , are currently doing very nicely indeed .
they are certainly not suffering from an acute lack of cash - although a lack of customers is a growing problem .
out of touch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky partly to blame is a product range that reflects neither the financial crisis nor environmental concerns . with their enormous gas guzzlers , state support would not be enough to pull these companies through a financial crisis .
they need more than bailouts , credit guarantees and stimulus packages .
the consumers simply do n't want these kinds of cars any more - not even in the us , traditionally home to low gas prices and a somewhat undeveloped environmental awareness .
the carmakers need to wake up and smell the coffee . developing new models that reflect changing consumer habits requires time and effort - and possibly even leads to closures and job cuts .
a number of suppliers have already bitten the dust , and if its parent company goes bankrupt , then heads will also roll at opel .
nonetheless , over-impulsive , sweeping aid packages make no sense .
a credit guarantee should be offered on a case-by-case basis , and only after much deliberation .
not only is it a use of taxpayers ' money , it is also a move that gives the company at stake an unfair competitive advantage .
a state aid package is a more favorable financing solution than those available to other companies .
were even financially stable companies which could actually weather the financial crisis under their own steam to start considering this an option , they would all want credit guarantees .
the government needs to avoid companies enjoying what is known as windfall gains - and it also needs to avoid its support ending up in the wrong place .
when it comes to internal funds , after all , multinationals in particular tend to be very " flexible . "
just one cog in the wheel the automotive industry is important , but its role in the economy is not nearly as important as that of the banks .
even so , the state will do what it can to extend lifelines to carmakers facing the abyss .
too many jobs are at stake .
in germany , opel employs 25,000 people , its suppliers another 50,000 .
for the time being , opel 's future appears safe .
but everything depends on general motors .
the government in berlin by all means needs to address the crisis in the automotive industry - and especially opel 's case .
but other economic sectors are also hard hit by the troubled economy .
and while the government might be able to help out the odd company with an occasional loan guarantee , it ca n't afford to rescue entire sectors .

he talked to dw-world about the g20 financial summit and the global economic crisis . dw-world.de : most economists have called the g20 summit a success .
what is your opinion on the summit as a ceo of a global company ? martin richenhagen : the most positive aspect of the summit for agco is that the political leaders first of all identified a problem and secondly started to harmonize and coordinate the action plan .
for a global company , it is very important that you have stable rules and conditions .
for me , it looks likely as that this will happen now . let 's talk briefly about the global financial crisis .
in the us , but also in europe , increasing numbers of companies are suffering , and its not just banks .
how is the agriculture industry affected by the financial meltdown and do you fear that the crisis will spread to more sectors of the economy ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agriculture is n't like most other businesses , according to richenhagen first of all , the farm business is following a slightly different logic .
the farm business is driven by the growing world population .
about 70 million people a year are added to the population .
second , the sector is driven by renewable fuels and third by changing diets in emerging markets like china and india .
therefore , agricultural demand is actually higher than supply and will be higher than supply for many years to come . as far as our company is concerned , we have managed things more carefully over the last few years and our debt-to-capital is down to zero .
we also expect a cash position of $ 600 million for the end of this year .
we work together with pretty good banks , and for many years we have had an agco finance bank helping customers with financing .
with that in mind , i think we are pretty well prepared for this crisis and we will not suffer too much from it . in the united states and in europe there is a heated debate whether the government should bail out giant companies like car manufacturers .
should the government rescue giant companies or let them go bust ? this is a difficult one .
the same managers who do n't normally ask for state or governmental support or partial support are all of a sudden starting to cry for help .
i personally believe companies that have not been managed well , like general motors , should go bankrupt .
their problem is that they have a very bloated organization , they are really not lean enough and this has been the case for at least 20 or 30 years .
they are just a weak management team and therefore the consequence is that they should go bankrupt . interview : michael knigge -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he talked to dw-world about the g20 financial summit and the global economic crisis . dw-world.de : most economists have called the g20 summit a success .
what is your opinion on the summit as a ceo of a global company ? martin richenhagen : the most positive aspect of the summit for agco is that the political leaders first of all identified a problem and secondly started to harmonize and coordinate the action plan .
for a global company , it is very important that you have stable rules and conditions .
for me , it looks likely as that this will happen now . let 's talk briefly about the global financial crisis .
in the us , but also in europe , increasing numbers of companies are suffering , and its not just banks .
how is the agriculture industry affected by the financial meltdown and do you fear that the crisis will spread to more sectors of the economy ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agriculture is n't like most other businesses , according to richenhagen first of all , the farm business is following a slightly different logic .
the farm business is driven by the growing world population .
about 70 million people a year are added to the population .
second , the sector is driven by renewable fuels and third by changing diets in emerging markets like china and india .
therefore , agricultural demand is actually higher than supply and will be higher than supply for many years to come . as far as our company is concerned , we have managed things more carefully over the last few years and our debt-to-capital is down to zero .
we also expect a cash position of $ 600 million for the end of this year .
we work together with pretty good banks , and for many years we have had an agco finance bank helping customers with financing .
with that in mind , i think we are pretty well prepared for this crisis and we will not suffer too much from it . in the united states and in europe there is a heated debate whether the government should bail out giant companies like car manufacturers .
should the government rescue giant companies or let them go bust ? this is a difficult one .
the same managers who do n't normally ask for state or governmental support or partial support are all of a sudden starting to cry for help .
i personally believe companies that have not been managed well , like general motors , should go bankrupt .
their problem is that they have a very bloated organization , they are really not lean enough and this has been the case for at least 20 or 30 years .
they are just a weak management team and therefore the consequence is that they should go bankrupt . interview : michael knigge -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

17 , that the eu members states should develop a common rescue package to help those car manufacturers stricken by the current economic crisis . " if we agree on a common direction forward , we will remain strong within europe and in our competition with other sectors in the world , " steinmeier , the social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- candidate for chancellor , said after meeting with the heads of germany 's largest auto manufacturers on monday . juncker , in an interview with germany 's bild newspaper , agreed . " i agree with the idea of a rescue plan for the automobile industry on a european level , " he said .
" if the us government is prepared to gives billions of dollars to save ford , general motors and chrysler before they fail , then we can not simply watch and abandon our manufacturers in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker sees no sense in individual rescue packages " it now makes little sense for germany , france or italy to try to protect their automobile industry individually .
that can only be done together , " juncker said . european commission chief jose manuel barroso said friday that the eu is ready to take action at the world trade organization if it judges that us aid for its struggling auto industry is " illegal . " the us congress approved an aid package worth $ 25 billion -lrb- 19.7 billion euros -rrb- in september to help the auto industry invest in new generation technology but no timetable was fixed for payments to be made . meanwhile , european automakers - who have cast an envious eye at the us plan and called for similar action at home - have been forced to close factories and cut jobs . protection needed to support healthy firms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier wants to protect firms from becoming affected " we must prevent healthy enterprises from becoming affected -lrb- by this crisis -rrb- , " steinmeier said .
" therefore , we must fight to keep the structures which made the automobile industry so strong in germany from disintegrating . " steinmeier 's statements came as the european investment bank -lrb- eib -rrb- , the eu 's lending arm , proposed to increase loans to europe 's ailing auto sector as part of a broader financing plan . " the eib will propose -lrb- to eu finance ministers -rrb- an increase of 20-30 percent , and that corresponds to 10 to 15 billion euros , " more money for both 2009 and 2010 - including help to small- and medium-sized businesses - a spokesman for the luxembourg-based bank told reporters . the eib has handed out an average of 2 billion euros in loans to the automobile sector in the past three years . french finance minister christine lagarde , whose country currently holds the eu rotating presidency , said monday that support for the sector was first of all a matter for the eib , which was working on the dossier . steinmeier : german banks should use bailout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin bailed-out the banks so other sectors could benefit steinmeier also urged the banking sector to provide more support for the car industry by being more generous in its granting of credit . " one of the biggest threats to the auto industry is the current shyness of the banks to take risks , " he said , adding that the financial package provided by the government for german banks was created for such purposes . however , peter bofinger , a member of the german council of economic experts , said the german government should consider putting the ailing manufacturer opel under state control with a view to attracting private investors to support it once the financial crisis has abated . bofinger claimed that the fears that the nationalization of opel could lead to calls for other companies to come under state protection was unfounded . " with a temporary nationalization , i see little danger that other companies would follow , " he said in an interview with the munich 's merkur newspaper .
" most german carmakers and suppliers would have no interest in being temporarily taken into state ownership . " german chancellor angela merkel spent most of monday locked in discussions with opel bosses but emerged from the lengthy negotiations without reaching a decision on potential state aid .
merkel told reporters that the issue would be debated again and that a decision would be made before christmas . economic experts suspicious of nationalization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel is still waiting for a green light for its state aid otto kentzler , the president of the german confederation of skilled crafts -lrb- zdh -rrb- supported the idea of temporarily nationalizing opel , as it would " support and protect many jobs , not only in the automobile industry but in the manufacturing sector and supply industry . " but mario ohoven , the president of the federal association of medium-size enterprises -lrb- bvmw -rrb- said he believes that smaller companies would suffer should the government support opel . " medium-size enterprises die quietly and unnoticed while large-scale enterprises are saved by the state , " he said , adding that merkel risked making a huge mistake by providing the automakers with a billion-euro emergency parachute as more companies would then demand the same . volker treier , chief economist for the german chamber of commerce and industry -lrb- dihk -rrb- , said nationalization should only be used when there are no other options . " government interference should only be necessary in a crisis as the last resort and then only if areas of the national economy are in danger without this nationalization , " he said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" with a temporary nationalization , i see little danger that other companies would follow , " he said in an interview with the munich 's merkur newspaper .
" most german carmakers and suppliers would have no interest in being temporarily taken into state ownership . " german chancellor angela merkel spent most of monday locked in discussions with opel bosses but emerged from the lengthy negotiations without reaching a decision on potential state aid .
merkel told reporters that the issue would be debated again and that a decision would be made before christmas . economic experts suspicious of nationalization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel is still waiting for a green light for its state aid otto kentzler , the president of the german confederation of skilled crafts -lrb- zdh -rrb- supported the idea of temporarily nationalizing opel , as it would " support and protect many jobs , not only in the automobile industry but in the manufacturing sector and supply industry . " but mario ohoven , the president of the federal association of medium-size enterprises -lrb- bvmw -rrb- said he believes that smaller companies would suffer should the government support opel . " medium-size enterprises die quietly and unnoticed while large-scale enterprises are saved by the state , " he said , adding that merkel risked making a huge mistake by providing the automakers with a billion-euro emergency parachute as more companies would then demand the same . volker treier , chief economist for the german chamber of commerce and industry -lrb- dihk -rrb- , said nationalization should only be used when there are no other options . " government interference should only be necessary in a crisis as the last resort and then only if areas of the national economy are in danger without this nationalization , " he said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" workers from new -lrb- eu -rrb- member states have satisfied demand in receiving countries ... without creating any major disruption to unemployment or to the salaries of native workers , " spidla said . and since the free movement of people is " a fundamental right " , governments should " lift their restrictions as soon as possible , " the commissioner said . spidla made his comments while presenting a report showing that the eu 's recent enlargement has not , as some had feared , led to a massive influx of polish plumbers - a symbol of cheap labor - to the eu 's 15 oldest and richest members -lrb- eu-15 -rrb- . the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , poland , slovakia and slovenia , as well as cyprus and malta , all joined the eu in 2004 , while bulgaria and romania followed in 2007 . the commission 's latest estimates show that the share of nationals from the 10 countries that joined in 2004 and who have decided to relocate elsewhere in the eu has risen from 0.2 percent in 2003 to 0.5 percent in 2007 , with most of them heading to britain or ireland . the share of bulgarians and romanians now living in the eu-15 , meanwhile , has increased from 0.2 percent to 0.4 percent over the same period , with most heading for spain or italy . more benefits than problems such migrations have , on balance , brought more benefits than problems by satisfying demand and by meeting skill shortages in the receiving countries , spidla said . officials in brussels also noted that the arrival of workers from new member states tends to increase productivity and ease inflationary pressure , since these workers send part of their salaries back home rather than spending it in their new country of residence . and unlike many illegal immigrants arriving from asia , africa or latin america , eu workers tend to enjoy regular contracts and thus pay taxes . restrictions remain in place when the eu agreed to enlarge its borders , the eu executive in brussels sought to allay the concerns of many by granting " old " eu governments the ability to temporarily restrict the influx of workers from new member states . such restrictions must however be abolished entirely by 2011 for workers from the eight central and eastern european countries that joined in 2004 - and by 2013 for bulgarians and romanians . at the moment , only austria , belgium , denmark and germany maintain some restrictions on workers from the eight countries that joined in 2004 , while workers from bulgaria and romania still face barriers to entry in most eu-15 countries . germany should open up asked whether europe 's biggest employer - germany - should now lift its restrictions , spidla said the commission 's report " shows quite clearly that all countries that have opened up -lrb- their labor markets -rrb- have found it to be a good thing . " the commissioner also noted that since migrant workers tend to go where jobs are available , the current recession would not lead to a major increase in the influx of such workers . governments now have until the end of april to communicate to the commission whether they intend to extend their restrictions .
however , they can only do so if they can show that lifting them would lead to " serious disturbances " to their labor markets . polish migration poles meanwhile do make up the largest immigrant group in the european union , followed by romanians and moroccans , an eu report said tuesday . out of some 3 million immigrants that settled in the eu , some 290,000 were poles , said the eurostat statistics based on 2006 . some 2 million poles went to work in other eu countries since poland joined the european union in 2004 .
poles working abroad have contributed to the ex-communist nation 's prosperity , sending home more than $ 8 billion -lrb- 6.32 billion euros -rrb- in 2007 while helping to cut the jobless rate . about 40 percent of all eu immigrants were eu citizens migrating to another member state .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 18.11.2008 opinion : bailouts fine in moderation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government is set to decide whether to grant ailing german carmaker opel 1 billion euros in credit guarantees .
dw 's karl zawadzky asks whether state support is really the way to go . the government in berlin responded to opel 's cry for help by saying it would study the plea - unlike hessen 's state premier roland koch , who immediately called for a " protective shield " in the form of comprehensive state support for germany 's entire automotive industry and government help totalling 500 million euros -lrb- $ 632 million -rrb- of the state budget .
the government 's more measured response is an eminently sensible one , since the german company owned by general motors is not actually at immediate risk of bankruptcy .
and if regional governments start bailing out individual companies facing insolvency - for whatever reasons - then who knows where that could lead ?
worst-case scenarios executives and union leaders at gm subsidiary opel turned to berlin and the regional governments in the states where opel has factories out of fear that parent company general motors might go bust and will no longer be able to pay back the loans it owes its german subsidiary .
but this would be a worst-case scenario - and an unlikely one , given that in the us , congress is currently working out the details of a $ 25 billion rescue package for america 's big three carmakers general motors , ford , and chrysler .
so there clearly is enough time to weigh the options , instead of acting rashly , and the options do need to be weighed .
for example , it makes no sense to use german taxpayers ' money given the risk that funding will simply end up in the pockets of the american parent company - especially since several years ago , general motors turned opel from a joint stock company into a limited liability company , not least in order to boost control of its subsidiary . after merkel held talks in berlin with carl-peter forster , ceo of general motors europe , hans demant , opel ceo and klaus franz , president of the works council , it became clear that berlin and the regional governments where opel 's factories are based do not intend to abandon the company .
but a bailout will come with strings attached .
and no one has any intention of introducing state support for the entire automotive industry .
many companies , after all , including daimler , bmw , vw and porsche , are currently doing very nicely indeed .
they are certainly not suffering from an acute lack of cash - although a lack of customers is a growing problem .
out of touch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky partly to blame is a product range that reflects neither the financial crisis nor environmental concerns . with their enormous gas guzzlers , state support would not be enough to pull these companies through a financial crisis .
they need more than bailouts , credit guarantees and stimulus packages .
the consumers simply do n't want these kinds of cars any more - not even in the us , traditionally home to low gas prices and a somewhat undeveloped environmental awareness .
the carmakers need to wake up and smell the coffee . developing new models that reflect changing consumer habits requires time and effort - and possibly even leads to closures and job cuts .
a number of suppliers have already bitten the dust , and if its parent company goes bankrupt , then heads will also roll at opel .
nonetheless , over-impulsive , sweeping aid packages make no sense .
a credit guarantee should be offered on a case-by-case basis , and only after much deliberation .
not only is it a use of taxpayers ' money , it is also a move that gives the company at stake an unfair competitive advantage .
a state aid package is a more favorable financing solution than those available to other companies .
were even financially stable companies which could actually weather the financial crisis under their own steam to start considering this an option , they would all want credit guarantees .
the government needs to avoid companies enjoying what is known as windfall gains - and it also needs to avoid its support ending up in the wrong place .
when it comes to internal funds , after all , multinationals in particular tend to be very " flexible . "
just one cog in the wheel the automotive industry is important , but its role in the economy is not nearly as important as that of the banks .
even so , the state will do what it can to extend lifelines to carmakers facing the abyss .
too many jobs are at stake .
in germany , opel employs 25,000 people , its suppliers another 50,000 .
for the time being , opel 's future appears safe .
but everything depends on general motors .
the government in berlin by all means needs to address the crisis in the automotive industry - and especially opel 's case .
but other economic sectors are also hard hit by the troubled economy .
and while the government might be able to help out the odd company with an occasional loan guarantee , it ca n't afford to rescue entire sectors .

dw 's karl zawadzky asks whether state support is really the way to go . the government in berlin responded to opel 's cry for help by saying it would study the plea - unlike hessen 's state premier roland koch , who immediately called for a " protective shield " in the form of comprehensive state support for germany 's entire automotive industry and government help totalling 500 million euros -lrb- $ 632 million -rrb- of the state budget .
the government 's more measured response is an eminently sensible one , since the german company owned by general motors is not actually at immediate risk of bankruptcy .
and if regional governments start bailing out individual companies facing insolvency - for whatever reasons - then who knows where that could lead ?
worst-case scenarios executives and union leaders at gm subsidiary opel turned to berlin and the regional governments in the states where opel has factories out of fear that parent company general motors might go bust and will no longer be able to pay back the loans it owes its german subsidiary .
but this would be a worst-case scenario - and an unlikely one , given that in the us , congress is currently working out the details of a $ 25 billion rescue package for america 's big three carmakers general motors , ford , and chrysler .
so there clearly is enough time to weigh the options , instead of acting rashly , and the options do need to be weighed .
for example , it makes no sense to use german taxpayers ' money given the risk that funding will simply end up in the pockets of the american parent company - especially since several years ago , general motors turned opel from a joint stock company into a limited liability company , not least in order to boost control of its subsidiary . after merkel held talks in berlin with carl-peter forster , ceo of general motors europe , hans demant , opel ceo and klaus franz , president of the works council , it became clear that berlin and the regional governments where opel 's factories are based do not intend to abandon the company .
but a bailout will come with strings attached .
and no one has any intention of introducing state support for the entire automotive industry .
many companies , after all , including daimler , bmw , vw and porsche , are currently doing very nicely indeed .
they are certainly not suffering from an acute lack of cash - although a lack of customers is a growing problem .
out of touch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky partly to blame is a product range that reflects neither the financial crisis nor environmental concerns . with their enormous gas guzzlers , state support would not be enough to pull these companies through a financial crisis .
they need more than bailouts , credit guarantees and stimulus packages .
the consumers simply do n't want these kinds of cars any more - not even in the us , traditionally home to low gas prices and a somewhat undeveloped environmental awareness .

17 , marking the occasion , neumann said the restitution was a sign of improving relations between the former wartime foes . " now that the last of the 117 windows from the marienkirche can finally return to their proper place it is a further sign of reconciliation and the friendship between our two countries , " he said . the panels had been removed from the marienkirche during the war to protect them from bombing .
they were stored in the basement of the potsdam neues palais , where they were seized by red army soldiers in 1945 .
the soviet union claimed them as war booty and shipped them back to russia . at the ceremony , kotenev also noted that nazi germany had been guilty of wanton looting during the war and stressed that the process of restoring property to its original owners must be reciprocal . " i would like to stress the word ' mutual ' because there are still harsh critics and the issue of looted art is often treated in the media as one in which it is the russians who owe a debt , " he said .
" it is often carelessly - or intentionally - forgotten that during the raids of the wehrmacht many russian museums were systematically plundered . " nonetheless , he hailed the return of the panels as " a milestone in a process begun fifty years ago . " " a homecoming is always a special experience , " said kotenev .
" especially when that homecoming follows a long absence . " war booty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the panels depict biblical stories such as noah 's ark in 1958 , some 1,5 million works of art were returned to east germany by the soviet union after the hague convention for the protection of cultural property made it illegal to use cultural property as war reparations . previously , moscow declared that art seized by the red army was retribution for the 27 million soviet lives lost during the second world war . however , disputes over art seized during and after the war continued to overshadow german-russian relations since the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 . recent years have seen some of the russian cultural treasures looted by the nazis returned to russia .
russian deputies passed a measure in 1997 declaring artwork seized from germany to be rightful spoils of war to compensate for the sacking of its own collections . but germany has refused to relinquish its claims .
experts say that there are still some 2.5 million objects missing from germany believed to be in the former soviet union . meanwhile in frankfurt , mayor martin patzelt announced that the missing panes in marienkirche 's stained glass windows will now undergo restoration and are expected to be returned to their original position by next year . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in these tough times , even the super-wealthy are n't protected against getting soaked . vw stocks went on a wild ride at the end of october , at one point breaking the 1000-euro -lrb- $ 1,264 -rrb- mark before plummeting back down to earth .
but adolf merckle and his family , who had bought options predicated on the idea of vw share prices falling , got run over .
now the family holding company is trouble .
" the -lsb- holding company -rsb- too has suffered under the extreme turbulence in the financial markets in the past few weeks , " merckle 's son ludwig confirmed to dpa press agency on tuesday , nov .
18 .
the family is reported to have lost as much as one billion euros as it was forced to buy up inflated vw shares .
adolf merckle 's personal wealth has been estimated at $ 9.2 billion .
adding to the family 's woes is the fact that the merkel group , a consortium that includes major cement and pharmaceuticals companies , is reported to be in debt to the tune of 16 billion euros .
now one of germany 's top billionaires is facing the unusual challenge of a personal cash crunch - and the state is not yet stepping in .
no deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : billionaire merckle is now trying to see about a loan adolf merckle met with the economics minister of the state of baden-wuerttemberg , ernst pfister , to discuss the financial troubles of the consortium , which employs some 100,000 people .
but if it was a loan he was after , he was disappointed .
" we are confident that the banks and the corporation will find a solution , " pfister told dpa after that meeting .
baden-wuerttemberg 's state premier guenther oettinger has said his government is monitoring the situation .
" we 'll be following this topic intensely but prudently , " oettinger said .
" the employees ca n't be left standing there like idiots for something that 's the fault of company directors . "
ludwig merckle said the company had discussed its need for capital with some 40 banks .
" various options are being examined in order to ensure that debts are reduced responsibly , " merckle told the daily suedwest-presse newspaper .
the plans could include selling off some of the merckle group 's prime subsidiaries - in a sign that not even the super-rich can avoid tightening their belts during the economic crisis . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

17 , that the eu members states should develop a common rescue package to help those car manufacturers stricken by the current economic crisis . " if we agree on a common direction forward , we will remain strong within europe and in our competition with other sectors in the world , " steinmeier , the social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- candidate for chancellor , said after meeting with the heads of germany 's largest auto manufacturers on monday . juncker , in an interview with germany 's bild newspaper , agreed . " i agree with the idea of a rescue plan for the automobile industry on a european level , " he said .
" if the us government is prepared to gives billions of dollars to save ford , general motors and chrysler before they fail , then we can not simply watch and abandon our manufacturers in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker sees no sense in individual rescue packages " it now makes little sense for germany , france or italy to try to protect their automobile industry individually .
that can only be done together , " juncker said . european commission chief jose manuel barroso said friday that the eu is ready to take action at the world trade organization if it judges that us aid for its struggling auto industry is " illegal . " the us congress approved an aid package worth $ 25 billion -lrb- 19.7 billion euros -rrb- in september to help the auto industry invest in new generation technology but no timetable was fixed for payments to be made . meanwhile , european automakers - who have cast an envious eye at the us plan and called for similar action at home - have been forced to close factories and cut jobs . protection needed to support healthy firms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier wants to protect firms from becoming affected " we must prevent healthy enterprises from becoming affected -lrb- by this crisis -rrb- , " steinmeier said .
" therefore , we must fight to keep the structures which made the automobile industry so strong in germany from disintegrating . " steinmeier 's statements came as the european investment bank -lrb- eib -rrb- , the eu 's lending arm , proposed to increase loans to europe 's ailing auto sector as part of a broader financing plan . " the eib will propose -lrb- to eu finance ministers -rrb- an increase of 20-30 percent , and that corresponds to 10 to 15 billion euros , " more money for both 2009 and 2010 - including help to small- and medium-sized businesses - a spokesman for the luxembourg-based bank told reporters . the eib has handed out an average of 2 billion euros in loans to the automobile sector in the past three years . french finance minister christine lagarde , whose country currently holds the eu rotating presidency , said monday that support for the sector was first of all a matter for the eib , which was working on the dossier . steinmeier : german banks should use bailout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin bailed-out the banks so other sectors could benefit steinmeier also urged the banking sector to provide more support for the car industry by being more generous in its granting of credit . " one of the biggest threats to the auto industry is the current shyness of the banks to take risks , " he said , adding that the financial package provided by the government for german banks was created for such purposes . however , peter bofinger , a member of the german council of economic experts , said the german government should consider putting the ailing manufacturer opel under state control with a view to attracting private investors to support it once the financial crisis has abated . bofinger claimed that the fears that the nationalization of opel could lead to calls for other companies to come under state protection was unfounded . " with a temporary nationalization , i see little danger that other companies would follow , " he said in an interview with the munich 's merkur newspaper .
" most german carmakers and suppliers would have no interest in being temporarily taken into state ownership . " german chancellor angela merkel spent most of monday locked in discussions with opel bosses but emerged from the lengthy negotiations without reaching a decision on potential state aid .
merkel told reporters that the issue would be debated again and that a decision would be made before christmas . economic experts suspicious of nationalization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel is still waiting for a green light for its state aid otto kentzler , the president of the german confederation of skilled crafts -lrb- zdh -rrb- supported the idea of temporarily nationalizing opel , as it would " support and protect many jobs , not only in the automobile industry but in the manufacturing sector and supply industry . " but mario ohoven , the president of the federal association of medium-size enterprises -lrb- bvmw -rrb- said he believes that smaller companies would suffer should the government support opel . " medium-size enterprises die quietly and unnoticed while large-scale enterprises are saved by the state , " he said , adding that merkel risked making a huge mistake by providing the automakers with a billion-euro emergency parachute as more companies would then demand the same . volker treier , chief economist for the german chamber of commerce and industry -lrb- dihk -rrb- , said nationalization should only be used when there are no other options . " government interference should only be necessary in a crisis as the last resort and then only if areas of the national economy are in danger without this nationalization , " he said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they say the proposed law 's aggressive online evidence-gathering measures are ill-conceived and open to abuse . less than a week after germany 's lower house of parliament approved new anti-terrorism legislation that would vastly expand the cyber-spying powers of the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- , two police trade unions and the german judicial federation demanded that amendments be made to the so-called federal bureau of criminal investigations bill . the bill , backed strongly by chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition government , was passed in the bundestag last week with 375 parliamentarians in favor and 168 against .
the plan , if approved by the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament , could go into effect in early 2009 . among the most contentious points in the bill are those addressing the expansion of surreptitious online search capabilities and an increase in the bka 's powers to access information from the computers , telephone conversations and homes of suspected terrorists . if enacted the plan would allow " remote forensic software " to search secretly through hard drives and send potentially incriminating evidence back to investigators .

the plan , if approved by the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament , could go into effect in early 2009 . among the most contentious points in the bill are those addressing the expansion of surreptitious online search capabilities and an increase in the bka 's powers to access information from the computers , telephone conversations and homes of suspected terrorists . if enacted the plan would allow " remote forensic software " to search secretly through hard drives and send potentially incriminating evidence back to investigators .

" it is obvious that the bka is not ready for the creation of these new online searches , " he said , according to the osnabrücker zeitung article . klaus jansen , the head of the federation of german criminal investigative officers , accused the ruling coalition of conservatives and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- of making " putrid political compromises " and bowing to the bka 's demands . he also criticized the measure which would allow the bka to undertake emergency online activities without immediate court approval if such approval is obtained within three days . state parliamentarians agree to reject law the police criticism comes after the spd party congress in the state of saxony agreed over the weekend to reject the proposed law when it comes before the bundesrat .

17 , marking the occasion , neumann said the restitution was a sign of improving relations between the former wartime foes . " now that the last of the 117 windows from the marienkirche can finally return to their proper place it is a further sign of reconciliation and the friendship between our two countries , " he said . the panels had been removed from the marienkirche during the war to protect them from bombing .
they were stored in the basement of the potsdam neues palais , where they were seized by red army soldiers in 1945 .
the soviet union claimed them as war booty and shipped them back to russia . at the ceremony , kotenev also noted that nazi germany had been guilty of wanton looting during the war and stressed that the process of restoring property to its original owners must be reciprocal . " i would like to stress the word ' mutual ' because there are still harsh critics and the issue of looted art is often treated in the media as one in which it is the russians who owe a debt , " he said .
" it is often carelessly - or intentionally - forgotten that during the raids of the wehrmacht many russian museums were systematically plundered . " nonetheless , he hailed the return of the panels as " a milestone in a process begun fifty years ago . " " a homecoming is always a special experience , " said kotenev .
" especially when that homecoming follows a long absence . " war booty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the panels depict biblical stories such as noah 's ark in 1958 , some 1,5 million works of art were returned to east germany by the soviet union after the hague convention for the protection of cultural property made it illegal to use cultural property as war reparations . previously , moscow declared that art seized by the red army was retribution for the 27 million soviet lives lost during the second world war . however , disputes over art seized during and after the war continued to overshadow german-russian relations since the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 . recent years have seen some of the russian cultural treasures looted by the nazis returned to russia .
russian deputies passed a measure in 1997 declaring artwork seized from germany to be rightful spoils of war to compensate for the sacking of its own collections . but germany has refused to relinquish its claims .
experts say that there are still some 2.5 million objects missing from germany believed to be in the former soviet union . meanwhile in frankfurt , mayor martin patzelt announced that the missing panes in marienkirche 's stained glass windows will now undergo restoration and are expected to be returned to their original position by next year . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it remains to be seen whether the case will ever come to trial . the decision announced by the un highest court in the hague on tuesday , sept .
18 , was a narrow one .
" the court ... by 10 votes to seven finds that ... the court has the jurisdiction to entertain the application by the republic of croatia , " said presiding judge rosalyn higgins .
croatian minister of justice ivan simonovic said he was very happy about the judgement .
" we won in round one , " simonovic told a croatian daily newspaper . " now we have round two and that is to prove genocide in croatia , " croatia lodged its complaint against serbia in 1999 .
zagreb said that serbian participation in the croatian war of 1991-1995 amounted to " a form of genocide which resulted in large numbers of croatian citizens being displaced , killed , tortured , or illegally detained as well as extensive property destruction . "
croatia has estimated that some 20,000 people lost their lives in the conflict .
belgrade had argued that the icj did not have jurisdiction over the complaint .
unsettling history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in october 2008 , former croatian-serb leader milan martic was convicted of war crimes zagreb 's accusations stem from the period immediately after the end of the cold war , which saw the disintegration of the serb-dominated federal republic of yugoslavia .
croatia declared independence from yugoslavia in 1991 .
ethnic serbs , who made up 12 percent of the population in croatia , staged an armed insurrection .
with belgrade 's backing , serbs briefly controlled around 30 percent of what is today croatia , declaring the region known as krajina an independent state .
the ethnic serbian forces were later defeated by the croatian national army with the help of western nations , chiefly the us .
hundreds of thousands of people were displaced during the course of the fighting before it finally ended for good in 1995 .
croatia is seeking punishment against serbians it considers responsible for the violence as well as monetary reparations and the return of croatian cultural treasures .
but it could take years for an actual case against serbia to come to trial , and even if proceedings are initiated , zagreb is unlikely to get everything it wants .
last year , in a similar case , the icj controversially cleared belgrade of any direct responsibility for the genocide of thousands of men and boys in the town of srebrenica in bosnia-hercegovina .
rehabilitation attempt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : capturing mladic could be a major step for serbia toward joining the eu in another event related to the balkans ' troubled history , the prosecutor of the un 's international tribunal for the former yugoslavia , david brammertz , held talks with serbian president boris tadic and other officials .
the focus was on whether belgrade was doing enough to hunt down serbs suspected of crimes against humanity , most notably former bosnian-serbian general ratko mladic , who is wanted on charges of genocide .
brammertz declined to give a public statement , but the serbian government said the talks had gone well .
" brammertz underlined the very good cooperation in the past few months with serbia 's institutions , " the cabinet of the serbian prime minister said in a statement .
serbian cooperation with international efforts to bring war criminals to justice is seen as key to belgrade 's bid to join the eu .
serbia hopes to begin the process of accession next year , but some member states like the netherlands want to see belgrade apprehend suspects like mladic before starting any official procedures . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they say the proposed law 's aggressive online evidence-gathering measures are ill-conceived and open to abuse . less than a week after germany 's lower house of parliament approved new anti-terrorism legislation that would vastly expand the cyber-spying powers of the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- , two police trade unions and the german judicial federation demanded that amendments be made to the so-called federal bureau of criminal investigations bill . the bill , backed strongly by chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition government , was passed in the bundestag last week with 375 parliamentarians in favor and 168 against .
the plan , if approved by the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament , could go into effect in early 2009 . among the most contentious points in the bill are those addressing the expansion of surreptitious online search capabilities and an increase in the bka 's powers to access information from the computers , telephone conversations and homes of suspected terrorists . if enacted the plan would allow " remote forensic software " to search secretly through hard drives and send potentially incriminating evidence back to investigators .
the measure does not , however , allow the police to enter a home in order to install monitoring equipment or software on a computer . unions : constitutional approval needed critics of the law say that it infringes upon privacy rights guaranteed by the constitution . the bka needs a nationally accepted law approved by the federal constitutional court before its measures could go into effect , rainer wendt , the chairman of the german police trade union -lrb- dpolg -rrb- , told the osnabrücker zeitung newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bka president joerg ziercke is a strong advocate of the law konrad freiberg , the chairman of the trade union of the police -lrb- gdp -rrb- , criticized the government for focusing on the " cheap solution " of online searches and failing to address more serious reforms necessary for the bka to fulfill its anti-terror mandate . " it is obvious that the bka is not ready for the creation of these new online searches , " he said , according to the osnabrücker zeitung article . klaus jansen , the head of the federation of german criminal investigative officers , accused the ruling coalition of conservatives and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- of making " putrid political compromises " and bowing to the bka 's demands . he also criticized the measure which would allow the bka to undertake emergency online activities without immediate court approval if such approval is obtained within three days . state parliamentarians agree to reject law the police criticism comes after the spd party congress in the state of saxony agreed over the weekend to reject the proposed law when it comes before the bundesrat .
the spd congress in neighboring saxony-anhalt also agreed to reject the law .
at least one of the states would have to change it position for the bill to be enacted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition to interior minister schaeuble 's plan is growing ralf stegner , the regional chairman of the spd parliamentary group in schleswig-holstein , demanded amendments to the plan before christmas .
the bill had originally been scheduled for vote at the end of november . however , with party rebellions gathering pace around the country and privacy rights advocates joining the police unions in condemning the law , the bill could first go before the federal constitutional court to be judged on its constitutional merits . german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble said he wants to discuss the measure 's necessity - as currently written - with his state interior ministers during a meeting on wednesday . opposition fears unconstitutional " super police " critics in opposition parties have come out against the creation of a " super police force " whose expanded powers , they say , would infringe on privacy and human rights . as well as the online measures , the bill allows the bka to bug , film or photograph the homes of suspected terrorists or places where they are staying .
the tapping of suspects ' telephones and cell phones as well as tracking the location of mobile phone calls would also be permissible . additionally , the bka would be able to perform data-mining searches as a preventative measure rather than as part of criminal proceedings following terrorist attacks .
in certain cases , such data-mining , which would require court approval , can also include the use of data seized from private institutions . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" now that the last of the 117 windows from the marienkirche can finally return to their proper place it is a further sign of reconciliation and the friendship between our two countries , " he said . the panels had been removed from the marienkirche during the war to protect them from bombing .
they were stored in the basement of the potsdam neues palais , where they were seized by red army soldiers in 1945 .
the soviet union claimed them as war booty and shipped them back to russia . at the ceremony , kotenev also noted that nazi germany had been guilty of wanton looting during the war and stressed that the process of restoring property to its original owners must be reciprocal . " i would like to stress the word ' mutual ' because there are still harsh critics and the issue of looted art is often treated in the media as one in which it is the russians who owe a debt , " he said .
" it is often carelessly - or intentionally - forgotten that during the raids of the wehrmacht many russian museums were systematically plundered .

" it is often carelessly - or intentionally - forgotten that during the raids of the wehrmacht many russian museums were systematically plundered . " nonetheless , he hailed the return of the panels as " a milestone in a process begun fifty years ago . " " a homecoming is always a special experience , " said kotenev .
" especially when that homecoming follows a long absence . " war booty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the panels depict biblical stories such as noah 's ark in 1958 , some 1,5 million works of art were returned to east germany by the soviet union after the hague convention for the protection of cultural property made it illegal to use cultural property as war reparations . previously , moscow declared that art seized by the red army was retribution for the 27 million soviet lives lost during the second world war . however , disputes over art seized during and after the war continued to overshadow german-russian relations since the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 . recent years have seen some of the russian cultural treasures looted by the nazis returned to russia .
russian deputies passed a measure in 1997 declaring artwork seized from germany to be rightful spoils of war to compensate for the sacking of its own collections . but germany has refused to relinquish its claims .
experts say that there are still some 2.5 million objects missing from germany believed to be in the former soviet union . meanwhile in frankfurt , mayor martin patzelt announced that the missing panes in marienkirche 's stained glass windows will now undergo restoration and are expected to be returned to their original position by next year . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he talked to dw-world about the g20 financial summit and the global economic crisis . dw-world.de : most economists have called the g20 summit a success .
what is your opinion on the summit as a ceo of a global company ? martin richenhagen : the most positive aspect of the summit for agco is that the political leaders first of all identified a problem and secondly started to harmonize and coordinate the action plan .
for a global company , it is very important that you have stable rules and conditions .
for me , it looks likely as that this will happen now . let 's talk briefly about the global financial crisis .
in the us , but also in europe , increasing numbers of companies are suffering , and its not just banks .
how is the agriculture industry affected by the financial meltdown and do you fear that the crisis will spread to more sectors of the economy ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agriculture is n't like most other businesses , according to richenhagen first of all , the farm business is following a slightly different logic .
the farm business is driven by the growing world population .
about 70 million people a year are added to the population .
second , the sector is driven by renewable fuels and third by changing diets in emerging markets like china and india .
therefore , agricultural demand is actually higher than supply and will be higher than supply for many years to come . as far as our company is concerned , we have managed things more carefully over the last few years and our debt-to-capital is down to zero .
we also expect a cash position of $ 600 million for the end of this year .
we work together with pretty good banks , and for many years we have had an agco finance bank helping customers with financing .
with that in mind , i think we are pretty well prepared for this crisis and we will not suffer too much from it . in the united states and in europe there is a heated debate whether the government should bail out giant companies like car manufacturers .
should the government rescue giant companies or let them go bust ? this is a difficult one .
the same managers who do n't normally ask for state or governmental support or partial support are all of a sudden starting to cry for help .
i personally believe companies that have not been managed well , like general motors , should go bankrupt .
their problem is that they have a very bloated organization , they are really not lean enough and this has been the case for at least 20 or 30 years .

he talked to dw-world about the g20 financial summit and the global economic crisis . dw-world.de : most economists have called the g20 summit a success .
what is your opinion on the summit as a ceo of a global company ? martin richenhagen : the most positive aspect of the summit for agco is that the political leaders first of all identified a problem and secondly started to harmonize and coordinate the action plan .
for a global company , it is very important that you have stable rules and conditions .
for me , it looks likely as that this will happen now . let 's talk briefly about the global financial crisis .
in the us , but also in europe , increasing numbers of companies are suffering , and its not just banks .
how is the agriculture industry affected by the financial meltdown and do you fear that the crisis will spread to more sectors of the economy ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agriculture is n't like most other businesses , according to richenhagen first of all , the farm business is following a slightly different logic .
the farm business is driven by the growing world population .
about 70 million people a year are added to the population .
second , the sector is driven by renewable fuels and third by changing diets in emerging markets like china and india .
therefore , agricultural demand is actually higher than supply and will be higher than supply for many years to come . as far as our company is concerned , we have managed things more carefully over the last few years and our debt-to-capital is down to zero .
we also expect a cash position of $ 600 million for the end of this year .
we work together with pretty good banks , and for many years we have had an agco finance bank helping customers with financing .
with that in mind , i think we are pretty well prepared for this crisis and we will not suffer too much from it . in the united states and in europe there is a heated debate whether the government should bail out giant companies like car manufacturers .
should the government rescue giant companies or let them go bust ? this is a difficult one .
the same managers who do n't normally ask for state or governmental support or partial support are all of a sudden starting to cry for help .
i personally believe companies that have not been managed well , like general motors , should go bankrupt .
their problem is that they have a very bloated organization , they are really not lean enough and this has been the case for at least 20 or 30 years .
they are just a weak management team and therefore the consequence is that they should go bankrupt . interview : michael knigge -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the family is reported to have lost as much as one billion euros as it was forced to buy up inflated vw shares .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 18.11.2008 brussels : eu states should let in workers from new members großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some eu countries are still hard to reach for workers from new member states eu governments should lift their restrictions on workers from the bloc 's newer member states , since they bring more gain than pain , employment commissioner vladimir spidla said tuesday . " workers from new -lrb- eu -rrb- member states have satisfied demand in receiving countries ... without creating any major disruption to unemployment or to the salaries of native workers , " spidla said . and since the free movement of people is " a fundamental right " , governments should " lift their restrictions as soon as possible , " the commissioner said . spidla made his comments while presenting a report showing that the eu 's recent enlargement has not , as some had feared , led to a massive influx of polish plumbers - a symbol of cheap labor - to the eu 's 15 oldest and richest members -lrb- eu-15 -rrb- . the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , poland , slovakia and slovenia , as well as cyprus and malta , all joined the eu in 2004 , while bulgaria and romania followed in 2007 . the commission 's latest estimates show that the share of nationals from the 10 countries that joined in 2004 and who have decided to relocate elsewhere in the eu has risen from 0.2 percent in 2003 to 0.5 percent in 2007 , with most of them heading to britain or ireland . the share of bulgarians and romanians now living in the eu-15 , meanwhile , has increased from 0.2 percent to 0.4 percent over the same period , with most heading for spain or italy . more benefits than problems such migrations have , on balance , brought more benefits than problems by satisfying demand and by meeting skill shortages in the receiving countries , spidla said . officials in brussels also noted that the arrival of workers from new member states tends to increase productivity and ease inflationary pressure , since these workers send part of their salaries back home rather than spending it in their new country of residence . and unlike many illegal immigrants arriving from asia , africa or latin america , eu workers tend to enjoy regular contracts and thus pay taxes . restrictions remain in place when the eu agreed to enlarge its borders , the eu executive in brussels sought to allay the concerns of many by granting " old " eu governments the ability to temporarily restrict the influx of workers from new member states . such restrictions must however be abolished entirely by 2011 for workers from the eight central and eastern european countries that joined in 2004 - and by 2013 for bulgarians and romanians . at the moment , only austria , belgium , denmark and germany maintain some restrictions on workers from the eight countries that joined in 2004 , while workers from bulgaria and romania still face barriers to entry in most eu-15 countries . germany should open up asked whether europe 's biggest employer - germany - should now lift its restrictions , spidla said the commission 's report " shows quite clearly that all countries that have opened up -lrb- their labor markets -rrb- have found it to be a good thing . " the commissioner also noted that since migrant workers tend to go where jobs are available , the current recession would not lead to a major increase in the influx of such workers . governments now have until the end of april to communicate to the commission whether they intend to extend their restrictions .
however , they can only do so if they can show that lifting them would lead to " serious disturbances " to their labor markets . polish migration poles meanwhile do make up the largest immigrant group in the european union , followed by romanians and moroccans , an eu report said tuesday . out of some 3 million immigrants that settled in the eu , some 290,000 were poles , said the eurostat statistics based on 2006 . some 2 million poles went to work in other eu countries since poland joined the european union in 2004 .
poles working abroad have contributed to the ex-communist nation 's prosperity , sending home more than $ 8 billion -lrb- 6.32 billion euros -rrb- in 2007 while helping to cut the jobless rate . about 40 percent of all eu immigrants were eu citizens migrating to another member state .
the remaining 60 percent were from european non-member states , asia , the united states and africa , the report said . spain , followed by germany and britain , saw the largest number of immigrants in 2006 .
luxembourg had the highest rate of immigrants with 28.8 per 1,000 inhabitants . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it remains to be seen whether the case will ever come to trial . the decision announced by the un highest court in the hague on tuesday , sept .
18 , was a narrow one .
" the court ... by 10 votes to seven finds that ... the court has the jurisdiction to entertain the application by the republic of croatia , " said presiding judge rosalyn higgins .
croatian minister of justice ivan simonovic said he was very happy about the judgement .
" we won in round one , " simonovic told a croatian daily newspaper . " now we have round two and that is to prove genocide in croatia , " croatia lodged its complaint against serbia in 1999 .
zagreb said that serbian participation in the croatian war of 1991-1995 amounted to " a form of genocide which resulted in large numbers of croatian citizens being displaced , killed , tortured , or illegally detained as well as extensive property destruction . "
croatia has estimated that some 20,000 people lost their lives in the conflict .
belgrade had argued that the icj did not have jurisdiction over the complaint .
unsettling history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in october 2008 , former croatian-serb leader milan martic was convicted of war crimes zagreb 's accusations stem from the period immediately after the end of the cold war , which saw the disintegration of the serb-dominated federal republic of yugoslavia .
croatia declared independence from yugoslavia in 1991 .
ethnic serbs , who made up 12 percent of the population in croatia , staged an armed insurrection .
with belgrade 's backing , serbs briefly controlled around 30 percent of what is today croatia , declaring the region known as krajina an independent state .
the ethnic serbian forces were later defeated by the croatian national army with the help of western nations , chiefly the us .
hundreds of thousands of people were displaced during the course of the fighting before it finally ended for good in 1995 .
croatia is seeking punishment against serbians it considers responsible for the violence as well as monetary reparations and the return of croatian cultural treasures .
but it could take years for an actual case against serbia to come to trial , and even if proceedings are initiated , zagreb is unlikely to get everything it wants .
last year , in a similar case , the icj controversially cleared belgrade of any direct responsibility for the genocide of thousands of men and boys in the town of srebrenica in bosnia-hercegovina .
rehabilitation attempt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : capturing mladic could be a major step for serbia toward joining the eu in another event related to the balkans ' troubled history , the prosecutor of the un 's international tribunal for the former yugoslavia , david brammertz , held talks with serbian president boris tadic and other officials .
the focus was on whether belgrade was doing enough to hunt down serbs suspected of crimes against humanity , most notably former bosnian-serbian general ratko mladic , who is wanted on charges of genocide .
brammertz declined to give a public statement , but the serbian government said the talks had gone well .
" brammertz underlined the very good cooperation in the past few months with serbia 's institutions , " the cabinet of the serbian prime minister said in a statement .
serbian cooperation with international efforts to bring war criminals to justice is seen as key to belgrade 's bid to join the eu .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 18.11.2008 opinion : bailouts fine in moderation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government is set to decide whether to grant ailing german carmaker opel 1 billion euros in credit guarantees .
dw 's karl zawadzky asks whether state support is really the way to go . the government in berlin responded to opel 's cry for help by saying it would study the plea - unlike hessen 's state premier roland koch , who immediately called for a " protective shield " in the form of comprehensive state support for germany 's entire automotive industry and government help totalling 500 million euros -lrb- $ 632 million -rrb- of the state budget .
the government 's more measured response is an eminently sensible one , since the german company owned by general motors is not actually at immediate risk of bankruptcy .
and if regional governments start bailing out individual companies facing insolvency - for whatever reasons - then who knows where that could lead ?
worst-case scenarios executives and union leaders at gm subsidiary opel turned to berlin and the regional governments in the states where opel has factories out of fear that parent company general motors might go bust and will no longer be able to pay back the loans it owes its german subsidiary .
but this would be a worst-case scenario - and an unlikely one , given that in the us , congress is currently working out the details of a $ 25 billion rescue package for america 's big three carmakers general motors , ford , and chrysler .
so there clearly is enough time to weigh the options , instead of acting rashly , and the options do need to be weighed .
for example , it makes no sense to use german taxpayers ' money given the risk that funding will simply end up in the pockets of the american parent company - especially since several years ago , general motors turned opel from a joint stock company into a limited liability company , not least in order to boost control of its subsidiary . after merkel held talks in berlin with carl-peter forster , ceo of general motors europe , hans demant , opel ceo and klaus franz , president of the works council , it became clear that berlin and the regional governments where opel 's factories are based do not intend to abandon the company .
but a bailout will come with strings attached .
and no one has any intention of introducing state support for the entire automotive industry .
many companies , after all , including daimler , bmw , vw and porsche , are currently doing very nicely indeed .
they are certainly not suffering from an acute lack of cash - although a lack of customers is a growing problem .
out of touch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky partly to blame is a product range that reflects neither the financial crisis nor environmental concerns . with their enormous gas guzzlers , state support would not be enough to pull these companies through a financial crisis .
they need more than bailouts , credit guarantees and stimulus packages .
the consumers simply do n't want these kinds of cars any more - not even in the us , traditionally home to low gas prices and a somewhat undeveloped environmental awareness .
the carmakers need to wake up and smell the coffee . developing new models that reflect changing consumer habits requires time and effort - and possibly even leads to closures and job cuts .
a number of suppliers have already bitten the dust , and if its parent company goes bankrupt , then heads will also roll at opel .
nonetheless , over-impulsive , sweeping aid packages make no sense .
a credit guarantee should be offered on a case-by-case basis , and only after much deliberation .
not only is it a use of taxpayers ' money , it is also a move that gives the company at stake an unfair competitive advantage .
a state aid package is a more favorable financing solution than those available to other companies .
were even financially stable companies which could actually weather the financial crisis under their own steam to start considering this an option , they would all want credit guarantees .
the government needs to avoid companies enjoying what is known as windfall gains - and it also needs to avoid its support ending up in the wrong place .
when it comes to internal funds , after all , multinationals in particular tend to be very " flexible . "
just one cog in the wheel the automotive industry is important , but its role in the economy is not nearly as important as that of the banks .
even so , the state will do what it can to extend lifelines to carmakers facing the abyss .
too many jobs are at stake .
in germany , opel employs 25,000 people , its suppliers another 50,000 .
for the time being , opel 's future appears safe .
but everything depends on general motors .
the government in berlin by all means needs to address the crisis in the automotive industry - and especially opel 's case .
but other economic sectors are also hard hit by the troubled economy .
and while the government might be able to help out the odd company with an occasional loan guarantee , it ca n't afford to rescue entire sectors .

" workers from new -lrb- eu -rrb- member states have satisfied demand in receiving countries ... without creating any major disruption to unemployment or to the salaries of native workers , " spidla said . and since the free movement of people is " a fundamental right " , governments should " lift their restrictions as soon as possible , " the commissioner said . spidla made his comments while presenting a report showing that the eu 's recent enlargement has not , as some had feared , led to a massive influx of polish plumbers - a symbol of cheap labor - to the eu 's 15 oldest and richest members -lrb- eu-15 -rrb- . the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , poland , slovakia and slovenia , as well as cyprus and malta , all joined the eu in 2004 , while bulgaria and romania followed in 2007 . the commission 's latest estimates show that the share of nationals from the 10 countries that joined in 2004 and who have decided to relocate elsewhere in the eu has risen from 0.2 percent in 2003 to 0.5 percent in 2007 , with most of them heading to britain or ireland . the share of bulgarians and romanians now living in the eu-15 , meanwhile , has increased from 0.2 percent to 0.4 percent over the same period , with most heading for spain or italy . more benefits than problems such migrations have , on balance , brought more benefits than problems by satisfying demand and by meeting skill shortages in the receiving countries , spidla said . officials in brussels also noted that the arrival of workers from new member states tends to increase productivity and ease inflationary pressure , since these workers send part of their salaries back home rather than spending it in their new country of residence . and unlike many illegal immigrants arriving from asia , africa or latin america , eu workers tend to enjoy regular contracts and thus pay taxes . restrictions remain in place when the eu agreed to enlarge its borders , the eu executive in brussels sought to allay the concerns of many by granting " old " eu governments the ability to temporarily restrict the influx of workers from new member states . such restrictions must however be abolished entirely by 2011 for workers from the eight central and eastern european countries that joined in 2004 - and by 2013 for bulgarians and romanians . at the moment , only austria , belgium , denmark and germany maintain some restrictions on workers from the eight countries that joined in 2004 , while workers from bulgaria and romania still face barriers to entry in most eu-15 countries . germany should open up asked whether europe 's biggest employer - germany - should now lift its restrictions , spidla said the commission 's report " shows quite clearly that all countries that have opened up -lrb- their labor markets -rrb- have found it to be a good thing . " the commissioner also noted that since migrant workers tend to go where jobs are available , the current recession would not lead to a major increase in the influx of such workers . governments now have until the end of april to communicate to the commission whether they intend to extend their restrictions .
however , they can only do so if they can show that lifting them would lead to " serious disturbances " to their labor markets . polish migration poles meanwhile do make up the largest immigrant group in the european union , followed by romanians and moroccans , an eu report said tuesday . out of some 3 million immigrants that settled in the eu , some 290,000 were poles , said the eurostat statistics based on 2006 . some 2 million poles went to work in other eu countries since poland joined the european union in 2004 .

" workers from new -lrb- eu -rrb- member states have satisfied demand in receiving countries ... without creating any major disruption to unemployment or to the salaries of native workers , " spidla said . and since the free movement of people is " a fundamental right " , governments should " lift their restrictions as soon as possible , " the commissioner said . spidla made his comments while presenting a report showing that the eu 's recent enlargement has not , as some had feared , led to a massive influx of polish plumbers - a symbol of cheap labor - to the eu 's 15 oldest and richest members -lrb- eu-15 -rrb- . the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , poland , slovakia and slovenia , as well as cyprus and malta , all joined the eu in 2004 , while bulgaria and romania followed in 2007 . the commission 's latest estimates show that the share of nationals from the 10 countries that joined in 2004 and who have decided to relocate elsewhere in the eu has risen from 0.2 percent in 2003 to 0.5 percent in 2007 , with most of them heading to britain or ireland . the share of bulgarians and romanians now living in the eu-15 , meanwhile , has increased from 0.2 percent to 0.4 percent over the same period , with most heading for spain or italy . more benefits than problems such migrations have , on balance , brought more benefits than problems by satisfying demand and by meeting skill shortages in the receiving countries , spidla said . officials in brussels also noted that the arrival of workers from new member states tends to increase productivity and ease inflationary pressure , since these workers send part of their salaries back home rather than spending it in their new country of residence . and unlike many illegal immigrants arriving from asia , africa or latin america , eu workers tend to enjoy regular contracts and thus pay taxes . restrictions remain in place when the eu agreed to enlarge its borders , the eu executive in brussels sought to allay the concerns of many by granting " old " eu governments the ability to temporarily restrict the influx of workers from new member states . such restrictions must however be abolished entirely by 2011 for workers from the eight central and eastern european countries that joined in 2004 - and by 2013 for bulgarians and romanians . at the moment , only austria , belgium , denmark and germany maintain some restrictions on workers from the eight countries that joined in 2004 , while workers from bulgaria and romania still face barriers to entry in most eu-15 countries . germany should open up asked whether europe 's biggest employer - germany - should now lift its restrictions , spidla said the commission 's report " shows quite clearly that all countries that have opened up -lrb- their labor markets -rrb- have found it to be a good thing . " the commissioner also noted that since migrant workers tend to go where jobs are available , the current recession would not lead to a major increase in the influx of such workers . governments now have until the end of april to communicate to the commission whether they intend to extend their restrictions .
however , they can only do so if they can show that lifting them would lead to " serious disturbances " to their labor markets . polish migration poles meanwhile do make up the largest immigrant group in the european union , followed by romanians and moroccans , an eu report said tuesday . out of some 3 million immigrants that settled in the eu , some 290,000 were poles , said the eurostat statistics based on 2006 . some 2 million poles went to work in other eu countries since poland joined the european union in 2004 .
poles working abroad have contributed to the ex-communist nation 's prosperity , sending home more than $ 8 billion -lrb- 6.32 billion euros -rrb- in 2007 while helping to cut the jobless rate . about 40 percent of all eu immigrants were eu citizens migrating to another member state .
the remaining 60 percent were from european non-member states , asia , the united states and africa , the report said . spain , followed by germany and britain , saw the largest number of immigrants in 2006 .
luxembourg had the highest rate of immigrants with 28.8 per 1,000 inhabitants . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

17 , that the eu members states should develop a common rescue package to help those car manufacturers stricken by the current economic crisis . " if we agree on a common direction forward , we will remain strong within europe and in our competition with other sectors in the world , " steinmeier , the social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- candidate for chancellor , said after meeting with the heads of germany 's largest auto manufacturers on monday . juncker , in an interview with germany 's bild newspaper , agreed . " i agree with the idea of a rescue plan for the automobile industry on a european level , " he said .
" if the us government is prepared to gives billions of dollars to save ford , general motors and chrysler before they fail , then we can not simply watch and abandon our manufacturers in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker sees no sense in individual rescue packages " it now makes little sense for germany , france or italy to try to protect their automobile industry individually .
that can only be done together , " juncker said . european commission chief jose manuel barroso said friday that the eu is ready to take action at the world trade organization if it judges that us aid for its struggling auto industry is " illegal . " the us congress approved an aid package worth $ 25 billion -lrb- 19.7 billion euros -rrb- in september to help the auto industry invest in new generation technology but no timetable was fixed for payments to be made . meanwhile , european automakers - who have cast an envious eye at the us plan and called for similar action at home - have been forced to close factories and cut jobs . protection needed to support healthy firms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier wants to protect firms from becoming affected " we must prevent healthy enterprises from becoming affected -lrb- by this crisis -rrb- , " steinmeier said .
" therefore , we must fight to keep the structures which made the automobile industry so strong in germany from disintegrating . " steinmeier 's statements came as the european investment bank -lrb- eib -rrb- , the eu 's lending arm , proposed to increase loans to europe 's ailing auto sector as part of a broader financing plan . " the eib will propose -lrb- to eu finance ministers -rrb- an increase of 20-30 percent , and that corresponds to 10 to 15 billion euros , " more money for both 2009 and 2010 - including help to small- and medium-sized businesses - a spokesman for the luxembourg-based bank told reporters . the eib has handed out an average of 2 billion euros in loans to the automobile sector in the past three years . french finance minister christine lagarde , whose country currently holds the eu rotating presidency , said monday that support for the sector was first of all a matter for the eib , which was working on the dossier . steinmeier : german banks should use bailout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin bailed-out the banks so other sectors could benefit steinmeier also urged the banking sector to provide more support for the car industry by being more generous in its granting of credit . " one of the biggest threats to the auto industry is the current shyness of the banks to take risks , " he said , adding that the financial package provided by the government for german banks was created for such purposes . however , peter bofinger , a member of the german council of economic experts , said the german government should consider putting the ailing manufacturer opel under state control with a view to attracting private investors to support it once the financial crisis has abated . bofinger claimed that the fears that the nationalization of opel could lead to calls for other companies to come under state protection was unfounded . " with a temporary nationalization , i see little danger that other companies would follow , " he said in an interview with the munich 's merkur newspaper .
" most german carmakers and suppliers would have no interest in being temporarily taken into state ownership . " german chancellor angela merkel spent most of monday locked in discussions with opel bosses but emerged from the lengthy negotiations without reaching a decision on potential state aid .
merkel told reporters that the issue would be debated again and that a decision would be made before christmas . economic experts suspicious of nationalization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel is still waiting for a green light for its state aid otto kentzler , the president of the german confederation of skilled crafts -lrb- zdh -rrb- supported the idea of temporarily nationalizing opel , as it would " support and protect many jobs , not only in the automobile industry but in the manufacturing sector and supply industry .

17 , that the eu members states should develop a common rescue package to help those car manufacturers stricken by the current economic crisis . " if we agree on a common direction forward , we will remain strong within europe and in our competition with other sectors in the world , " steinmeier , the social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- candidate for chancellor , said after meeting with the heads of germany 's largest auto manufacturers on monday . juncker , in an interview with germany 's bild newspaper , agreed . " i agree with the idea of a rescue plan for the automobile industry on a european level , " he said .
" if the us government is prepared to gives billions of dollars to save ford , general motors and chrysler before they fail , then we can not simply watch and abandon our manufacturers in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker sees no sense in individual rescue packages " it now makes little sense for germany , france or italy to try to protect their automobile industry individually .
that can only be done together , " juncker said . european commission chief jose manuel barroso said friday that the eu is ready to take action at the world trade organization if it judges that us aid for its struggling auto industry is " illegal . " the us congress approved an aid package worth $ 25 billion -lrb- 19.7 billion euros -rrb- in september to help the auto industry invest in new generation technology but no timetable was fixed for payments to be made . meanwhile , european automakers - who have cast an envious eye at the us plan and called for similar action at home - have been forced to close factories and cut jobs . protection needed to support healthy firms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier wants to protect firms from becoming affected " we must prevent healthy enterprises from becoming affected -lrb- by this crisis -rrb- , " steinmeier said .
" therefore , we must fight to keep the structures which made the automobile industry so strong in germany from disintegrating .

but it remains to be seen whether the case will ever come to trial . the decision announced by the un highest court in the hague on tuesday , sept .
18 , was a narrow one .
" the court ... by 10 votes to seven finds that ... the court has the jurisdiction to entertain the application by the republic of croatia , " said presiding judge rosalyn higgins .
croatian minister of justice ivan simonovic said he was very happy about the judgement .
" we won in round one , " simonovic told a croatian daily newspaper . " now we have round two and that is to prove genocide in croatia , " croatia lodged its complaint against serbia in 1999 .
zagreb said that serbian participation in the croatian war of 1991-1995 amounted to " a form of genocide which resulted in large numbers of croatian citizens being displaced , killed , tortured , or illegally detained as well as extensive property destruction . "
croatia has estimated that some 20,000 people lost their lives in the conflict .
belgrade had argued that the icj did not have jurisdiction over the complaint .
unsettling history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in october 2008 , former croatian-serb leader milan martic was convicted of war crimes zagreb 's accusations stem from the period immediately after the end of the cold war , which saw the disintegration of the serb-dominated federal republic of yugoslavia .
croatia declared independence from yugoslavia in 1991 .
ethnic serbs , who made up 12 percent of the population in croatia , staged an armed insurrection .
with belgrade 's backing , serbs briefly controlled around 30 percent of what is today croatia , declaring the region known as krajina an independent state .
the ethnic serbian forces were later defeated by the croatian national army with the help of western nations , chiefly the us .
hundreds of thousands of people were displaced during the course of the fighting before it finally ended for good in 1995 .
croatia is seeking punishment against serbians it considers responsible for the violence as well as monetary reparations and the return of croatian cultural treasures .
but it could take years for an actual case against serbia to come to trial , and even if proceedings are initiated , zagreb is unlikely to get everything it wants .
last year , in a similar case , the icj controversially cleared belgrade of any direct responsibility for the genocide of thousands of men and boys in the town of srebrenica in bosnia-hercegovina .
rehabilitation attempt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : capturing mladic could be a major step for serbia toward joining the eu in another event related to the balkans ' troubled history , the prosecutor of the un 's international tribunal for the former yugoslavia , david brammertz , held talks with serbian president boris tadic and other officials .
the focus was on whether belgrade was doing enough to hunt down serbs suspected of crimes against humanity , most notably former bosnian-serbian general ratko mladic , who is wanted on charges of genocide .
brammertz declined to give a public statement , but the serbian government said the talks had gone well .
" brammertz underlined the very good cooperation in the past few months with serbia 's institutions , " the cabinet of the serbian prime minister said in a statement .
serbian cooperation with international efforts to bring war criminals to justice is seen as key to belgrade 's bid to join the eu .
serbia hopes to begin the process of accession next year , but some member states like the netherlands want to see belgrade apprehend suspects like mladic before starting any official procedures . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 18.11.2008 brussels : eu states should let in workers from new members großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some eu countries are still hard to reach for workers from new member states eu governments should lift their restrictions on workers from the bloc 's newer member states , since they bring more gain than pain , employment commissioner vladimir spidla said tuesday . " workers from new -lrb- eu -rrb- member states have satisfied demand in receiving countries ... without creating any major disruption to unemployment or to the salaries of native workers , " spidla said . and since the free movement of people is " a fundamental right " , governments should " lift their restrictions as soon as possible , " the commissioner said . spidla made his comments while presenting a report showing that the eu 's recent enlargement has not , as some had feared , led to a massive influx of polish plumbers - a symbol of cheap labor - to the eu 's 15 oldest and richest members -lrb- eu-15 -rrb- . the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , poland , slovakia and slovenia , as well as cyprus and malta , all joined the eu in 2004 , while bulgaria and romania followed in 2007 . the commission 's latest estimates show that the share of nationals from the 10 countries that joined in 2004 and who have decided to relocate elsewhere in the eu has risen from 0.2 percent in 2003 to 0.5 percent in 2007 , with most of them heading to britain or ireland . the share of bulgarians and romanians now living in the eu-15 , meanwhile , has increased from 0.2 percent to 0.4 percent over the same period , with most heading for spain or italy . more benefits than problems such migrations have , on balance , brought more benefits than problems by satisfying demand and by meeting skill shortages in the receiving countries , spidla said . officials in brussels also noted that the arrival of workers from new member states tends to increase productivity and ease inflationary pressure , since these workers send part of their salaries back home rather than spending it in their new country of residence . and unlike many illegal immigrants arriving from asia , africa or latin america , eu workers tend to enjoy regular contracts and thus pay taxes . restrictions remain in place when the eu agreed to enlarge its borders , the eu executive in brussels sought to allay the concerns of many by granting " old " eu governments the ability to temporarily restrict the influx of workers from new member states . such restrictions must however be abolished entirely by 2011 for workers from the eight central and eastern european countries that joined in 2004 - and by 2013 for bulgarians and romanians . at the moment , only austria , belgium , denmark and germany maintain some restrictions on workers from the eight countries that joined in 2004 , while workers from bulgaria and romania still face barriers to entry in most eu-15 countries . germany should open up asked whether europe 's biggest employer - germany - should now lift its restrictions , spidla said the commission 's report " shows quite clearly that all countries that have opened up -lrb- their labor markets -rrb- have found it to be a good thing . " the commissioner also noted that since migrant workers tend to go where jobs are available , the current recession would not lead to a major increase in the influx of such workers . governments now have until the end of april to communicate to the commission whether they intend to extend their restrictions .
however , they can only do so if they can show that lifting them would lead to " serious disturbances " to their labor markets . polish migration poles meanwhile do make up the largest immigrant group in the european union , followed by romanians and moroccans , an eu report said tuesday . out of some 3 million immigrants that settled in the eu , some 290,000 were poles , said the eurostat statistics based on 2006 . some 2 million poles went to work in other eu countries since poland joined the european union in 2004 .
poles working abroad have contributed to the ex-communist nation 's prosperity , sending home more than $ 8 billion -lrb- 6.32 billion euros -rrb- in 2007 while helping to cut the jobless rate . about 40 percent of all eu immigrants were eu citizens migrating to another member state .
the remaining 60 percent were from european non-member states , asia , the united states and africa , the report said . spain , followed by germany and britain , saw the largest number of immigrants in 2006 .
luxembourg had the highest rate of immigrants with 28.8 per 1,000 inhabitants . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it remains to be seen whether the case will ever come to trial . the decision announced by the un highest court in the hague on tuesday , sept .
18 , was a narrow one .
" the court ... by 10 votes to seven finds that ... the court has the jurisdiction to entertain the application by the republic of croatia , " said presiding judge rosalyn higgins .
croatian minister of justice ivan simonovic said he was very happy about the judgement .
" we won in round one , " simonovic told a croatian daily newspaper . " now we have round two and that is to prove genocide in croatia , " croatia lodged its complaint against serbia in 1999 .
zagreb said that serbian participation in the croatian war of 1991-1995 amounted to " a form of genocide which resulted in large numbers of croatian citizens being displaced , killed , tortured , or illegally detained as well as extensive property destruction . "
croatia has estimated that some 20,000 people lost their lives in the conflict .
belgrade had argued that the icj did not have jurisdiction over the complaint .
unsettling history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in october 2008 , former croatian-serb leader milan martic was convicted of war crimes zagreb 's accusations stem from the period immediately after the end of the cold war , which saw the disintegration of the serb-dominated federal republic of yugoslavia .
croatia declared independence from yugoslavia in 1991 .
ethnic serbs , who made up 12 percent of the population in croatia , staged an armed insurrection .
with belgrade 's backing , serbs briefly controlled around 30 percent of what is today croatia , declaring the region known as krajina an independent state .
the ethnic serbian forces were later defeated by the croatian national army with the help of western nations , chiefly the us .
hundreds of thousands of people were displaced during the course of the fighting before it finally ended for good in 1995 .
croatia is seeking punishment against serbians it considers responsible for the violence as well as monetary reparations and the return of croatian cultural treasures .
but it could take years for an actual case against serbia to come to trial , and even if proceedings are initiated , zagreb is unlikely to get everything it wants .
last year , in a similar case , the icj controversially cleared belgrade of any direct responsibility for the genocide of thousands of men and boys in the town of srebrenica in bosnia-hercegovina .
rehabilitation attempt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : capturing mladic could be a major step for serbia toward joining the eu in another event related to the balkans ' troubled history , the prosecutor of the un 's international tribunal for the former yugoslavia , david brammertz , held talks with serbian president boris tadic and other officials .
the focus was on whether belgrade was doing enough to hunt down serbs suspected of crimes against humanity , most notably former bosnian-serbian general ratko mladic , who is wanted on charges of genocide .
brammertz declined to give a public statement , but the serbian government said the talks had gone well .
" brammertz underlined the very good cooperation in the past few months with serbia 's institutions , " the cabinet of the serbian prime minister said in a statement .
serbian cooperation with international efforts to bring war criminals to justice is seen as key to belgrade 's bid to join the eu .
serbia hopes to begin the process of accession next year , but some member states like the netherlands want to see belgrade apprehend suspects like mladic before starting any official procedures . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he talked to dw-world about the g20 financial summit and the global economic crisis . dw-world.de : most economists have called the g20 summit a success .
what is your opinion on the summit as a ceo of a global company ? martin richenhagen : the most positive aspect of the summit for agco is that the political leaders first of all identified a problem and secondly started to harmonize and coordinate the action plan .
for a global company , it is very important that you have stable rules and conditions .
for me , it looks likely as that this will happen now . let 's talk briefly about the global financial crisis .
in the us , but also in europe , increasing numbers of companies are suffering , and its not just banks .
how is the agriculture industry affected by the financial meltdown and do you fear that the crisis will spread to more sectors of the economy ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agriculture is n't like most other businesses , according to richenhagen first of all , the farm business is following a slightly different logic .
the farm business is driven by the growing world population .
about 70 million people a year are added to the population .
second , the sector is driven by renewable fuels and third by changing diets in emerging markets like china and india .
therefore , agricultural demand is actually higher than supply and will be higher than supply for many years to come . as far as our company is concerned , we have managed things more carefully over the last few years and our debt-to-capital is down to zero .
we also expect a cash position of $ 600 million for the end of this year .
we work together with pretty good banks , and for many years we have had an agco finance bank helping customers with financing .
with that in mind , i think we are pretty well prepared for this crisis and we will not suffer too much from it . in the united states and in europe there is a heated debate whether the government should bail out giant companies like car manufacturers .
should the government rescue giant companies or let them go bust ? this is a difficult one .
the same managers who do n't normally ask for state or governmental support or partial support are all of a sudden starting to cry for help .
i personally believe companies that have not been managed well , like general motors , should go bankrupt .
their problem is that they have a very bloated organization , they are really not lean enough and this has been the case for at least 20 or 30 years .
they are just a weak management team and therefore the consequence is that they should go bankrupt . interview : michael knigge -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but adolf merckle and his family , who had bought options predicated on the idea of vw share prices falling , got run over .
now the family holding company is trouble .
" the -lsb- holding company -rsb- too has suffered under the extreme turbulence in the financial markets in the past few weeks , " merckle 's son ludwig confirmed to dpa press agency on tuesday , nov .

the family is reported to have lost as much as one billion euros as it was forced to buy up inflated vw shares .
adolf merckle 's personal wealth has been estimated at $ 9.2 billion .
adding to the family 's woes is the fact that the merkel group , a consortium that includes major cement and pharmaceuticals companies , is reported to be in debt to the tune of 16 billion euros .
now one of germany 's top billionaires is facing the unusual challenge of a personal cash crunch - and the state is not yet stepping in .

but if it was a loan he was after , he was disappointed .
" we are confident that the banks and the corporation will find a solution , " pfister told dpa after that meeting .
baden-wuerttemberg 's state premier guenther oettinger has said his government is monitoring the situation .
" we 'll be following this topic intensely but prudently , " oettinger said .
" the employees ca n't be left standing there like idiots for something that 's the fault of company directors . "
ludwig merckle said the company had discussed its need for capital with some 40 banks .
" various options are being examined in order to ensure that debts are reduced responsibly , " merckle told the daily suedwest-presse newspaper .
the plans could include selling off some of the merckle group 's prime subsidiaries - in a sign that not even the super-rich can avoid tightening their belts during the economic crisis . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they say the proposed law 's aggressive online evidence-gathering measures are ill-conceived and open to abuse . less than a week after germany 's lower house of parliament approved new anti-terrorism legislation that would vastly expand the cyber-spying powers of the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- , two police trade unions and the german judicial federation demanded that amendments be made to the so-called federal bureau of criminal investigations bill . the bill , backed strongly by chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition government , was passed in the bundestag last week with 375 parliamentarians in favor and 168 against .
the plan , if approved by the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament , could go into effect in early 2009 . among the most contentious points in the bill are those addressing the expansion of surreptitious online search capabilities and an increase in the bka 's powers to access information from the computers , telephone conversations and homes of suspected terrorists . if enacted the plan would allow " remote forensic software " to search secretly through hard drives and send potentially incriminating evidence back to investigators .
the measure does not , however , allow the police to enter a home in order to install monitoring equipment or software on a computer . unions : constitutional approval needed critics of the law say that it infringes upon privacy rights guaranteed by the constitution . the bka needs a nationally accepted law approved by the federal constitutional court before its measures could go into effect , rainer wendt , the chairman of the german police trade union -lrb- dpolg -rrb- , told the osnabrücker zeitung newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bka president joerg ziercke is a strong advocate of the law konrad freiberg , the chairman of the trade union of the police -lrb- gdp -rrb- , criticized the government for focusing on the " cheap solution " of online searches and failing to address more serious reforms necessary for the bka to fulfill its anti-terror mandate . " it is obvious that the bka is not ready for the creation of these new online searches , " he said , according to the osnabrücker zeitung article . klaus jansen , the head of the federation of german criminal investigative officers , accused the ruling coalition of conservatives and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- of making " putrid political compromises " and bowing to the bka 's demands . he also criticized the measure which would allow the bka to undertake emergency online activities without immediate court approval if such approval is obtained within three days . state parliamentarians agree to reject law the police criticism comes after the spd party congress in the state of saxony agreed over the weekend to reject the proposed law when it comes before the bundesrat .
the spd congress in neighboring saxony-anhalt also agreed to reject the law .
at least one of the states would have to change it position for the bill to be enacted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition to interior minister schaeuble 's plan is growing ralf stegner , the regional chairman of the spd parliamentary group in schleswig-holstein , demanded amendments to the plan before christmas .

in these tough times , even the super-wealthy are n't protected against getting soaked . vw stocks went on a wild ride at the end of october , at one point breaking the 1000-euro -lrb- $ 1,264 -rrb- mark before plummeting back down to earth .
but adolf merckle and his family , who had bought options predicated on the idea of vw share prices falling , got run over .
now the family holding company is trouble .
" the -lsb- holding company -rsb- too has suffered under the extreme turbulence in the financial markets in the past few weeks , " merckle 's son ludwig confirmed to dpa press agency on tuesday , nov .

the family is reported to have lost as much as one billion euros as it was forced to buy up inflated vw shares .
adolf merckle 's personal wealth has been estimated at $ 9.2 billion .
adding to the family 's woes is the fact that the merkel group , a consortium that includes major cement and pharmaceuticals companies , is reported to be in debt to the tune of 16 billion euros .
now one of germany 's top billionaires is facing the unusual challenge of a personal cash crunch - and the state is not yet stepping in .

but if it was a loan he was after , he was disappointed .
" we are confident that the banks and the corporation will find a solution , " pfister told dpa after that meeting .
baden-wuerttemberg 's state premier guenther oettinger has said his government is monitoring the situation .
" we 'll be following this topic intensely but prudently , " oettinger said .
" the employees ca n't be left standing there like idiots for something that 's the fault of company directors . "
ludwig merckle said the company had discussed its need for capital with some 40 banks .
" various options are being examined in order to ensure that debts are reduced responsibly , " merckle told the daily suedwest-presse newspaper .

he talked to dw-world about the g20 financial summit and the global economic crisis . dw-world.de : most economists have called the g20 summit a success .
what is your opinion on the summit as a ceo of a global company ? martin richenhagen : the most positive aspect of the summit for agco is that the political leaders first of all identified a problem and secondly started to harmonize and coordinate the action plan .
for a global company , it is very important that you have stable rules and conditions .
for me , it looks likely as that this will happen now . let 's talk briefly about the global financial crisis .
in the us , but also in europe , increasing numbers of companies are suffering , and its not just banks .
how is the agriculture industry affected by the financial meltdown and do you fear that the crisis will spread to more sectors of the economy ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agriculture is n't like most other businesses , according to richenhagen first of all , the farm business is following a slightly different logic .
the farm business is driven by the growing world population .
about 70 million people a year are added to the population .
second , the sector is driven by renewable fuels and third by changing diets in emerging markets like china and india .
therefore , agricultural demand is actually higher than supply and will be higher than supply for many years to come . as far as our company is concerned , we have managed things more carefully over the last few years and our debt-to-capital is down to zero .
we also expect a cash position of $ 600 million for the end of this year .
we work together with pretty good banks , and for many years we have had an agco finance bank helping customers with financing .
with that in mind , i think we are pretty well prepared for this crisis and we will not suffer too much from it . in the united states and in europe there is a heated debate whether the government should bail out giant companies like car manufacturers .
should the government rescue giant companies or let them go bust ? this is a difficult one .
the same managers who do n't normally ask for state or governmental support or partial support are all of a sudden starting to cry for help .
i personally believe companies that have not been managed well , like general motors , should go bankrupt .
their problem is that they have a very bloated organization , they are really not lean enough and this has been the case for at least 20 or 30 years .
they are just a weak management team and therefore the consequence is that they should go bankrupt . interview : michael knigge -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with that in mind , i think we are pretty well prepared for this crisis and we will not suffer too much from it . in the united states and in europe there is a heated debate whether the government should bail out giant companies like car manufacturers .
should the government rescue giant companies or let them go bust ? this is a difficult one .
the same managers who do n't normally ask for state or governmental support or partial support are all of a sudden starting to cry for help .
i personally believe companies that have not been managed well , like general motors , should go bankrupt .
their problem is that they have a very bloated organization , they are really not lean enough and this has been the case for at least 20 or 30 years .
they are just a weak management team and therefore the consequence is that they should go bankrupt . interview : michael knigge -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw 's karl zawadzky asks whether state support is really the way to go . the government in berlin responded to opel 's cry for help by saying it would study the plea - unlike hessen 's state premier roland koch , who immediately called for a " protective shield " in the form of comprehensive state support for germany 's entire automotive industry and government help totalling 500 million euros -lrb- $ 632 million -rrb- of the state budget .
the government 's more measured response is an eminently sensible one , since the german company owned by general motors is not actually at immediate risk of bankruptcy .
and if regional governments start bailing out individual companies facing insolvency - for whatever reasons - then who knows where that could lead ?
worst-case scenarios executives and union leaders at gm subsidiary opel turned to berlin and the regional governments in the states where opel has factories out of fear that parent company general motors might go bust and will no longer be able to pay back the loans it owes its german subsidiary .
but this would be a worst-case scenario - and an unlikely one , given that in the us , congress is currently working out the details of a $ 25 billion rescue package for america 's big three carmakers general motors , ford , and chrysler .
so there clearly is enough time to weigh the options , instead of acting rashly , and the options do need to be weighed .
for example , it makes no sense to use german taxpayers ' money given the risk that funding will simply end up in the pockets of the american parent company - especially since several years ago , general motors turned opel from a joint stock company into a limited liability company , not least in order to boost control of its subsidiary . after merkel held talks in berlin with carl-peter forster , ceo of general motors europe , hans demant , opel ceo and klaus franz , president of the works council , it became clear that berlin and the regional governments where opel 's factories are based do not intend to abandon the company .
but a bailout will come with strings attached .
and no one has any intention of introducing state support for the entire automotive industry .
many companies , after all , including daimler , bmw , vw and porsche , are currently doing very nicely indeed .
they are certainly not suffering from an acute lack of cash - although a lack of customers is a growing problem .

the consumers simply do n't want these kinds of cars any more - not even in the us , traditionally home to low gas prices and a somewhat undeveloped environmental awareness .
the carmakers need to wake up and smell the coffee . developing new models that reflect changing consumer habits requires time and effort - and possibly even leads to closures and job cuts .
a number of suppliers have already bitten the dust , and if its parent company goes bankrupt , then heads will also roll at opel .
nonetheless , over-impulsive , sweeping aid packages make no sense .
a credit guarantee should be offered on a case-by-case basis , and only after much deliberation .
not only is it a use of taxpayers ' money , it is also a move that gives the company at stake an unfair competitive advantage .
a state aid package is a more favorable financing solution than those available to other companies .
were even financially stable companies which could actually weather the financial crisis under their own steam to start considering this an option , they would all want credit guarantees .
the government needs to avoid companies enjoying what is known as windfall gains - and it also needs to avoid its support ending up in the wrong place .

they say the proposed law 's aggressive online evidence-gathering measures are ill-conceived and open to abuse . less than a week after germany 's lower house of parliament approved new anti-terrorism legislation that would vastly expand the cyber-spying powers of the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- , two police trade unions and the german judicial federation demanded that amendments be made to the so-called federal bureau of criminal investigations bill . the bill , backed strongly by chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition government , was passed in the bundestag last week with 375 parliamentarians in favor and 168 against .
the plan , if approved by the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament , could go into effect in early 2009 . among the most contentious points in the bill are those addressing the expansion of surreptitious online search capabilities and an increase in the bka 's powers to access information from the computers , telephone conversations and homes of suspected terrorists . if enacted the plan would allow " remote forensic software " to search secretly through hard drives and send potentially incriminating evidence back to investigators .
the measure does not , however , allow the police to enter a home in order to install monitoring equipment or software on a computer . unions : constitutional approval needed critics of the law say that it infringes upon privacy rights guaranteed by the constitution . the bka needs a nationally accepted law approved by the federal constitutional court before its measures could go into effect , rainer wendt , the chairman of the german police trade union -lrb- dpolg -rrb- , told the osnabrücker zeitung newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bka president joerg ziercke is a strong advocate of the law konrad freiberg , the chairman of the trade union of the police -lrb- gdp -rrb- , criticized the government for focusing on the " cheap solution " of online searches and failing to address more serious reforms necessary for the bka to fulfill its anti-terror mandate . " it is obvious that the bka is not ready for the creation of these new online searches , " he said , according to the osnabrücker zeitung article . klaus jansen , the head of the federation of german criminal investigative officers , accused the ruling coalition of conservatives and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- of making " putrid political compromises " and bowing to the bka 's demands . he also criticized the measure which would allow the bka to undertake emergency online activities without immediate court approval if such approval is obtained within three days . state parliamentarians agree to reject law the police criticism comes after the spd party congress in the state of saxony agreed over the weekend to reject the proposed law when it comes before the bundesrat .
the spd congress in neighboring saxony-anhalt also agreed to reject the law .
at least one of the states would have to change it position for the bill to be enacted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition to interior minister schaeuble 's plan is growing ralf stegner , the regional chairman of the spd parliamentary group in schleswig-holstein , demanded amendments to the plan before christmas .
the bill had originally been scheduled for vote at the end of november . however , with party rebellions gathering pace around the country and privacy rights advocates joining the police unions in condemning the law , the bill could first go before the federal constitutional court to be judged on its constitutional merits . german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble said he wants to discuss the measure 's necessity - as currently written - with his state interior ministers during a meeting on wednesday . opposition fears unconstitutional " super police " critics in opposition parties have come out against the creation of a " super police force " whose expanded powers , they say , would infringe on privacy and human rights . as well as the online measures , the bill allows the bka to bug , film or photograph the homes of suspected terrorists or places where they are staying .
the tapping of suspects ' telephones and cell phones as well as tracking the location of mobile phone calls would also be permissible . additionally , the bka would be able to perform data-mining searches as a preventative measure rather than as part of criminal proceedings following terrorist attacks .
in certain cases , such data-mining , which would require court approval , can also include the use of data seized from private institutions . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" workers from new -lrb- eu -rrb- member states have satisfied demand in receiving countries ... without creating any major disruption to unemployment or to the salaries of native workers , " spidla said . and since the free movement of people is " a fundamental right " , governments should " lift their restrictions as soon as possible , " the commissioner said . spidla made his comments while presenting a report showing that the eu 's recent enlargement has not , as some had feared , led to a massive influx of polish plumbers - a symbol of cheap labor - to the eu 's 15 oldest and richest members -lrb- eu-15 -rrb- . the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , poland , slovakia and slovenia , as well as cyprus and malta , all joined the eu in 2004 , while bulgaria and romania followed in 2007 . the commission 's latest estimates show that the share of nationals from the 10 countries that joined in 2004 and who have decided to relocate elsewhere in the eu has risen from 0.2 percent in 2003 to 0.5 percent in 2007 , with most of them heading to britain or ireland . the share of bulgarians and romanians now living in the eu-15 , meanwhile , has increased from 0.2 percent to 0.4 percent over the same period , with most heading for spain or italy . more benefits than problems such migrations have , on balance , brought more benefits than problems by satisfying demand and by meeting skill shortages in the receiving countries , spidla said . officials in brussels also noted that the arrival of workers from new member states tends to increase productivity and ease inflationary pressure , since these workers send part of their salaries back home rather than spending it in their new country of residence . and unlike many illegal immigrants arriving from asia , africa or latin america , eu workers tend to enjoy regular contracts and thus pay taxes . restrictions remain in place when the eu agreed to enlarge its borders , the eu executive in brussels sought to allay the concerns of many by granting " old " eu governments the ability to temporarily restrict the influx of workers from new member states . such restrictions must however be abolished entirely by 2011 for workers from the eight central and eastern european countries that joined in 2004 - and by 2013 for bulgarians and romanians . at the moment , only austria , belgium , denmark and germany maintain some restrictions on workers from the eight countries that joined in 2004 , while workers from bulgaria and romania still face barriers to entry in most eu-15 countries . germany should open up asked whether europe 's biggest employer - germany - should now lift its restrictions , spidla said the commission 's report " shows quite clearly that all countries that have opened up -lrb- their labor markets -rrb- have found it to be a good thing . " the commissioner also noted that since migrant workers tend to go where jobs are available , the current recession would not lead to a major increase in the influx of such workers . governments now have until the end of april to communicate to the commission whether they intend to extend their restrictions .
however , they can only do so if they can show that lifting them would lead to " serious disturbances " to their labor markets . polish migration poles meanwhile do make up the largest immigrant group in the european union , followed by romanians and moroccans , an eu report said tuesday . out of some 3 million immigrants that settled in the eu , some 290,000 were poles , said the eurostat statistics based on 2006 . some 2 million poles went to work in other eu countries since poland joined the european union in 2004 .
poles working abroad have contributed to the ex-communist nation 's prosperity , sending home more than $ 8 billion -lrb- 6.32 billion euros -rrb- in 2007 while helping to cut the jobless rate . about 40 percent of all eu immigrants were eu citizens migrating to another member state .
the remaining 60 percent were from european non-member states , asia , the united states and africa , the report said . spain , followed by germany and britain , saw the largest number of immigrants in 2006 .
luxembourg had the highest rate of immigrants with 28.8 per 1,000 inhabitants . mathis winkler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw 's karl zawadzky asks whether state support is really the way to go . the government in berlin responded to opel 's cry for help by saying it would study the plea - unlike hessen 's state premier roland koch , who immediately called for a " protective shield " in the form of comprehensive state support for germany 's entire automotive industry and government help totalling 500 million euros -lrb- $ 632 million -rrb- of the state budget .
the government 's more measured response is an eminently sensible one , since the german company owned by general motors is not actually at immediate risk of bankruptcy .
and if regional governments start bailing out individual companies facing insolvency - for whatever reasons - then who knows where that could lead ?
worst-case scenarios executives and union leaders at gm subsidiary opel turned to berlin and the regional governments in the states where opel has factories out of fear that parent company general motors might go bust and will no longer be able to pay back the loans it owes its german subsidiary .
but this would be a worst-case scenario - and an unlikely one , given that in the us , congress is currently working out the details of a $ 25 billion rescue package for america 's big three carmakers general motors , ford , and chrysler .
so there clearly is enough time to weigh the options , instead of acting rashly , and the options do need to be weighed .
for example , it makes no sense to use german taxpayers ' money given the risk that funding will simply end up in the pockets of the american parent company - especially since several years ago , general motors turned opel from a joint stock company into a limited liability company , not least in order to boost control of its subsidiary . after merkel held talks in berlin with carl-peter forster , ceo of general motors europe , hans demant , opel ceo and klaus franz , president of the works council , it became clear that berlin and the regional governments where opel 's factories are based do not intend to abandon the company .
but a bailout will come with strings attached .
and no one has any intention of introducing state support for the entire automotive industry .
many companies , after all , including daimler , bmw , vw and porsche , are currently doing very nicely indeed .
they are certainly not suffering from an acute lack of cash - although a lack of customers is a growing problem .
out of touch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky partly to blame is a product range that reflects neither the financial crisis nor environmental concerns . with their enormous gas guzzlers , state support would not be enough to pull these companies through a financial crisis .
they need more than bailouts , credit guarantees and stimulus packages .
the consumers simply do n't want these kinds of cars any more - not even in the us , traditionally home to low gas prices and a somewhat undeveloped environmental awareness .
the carmakers need to wake up and smell the coffee . developing new models that reflect changing consumer habits requires time and effort - and possibly even leads to closures and job cuts .
a number of suppliers have already bitten the dust , and if its parent company goes bankrupt , then heads will also roll at opel .
nonetheless , over-impulsive , sweeping aid packages make no sense .
a credit guarantee should be offered on a case-by-case basis , and only after much deliberation .
not only is it a use of taxpayers ' money , it is also a move that gives the company at stake an unfair competitive advantage .
a state aid package is a more favorable financing solution than those available to other companies .
were even financially stable companies which could actually weather the financial crisis under their own steam to start considering this an option , they would all want credit guarantees .
the government needs to avoid companies enjoying what is known as windfall gains - and it also needs to avoid its support ending up in the wrong place .
when it comes to internal funds , after all , multinationals in particular tend to be very " flexible . "
just one cog in the wheel the automotive industry is important , but its role in the economy is not nearly as important as that of the banks .
even so , the state will do what it can to extend lifelines to carmakers facing the abyss .
too many jobs are at stake .
in germany , opel employs 25,000 people , its suppliers another 50,000 .
for the time being , opel 's future appears safe .
but everything depends on general motors .
the government in berlin by all means needs to address the crisis in the automotive industry - and especially opel 's case .
but other economic sectors are also hard hit by the troubled economy .
and while the government might be able to help out the odd company with an occasional loan guarantee , it ca n't afford to rescue entire sectors .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 18.11.2008 opinion : bailouts fine in moderation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government is set to decide whether to grant ailing german carmaker opel 1 billion euros in credit guarantees .
dw 's karl zawadzky asks whether state support is really the way to go . the government in berlin responded to opel 's cry for help by saying it would study the plea - unlike hessen 's state premier roland koch , who immediately called for a " protective shield " in the form of comprehensive state support for germany 's entire automotive industry and government help totalling 500 million euros -lrb- $ 632 million -rrb- of the state budget .
the government 's more measured response is an eminently sensible one , since the german company owned by general motors is not actually at immediate risk of bankruptcy .
and if regional governments start bailing out individual companies facing insolvency - for whatever reasons - then who knows where that could lead ?
worst-case scenarios executives and union leaders at gm subsidiary opel turned to berlin and the regional governments in the states where opel has factories out of fear that parent company general motors might go bust and will no longer be able to pay back the loans it owes its german subsidiary .
but this would be a worst-case scenario - and an unlikely one , given that in the us , congress is currently working out the details of a $ 25 billion rescue package for america 's big three carmakers general motors , ford , and chrysler .
so there clearly is enough time to weigh the options , instead of acting rashly , and the options do need to be weighed .
for example , it makes no sense to use german taxpayers ' money given the risk that funding will simply end up in the pockets of the american parent company - especially since several years ago , general motors turned opel from a joint stock company into a limited liability company , not least in order to boost control of its subsidiary . after merkel held talks in berlin with carl-peter forster , ceo of general motors europe , hans demant , opel ceo and klaus franz , president of the works council , it became clear that berlin and the regional governments where opel 's factories are based do not intend to abandon the company .
but a bailout will come with strings attached .
and no one has any intention of introducing state support for the entire automotive industry .
many companies , after all , including daimler , bmw , vw and porsche , are currently doing very nicely indeed .
they are certainly not suffering from an acute lack of cash - although a lack of customers is a growing problem .
out of touch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky partly to blame is a product range that reflects neither the financial crisis nor environmental concerns . with their enormous gas guzzlers , state support would not be enough to pull these companies through a financial crisis .
they need more than bailouts , credit guarantees and stimulus packages .
the consumers simply do n't want these kinds of cars any more - not even in the us , traditionally home to low gas prices and a somewhat undeveloped environmental awareness .
the carmakers need to wake up and smell the coffee . developing new models that reflect changing consumer habits requires time and effort - and possibly even leads to closures and job cuts .
a number of suppliers have already bitten the dust , and if its parent company goes bankrupt , then heads will also roll at opel .
nonetheless , over-impulsive , sweeping aid packages make no sense .
a credit guarantee should be offered on a case-by-case basis , and only after much deliberation .
not only is it a use of taxpayers ' money , it is also a move that gives the company at stake an unfair competitive advantage .
a state aid package is a more favorable financing solution than those available to other companies .
were even financially stable companies which could actually weather the financial crisis under their own steam to start considering this an option , they would all want credit guarantees .
the government needs to avoid companies enjoying what is known as windfall gains - and it also needs to avoid its support ending up in the wrong place .
when it comes to internal funds , after all , multinationals in particular tend to be very " flexible . "
just one cog in the wheel the automotive industry is important , but its role in the economy is not nearly as important as that of the banks .
even so , the state will do what it can to extend lifelines to carmakers facing the abyss .
too many jobs are at stake .
in germany , opel employs 25,000 people , its suppliers another 50,000 .
for the time being , opel 's future appears safe .
but everything depends on general motors .
the government in berlin by all means needs to address the crisis in the automotive industry - and especially opel 's case .
but other economic sectors are also hard hit by the troubled economy .
and while the government might be able to help out the odd company with an occasional loan guarantee , it ca n't afford to rescue entire sectors .

" workers from new -lrb- eu -rrb- member states have satisfied demand in receiving countries ... without creating any major disruption to unemployment or to the salaries of native workers , " spidla said . and since the free movement of people is " a fundamental right " , governments should " lift their restrictions as soon as possible , " the commissioner said . spidla made his comments while presenting a report showing that the eu 's recent enlargement has not , as some had feared , led to a massive influx of polish plumbers - a symbol of cheap labor - to the eu 's 15 oldest and richest members -lrb- eu-15 -rrb- . the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , poland , slovakia and slovenia , as well as cyprus and malta , all joined the eu in 2004 , while bulgaria and romania followed in 2007 . the commission 's latest estimates show that the share of nationals from the 10 countries that joined in 2004 and who have decided to relocate elsewhere in the eu has risen from 0.2 percent in 2003 to 0.5 percent in 2007 , with most of them heading to britain or ireland . the share of bulgarians and romanians now living in the eu-15 , meanwhile , has increased from 0.2 percent to 0.4 percent over the same period , with most heading for spain or italy . more benefits than problems such migrations have , on balance , brought more benefits than problems by satisfying demand and by meeting skill shortages in the receiving countries , spidla said . officials in brussels also noted that the arrival of workers from new member states tends to increase productivity and ease inflationary pressure , since these workers send part of their salaries back home rather than spending it in their new country of residence . and unlike many illegal immigrants arriving from asia , africa or latin america , eu workers tend to enjoy regular contracts and thus pay taxes . restrictions remain in place when the eu agreed to enlarge its borders , the eu executive in brussels sought to allay the concerns of many by granting " old " eu governments the ability to temporarily restrict the influx of workers from new member states . such restrictions must however be abolished entirely by 2011 for workers from the eight central and eastern european countries that joined in 2004 - and by 2013 for bulgarians and romanians . at the moment , only austria , belgium , denmark and germany maintain some restrictions on workers from the eight countries that joined in 2004 , while workers from bulgaria and romania still face barriers to entry in most eu-15 countries . germany should open up asked whether europe 's biggest employer - germany - should now lift its restrictions , spidla said the commission 's report " shows quite clearly that all countries that have opened up -lrb- their labor markets -rrb- have found it to be a good thing . " the commissioner also noted that since migrant workers tend to go where jobs are available , the current recession would not lead to a major increase in the influx of such workers . governments now have until the end of april to communicate to the commission whether they intend to extend their restrictions .
however , they can only do so if they can show that lifting them would lead to " serious disturbances " to their labor markets . polish migration poles meanwhile do make up the largest immigrant group in the european union , followed by romanians and moroccans , an eu report said tuesday . out of some 3 million immigrants that settled in the eu , some 290,000 were poles , said the eurostat statistics based on 2006 . some 2 million poles went to work in other eu countries since poland joined the european union in 2004 .
poles working abroad have contributed to the ex-communist nation 's prosperity , sending home more than $ 8 billion -lrb- 6.32 billion euros -rrb- in 2007 while helping to cut the jobless rate . about 40 percent of all eu immigrants were eu citizens migrating to another member state .

what is your opinion on the summit as a ceo of a global company ? martin richenhagen : the most positive aspect of the summit for agco is that the political leaders first of all identified a problem and secondly started to harmonize and coordinate the action plan .
for a global company , it is very important that you have stable rules and conditions .
for me , it looks likely as that this will happen now . let 's talk briefly about the global financial crisis .
in the us , but also in europe , increasing numbers of companies are suffering , and its not just banks .
how is the agriculture industry affected by the financial meltdown and do you fear that the crisis will spread to more sectors of the economy ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agriculture is n't like most other businesses , according to richenhagen first of all , the farm business is following a slightly different logic .
the farm business is driven by the growing world population .
about 70 million people a year are added to the population .
second , the sector is driven by renewable fuels and third by changing diets in emerging markets like china and india .
therefore , agricultural demand is actually higher than supply and will be higher than supply for many years to come . as far as our company is concerned , we have managed things more carefully over the last few years and our debt-to-capital is down to zero .
we also expect a cash position of $ 600 million for the end of this year .
we work together with pretty good banks , and for many years we have had an agco finance bank helping customers with financing .
with that in mind , i think we are pretty well prepared for this crisis and we will not suffer too much from it . in the united states and in europe there is a heated debate whether the government should bail out giant companies like car manufacturers .
should the government rescue giant companies or let them go bust ? this is a difficult one .
the same managers who do n't normally ask for state or governmental support or partial support are all of a sudden starting to cry for help .
i personally believe companies that have not been managed well , like general motors , should go bankrupt .
their problem is that they have a very bloated organization , they are really not lean enough and this has been the case for at least 20 or 30 years .
they are just a weak management team and therefore the consequence is that they should go bankrupt . interview : michael knigge -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" workers from new -lrb- eu -rrb- member states have satisfied demand in receiving countries ... without creating any major disruption to unemployment or to the salaries of native workers , " spidla said . and since the free movement of people is " a fundamental right " , governments should " lift their restrictions as soon as possible , " the commissioner said . spidla made his comments while presenting a report showing that the eu 's recent enlargement has not , as some had feared , led to a massive influx of polish plumbers - a symbol of cheap labor - to the eu 's 15 oldest and richest members -lrb- eu-15 -rrb- . the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , poland , slovakia and slovenia , as well as cyprus and malta , all joined the eu in 2004 , while bulgaria and romania followed in 2007 . the commission 's latest estimates show that the share of nationals from the 10 countries that joined in 2004 and who have decided to relocate elsewhere in the eu has risen from 0.2 percent in 2003 to 0.5 percent in 2007 , with most of them heading to britain or ireland . the share of bulgarians and romanians now living in the eu-15 , meanwhile , has increased from 0.2 percent to 0.4 percent over the same period , with most heading for spain or italy . more benefits than problems such migrations have , on balance , brought more benefits than problems by satisfying demand and by meeting skill shortages in the receiving countries , spidla said . officials in brussels also noted that the arrival of workers from new member states tends to increase productivity and ease inflationary pressure , since these workers send part of their salaries back home rather than spending it in their new country of residence . and unlike many illegal immigrants arriving from asia , africa or latin america , eu workers tend to enjoy regular contracts and thus pay taxes . restrictions remain in place when the eu agreed to enlarge its borders , the eu executive in brussels sought to allay the concerns of many by granting " old " eu governments the ability to temporarily restrict the influx of workers from new member states . such restrictions must however be abolished entirely by 2011 for workers from the eight central and eastern european countries that joined in 2004 - and by 2013 for bulgarians and romanians . at the moment , only austria , belgium , denmark and germany maintain some restrictions on workers from the eight countries that joined in 2004 , while workers from bulgaria and romania still face barriers to entry in most eu-15 countries . germany should open up asked whether europe 's biggest employer - germany - should now lift its restrictions , spidla said the commission 's report " shows quite clearly that all countries that have opened up -lrb- their labor markets -rrb- have found it to be a good thing . " the commissioner also noted that since migrant workers tend to go where jobs are available , the current recession would not lead to a major increase in the influx of such workers . governments now have until the end of april to communicate to the commission whether they intend to extend their restrictions .
however , they can only do so if they can show that lifting them would lead to " serious disturbances " to their labor markets . polish migration poles meanwhile do make up the largest immigrant group in the european union , followed by romanians and moroccans , an eu report said tuesday . out of some 3 million immigrants that settled in the eu , some 290,000 were poles , said the eurostat statistics based on 2006 . some 2 million poles went to work in other eu countries since poland joined the european union in 2004 .
poles working abroad have contributed to the ex-communist nation 's prosperity , sending home more than $ 8 billion -lrb- 6.32 billion euros -rrb- in 2007 while helping to cut the jobless rate . about 40 percent of all eu immigrants were eu citizens migrating to another member state .
the remaining 60 percent were from european non-member states , asia , the united states and africa , the report said . spain , followed by germany and britain , saw the largest number of immigrants in 2006 .

he talked to dw-world about the g20 financial summit and the global economic crisis . dw-world.de : most economists have called the g20 summit a success .
what is your opinion on the summit as a ceo of a global company ? martin richenhagen : the most positive aspect of the summit for agco is that the political leaders first of all identified a problem and secondly started to harmonize and coordinate the action plan .
for a global company , it is very important that you have stable rules and conditions .
for me , it looks likely as that this will happen now . let 's talk briefly about the global financial crisis .
in the us , but also in europe , increasing numbers of companies are suffering , and its not just banks .
how is the agriculture industry affected by the financial meltdown and do you fear that the crisis will spread to more sectors of the economy ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agriculture is n't like most other businesses , according to richenhagen first of all , the farm business is following a slightly different logic .
the farm business is driven by the growing world population .
about 70 million people a year are added to the population .
second , the sector is driven by renewable fuels and third by changing diets in emerging markets like china and india .
therefore , agricultural demand is actually higher than supply and will be higher than supply for many years to come . as far as our company is concerned , we have managed things more carefully over the last few years and our debt-to-capital is down to zero .
we also expect a cash position of $ 600 million for the end of this year .
we work together with pretty good banks , and for many years we have had an agco finance bank helping customers with financing .
with that in mind , i think we are pretty well prepared for this crisis and we will not suffer too much from it . in the united states and in europe there is a heated debate whether the government should bail out giant companies like car manufacturers .
should the government rescue giant companies or let them go bust ? this is a difficult one .
the same managers who do n't normally ask for state or governmental support or partial support are all of a sudden starting to cry for help .
i personally believe companies that have not been managed well , like general motors , should go bankrupt .
their problem is that they have a very bloated organization , they are really not lean enough and this has been the case for at least 20 or 30 years .
they are just a weak management team and therefore the consequence is that they should go bankrupt . interview : michael knigge -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 18.11.2008 icj : we can hear croatia 's genocide case against serbia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatia would like to see serbia held accountable for the events of 1991 the international court of justice has ruled that it does have jurisdiction over a case croatia would like to bring against serbia for mass-murder .
but it remains to be seen whether the case will ever come to trial . the decision announced by the un highest court in the hague on tuesday , sept .
18 , was a narrow one .
" the court ... by 10 votes to seven finds that ... the court has the jurisdiction to entertain the application by the republic of croatia , " said presiding judge rosalyn higgins .
croatian minister of justice ivan simonovic said he was very happy about the judgement .
" we won in round one , " simonovic told a croatian daily newspaper . " now we have round two and that is to prove genocide in croatia , " croatia lodged its complaint against serbia in 1999 .
zagreb said that serbian participation in the croatian war of 1991-1995 amounted to " a form of genocide which resulted in large numbers of croatian citizens being displaced , killed , tortured , or illegally detained as well as extensive property destruction . "
croatia has estimated that some 20,000 people lost their lives in the conflict .
belgrade had argued that the icj did not have jurisdiction over the complaint .
unsettling history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in october 2008 , former croatian-serb leader milan martic was convicted of war crimes zagreb 's accusations stem from the period immediately after the end of the cold war , which saw the disintegration of the serb-dominated federal republic of yugoslavia .
croatia declared independence from yugoslavia in 1991 .
ethnic serbs , who made up 12 percent of the population in croatia , staged an armed insurrection .
with belgrade 's backing , serbs briefly controlled around 30 percent of what is today croatia , declaring the region known as krajina an independent state .
the ethnic serbian forces were later defeated by the croatian national army with the help of western nations , chiefly the us .
hundreds of thousands of people were displaced during the course of the fighting before it finally ended for good in 1995 .
croatia is seeking punishment against serbians it considers responsible for the violence as well as monetary reparations and the return of croatian cultural treasures .
but it could take years for an actual case against serbia to come to trial , and even if proceedings are initiated , zagreb is unlikely to get everything it wants .
last year , in a similar case , the icj controversially cleared belgrade of any direct responsibility for the genocide of thousands of men and boys in the town of srebrenica in bosnia-hercegovina .
rehabilitation attempt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : capturing mladic could be a major step for serbia toward joining the eu in another event related to the balkans ' troubled history , the prosecutor of the un 's international tribunal for the former yugoslavia , david brammertz , held talks with serbian president boris tadic and other officials .
the focus was on whether belgrade was doing enough to hunt down serbs suspected of crimes against humanity , most notably former bosnian-serbian general ratko mladic , who is wanted on charges of genocide .
brammertz declined to give a public statement , but the serbian government said the talks had gone well .
" brammertz underlined the very good cooperation in the past few months with serbia 's institutions , " the cabinet of the serbian prime minister said in a statement .
serbian cooperation with international efforts to bring war criminals to justice is seen as key to belgrade 's bid to join the eu .
serbia hopes to begin the process of accession next year , but some member states like the netherlands want to see belgrade apprehend suspects like mladic before starting any official procedures . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" now that the last of the 117 windows from the marienkirche can finally return to their proper place it is a further sign of reconciliation and the friendship between our two countries , " he said . the panels had been removed from the marienkirche during the war to protect them from bombing .
they were stored in the basement of the potsdam neues palais , where they were seized by red army soldiers in 1945 .
the soviet union claimed them as war booty and shipped them back to russia . at the ceremony , kotenev also noted that nazi germany had been guilty of wanton looting during the war and stressed that the process of restoring property to its original owners must be reciprocal . " i would like to stress the word ' mutual ' because there are still harsh critics and the issue of looted art is often treated in the media as one in which it is the russians who owe a debt , " he said .
" it is often carelessly - or intentionally - forgotten that during the raids of the wehrmacht many russian museums were systematically plundered .

but it remains to be seen whether the case will ever come to trial . the decision announced by the un highest court in the hague on tuesday , sept .
18 , was a narrow one .
" the court ... by 10 votes to seven finds that ... the court has the jurisdiction to entertain the application by the republic of croatia , " said presiding judge rosalyn higgins .
croatian minister of justice ivan simonovic said he was very happy about the judgement .
" we won in round one , " simonovic told a croatian daily newspaper . " now we have round two and that is to prove genocide in croatia , " croatia lodged its complaint against serbia in 1999 .
zagreb said that serbian participation in the croatian war of 1991-1995 amounted to " a form of genocide which resulted in large numbers of croatian citizens being displaced , killed , tortured , or illegally detained as well as extensive property destruction . "

croatia declared independence from yugoslavia in 1991 .
ethnic serbs , who made up 12 percent of the population in croatia , staged an armed insurrection .

17 , that the eu members states should develop a common rescue package to help those car manufacturers stricken by the current economic crisis . " if we agree on a common direction forward , we will remain strong within europe and in our competition with other sectors in the world , " steinmeier , the social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- candidate for chancellor , said after meeting with the heads of germany 's largest auto manufacturers on monday . juncker , in an interview with germany 's bild newspaper , agreed . " i agree with the idea of a rescue plan for the automobile industry on a european level , " he said .
" if the us government is prepared to gives billions of dollars to save ford , general motors and chrysler before they fail , then we can not simply watch and abandon our manufacturers in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker sees no sense in individual rescue packages " it now makes little sense for germany , france or italy to try to protect their automobile industry individually .
that can only be done together , " juncker said . european commission chief jose manuel barroso said friday that the eu is ready to take action at the world trade organization if it judges that us aid for its struggling auto industry is " illegal . " the us congress approved an aid package worth $ 25 billion -lrb- 19.7 billion euros -rrb- in september to help the auto industry invest in new generation technology but no timetable was fixed for payments to be made . meanwhile , european automakers - who have cast an envious eye at the us plan and called for similar action at home - have been forced to close factories and cut jobs . protection needed to support healthy firms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier wants to protect firms from becoming affected " we must prevent healthy enterprises from becoming affected -lrb- by this crisis -rrb- , " steinmeier said .
" therefore , we must fight to keep the structures which made the automobile industry so strong in germany from disintegrating . " steinmeier 's statements came as the european investment bank -lrb- eib -rrb- , the eu 's lending arm , proposed to increase loans to europe 's ailing auto sector as part of a broader financing plan . " the eib will propose -lrb- to eu finance ministers -rrb- an increase of 20-30 percent , and that corresponds to 10 to 15 billion euros , " more money for both 2009 and 2010 - including help to small- and medium-sized businesses - a spokesman for the luxembourg-based bank told reporters . the eib has handed out an average of 2 billion euros in loans to the automobile sector in the past three years . french finance minister christine lagarde , whose country currently holds the eu rotating presidency , said monday that support for the sector was first of all a matter for the eib , which was working on the dossier . steinmeier : german banks should use bailout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin bailed-out the banks so other sectors could benefit steinmeier also urged the banking sector to provide more support for the car industry by being more generous in its granting of credit . " one of the biggest threats to the auto industry is the current shyness of the banks to take risks , " he said , adding that the financial package provided by the government for german banks was created for such purposes . however , peter bofinger , a member of the german council of economic experts , said the german government should consider putting the ailing manufacturer opel under state control with a view to attracting private investors to support it once the financial crisis has abated . bofinger claimed that the fears that the nationalization of opel could lead to calls for other companies to come under state protection was unfounded . " with a temporary nationalization , i see little danger that other companies would follow , " he said in an interview with the munich 's merkur newspaper .
" most german carmakers and suppliers would have no interest in being temporarily taken into state ownership . " german chancellor angela merkel spent most of monday locked in discussions with opel bosses but emerged from the lengthy negotiations without reaching a decision on potential state aid .
merkel told reporters that the issue would be debated again and that a decision would be made before christmas . economic experts suspicious of nationalization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel is still waiting for a green light for its state aid otto kentzler , the president of the german confederation of skilled crafts -lrb- zdh -rrb- supported the idea of temporarily nationalizing opel , as it would " support and protect many jobs , not only in the automobile industry but in the manufacturing sector and supply industry . " but mario ohoven , the president of the federal association of medium-size enterprises -lrb- bvmw -rrb- said he believes that smaller companies would suffer should the government support opel . " medium-size enterprises die quietly and unnoticed while large-scale enterprises are saved by the state , " he said , adding that merkel risked making a huge mistake by providing the automakers with a billion-euro emergency parachute as more companies would then demand the same . volker treier , chief economist for the german chamber of commerce and industry -lrb- dihk -rrb- , said nationalization should only be used when there are no other options . " government interference should only be necessary in a crisis as the last resort and then only if areas of the national economy are in danger without this nationalization , " he said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the eib will propose -lrb- to eu finance ministers -rrb- an increase of 20-30 percent , and that corresponds to 10 to 15 billion euros , " more money for both 2009 and 2010 - including help to small- and medium-sized businesses - a spokesman for the luxembourg-based bank told reporters . the eib has handed out an average of 2 billion euros in loans to the automobile sector in the past three years . french finance minister christine lagarde , whose country currently holds the eu rotating presidency , said monday that support for the sector was first of all a matter for the eib , which was working on the dossier . steinmeier : german banks should use bailout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin bailed-out the banks so other sectors could benefit steinmeier also urged the banking sector to provide more support for the car industry by being more generous in its granting of credit . " one of the biggest threats to the auto industry is the current shyness of the banks to take risks , " he said , adding that the financial package provided by the government for german banks was created for such purposes . however , peter bofinger , a member of the german council of economic experts , said the german government should consider putting the ailing manufacturer opel under state control with a view to attracting private investors to support it once the financial crisis has abated . bofinger claimed that the fears that the nationalization of opel could lead to calls for other companies to come under state protection was unfounded . " with a temporary nationalization , i see little danger that other companies would follow , " he said in an interview with the munich 's merkur newspaper .
" most german carmakers and suppliers would have no interest in being temporarily taken into state ownership . " german chancellor angela merkel spent most of monday locked in discussions with opel bosses but emerged from the lengthy negotiations without reaching a decision on potential state aid .
merkel told reporters that the issue would be debated again and that a decision would be made before christmas . economic experts suspicious of nationalization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel is still waiting for a green light for its state aid otto kentzler , the president of the german confederation of skilled crafts -lrb- zdh -rrb- supported the idea of temporarily nationalizing opel , as it would " support and protect many jobs , not only in the automobile industry but in the manufacturing sector and supply industry . " but mario ohoven , the president of the federal association of medium-size enterprises -lrb- bvmw -rrb- said he believes that smaller companies would suffer should the government support opel . " medium-size enterprises die quietly and unnoticed while large-scale enterprises are saved by the state , " he said , adding that merkel risked making a huge mistake by providing the automakers with a billion-euro emergency parachute as more companies would then demand the same . volker treier , chief economist for the german chamber of commerce and industry -lrb- dihk -rrb- , said nationalization should only be used when there are no other options . " government interference should only be necessary in a crisis as the last resort and then only if areas of the national economy are in danger without this nationalization , " he said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he talked to dw-world about the g20 financial summit and the global economic crisis . dw-world.de : most economists have called the g20 summit a success .
what is your opinion on the summit as a ceo of a global company ? martin richenhagen : the most positive aspect of the summit for agco is that the political leaders first of all identified a problem and secondly started to harmonize and coordinate the action plan .

the farm business is driven by the growing world population .

we also expect a cash position of $ 600 million for the end of this year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 18.11.2008 opinion : bailouts fine in moderation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government is set to decide whether to grant ailing german carmaker opel 1 billion euros in credit guarantees .
dw 's karl zawadzky asks whether state support is really the way to go . the government in berlin responded to opel 's cry for help by saying it would study the plea - unlike hessen 's state premier roland koch , who immediately called for a " protective shield " in the form of comprehensive state support for germany 's entire automotive industry and government help totalling 500 million euros -lrb- $ 632 million -rrb- of the state budget .
the government 's more measured response is an eminently sensible one , since the german company owned by general motors is not actually at immediate risk of bankruptcy .
and if regional governments start bailing out individual companies facing insolvency - for whatever reasons - then who knows where that could lead ?
worst-case scenarios executives and union leaders at gm subsidiary opel turned to berlin and the regional governments in the states where opel has factories out of fear that parent company general motors might go bust and will no longer be able to pay back the loans it owes its german subsidiary .
but this would be a worst-case scenario - and an unlikely one , given that in the us , congress is currently working out the details of a $ 25 billion rescue package for america 's big three carmakers general motors , ford , and chrysler .
so there clearly is enough time to weigh the options , instead of acting rashly , and the options do need to be weighed .
for example , it makes no sense to use german taxpayers ' money given the risk that funding will simply end up in the pockets of the american parent company - especially since several years ago , general motors turned opel from a joint stock company into a limited liability company , not least in order to boost control of its subsidiary . after merkel held talks in berlin with carl-peter forster , ceo of general motors europe , hans demant , opel ceo and klaus franz , president of the works council , it became clear that berlin and the regional governments where opel 's factories are based do not intend to abandon the company .
but a bailout will come with strings attached .
and no one has any intention of introducing state support for the entire automotive industry .
many companies , after all , including daimler , bmw , vw and porsche , are currently doing very nicely indeed .
they are certainly not suffering from an acute lack of cash - although a lack of customers is a growing problem .
out of touch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky partly to blame is a product range that reflects neither the financial crisis nor environmental concerns . with their enormous gas guzzlers , state support would not be enough to pull these companies through a financial crisis .
they need more than bailouts , credit guarantees and stimulus packages .
the consumers simply do n't want these kinds of cars any more - not even in the us , traditionally home to low gas prices and a somewhat undeveloped environmental awareness .
the carmakers need to wake up and smell the coffee . developing new models that reflect changing consumer habits requires time and effort - and possibly even leads to closures and job cuts .
a number of suppliers have already bitten the dust , and if its parent company goes bankrupt , then heads will also roll at opel .
nonetheless , over-impulsive , sweeping aid packages make no sense .
a credit guarantee should be offered on a case-by-case basis , and only after much deliberation .
not only is it a use of taxpayers ' money , it is also a move that gives the company at stake an unfair competitive advantage .
a state aid package is a more favorable financing solution than those available to other companies .
were even financially stable companies which could actually weather the financial crisis under their own steam to start considering this an option , they would all want credit guarantees .
the government needs to avoid companies enjoying what is known as windfall gains - and it also needs to avoid its support ending up in the wrong place .
when it comes to internal funds , after all , multinationals in particular tend to be very " flexible . "
just one cog in the wheel the automotive industry is important , but its role in the economy is not nearly as important as that of the banks .
even so , the state will do what it can to extend lifelines to carmakers facing the abyss .
too many jobs are at stake .
in germany , opel employs 25,000 people , its suppliers another 50,000 .
for the time being , opel 's future appears safe .
but everything depends on general motors .
the government in berlin by all means needs to address the crisis in the automotive industry - and especially opel 's case .
but other economic sectors are also hard hit by the troubled economy .
and while the government might be able to help out the odd company with an occasional loan guarantee , it ca n't afford to rescue entire sectors .

17 , marking the occasion , neumann said the restitution was a sign of improving relations between the former wartime foes . " now that the last of the 117 windows from the marienkirche can finally return to their proper place it is a further sign of reconciliation and the friendship between our two countries , " he said . the panels had been removed from the marienkirche during the war to protect them from bombing .
they were stored in the basement of the potsdam neues palais , where they were seized by red army soldiers in 1945 .
the soviet union claimed them as war booty and shipped them back to russia . at the ceremony , kotenev also noted that nazi germany had been guilty of wanton looting during the war and stressed that the process of restoring property to its original owners must be reciprocal . " i would like to stress the word ' mutual ' because there are still harsh critics and the issue of looted art is often treated in the media as one in which it is the russians who owe a debt , " he said .
" it is often carelessly - or intentionally - forgotten that during the raids of the wehrmacht many russian museums were systematically plundered . " nonetheless , he hailed the return of the panels as " a milestone in a process begun fifty years ago . " " a homecoming is always a special experience , " said kotenev .
" especially when that homecoming follows a long absence . " war booty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the panels depict biblical stories such as noah 's ark in 1958 , some 1,5 million works of art were returned to east germany by the soviet union after the hague convention for the protection of cultural property made it illegal to use cultural property as war reparations . previously , moscow declared that art seized by the red army was retribution for the 27 million soviet lives lost during the second world war . however , disputes over art seized during and after the war continued to overshadow german-russian relations since the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 . recent years have seen some of the russian cultural treasures looted by the nazis returned to russia .
russian deputies passed a measure in 1997 declaring artwork seized from germany to be rightful spoils of war to compensate for the sacking of its own collections . but germany has refused to relinquish its claims .
experts say that there are still some 2.5 million objects missing from germany believed to be in the former soviet union . meanwhile in frankfurt , mayor martin patzelt announced that the missing panes in marienkirche 's stained glass windows will now undergo restoration and are expected to be returned to their original position by next year . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

17 , marking the occasion , neumann said the restitution was a sign of improving relations between the former wartime foes . " now that the last of the 117 windows from the marienkirche can finally return to their proper place it is a further sign of reconciliation and the friendship between our two countries , " he said . the panels had been removed from the marienkirche during the war to protect them from bombing .
they were stored in the basement of the potsdam neues palais , where they were seized by red army soldiers in 1945 .
the soviet union claimed them as war booty and shipped them back to russia . at the ceremony , kotenev also noted that nazi germany had been guilty of wanton looting during the war and stressed that the process of restoring property to its original owners must be reciprocal . " i would like to stress the word ' mutual ' because there are still harsh critics and the issue of looted art is often treated in the media as one in which it is the russians who owe a debt , " he said .
" it is often carelessly - or intentionally - forgotten that during the raids of the wehrmacht many russian museums were systematically plundered . " nonetheless , he hailed the return of the panels as " a milestone in a process begun fifty years ago . " " a homecoming is always a special experience , " said kotenev .
" especially when that homecoming follows a long absence . " war booty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the panels depict biblical stories such as noah 's ark in 1958 , some 1,5 million works of art were returned to east germany by the soviet union after the hague convention for the protection of cultural property made it illegal to use cultural property as war reparations . previously , moscow declared that art seized by the red army was retribution for the 27 million soviet lives lost during the second world war . however , disputes over art seized during and after the war continued to overshadow german-russian relations since the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 . recent years have seen some of the russian cultural treasures looted by the nazis returned to russia .
russian deputies passed a measure in 1997 declaring artwork seized from germany to be rightful spoils of war to compensate for the sacking of its own collections . but germany has refused to relinquish its claims .
experts say that there are still some 2.5 million objects missing from germany believed to be in the former soviet union . meanwhile in frankfurt , mayor martin patzelt announced that the missing panes in marienkirche 's stained glass windows will now undergo restoration and are expected to be returned to their original position by next year . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" workers from new -lrb- eu -rrb- member states have satisfied demand in receiving countries ... without creating any major disruption to unemployment or to the salaries of native workers , " spidla said . and since the free movement of people is " a fundamental right " , governments should " lift their restrictions as soon as possible , " the commissioner said . spidla made his comments while presenting a report showing that the eu 's recent enlargement has not , as some had feared , led to a massive influx of polish plumbers - a symbol of cheap labor - to the eu 's 15 oldest and richest members -lrb- eu-15 -rrb- . the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , poland , slovakia and slovenia , as well as cyprus and malta , all joined the eu in 2004 , while bulgaria and romania followed in 2007 . the commission 's latest estimates show that the share of nationals from the 10 countries that joined in 2004 and who have decided to relocate elsewhere in the eu has risen from 0.2 percent in 2003 to 0.5 percent in 2007 , with most of them heading to britain or ireland . the share of bulgarians and romanians now living in the eu-15 , meanwhile , has increased from 0.2 percent to 0.4 percent over the same period , with most heading for spain or italy . more benefits than problems such migrations have , on balance , brought more benefits than problems by satisfying demand and by meeting skill shortages in the receiving countries , spidla said . officials in brussels also noted that the arrival of workers from new member states tends to increase productivity and ease inflationary pressure , since these workers send part of their salaries back home rather than spending it in their new country of residence . and unlike many illegal immigrants arriving from asia , africa or latin america , eu workers tend to enjoy regular contracts and thus pay taxes . restrictions remain in place when the eu agreed to enlarge its borders , the eu executive in brussels sought to allay the concerns of many by granting " old " eu governments the ability to temporarily restrict the influx of workers from new member states . such restrictions must however be abolished entirely by 2011 for workers from the eight central and eastern european countries that joined in 2004 - and by 2013 for bulgarians and romanians . at the moment , only austria , belgium , denmark and germany maintain some restrictions on workers from the eight countries that joined in 2004 , while workers from bulgaria and romania still face barriers to entry in most eu-15 countries . germany should open up asked whether europe 's biggest employer - germany - should now lift its restrictions , spidla said the commission 's report " shows quite clearly that all countries that have opened up -lrb- their labor markets -rrb- have found it to be a good thing . " the commissioner also noted that since migrant workers tend to go where jobs are available , the current recession would not lead to a major increase in the influx of such workers . governments now have until the end of april to communicate to the commission whether they intend to extend their restrictions .
however , they can only do so if they can show that lifting them would lead to " serious disturbances " to their labor markets . polish migration poles meanwhile do make up the largest immigrant group in the european union , followed by romanians and moroccans , an eu report said tuesday . out of some 3 million immigrants that settled in the eu , some 290,000 were poles , said the eurostat statistics based on 2006 . some 2 million poles went to work in other eu countries since poland joined the european union in 2004 .
poles working abroad have contributed to the ex-communist nation 's prosperity , sending home more than $ 8 billion -lrb- 6.32 billion euros -rrb- in 2007 while helping to cut the jobless rate . about 40 percent of all eu immigrants were eu citizens migrating to another member state .
the remaining 60 percent were from european non-member states , asia , the united states and africa , the report said . spain , followed by germany and britain , saw the largest number of immigrants in 2006 .

he talked to dw-world about the g20 financial summit and the global economic crisis . dw-world.de : most economists have called the g20 summit a success .
what is your opinion on the summit as a ceo of a global company ? martin richenhagen : the most positive aspect of the summit for agco is that the political leaders first of all identified a problem and secondly started to harmonize and coordinate the action plan .
for a global company , it is very important that you have stable rules and conditions .
for me , it looks likely as that this will happen now . let 's talk briefly about the global financial crisis .
in the us , but also in europe , increasing numbers of companies are suffering , and its not just banks .
how is the agriculture industry affected by the financial meltdown and do you fear that the crisis will spread to more sectors of the economy ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agriculture is n't like most other businesses , according to richenhagen first of all , the farm business is following a slightly different logic .
the farm business is driven by the growing world population .
about 70 million people a year are added to the population .
second , the sector is driven by renewable fuels and third by changing diets in emerging markets like china and india .
therefore , agricultural demand is actually higher than supply and will be higher than supply for many years to come . as far as our company is concerned , we have managed things more carefully over the last few years and our debt-to-capital is down to zero .
we also expect a cash position of $ 600 million for the end of this year .
we work together with pretty good banks , and for many years we have had an agco finance bank helping customers with financing .
with that in mind , i think we are pretty well prepared for this crisis and we will not suffer too much from it . in the united states and in europe there is a heated debate whether the government should bail out giant companies like car manufacturers .
should the government rescue giant companies or let them go bust ? this is a difficult one .
the same managers who do n't normally ask for state or governmental support or partial support are all of a sudden starting to cry for help .
i personally believe companies that have not been managed well , like general motors , should go bankrupt .
their problem is that they have a very bloated organization , they are really not lean enough and this has been the case for at least 20 or 30 years .
they are just a weak management team and therefore the consequence is that they should go bankrupt . interview : michael knigge -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

17 , that the eu members states should develop a common rescue package to help those car manufacturers stricken by the current economic crisis . " if we agree on a common direction forward , we will remain strong within europe and in our competition with other sectors in the world , " steinmeier , the social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- candidate for chancellor , said after meeting with the heads of germany 's largest auto manufacturers on monday . juncker , in an interview with germany 's bild newspaper , agreed . " i agree with the idea of a rescue plan for the automobile industry on a european level , " he said .
" if the us government is prepared to gives billions of dollars to save ford , general motors and chrysler before they fail , then we can not simply watch and abandon our manufacturers in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker sees no sense in individual rescue packages " it now makes little sense for germany , france or italy to try to protect their automobile industry individually .
that can only be done together , " juncker said . european commission chief jose manuel barroso said friday that the eu is ready to take action at the world trade organization if it judges that us aid for its struggling auto industry is " illegal . " the us congress approved an aid package worth $ 25 billion -lrb- 19.7 billion euros -rrb- in september to help the auto industry invest in new generation technology but no timetable was fixed for payments to be made . meanwhile , european automakers - who have cast an envious eye at the us plan and called for similar action at home - have been forced to close factories and cut jobs . protection needed to support healthy firms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier wants to protect firms from becoming affected " we must prevent healthy enterprises from becoming affected -lrb- by this crisis -rrb- , " steinmeier said .
" therefore , we must fight to keep the structures which made the automobile industry so strong in germany from disintegrating . " steinmeier 's statements came as the european investment bank -lrb- eib -rrb- , the eu 's lending arm , proposed to increase loans to europe 's ailing auto sector as part of a broader financing plan . " the eib will propose -lrb- to eu finance ministers -rrb- an increase of 20-30 percent , and that corresponds to 10 to 15 billion euros , " more money for both 2009 and 2010 - including help to small- and medium-sized businesses - a spokesman for the luxembourg-based bank told reporters . the eib has handed out an average of 2 billion euros in loans to the automobile sector in the past three years . french finance minister christine lagarde , whose country currently holds the eu rotating presidency , said monday that support for the sector was first of all a matter for the eib , which was working on the dossier . steinmeier : german banks should use bailout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin bailed-out the banks so other sectors could benefit steinmeier also urged the banking sector to provide more support for the car industry by being more generous in its granting of credit . " one of the biggest threats to the auto industry is the current shyness of the banks to take risks , " he said , adding that the financial package provided by the government for german banks was created for such purposes . however , peter bofinger , a member of the german council of economic experts , said the german government should consider putting the ailing manufacturer opel under state control with a view to attracting private investors to support it once the financial crisis has abated . bofinger claimed that the fears that the nationalization of opel could lead to calls for other companies to come under state protection was unfounded . " with a temporary nationalization , i see little danger that other companies would follow , " he said in an interview with the munich 's merkur newspaper .
" most german carmakers and suppliers would have no interest in being temporarily taken into state ownership . " german chancellor angela merkel spent most of monday locked in discussions with opel bosses but emerged from the lengthy negotiations without reaching a decision on potential state aid .
merkel told reporters that the issue would be debated again and that a decision would be made before christmas . economic experts suspicious of nationalization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel is still waiting for a green light for its state aid otto kentzler , the president of the german confederation of skilled crafts -lrb- zdh -rrb- supported the idea of temporarily nationalizing opel , as it would " support and protect many jobs , not only in the automobile industry but in the manufacturing sector and supply industry .

" medium-size enterprises die quietly and unnoticed while large-scale enterprises are saved by the state , " he said , adding that merkel risked making a huge mistake by providing the automakers with a billion-euro emergency parachute as more companies would then demand the same . volker treier , chief economist for the german chamber of commerce and industry -lrb- dihk -rrb- , said nationalization should only be used when there are no other options .

17 , that the eu members states should develop a common rescue package to help those car manufacturers stricken by the current economic crisis . " if we agree on a common direction forward , we will remain strong within europe and in our competition with other sectors in the world , " steinmeier , the social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- candidate for chancellor , said after meeting with the heads of germany 's largest auto manufacturers on monday . juncker , in an interview with germany 's bild newspaper , agreed . " i agree with the idea of a rescue plan for the automobile industry on a european level , " he said .
" if the us government is prepared to gives billions of dollars to save ford , general motors and chrysler before they fail , then we can not simply watch and abandon our manufacturers in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker sees no sense in individual rescue packages " it now makes little sense for germany , france or italy to try to protect their automobile industry individually .
that can only be done together , " juncker said . european commission chief jose manuel barroso said friday that the eu is ready to take action at the world trade organization if it judges that us aid for its struggling auto industry is " illegal . " the us congress approved an aid package worth $ 25 billion -lrb- 19.7 billion euros -rrb- in september to help the auto industry invest in new generation technology but no timetable was fixed for payments to be made . meanwhile , european automakers - who have cast an envious eye at the us plan and called for similar action at home - have been forced to close factories and cut jobs . protection needed to support healthy firms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier wants to protect firms from becoming affected " we must prevent healthy enterprises from becoming affected -lrb- by this crisis -rrb- , " steinmeier said .
" therefore , we must fight to keep the structures which made the automobile industry so strong in germany from disintegrating . " steinmeier 's statements came as the european investment bank -lrb- eib -rrb- , the eu 's lending arm , proposed to increase loans to europe 's ailing auto sector as part of a broader financing plan . " the eib will propose -lrb- to eu finance ministers -rrb- an increase of 20-30 percent , and that corresponds to 10 to 15 billion euros , " more money for both 2009 and 2010 - including help to small- and medium-sized businesses - a spokesman for the luxembourg-based bank told reporters . the eib has handed out an average of 2 billion euros in loans to the automobile sector in the past three years . french finance minister christine lagarde , whose country currently holds the eu rotating presidency , said monday that support for the sector was first of all a matter for the eib , which was working on the dossier . steinmeier : german banks should use bailout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin bailed-out the banks so other sectors could benefit steinmeier also urged the banking sector to provide more support for the car industry by being more generous in its granting of credit . " one of the biggest threats to the auto industry is the current shyness of the banks to take risks , " he said , adding that the financial package provided by the government for german banks was created for such purposes . however , peter bofinger , a member of the german council of economic experts , said the german government should consider putting the ailing manufacturer opel under state control with a view to attracting private investors to support it once the financial crisis has abated . bofinger claimed that the fears that the nationalization of opel could lead to calls for other companies to come under state protection was unfounded . " with a temporary nationalization , i see little danger that other companies would follow , " he said in an interview with the munich 's merkur newspaper .
" most german carmakers and suppliers would have no interest in being temporarily taken into state ownership . " german chancellor angela merkel spent most of monday locked in discussions with opel bosses but emerged from the lengthy negotiations without reaching a decision on potential state aid .
merkel told reporters that the issue would be debated again and that a decision would be made before christmas . economic experts suspicious of nationalization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel is still waiting for a green light for its state aid otto kentzler , the president of the german confederation of skilled crafts -lrb- zdh -rrb- supported the idea of temporarily nationalizing opel , as it would " support and protect many jobs , not only in the automobile industry but in the manufacturing sector and supply industry . " but mario ohoven , the president of the federal association of medium-size enterprises -lrb- bvmw -rrb- said he believes that smaller companies would suffer should the government support opel . " medium-size enterprises die quietly and unnoticed while large-scale enterprises are saved by the state , " he said , adding that merkel risked making a huge mistake by providing the automakers with a billion-euro emergency parachute as more companies would then demand the same . volker treier , chief economist for the german chamber of commerce and industry -lrb- dihk -rrb- , said nationalization should only be used when there are no other options .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 18.11.2008 opinion : bailouts fine in moderation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government is set to decide whether to grant ailing german carmaker opel 1 billion euros in credit guarantees .
dw 's karl zawadzky asks whether state support is really the way to go . the government in berlin responded to opel 's cry for help by saying it would study the plea - unlike hessen 's state premier roland koch , who immediately called for a " protective shield " in the form of comprehensive state support for germany 's entire automotive industry and government help totalling 500 million euros -lrb- $ 632 million -rrb- of the state budget .
the government 's more measured response is an eminently sensible one , since the german company owned by general motors is not actually at immediate risk of bankruptcy .
and if regional governments start bailing out individual companies facing insolvency - for whatever reasons - then who knows where that could lead ?
worst-case scenarios executives and union leaders at gm subsidiary opel turned to berlin and the regional governments in the states where opel has factories out of fear that parent company general motors might go bust and will no longer be able to pay back the loans it owes its german subsidiary .
but this would be a worst-case scenario - and an unlikely one , given that in the us , congress is currently working out the details of a $ 25 billion rescue package for america 's big three carmakers general motors , ford , and chrysler .
so there clearly is enough time to weigh the options , instead of acting rashly , and the options do need to be weighed .
for example , it makes no sense to use german taxpayers ' money given the risk that funding will simply end up in the pockets of the american parent company - especially since several years ago , general motors turned opel from a joint stock company into a limited liability company , not least in order to boost control of its subsidiary . after merkel held talks in berlin with carl-peter forster , ceo of general motors europe , hans demant , opel ceo and klaus franz , president of the works council , it became clear that berlin and the regional governments where opel 's factories are based do not intend to abandon the company .
but a bailout will come with strings attached .
and no one has any intention of introducing state support for the entire automotive industry .
many companies , after all , including daimler , bmw , vw and porsche , are currently doing very nicely indeed .
they are certainly not suffering from an acute lack of cash - although a lack of customers is a growing problem .
out of touch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky partly to blame is a product range that reflects neither the financial crisis nor environmental concerns . with their enormous gas guzzlers , state support would not be enough to pull these companies through a financial crisis .
they need more than bailouts , credit guarantees and stimulus packages .
the consumers simply do n't want these kinds of cars any more - not even in the us , traditionally home to low gas prices and a somewhat undeveloped environmental awareness .
the carmakers need to wake up and smell the coffee . developing new models that reflect changing consumer habits requires time and effort - and possibly even leads to closures and job cuts .
a number of suppliers have already bitten the dust , and if its parent company goes bankrupt , then heads will also roll at opel .
nonetheless , over-impulsive , sweeping aid packages make no sense .
a credit guarantee should be offered on a case-by-case basis , and only after much deliberation .
not only is it a use of taxpayers ' money , it is also a move that gives the company at stake an unfair competitive advantage .
a state aid package is a more favorable financing solution than those available to other companies .
were even financially stable companies which could actually weather the financial crisis under their own steam to start considering this an option , they would all want credit guarantees .
the government needs to avoid companies enjoying what is known as windfall gains - and it also needs to avoid its support ending up in the wrong place .
when it comes to internal funds , after all , multinationals in particular tend to be very " flexible . "
just one cog in the wheel the automotive industry is important , but its role in the economy is not nearly as important as that of the banks .
even so , the state will do what it can to extend lifelines to carmakers facing the abyss .
too many jobs are at stake .
in germany , opel employs 25,000 people , its suppliers another 50,000 .
for the time being , opel 's future appears safe .
but everything depends on general motors .
the government in berlin by all means needs to address the crisis in the automotive industry - and especially opel 's case .
but other economic sectors are also hard hit by the troubled economy .
and while the government might be able to help out the odd company with an occasional loan guarantee , it ca n't afford to rescue entire sectors .

in these tough times , even the super-wealthy are n't protected against getting soaked . vw stocks went on a wild ride at the end of october , at one point breaking the 1000-euro -lrb- $ 1,264 -rrb- mark before plummeting back down to earth .
but adolf merckle and his family , who had bought options predicated on the idea of vw share prices falling , got run over .
now the family holding company is trouble .
" the -lsb- holding company -rsb- too has suffered under the extreme turbulence in the financial markets in the past few weeks , " merckle 's son ludwig confirmed to dpa press agency on tuesday , nov .
18 .
the family is reported to have lost as much as one billion euros as it was forced to buy up inflated vw shares .
adolf merckle 's personal wealth has been estimated at $ 9.2 billion .
adding to the family 's woes is the fact that the merkel group , a consortium that includes major cement and pharmaceuticals companies , is reported to be in debt to the tune of 16 billion euros .
now one of germany 's top billionaires is facing the unusual challenge of a personal cash crunch - and the state is not yet stepping in .
no deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : billionaire merckle is now trying to see about a loan adolf merckle met with the economics minister of the state of baden-wuerttemberg , ernst pfister , to discuss the financial troubles of the consortium , which employs some 100,000 people .
but if it was a loan he was after , he was disappointed .
" we are confident that the banks and the corporation will find a solution , " pfister told dpa after that meeting .
baden-wuerttemberg 's state premier guenther oettinger has said his government is monitoring the situation .
" we 'll be following this topic intensely but prudently , " oettinger said .
" the employees ca n't be left standing there like idiots for something that 's the fault of company directors . "
ludwig merckle said the company had discussed its need for capital with some 40 banks .
" various options are being examined in order to ensure that debts are reduced responsibly , " merckle told the daily suedwest-presse newspaper .

he talked to dw-world about the g20 financial summit and the global economic crisis . dw-world.de : most economists have called the g20 summit a success .
what is your opinion on the summit as a ceo of a global company ? martin richenhagen : the most positive aspect of the summit for agco is that the political leaders first of all identified a problem and secondly started to harmonize and coordinate the action plan .
for a global company , it is very important that you have stable rules and conditions .
for me , it looks likely as that this will happen now . let 's talk briefly about the global financial crisis .
in the us , but also in europe , increasing numbers of companies are suffering , and its not just banks .
how is the agriculture industry affected by the financial meltdown and do you fear that the crisis will spread to more sectors of the economy ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : agriculture is n't like most other businesses , according to richenhagen first of all , the farm business is following a slightly different logic .
the farm business is driven by the growing world population .
about 70 million people a year are added to the population .
second , the sector is driven by renewable fuels and third by changing diets in emerging markets like china and india .
therefore , agricultural demand is actually higher than supply and will be higher than supply for many years to come . as far as our company is concerned , we have managed things more carefully over the last few years and our debt-to-capital is down to zero .
we also expect a cash position of $ 600 million for the end of this year .
we work together with pretty good banks , and for many years we have had an agco finance bank helping customers with financing .
with that in mind , i think we are pretty well prepared for this crisis and we will not suffer too much from it . in the united states and in europe there is a heated debate whether the government should bail out giant companies like car manufacturers .
should the government rescue giant companies or let them go bust ? this is a difficult one .
the same managers who do n't normally ask for state or governmental support or partial support are all of a sudden starting to cry for help .
i personally believe companies that have not been managed well , like general motors , should go bankrupt .
their problem is that they have a very bloated organization , they are really not lean enough and this has been the case for at least 20 or 30 years .
they are just a weak management team and therefore the consequence is that they should go bankrupt . interview : michael knigge -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in these tough times , even the super-wealthy are n't protected against getting soaked . vw stocks went on a wild ride at the end of october , at one point breaking the 1000-euro -lrb- $ 1,264 -rrb- mark before plummeting back down to earth .
but adolf merckle and his family , who had bought options predicated on the idea of vw share prices falling , got run over .
now the family holding company is trouble .
" the -lsb- holding company -rsb- too has suffered under the extreme turbulence in the financial markets in the past few weeks , " merckle 's son ludwig confirmed to dpa press agency on tuesday , nov .
18 .
the family is reported to have lost as much as one billion euros as it was forced to buy up inflated vw shares .
adolf merckle 's personal wealth has been estimated at $ 9.2 billion .
adding to the family 's woes is the fact that the merkel group , a consortium that includes major cement and pharmaceuticals companies , is reported to be in debt to the tune of 16 billion euros .
now one of germany 's top billionaires is facing the unusual challenge of a personal cash crunch - and the state is not yet stepping in .
no deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : billionaire merckle is now trying to see about a loan adolf merckle met with the economics minister of the state of baden-wuerttemberg , ernst pfister , to discuss the financial troubles of the consortium , which employs some 100,000 people .
but if it was a loan he was after , he was disappointed .
" we are confident that the banks and the corporation will find a solution , " pfister told dpa after that meeting .
baden-wuerttemberg 's state premier guenther oettinger has said his government is monitoring the situation .
" we 'll be following this topic intensely but prudently , " oettinger said .
" the employees ca n't be left standing there like idiots for something that 's the fault of company directors . "
ludwig merckle said the company had discussed its need for capital with some 40 banks .
" various options are being examined in order to ensure that debts are reduced responsibly , " merckle told the daily suedwest-presse newspaper .

but it remains to be seen whether the case will ever come to trial . the decision announced by the un highest court in the hague on tuesday , sept .
18 , was a narrow one .
" the court ... by 10 votes to seven finds that ... the court has the jurisdiction to entertain the application by the republic of croatia , " said presiding judge rosalyn higgins .
croatian minister of justice ivan simonovic said he was very happy about the judgement .
" we won in round one , " simonovic told a croatian daily newspaper . " now we have round two and that is to prove genocide in croatia , " croatia lodged its complaint against serbia in 1999 .
zagreb said that serbian participation in the croatian war of 1991-1995 amounted to " a form of genocide which resulted in large numbers of croatian citizens being displaced , killed , tortured , or illegally detained as well as extensive property destruction . "
croatia has estimated that some 20,000 people lost their lives in the conflict .
belgrade had argued that the icj did not have jurisdiction over the complaint .
unsettling history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in october 2008 , former croatian-serb leader milan martic was convicted of war crimes zagreb 's accusations stem from the period immediately after the end of the cold war , which saw the disintegration of the serb-dominated federal republic of yugoslavia .
croatia declared independence from yugoslavia in 1991 .
ethnic serbs , who made up 12 percent of the population in croatia , staged an armed insurrection .
with belgrade 's backing , serbs briefly controlled around 30 percent of what is today croatia , declaring the region known as krajina an independent state .
the ethnic serbian forces were later defeated by the croatian national army with the help of western nations , chiefly the us .
hundreds of thousands of people were displaced during the course of the fighting before it finally ended for good in 1995 .
croatia is seeking punishment against serbians it considers responsible for the violence as well as monetary reparations and the return of croatian cultural treasures .
but it could take years for an actual case against serbia to come to trial , and even if proceedings are initiated , zagreb is unlikely to get everything it wants .
last year , in a similar case , the icj controversially cleared belgrade of any direct responsibility for the genocide of thousands of men and boys in the town of srebrenica in bosnia-hercegovina .
rehabilitation attempt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : capturing mladic could be a major step for serbia toward joining the eu in another event related to the balkans ' troubled history , the prosecutor of the un 's international tribunal for the former yugoslavia , david brammertz , held talks with serbian president boris tadic and other officials .
the focus was on whether belgrade was doing enough to hunt down serbs suspected of crimes against humanity , most notably former bosnian-serbian general ratko mladic , who is wanted on charges of genocide .
brammertz declined to give a public statement , but the serbian government said the talks had gone well .
" brammertz underlined the very good cooperation in the past few months with serbia 's institutions , " the cabinet of the serbian prime minister said in a statement .
serbian cooperation with international efforts to bring war criminals to justice is seen as key to belgrade 's bid to join the eu .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 18.11.2008 opinion : bailouts fine in moderation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government is set to decide whether to grant ailing german carmaker opel 1 billion euros in credit guarantees .
dw 's karl zawadzky asks whether state support is really the way to go . the government in berlin responded to opel 's cry for help by saying it would study the plea - unlike hessen 's state premier roland koch , who immediately called for a " protective shield " in the form of comprehensive state support for germany 's entire automotive industry and government help totalling 500 million euros -lrb- $ 632 million -rrb- of the state budget .
the government 's more measured response is an eminently sensible one , since the german company owned by general motors is not actually at immediate risk of bankruptcy .
and if regional governments start bailing out individual companies facing insolvency - for whatever reasons - then who knows where that could lead ?
worst-case scenarios executives and union leaders at gm subsidiary opel turned to berlin and the regional governments in the states where opel has factories out of fear that parent company general motors might go bust and will no longer be able to pay back the loans it owes its german subsidiary .
but this would be a worst-case scenario - and an unlikely one , given that in the us , congress is currently working out the details of a $ 25 billion rescue package for america 's big three carmakers general motors , ford , and chrysler .
so there clearly is enough time to weigh the options , instead of acting rashly , and the options do need to be weighed .
for example , it makes no sense to use german taxpayers ' money given the risk that funding will simply end up in the pockets of the american parent company - especially since several years ago , general motors turned opel from a joint stock company into a limited liability company , not least in order to boost control of its subsidiary . after merkel held talks in berlin with carl-peter forster , ceo of general motors europe , hans demant , opel ceo and klaus franz , president of the works council , it became clear that berlin and the regional governments where opel 's factories are based do not intend to abandon the company .
but a bailout will come with strings attached .
and no one has any intention of introducing state support for the entire automotive industry .
many companies , after all , including daimler , bmw , vw and porsche , are currently doing very nicely indeed .
they are certainly not suffering from an acute lack of cash - although a lack of customers is a growing problem .
out of touch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky partly to blame is a product range that reflects neither the financial crisis nor environmental concerns . with their enormous gas guzzlers , state support would not be enough to pull these companies through a financial crisis .
they need more than bailouts , credit guarantees and stimulus packages .
the consumers simply do n't want these kinds of cars any more - not even in the us , traditionally home to low gas prices and a somewhat undeveloped environmental awareness .
the carmakers need to wake up and smell the coffee . developing new models that reflect changing consumer habits requires time and effort - and possibly even leads to closures and job cuts .
a number of suppliers have already bitten the dust , and if its parent company goes bankrupt , then heads will also roll at opel .
nonetheless , over-impulsive , sweeping aid packages make no sense .
a credit guarantee should be offered on a case-by-case basis , and only after much deliberation .
not only is it a use of taxpayers ' money , it is also a move that gives the company at stake an unfair competitive advantage .
a state aid package is a more favorable financing solution than those available to other companies .
were even financially stable companies which could actually weather the financial crisis under their own steam to start considering this an option , they would all want credit guarantees .
the government needs to avoid companies enjoying what is known as windfall gains - and it also needs to avoid its support ending up in the wrong place .
when it comes to internal funds , after all , multinationals in particular tend to be very " flexible . "
just one cog in the wheel the automotive industry is important , but its role in the economy is not nearly as important as that of the banks .
even so , the state will do what it can to extend lifelines to carmakers facing the abyss .
too many jobs are at stake .
in germany , opel employs 25,000 people , its suppliers another 50,000 .
for the time being , opel 's future appears safe .
but everything depends on general motors .
the government in berlin by all means needs to address the crisis in the automotive industry - and especially opel 's case .
but other economic sectors are also hard hit by the troubled economy .
and while the government might be able to help out the odd company with an occasional loan guarantee , it ca n't afford to rescue entire sectors .

but it remains to be seen whether the case will ever come to trial . the decision announced by the un highest court in the hague on tuesday , sept .
18 , was a narrow one .
" the court ... by 10 votes to seven finds that ... the court has the jurisdiction to entertain the application by the republic of croatia , " said presiding judge rosalyn higgins .
croatian minister of justice ivan simonovic said he was very happy about the judgement .
" we won in round one , " simonovic told a croatian daily newspaper . " now we have round two and that is to prove genocide in croatia , " croatia lodged its complaint against serbia in 1999 .
zagreb said that serbian participation in the croatian war of 1991-1995 amounted to " a form of genocide which resulted in large numbers of croatian citizens being displaced , killed , tortured , or illegally detained as well as extensive property destruction . "
croatia has estimated that some 20,000 people lost their lives in the conflict .
belgrade had argued that the icj did not have jurisdiction over the complaint .
unsettling history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in october 2008 , former croatian-serb leader milan martic was convicted of war crimes zagreb 's accusations stem from the period immediately after the end of the cold war , which saw the disintegration of the serb-dominated federal republic of yugoslavia .
croatia declared independence from yugoslavia in 1991 .
ethnic serbs , who made up 12 percent of the population in croatia , staged an armed insurrection .
with belgrade 's backing , serbs briefly controlled around 30 percent of what is today croatia , declaring the region known as krajina an independent state .
the ethnic serbian forces were later defeated by the croatian national army with the help of western nations , chiefly the us .
hundreds of thousands of people were displaced during the course of the fighting before it finally ended for good in 1995 .
croatia is seeking punishment against serbians it considers responsible for the violence as well as monetary reparations and the return of croatian cultural treasures .
but it could take years for an actual case against serbia to come to trial , and even if proceedings are initiated , zagreb is unlikely to get everything it wants .
last year , in a similar case , the icj controversially cleared belgrade of any direct responsibility for the genocide of thousands of men and boys in the town of srebrenica in bosnia-hercegovina .
rehabilitation attempt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : capturing mladic could be a major step for serbia toward joining the eu in another event related to the balkans ' troubled history , the prosecutor of the un 's international tribunal for the former yugoslavia , david brammertz , held talks with serbian president boris tadic and other officials .
the focus was on whether belgrade was doing enough to hunt down serbs suspected of crimes against humanity , most notably former bosnian-serbian general ratko mladic , who is wanted on charges of genocide .
brammertz declined to give a public statement , but the serbian government said the talks had gone well .
" brammertz underlined the very good cooperation in the past few months with serbia 's institutions , " the cabinet of the serbian prime minister said in a statement .
serbian cooperation with international efforts to bring war criminals to justice is seen as key to belgrade 's bid to join the eu .
serbia hopes to begin the process of accession next year , but some member states like the netherlands want to see belgrade apprehend suspects like mladic before starting any official procedures . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they say the proposed law 's aggressive online evidence-gathering measures are ill-conceived and open to abuse . less than a week after germany 's lower house of parliament approved new anti-terrorism legislation that would vastly expand the cyber-spying powers of the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- , two police trade unions and the german judicial federation demanded that amendments be made to the so-called federal bureau of criminal investigations bill . the bill , backed strongly by chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition government , was passed in the bundestag last week with 375 parliamentarians in favor and 168 against .
the plan , if approved by the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament , could go into effect in early 2009 . among the most contentious points in the bill are those addressing the expansion of surreptitious online search capabilities and an increase in the bka 's powers to access information from the computers , telephone conversations and homes of suspected terrorists . if enacted the plan would allow " remote forensic software " to search secretly through hard drives and send potentially incriminating evidence back to investigators .
the measure does not , however , allow the police to enter a home in order to install monitoring equipment or software on a computer . unions : constitutional approval needed critics of the law say that it infringes upon privacy rights guaranteed by the constitution . the bka needs a nationally accepted law approved by the federal constitutional court before its measures could go into effect , rainer wendt , the chairman of the german police trade union -lrb- dpolg -rrb- , told the osnabrücker zeitung newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bka president joerg ziercke is a strong advocate of the law konrad freiberg , the chairman of the trade union of the police -lrb- gdp -rrb- , criticized the government for focusing on the " cheap solution " of online searches and failing to address more serious reforms necessary for the bka to fulfill its anti-terror mandate . " it is obvious that the bka is not ready for the creation of these new online searches , " he said , according to the osnabrücker zeitung article . klaus jansen , the head of the federation of german criminal investigative officers , accused the ruling coalition of conservatives and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- of making " putrid political compromises " and bowing to the bka 's demands . he also criticized the measure which would allow the bka to undertake emergency online activities without immediate court approval if such approval is obtained within three days . state parliamentarians agree to reject law the police criticism comes after the spd party congress in the state of saxony agreed over the weekend to reject the proposed law when it comes before the bundesrat .
the spd congress in neighboring saxony-anhalt also agreed to reject the law .
at least one of the states would have to change it position for the bill to be enacted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition to interior minister schaeuble 's plan is growing ralf stegner , the regional chairman of the spd parliamentary group in schleswig-holstein , demanded amendments to the plan before christmas .
the bill had originally been scheduled for vote at the end of november . however , with party rebellions gathering pace around the country and privacy rights advocates joining the police unions in condemning the law , the bill could first go before the federal constitutional court to be judged on its constitutional merits . german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble said he wants to discuss the measure 's necessity - as currently written - with his state interior ministers during a meeting on wednesday . opposition fears unconstitutional " super police " critics in opposition parties have come out against the creation of a " super police force " whose expanded powers , they say , would infringe on privacy and human rights . as well as the online measures , the bill allows the bka to bug , film or photograph the homes of suspected terrorists or places where they are staying .
the tapping of suspects ' telephones and cell phones as well as tracking the location of mobile phone calls would also be permissible . additionally , the bka would be able to perform data-mining searches as a preventative measure rather than as part of criminal proceedings following terrorist attacks .
in certain cases , such data-mining , which would require court approval , can also include the use of data seized from private institutions . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 18.11.2008 opinion : bailouts fine in moderation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government is set to decide whether to grant ailing german carmaker opel 1 billion euros in credit guarantees .
dw 's karl zawadzky asks whether state support is really the way to go . the government in berlin responded to opel 's cry for help by saying it would study the plea - unlike hessen 's state premier roland koch , who immediately called for a " protective shield " in the form of comprehensive state support for germany 's entire automotive industry and government help totalling 500 million euros -lrb- $ 632 million -rrb- of the state budget .
the government 's more measured response is an eminently sensible one , since the german company owned by general motors is not actually at immediate risk of bankruptcy .
and if regional governments start bailing out individual companies facing insolvency - for whatever reasons - then who knows where that could lead ?
worst-case scenarios executives and union leaders at gm subsidiary opel turned to berlin and the regional governments in the states where opel has factories out of fear that parent company general motors might go bust and will no longer be able to pay back the loans it owes its german subsidiary .
but this would be a worst-case scenario - and an unlikely one , given that in the us , congress is currently working out the details of a $ 25 billion rescue package for america 's big three carmakers general motors , ford , and chrysler .
so there clearly is enough time to weigh the options , instead of acting rashly , and the options do need to be weighed .
for example , it makes no sense to use german taxpayers ' money given the risk that funding will simply end up in the pockets of the american parent company - especially since several years ago , general motors turned opel from a joint stock company into a limited liability company , not least in order to boost control of its subsidiary . after merkel held talks in berlin with carl-peter forster , ceo of general motors europe , hans demant , opel ceo and klaus franz , president of the works council , it became clear that berlin and the regional governments where opel 's factories are based do not intend to abandon the company .
but a bailout will come with strings attached .
and no one has any intention of introducing state support for the entire automotive industry .
many companies , after all , including daimler , bmw , vw and porsche , are currently doing very nicely indeed .
they are certainly not suffering from an acute lack of cash - although a lack of customers is a growing problem .
out of touch bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl zawadzky partly to blame is a product range that reflects neither the financial crisis nor environmental concerns . with their enormous gas guzzlers , state support would not be enough to pull these companies through a financial crisis .
they need more than bailouts , credit guarantees and stimulus packages .
the consumers simply do n't want these kinds of cars any more - not even in the us , traditionally home to low gas prices and a somewhat undeveloped environmental awareness .
the carmakers need to wake up and smell the coffee . developing new models that reflect changing consumer habits requires time and effort - and possibly even leads to closures and job cuts .
a number of suppliers have already bitten the dust , and if its parent company goes bankrupt , then heads will also roll at opel .
nonetheless , over-impulsive , sweeping aid packages make no sense .
a credit guarantee should be offered on a case-by-case basis , and only after much deliberation .
not only is it a use of taxpayers ' money , it is also a move that gives the company at stake an unfair competitive advantage .
a state aid package is a more favorable financing solution than those available to other companies .
were even financially stable companies which could actually weather the financial crisis under their own steam to start considering this an option , they would all want credit guarantees .
the government needs to avoid companies enjoying what is known as windfall gains - and it also needs to avoid its support ending up in the wrong place .
when it comes to internal funds , after all , multinationals in particular tend to be very " flexible . "
just one cog in the wheel the automotive industry is important , but its role in the economy is not nearly as important as that of the banks .
even so , the state will do what it can to extend lifelines to carmakers facing the abyss .
too many jobs are at stake .
in germany , opel employs 25,000 people , its suppliers another 50,000 .
for the time being , opel 's future appears safe .
but everything depends on general motors .
the government in berlin by all means needs to address the crisis in the automotive industry - and especially opel 's case .
but other economic sectors are also hard hit by the troubled economy .
and while the government might be able to help out the odd company with an occasional loan guarantee , it ca n't afford to rescue entire sectors .

they say the proposed law 's aggressive online evidence-gathering measures are ill-conceived and open to abuse . less than a week after germany 's lower house of parliament approved new anti-terrorism legislation that would vastly expand the cyber-spying powers of the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- , two police trade unions and the german judicial federation demanded that amendments be made to the so-called federal bureau of criminal investigations bill . the bill , backed strongly by chancellor angela merkel 's grand coalition government , was passed in the bundestag last week with 375 parliamentarians in favor and 168 against .
the plan , if approved by the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament , could go into effect in early 2009 . among the most contentious points in the bill are those addressing the expansion of surreptitious online search capabilities and an increase in the bka 's powers to access information from the computers , telephone conversations and homes of suspected terrorists . if enacted the plan would allow " remote forensic software " to search secretly through hard drives and send potentially incriminating evidence back to investigators .
the measure does not , however , allow the police to enter a home in order to install monitoring equipment or software on a computer . unions : constitutional approval needed critics of the law say that it infringes upon privacy rights guaranteed by the constitution . the bka needs a nationally accepted law approved by the federal constitutional court before its measures could go into effect , rainer wendt , the chairman of the german police trade union -lrb- dpolg -rrb- , told the osnabrücker zeitung newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bka president joerg ziercke is a strong advocate of the law konrad freiberg , the chairman of the trade union of the police -lrb- gdp -rrb- , criticized the government for focusing on the " cheap solution " of online searches and failing to address more serious reforms necessary for the bka to fulfill its anti-terror mandate . " it is obvious that the bka is not ready for the creation of these new online searches , " he said , according to the osnabrücker zeitung article . klaus jansen , the head of the federation of german criminal investigative officers , accused the ruling coalition of conservatives and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- of making " putrid political compromises " and bowing to the bka 's demands . he also criticized the measure which would allow the bka to undertake emergency online activities without immediate court approval if such approval is obtained within three days . state parliamentarians agree to reject law the police criticism comes after the spd party congress in the state of saxony agreed over the weekend to reject the proposed law when it comes before the bundesrat .
the spd congress in neighboring saxony-anhalt also agreed to reject the law .
at least one of the states would have to change it position for the bill to be enacted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition to interior minister schaeuble 's plan is growing ralf stegner , the regional chairman of the spd parliamentary group in schleswig-holstein , demanded amendments to the plan before christmas .
the bill had originally been scheduled for vote at the end of november . however , with party rebellions gathering pace around the country and privacy rights advocates joining the police unions in condemning the law , the bill could first go before the federal constitutional court to be judged on its constitutional merits . german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble said he wants to discuss the measure 's necessity - as currently written - with his state interior ministers during a meeting on wednesday . opposition fears unconstitutional " super police " critics in opposition parties have come out against the creation of a " super police force " whose expanded powers , they say , would infringe on privacy and human rights . as well as the online measures , the bill allows the bka to bug , film or photograph the homes of suspected terrorists or places where they are staying .
the tapping of suspects ' telephones and cell phones as well as tracking the location of mobile phone calls would also be permissible . additionally , the bka would be able to perform data-mining searches as a preventative measure rather than as part of criminal proceedings following terrorist attacks .

" i would like to stress the word ' mutual ' because there are still harsh critics and the issue of looted art is often treated in the media as one in which it is the russians who owe a debt , " he said .
" it is often carelessly - or intentionally - forgotten that during the raids of the wehrmacht many russian museums were systematically plundered .

russian deputies passed a measure in 1997 declaring artwork seized from germany to be rightful spoils of war to compensate for the sacking of its own collections . but germany has refused to relinquish its claims .

" i would like to stress the word ' mutual ' because there are still harsh critics and the issue of looted art is often treated in the media as one in which it is the russians who owe a debt , " he said .
" it is often carelessly - or intentionally - forgotten that during the raids of the wehrmacht many russian museums were systematically plundered . " nonetheless , he hailed the return of the panels as " a milestone in a process begun fifty years ago . " " a homecoming is always a special experience , " said kotenev .
" especially when that homecoming follows a long absence . " war booty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the panels depict biblical stories such as noah 's ark in 1958 , some 1,5 million works of art were returned to east germany by the soviet union after the hague convention for the protection of cultural property made it illegal to use cultural property as war reparations . previously , moscow declared that art seized by the red army was retribution for the 27 million soviet lives lost during the second world war . however , disputes over art seized during and after the war continued to overshadow german-russian relations since the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 . recent years have seen some of the russian cultural treasures looted by the nazis returned to russia .
russian deputies passed a measure in 1997 declaring artwork seized from germany to be rightful spoils of war to compensate for the sacking of its own collections . but germany has refused to relinquish its claims .
experts say that there are still some 2.5 million objects missing from germany believed to be in the former soviet union . meanwhile in frankfurt , mayor martin patzelt announced that the missing panes in marienkirche 's stained glass windows will now undergo restoration and are expected to be returned to their original position by next year . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in these tough times , even the super-wealthy are n't protected against getting soaked . vw stocks went on a wild ride at the end of october , at one point breaking the 1000-euro -lrb- $ 1,264 -rrb- mark before plummeting back down to earth .
but adolf merckle and his family , who had bought options predicated on the idea of vw share prices falling , got run over .
now the family holding company is trouble .
" the -lsb- holding company -rsb- too has suffered under the extreme turbulence in the financial markets in the past few weeks , " merckle 's son ludwig confirmed to dpa press agency on tuesday , nov .
18 .
the family is reported to have lost as much as one billion euros as it was forced to buy up inflated vw shares .
adolf merckle 's personal wealth has been estimated at $ 9.2 billion .
adding to the family 's woes is the fact that the merkel group , a consortium that includes major cement and pharmaceuticals companies , is reported to be in debt to the tune of 16 billion euros .
now one of germany 's top billionaires is facing the unusual challenge of a personal cash crunch - and the state is not yet stepping in .
no deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : billionaire merckle is now trying to see about a loan adolf merckle met with the economics minister of the state of baden-wuerttemberg , ernst pfister , to discuss the financial troubles of the consortium , which employs some 100,000 people .
but if it was a loan he was after , he was disappointed .
" we are confident that the banks and the corporation will find a solution , " pfister told dpa after that meeting .
baden-wuerttemberg 's state premier guenther oettinger has said his government is monitoring the situation .
" we 'll be following this topic intensely but prudently , " oettinger said .
" the employees ca n't be left standing there like idiots for something that 's the fault of company directors . "
ludwig merckle said the company had discussed its need for capital with some 40 banks .
" various options are being examined in order to ensure that debts are reduced responsibly , " merckle told the daily suedwest-presse newspaper .
the plans could include selling off some of the merckle group 's prime subsidiaries - in a sign that not even the super-rich can avoid tightening their belts during the economic crisis . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" workers from new -lrb- eu -rrb- member states have satisfied demand in receiving countries ... without creating any major disruption to unemployment or to the salaries of native workers , " spidla said . and since the free movement of people is " a fundamental right " , governments should " lift their restrictions as soon as possible , " the commissioner said . spidla made his comments while presenting a report showing that the eu 's recent enlargement has not , as some had feared , led to a massive influx of polish plumbers - a symbol of cheap labor - to the eu 's 15 oldest and richest members -lrb- eu-15 -rrb- . the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , poland , slovakia and slovenia , as well as cyprus and malta , all joined the eu in 2004 , while bulgaria and romania followed in 2007 . the commission 's latest estimates show that the share of nationals from the 10 countries that joined in 2004 and who have decided to relocate elsewhere in the eu has risen from 0.2 percent in 2003 to 0.5 percent in 2007 , with most of them heading to britain or ireland . the share of bulgarians and romanians now living in the eu-15 , meanwhile , has increased from 0.2 percent to 0.4 percent over the same period , with most heading for spain or italy . more benefits than problems such migrations have , on balance , brought more benefits than problems by satisfying demand and by meeting skill shortages in the receiving countries , spidla said . officials in brussels also noted that the arrival of workers from new member states tends to increase productivity and ease inflationary pressure , since these workers send part of their salaries back home rather than spending it in their new country of residence . and unlike many illegal immigrants arriving from asia , africa or latin america , eu workers tend to enjoy regular contracts and thus pay taxes . restrictions remain in place when the eu agreed to enlarge its borders , the eu executive in brussels sought to allay the concerns of many by granting " old " eu governments the ability to temporarily restrict the influx of workers from new member states . such restrictions must however be abolished entirely by 2011 for workers from the eight central and eastern european countries that joined in 2004 - and by 2013 for bulgarians and romanians . at the moment , only austria , belgium , denmark and germany maintain some restrictions on workers from the eight countries that joined in 2004 , while workers from bulgaria and romania still face barriers to entry in most eu-15 countries . germany should open up asked whether europe 's biggest employer - germany - should now lift its restrictions , spidla said the commission 's report " shows quite clearly that all countries that have opened up -lrb- their labor markets -rrb- have found it to be a good thing . " the commissioner also noted that since migrant workers tend to go where jobs are available , the current recession would not lead to a major increase in the influx of such workers . governments now have until the end of april to communicate to the commission whether they intend to extend their restrictions .
however , they can only do so if they can show that lifting them would lead to " serious disturbances " to their labor markets . polish migration poles meanwhile do make up the largest immigrant group in the european union , followed by romanians and moroccans , an eu report said tuesday . out of some 3 million immigrants that settled in the eu , some 290,000 were poles , said the eurostat statistics based on 2006 . some 2 million poles went to work in other eu countries since poland joined the european union in 2004 .
poles working abroad have contributed to the ex-communist nation 's prosperity , sending home more than $ 8 billion -lrb- 6.32 billion euros -rrb- in 2007 while helping to cut the jobless rate . about 40 percent of all eu immigrants were eu citizens migrating to another member state .
the remaining 60 percent were from european non-member states , asia , the united states and africa , the report said . spain , followed by germany and britain , saw the largest number of immigrants in 2006 .

but it remains to be seen whether the case will ever come to trial . the decision announced by the un highest court in the hague on tuesday , sept .
18 , was a narrow one .
" the court ... by 10 votes to seven finds that ... the court has the jurisdiction to entertain the application by the republic of croatia , " said presiding judge rosalyn higgins .
croatian minister of justice ivan simonovic said he was very happy about the judgement .
" we won in round one , " simonovic told a croatian daily newspaper . " now we have round two and that is to prove genocide in croatia , " croatia lodged its complaint against serbia in 1999 .
zagreb said that serbian participation in the croatian war of 1991-1995 amounted to " a form of genocide which resulted in large numbers of croatian citizens being displaced , killed , tortured , or illegally detained as well as extensive property destruction . "
croatia has estimated that some 20,000 people lost their lives in the conflict .
belgrade had argued that the icj did not have jurisdiction over the complaint .
unsettling history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in october 2008 , former croatian-serb leader milan martic was convicted of war crimes zagreb 's accusations stem from the period immediately after the end of the cold war , which saw the disintegration of the serb-dominated federal republic of yugoslavia .
croatia declared independence from yugoslavia in 1991 .
ethnic serbs , who made up 12 percent of the population in croatia , staged an armed insurrection .
with belgrade 's backing , serbs briefly controlled around 30 percent of what is today croatia , declaring the region known as krajina an independent state .
the ethnic serbian forces were later defeated by the croatian national army with the help of western nations , chiefly the us .
hundreds of thousands of people were displaced during the course of the fighting before it finally ended for good in 1995 .
croatia is seeking punishment against serbians it considers responsible for the violence as well as monetary reparations and the return of croatian cultural treasures .
but it could take years for an actual case against serbia to come to trial , and even if proceedings are initiated , zagreb is unlikely to get everything it wants .
last year , in a similar case , the icj controversially cleared belgrade of any direct responsibility for the genocide of thousands of men and boys in the town of srebrenica in bosnia-hercegovina .
rehabilitation attempt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : capturing mladic could be a major step for serbia toward joining the eu in another event related to the balkans ' troubled history , the prosecutor of the un 's international tribunal for the former yugoslavia , david brammertz , held talks with serbian president boris tadic and other officials .
the focus was on whether belgrade was doing enough to hunt down serbs suspected of crimes against humanity , most notably former bosnian-serbian general ratko mladic , who is wanted on charges of genocide .
brammertz declined to give a public statement , but the serbian government said the talks had gone well .
" brammertz underlined the very good cooperation in the past few months with serbia 's institutions , " the cabinet of the serbian prime minister said in a statement .
serbian cooperation with international efforts to bring war criminals to justice is seen as key to belgrade 's bid to join the eu .
serbia hopes to begin the process of accession next year , but some member states like the netherlands want to see belgrade apprehend suspects like mladic before starting any official procedures . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

17 , that the eu members states should develop a common rescue package to help those car manufacturers stricken by the current economic crisis . " if we agree on a common direction forward , we will remain strong within europe and in our competition with other sectors in the world , " steinmeier , the social democratic -lrb- spd -rrb- candidate for chancellor , said after meeting with the heads of germany 's largest auto manufacturers on monday . juncker , in an interview with germany 's bild newspaper , agreed . " i agree with the idea of a rescue plan for the automobile industry on a european level , " he said .
" if the us government is prepared to gives billions of dollars to save ford , general motors and chrysler before they fail , then we can not simply watch and abandon our manufacturers in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker sees no sense in individual rescue packages " it now makes little sense for germany , france or italy to try to protect their automobile industry individually .
that can only be done together , " juncker said . european commission chief jose manuel barroso said friday that the eu is ready to take action at the world trade organization if it judges that us aid for its struggling auto industry is " illegal . " the us congress approved an aid package worth $ 25 billion -lrb- 19.7 billion euros -rrb- in september to help the auto industry invest in new generation technology but no timetable was fixed for payments to be made . meanwhile , european automakers - who have cast an envious eye at the us plan and called for similar action at home - have been forced to close factories and cut jobs . protection needed to support healthy firms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier wants to protect firms from becoming affected " we must prevent healthy enterprises from becoming affected -lrb- by this crisis -rrb- , " steinmeier said .
" therefore , we must fight to keep the structures which made the automobile industry so strong in germany from disintegrating . " steinmeier 's statements came as the european investment bank -lrb- eib -rrb- , the eu 's lending arm , proposed to increase loans to europe 's ailing auto sector as part of a broader financing plan . " the eib will propose -lrb- to eu finance ministers -rrb- an increase of 20-30 percent , and that corresponds to 10 to 15 billion euros , " more money for both 2009 and 2010 - including help to small- and medium-sized businesses - a spokesman for the luxembourg-based bank told reporters . the eib has handed out an average of 2 billion euros in loans to the automobile sector in the past three years . french finance minister christine lagarde , whose country currently holds the eu rotating presidency , said monday that support for the sector was first of all a matter for the eib , which was working on the dossier . steinmeier : german banks should use bailout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin bailed-out the banks so other sectors could benefit steinmeier also urged the banking sector to provide more support for the car industry by being more generous in its granting of credit . " one of the biggest threats to the auto industry is the current shyness of the banks to take risks , " he said , adding that the financial package provided by the government for german banks was created for such purposes . however , peter bofinger , a member of the german council of economic experts , said the german government should consider putting the ailing manufacturer opel under state control with a view to attracting private investors to support it once the financial crisis has abated . bofinger claimed that the fears that the nationalization of opel could lead to calls for other companies to come under state protection was unfounded . " with a temporary nationalization , i see little danger that other companies would follow , " he said in an interview with the munich 's merkur newspaper .
" most german carmakers and suppliers would have no interest in being temporarily taken into state ownership . " german chancellor angela merkel spent most of monday locked in discussions with opel bosses but emerged from the lengthy negotiations without reaching a decision on potential state aid .
merkel told reporters that the issue would be debated again and that a decision would be made before christmas . economic experts suspicious of nationalization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel is still waiting for a green light for its state aid otto kentzler , the president of the german confederation of skilled crafts -lrb- zdh -rrb- supported the idea of temporarily nationalizing opel , as it would " support and protect many jobs , not only in the automobile industry but in the manufacturing sector and supply industry . " but mario ohoven , the president of the federal association of medium-size enterprises -lrb- bvmw -rrb- said he believes that smaller companies would suffer should the government support opel . " medium-size enterprises die quietly and unnoticed while large-scale enterprises are saved by the state , " he said , adding that merkel risked making a huge mistake by providing the automakers with a billion-euro emergency parachute as more companies would then demand the same . volker treier , chief economist for the german chamber of commerce and industry -lrb- dihk -rrb- , said nationalization should only be used when there are no other options . " government interference should only be necessary in a crisis as the last resort and then only if areas of the national economy are in danger without this nationalization , " he said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in these tough times , even the super-wealthy are n't protected against getting soaked . vw stocks went on a wild ride at the end of october , at one point breaking the 1000-euro -lrb- $ 1,264 -rrb- mark before plummeting back down to earth .
but adolf merckle and his family , who had bought options predicated on the idea of vw share prices falling , got run over .
now the family holding company is trouble .
" the -lsb- holding company -rsb- too has suffered under the extreme turbulence in the financial markets in the past few weeks , " merckle 's son ludwig confirmed to dpa press agency on tuesday , nov .
18 .
the family is reported to have lost as much as one billion euros as it was forced to buy up inflated vw shares .
adolf merckle 's personal wealth has been estimated at $ 9.2 billion .
adding to the family 's woes is the fact that the merkel group , a consortium that includes major cement and pharmaceuticals companies , is reported to be in debt to the tune of 16 billion euros .
now one of germany 's top billionaires is facing the unusual challenge of a personal cash crunch - and the state is not yet stepping in .
no deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : billionaire merckle is now trying to see about a loan adolf merckle met with the economics minister of the state of baden-wuerttemberg , ernst pfister , to discuss the financial troubles of the consortium , which employs some 100,000 people .
but if it was a loan he was after , he was disappointed .
" we are confident that the banks and the corporation will find a solution , " pfister told dpa after that meeting .
baden-wuerttemberg 's state premier guenther oettinger has said his government is monitoring the situation .
" we 'll be following this topic intensely but prudently , " oettinger said .
" the employees ca n't be left standing there like idiots for something that 's the fault of company directors . "
ludwig merckle said the company had discussed its need for capital with some 40 banks .
" various options are being examined in order to ensure that debts are reduced responsibly , " merckle told the daily suedwest-presse newspaper .
the plans could include selling off some of the merckle group 's prime subsidiaries - in a sign that not even the super-rich can avoid tightening their belts during the economic crisis . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" workers from new -lrb- eu -rrb- member states have satisfied demand in receiving countries ... without creating any major disruption to unemployment or to the salaries of native workers , " spidla said . and since the free movement of people is " a fundamental right " , governments should " lift their restrictions as soon as possible , " the commissioner said . spidla made his comments while presenting a report showing that the eu 's recent enlargement has not , as some had feared , led to a massive influx of polish plumbers - a symbol of cheap labor - to the eu 's 15 oldest and richest members -lrb- eu-15 -rrb- . the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , poland , slovakia and slovenia , as well as cyprus and malta , all joined the eu in 2004 , while bulgaria and romania followed in 2007 . the commission 's latest estimates show that the share of nationals from the 10 countries that joined in 2004 and who have decided to relocate elsewhere in the eu has risen from 0.2 percent in 2003 to 0.5 percent in 2007 , with most of them heading to britain or ireland . the share of bulgarians and romanians now living in the eu-15 , meanwhile , has increased from 0.2 percent to 0.4 percent over the same period , with most heading for spain or italy . more benefits than problems such migrations have , on balance , brought more benefits than problems by satisfying demand and by meeting skill shortages in the receiving countries , spidla said . officials in brussels also noted that the arrival of workers from new member states tends to increase productivity and ease inflationary pressure , since these workers send part of their salaries back home rather than spending it in their new country of residence . and unlike many illegal immigrants arriving from asia , africa or latin america , eu workers tend to enjoy regular contracts and thus pay taxes . restrictions remain in place when the eu agreed to enlarge its borders , the eu executive in brussels sought to allay the concerns of many by granting " old " eu governments the ability to temporarily restrict the influx of workers from new member states . such restrictions must however be abolished entirely by 2011 for workers from the eight central and eastern european countries that joined in 2004 - and by 2013 for bulgarians and romanians . at the moment , only austria , belgium , denmark and germany maintain some restrictions on workers from the eight countries that joined in 2004 , while workers from bulgaria and romania still face barriers to entry in most eu-15 countries . germany should open up asked whether europe 's biggest employer - germany - should now lift its restrictions , spidla said the commission 's report " shows quite clearly that all countries that have opened up -lrb- their labor markets -rrb- have found it to be a good thing . " the commissioner also noted that since migrant workers tend to go where jobs are available , the current recession would not lead to a major increase in the influx of such workers . governments now have until the end of april to communicate to the commission whether they intend to extend their restrictions .
however , they can only do so if they can show that lifting them would lead to " serious disturbances " to their labor markets . polish migration poles meanwhile do make up the largest immigrant group in the european union , followed by romanians and moroccans , an eu report said tuesday . out of some 3 million immigrants that settled in the eu , some 290,000 were poles , said the eurostat statistics based on 2006 . some 2 million poles went to work in other eu countries since poland joined the european union in 2004 .
poles working abroad have contributed to the ex-communist nation 's prosperity , sending home more than $ 8 billion -lrb- 6.32 billion euros -rrb- in 2007 while helping to cut the jobless rate . about 40 percent of all eu immigrants were eu citizens migrating to another member state .
the remaining 60 percent were from european non-member states , asia , the united states and africa , the report said . spain , followed by germany and britain , saw the largest number of immigrants in 2006 .

17 , marking the occasion , neumann said the restitution was a sign of improving relations between the former wartime foes . " now that the last of the 117 windows from the marienkirche can finally return to their proper place it is a further sign of reconciliation and the friendship between our two countries , " he said . the panels had been removed from the marienkirche during the war to protect them from bombing .
they were stored in the basement of the potsdam neues palais , where they were seized by red army soldiers in 1945 .
the soviet union claimed them as war booty and shipped them back to russia . at the ceremony , kotenev also noted that nazi germany had been guilty of wanton looting during the war and stressed that the process of restoring property to its original owners must be reciprocal . " i would like to stress the word ' mutual ' because there are still harsh critics and the issue of looted art is often treated in the media as one in which it is the russians who owe a debt , " he said .
" it is often carelessly - or intentionally - forgotten that during the raids of the wehrmacht many russian museums were systematically plundered . " nonetheless , he hailed the return of the panels as " a milestone in a process begun fifty years ago . " " a homecoming is always a special experience , " said kotenev .
" especially when that homecoming follows a long absence . " war booty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the panels depict biblical stories such as noah 's ark in 1958 , some 1,5 million works of art were returned to east germany by the soviet union after the hague convention for the protection of cultural property made it illegal to use cultural property as war reparations . previously , moscow declared that art seized by the red army was retribution for the 27 million soviet lives lost during the second world war . however , disputes over art seized during and after the war continued to overshadow german-russian relations since the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 . recent years have seen some of the russian cultural treasures looted by the nazis returned to russia .
russian deputies passed a measure in 1997 declaring artwork seized from germany to be rightful spoils of war to compensate for the sacking of its own collections . but germany has refused to relinquish its claims .
experts say that there are still some 2.5 million objects missing from germany believed to be in the former soviet union . meanwhile in frankfurt , mayor martin patzelt announced that the missing panes in marienkirche 's stained glass windows will now undergo restoration and are expected to be returned to their original position by next year . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

eleven-year-old nikolin dreams about the day he can walk out of his house without fear and attend the local school .
" i imagine that it 's a beautiful place , with chairs , benches , and a blackboard .
i imagine being there with loads of other kids , " he says .
seated on the porch of his parent 's small farmhouse in northern albania , he looks wistfully towards the gatepost which marks the boundary between safety and danger .
" it would be good to make friends , to play and learn , and have friends over to see me , " he adds quietly .
does he understand why he ca n't go out ?
" i know that they will kill me out there , that 's why . "
' kanun ' code nikolin and his three brothers and sisters have the misfortune to have been born into a family entangled in a blood feud , or vendetta , that dates back more than 30 years .
the children 's father , kole ndrepepa , was only a teenager when he killed a neighbour after a petty argument near his village .
under an ancient albanian code , called the " kanun " , the victim 's family invoked its right to take revenge on any male adult in ndrepepa 's extended family , even though he spent 15 years in jail for the crime .
" after i came out of jail i tried to seek reconciliation with the victim 's relatives , but i did n't succeed , ” said the 50-year-old ndrepepa .
" now we 're all scared to go out since we still owe blood . "
because the kanun precludes entering another person 's property to exact revenge , home is the only safe place for those under threat .
according to the headmaster of the local school , leke pjetri , 20 other youngsters are in the same position as ndrepepa 's children .
' strange crimes ' the non-governmental national reconciliation committee -lrb- nrc -rrb- , a group that tries to mediate between warring families , estimates that several thousand albanian families are currently embroiled in feuds nationwide , leaving some 800 children confined to their homes .
blood feuds were officially banned during the 40-year rule of albania 's communist-era hardliner enver hoxha , but in the chaos that accompanied the fall of communism in the early 1990s , the practice resurfaced , often sparked by disputes over rural property , or slurs on family honour .
nrc director gjin marku told the bbc that since tradition dictates that ending a blood feud requires the agreement of all male adults in both families , the reconciliation process can sometimes take up to 10 years to complete .
" if just one man in a family of perhaps 50 or 60 people objects , then the whole process fails , " he said .
albanian justice minister enkelejd alibeaj said the problem was slowly diminishing , although it remained acute in some areas of the north of the country .
mr alibeaj , who made his name fighting corruption , denied claims that the authorities were not taking the problem seriously : " what 's important is not the frequency with which this is happening , but that such strange crimes happen at all in the 21st century and in a country now aspiring to join the european union .
that is what really concerns us - and is making us act . "
he said that 13 people were prosecuted for blood-feud-related murders last year under a specific article in the penal code referring to killing for revenge .
pjeter 's dream but for some of those whose lives have been turned upside down by these age-old customs , swift resolution remains a distant hope . "
the only future i see for myself is being able to leave albania and live somewhere else , far , away far from here " pjeter luci it has been almost two years since pjeter luci dared venture outside the cramped house on the edge of tirana , albania 's capital , which he shares with his mother , lula , and two sisters .
the family were forced to flee their village in the north after a distant cousin killed four men in a bar brawl .
the dead men 's relatives have all sworn to take revenge .
pjeter , 22 , said he dreamed about being able to leave what he termed " his prison " .
he said that it was " unacceptable " to have to pay for a crime committed by someone else .
" the only future i see for myself is being able to leave albania and live somewhere else , far , away far from here . "

' we owe blood to another family ' the children 's father , kole ndrepepa , was only a teenager when he killed a neighbour after a petty argument near his village .
under an ancient albanian code , called the " kanun " , the victim 's family invoked its right to take revenge on any male adult in ndrepepa 's extended family , even though he spent 15 years in jail for the crime .
" after i came out of jail i tried to seek reconciliation with the victim 's relatives , but i did n't succeed , ” said the 50-year-old ndrepepa .
" now we 're all scared to go out since we still owe blood . "
because the kanun precludes entering another person 's property to exact revenge , home is the only safe place for those under threat .
according to the headmaster of the local school , leke pjetri , 20 other youngsters are in the same position as ndrepepa 's children .
' strange crimes ' the non-governmental national reconciliation committee -lrb- nrc -rrb- , a group that tries to mediate between warring families , estimates that several thousand albanian families are currently embroiled in feuds nationwide , leaving some 800 children confined to their homes .
some villagers are forced to flee their homes to start a new life in tirana blood feuds were officially banned during the 40-year rule of albania 's communist-era hardliner enver hoxha , but in the chaos that accompanied the fall of communism in the early 1990s , the practice resurfaced , often sparked by disputes over rural property , or slurs on family honour .
nrc director gjin marku told the bbc that since tradition dictates that ending a blood feud requires the agreement of all male adults in both families , the reconciliation process can sometimes take up to 10 years to complete .
" if just one man in a family of perhaps 50 or 60 people objects , then the whole process fails , " he said .
albanian justice minister enkelejd alibeaj said the problem was slowly diminishing , although it remained acute in some areas of the north of the country .
mr alibeaj , who made his name fighting corruption , denied claims that the authorities were not taking the problem seriously : " what 's important is not the frequency with which this is happening , but that such strange crimes happen at all in the 21st century and in a country now aspiring to join the european union .
that is what really concerns us - and is making us act . "
he said that 13 people were prosecuted for blood-feud-related murders last year under a specific article in the penal code referring to killing for revenge .
pjeter 's dream but for some of those whose lives have been turned upside down by these age-old customs , swift resolution remains a distant hope .
the only future i see for myself is being able to leave albania and live somewhere else , far , away far from here pjeter luci it has been almost two years since pjeter luci dared venture outside the cramped house on the edge of tirana , albania 's capital , which he shares with his mother , lula , and two sisters .
the family were forced to flee their village in the north after a distant cousin killed four men in a bar brawl .
the dead men 's relatives have all sworn to take revenge .
pjeter , 22 , said he dreamed about being able to leave what he termed " his prison " .
he said that it was " unacceptable " to have to pay for a crime committed by someone else .

' we owe blood to another family ' the children 's father , kole ndrepepa , was only a teenager when he killed a neighbour after a petty argument near his village .
under an ancient albanian code , called the " kanun " , the victim 's family invoked its right to take revenge on any male adult in ndrepepa 's extended family , even though he spent 15 years in jail for the crime .
" after i came out of jail i tried to seek reconciliation with the victim 's relatives , but i did n't succeed , ” said the 50-year-old ndrepepa .
" now we 're all scared to go out since we still owe blood . "
because the kanun precludes entering another person 's property to exact revenge , home is the only safe place for those under threat .
according to the headmaster of the local school , leke pjetri , 20 other youngsters are in the same position as ndrepepa 's children .
' strange crimes ' the non-governmental national reconciliation committee -lrb- nrc -rrb- , a group that tries to mediate between warring families , estimates that several thousand albanian families are currently embroiled in feuds nationwide , leaving some 800 children confined to their homes .
some villagers are forced to flee their homes to start a new life in tirana blood feuds were officially banned during the 40-year rule of albania 's communist-era hardliner enver hoxha , but in the chaos that accompanied the fall of communism in the early 1990s , the practice resurfaced , often sparked by disputes over rural property , or slurs on family honour .
nrc director gjin marku told the bbc that since tradition dictates that ending a blood feud requires the agreement of all male adults in both families , the reconciliation process can sometimes take up to 10 years to complete .
" if just one man in a family of perhaps 50 or 60 people objects , then the whole process fails , " he said .
albanian justice minister enkelejd alibeaj said the problem was slowly diminishing , although it remained acute in some areas of the north of the country .
mr alibeaj , who made his name fighting corruption , denied claims that the authorities were not taking the problem seriously : " what 's important is not the frequency with which this is happening , but that such strange crimes happen at all in the 21st century and in a country now aspiring to join the european union .
that is what really concerns us - and is making us act . "

the accident occurred early on monday morning at the gaomendong coal mine near pingdingshan city in henan province .
xinhua state news agency reported that one miner was still missing and one other had been found dead .
of the 42 miners at work at the time of the flooding , eight managed to escape shortly afterwards , xinhua said .
state media said the mine boss was being investigated for running an illegal operation .
it took the mine owner more than two hours to report the accident .
he is also accused of ignoring reports from miners that water was seeping into the shaft , xinhua said .
' illegal ' operation the owner , lou gaofeng , had been detained , the agency said , adding the mine had been operating illegally , even though its production licence was valid until november 2009 .
" the mine was undergoing a technical renovation ... and had yet to be approved for resuming production , " said wang dexue , deputy head of the state administration of work safety .
" the mine allows a maximum of 28 miners .
but 42 people were working underground when the accident happened , " said li hanwei , vice director of the rescue operations .
it was the third coal mine accident in less than three weeks in henan , with a total of five miners dying in the two previous accidents , xinhua said .
china has a dismal work safety record , with thousands of people dying every year in mines , factories and on construction sites .
nearly 3,800 people died in gas blasts , flooding and other accidents in chinese coal mines last year , according to official figures .
independent monitors say the real figure is likely much higher as many accidents are covered up .

the public accounts committee said 90 % of journeys were on time , but increased network congestion made disruption worse when any problems occurred .
chairman edward leigh said passengers were " rightly angered " over delays .
the committee also found that rescue services did not always know how to contact network rail and that parts of the network had no mobile phone signal .
informed staff in 2006/07 passengers paid £ 5.1bn in fares and the department for transport gave an additional £ 3.4bn to network rail and £ 1.7bn to train operating companies .
even if the driver or guard does n't know what is going on , an announcement to that effect is reassuring edward leigh mp mr leigh , conservative mp for gainsborough , said : " the fire and rescue services often do not know whom to contact and can take decisions without knowing what the effect will be on passengers elsewhere .
" this is not the best way to manage rail incidents to minimise disruption on the network .
at the very least the emergency services should always know whom to phone . "
the committee said relationships between the rail industry and the emergency services were " fragmented " and recommended the government should play a more active role in bringing together the industry , emergency services and other officials , such as coroners .
mr leigh said : " rail passengers pay handsomely to travel on trains and yet , through incidents on the network , are still suffering expensive delays .
" passengers are rightly angered when their train comes to a halt for a lengthy period and nobody in the train crew can give them any information .
" even if the driver or guard does n't know what is going on , an announcement to that effect is reassuring . "
anthony smith , chief executive of customer watchdog passenger focus , said : " passengers have told us repeatedly that having informed staff on the train and on the platform is their main concern during disruption .
" our research shows that some operators , such as virgin trains and merseyrail , are better at communicating with passengers at these times , but there are lessons for the whole industry to be learned . "

the public accounts committee said 90 % of journeys were on time , but increased network congestion made disruption worse when any problems occurred .
chairman edward leigh said passengers were " rightly angered " over delays .
the committee also found that rescue services did not always know how to contact network rail and that parts of the network had no mobile phone signal .
informed staff in 2006/07 passengers paid £ 5.1bn in fares and the department for transport gave an additional £ 3.4bn to network rail and £ 1.7bn to train operating companies .
even if the driver or guard does n't know what is going on , an announcement to that effect is reassuring edward leigh mp mr leigh , conservative mp for gainsborough , said : " the fire and rescue services often do not know whom to contact and can take decisions without knowing what the effect will be on passengers elsewhere .
" this is not the best way to manage rail incidents to minimise disruption on the network .
at the very least the emergency services should always know whom to phone . "
the committee said relationships between the rail industry and the emergency services were " fragmented " and recommended the government should play a more active role in bringing together the industry , emergency services and other officials , such as coroners .
mr leigh said : " rail passengers pay handsomely to travel on trains and yet , through incidents on the network , are still suffering expensive delays .
" passengers are rightly angered when their train comes to a halt for a lengthy period and nobody in the train crew can give them any information .
" even if the driver or guard does n't know what is going on , an announcement to that effect is reassuring . "
anthony smith , chief executive of customer watchdog passenger focus , said : " passengers have told us repeatedly that having informed staff on the train and on the platform is their main concern during disruption .
" our research shows that some operators , such as virgin trains and merseyrail , are better at communicating with passengers at these times , but there are lessons for the whole industry to be learned . "

industry watchdog phonepay plus is urging 4,300 secondary schools to join a scheme to raise awareness among pupils of the potential pitfalls .
it has created a lesson on ringtones for the information and communication technology curriculum .
phonepay plus received more than 8,000 mobile-related complaints in 2007/8 .
that is an increase of 108 % on the previous year .
in the first three months of 2008 alone , the watchdog received more than 4,500 complaints .
the most commonly cited concerns were about paid-for promotional messages and misleading subscription charges .
business plans the phone brain initiative also involves the ministry of sound record label , the government-sponsored young enterprise campaign make your mark and the peter jones foundation , which was founded by one of the entrepreneurs featured in the bbc programme dragons ' den .
organisers say the lesson will not stop teenagers downloading commercial ringtones , but will hopefully make them check the small print . "
they hide charges , mislead customers about pricing and drop important details down into the small print " george kidd , phonepay plus they also say it will raise awareness of the opportunities associated with phone-paid services by encouraging 13 to 18-year-olds to devise a business plan for their own service .
a select few will then have the opportunity to pitch their ideas to peter jones and become involved with the new national skills academy for enterprise .
earlier this year , george kidd , from phonepay plus , told bbc radio 1 's newsbeat that young people felt they were being " ripped of " by some ringtone providers .
" some firms are starting to cut the corners , " he said .
" they hide charges , mislead customers about pricing and drop important details down into the small print . "
many of those who have complained had intended to buy just one ringtone , but found themselves locked into an expensive subscription .
the watchdog said it had seen evidence that some customers had been charged thousands of pounds as a result of bad practice by some companies .
pupils involved in the scheme will also be able to create their own ringtones using ministry of sound music .

pupils involved in the scheme will also be able to create their own ringtones using ministry of sound music .

pupils involved in the scheme will also be able to create their own ringtones using ministry of sound music .

wander round the streets of washington dc 's georgetown district after dark , and you 'll swear you can hear the tinkling strains of tubular bells which served as the spine-tingling theme tune for the supernatural shocker the exorcist .
take a jog down edinburgh 's main drag on a busy shopping afternoon , and you 'll find yourself drumming along to the tub-thumping strains of iggy pop 's lust for life , which accompanied renton 's memorable opening dash in trainspotting .
and venture off the beaten track to pennan in scenic aberdeenshire , and only the hardest of hearts could not imagine the sounds of mark knopfler 's haunting theme from local hero echoing around the rocks and the waters of this heartbreakingly beautiful fishing village .
' brigadoon meets apocalypse now ' local hero joins a trio of movies - along with silent running and love and death - which habitually jockey for position as my second favourite film of all time .
since the movie first opened in the early 1980s , i must have watched it around 100 times - which turns out to be about 99 times more than its creator bill forsyth .
inspired by a news story about oil companies buying up land in orkney , local hero tells of a houston executive who comes to scotland to purchase an entire village , only to be seduced by this remote place 's strange magic .
forsyth once described the movie as " brigadoon meets apocalypse now " . "
it 's been so long since i 've seen it , i keep remembering the script rather than the finished film ! "
bill forsyth its success was so universal that tourists still travel to pennan to seek out the legendary red phone box from which mac calls his employers in the us to report back on the progress of the sale , and to marvel at the otherworldly wonder of the northern lights .
despite the film 's enduring appeal , forsyth chose to move on once it was completed , and claims not to have watched it in a quarter of a century .
last month , i persuaded this great film-maker - who also made gems like gregory 's girl and that sinking feeling - to come back to with me to pennan to celebrate local hero 's 25th birthday .
it was , according to bill , an " unexpectedly emotional experience " as the locals turned out en masse to watch a special screening of the film that put pennan on the movie map .
' pretty good ' as local hero started to play in the recently rebuilt community centre -lrb- it was devastated by a mudslide last year -rrb- , forsyth leaned over and whispered to me : " this must be some tv version of the film - there 's loads of bits missing ! "
" er , no bill , " i replied , " i assure you this is the movie as it 's always been .
and i should know - i 've seen it a lot . "
" yeah , you 're probably right , " he replied .
" but it 's been so long since i 've seen it , i keep remembering the script rather than the finished film ! "
at the end the screening , forsyth took a bow in front of a clearly enraptured audience , and agreed that , actually , his best-loved movie was , as everyone has been telling him for years , " pretty good " .
the evening was rounded off by live music from inspiration , whose line-up includes two key members of the ace tones - the fictional band seen performing in local hero - who still sound as toe-tapping as ever .
then , everyone stumbled out onto the beach to watch a riotous firework display which lit up the sky like the northern lights which first dazzled mac all those years ago .
as the festivities ended , i took the opportunity to fulfil a lifelong , and frankly reckless , ambition .
throwing caution to the wind i strode out along the seafront proudly blaring that theme from local hero on my latest musical acquisition - a set of bagpipes .
whether my pipe playing has made it into the finished piece which goes out on the culture show tonight i 'm not sure - perhaps it only sounded lovely in my head .
but the magic and celebration of bill forsyth 's long overdue cinematic homecoming is there for all to see , a fitting tribute to one of the greatest and most enduring movies ever made .
the culture show is on tuesdays at 2200gmt on bbc two .

it 's been so long since i 've seen it , i keep remembering the script rather than the finished film !
bill forsyth its success was so universal that tourists still travel to pennan to seek out the legendary red phone box from which mac calls his employers in the us to report back on the progress of the sale , and to marvel at the otherworldly wonder of the northern lights .
despite the film 's enduring appeal , forsyth chose to move on once it was completed , and claims not to have watched it in a quarter of a century .
last month , i persuaded this great film-maker - who also made gems like gregory 's girl and that sinking feeling - to come back to with me to pennan to celebrate local hero 's 25th birthday .
it was , according to bill , an " unexpectedly emotional experience " as the locals turned out en masse to watch a special screening of the film that put pennan on the movie map .
' pretty good ' as local hero started to play in the recently rebuilt community centre -lrb- it was devastated by a mudslide last year -rrb- , forsyth leaned over and whispered to me : " this must be some tv version of the film - there 's loads of bits missing ! "
" er , no bill , " i replied , " i assure you this is the movie as it 's always been .
and i should know - i 've seen it a lot . "
" yeah , you 're probably right , " he replied .
" but it 's been so long since i 've seen it , i keep remembering the script rather than the finished film ! "
tourists still travel to pennan to find the film 's red telephone box .
at the end the screening , forsyth took a bow in front of a clearly enraptured audience , and agreed that , actually , his best-loved movie was , as everyone has been telling him for years , " pretty good " .
the evening was rounded off by live music from inspiration , whose line-up includes two key members of the ace tones - the fictional band seen performing in local hero - who still sound as toe-tapping as ever .
then , everyone stumbled out onto the beach to watch a riotous firework display which lit up the sky like the northern lights which first dazzled mac all those years ago .
as the festivities ended , i took the opportunity to fulfil a lifelong , and frankly reckless , ambition .
throwing caution to the wind i strode out along the seafront proudly blaring that theme from local hero on my latest musical acquisition - a set of bagpipes .
whether my pipe playing has made it into the finished piece which goes out on the culture show tonight i 'm not sure - perhaps it only sounded lovely in my head .
but the magic and celebration of bill forsyth 's long overdue cinematic homecoming is there for all to see , a fitting tribute to one of the greatest and most enduring movies ever made .
the culture show is on tuesdays at 2200gmt on bbc two .

please turn on javascript .
media requires javascript to play .
dicaprio on being tortured on camera eight years ago , leonardo dicaprio was in rome to shoot gangs of new york , his first of four collaborations with acclaimed film director martin scorsese .
it was there that the actor witnessed what he describes as the " debacle " of george w bush 's electoral victory over former vice-president al gore .
two weeks ago , he was back in the city for the italian premiere of his latest film body of lies , and stayed up all night to see barack obama named america 's next commander-in-chief .
" it was an overwhelming , resounding victory , " smiles the actor and environmentalist , who celebrated his 34th birthday on 11 november .
" i could n't be more excited .
" it 's up to our country now to support him in every way we can , " adds the oscar-nominated star of the aviator , blood diamond and the departed .
' profound ' " i think the rest of the world has been looking for somebody as the head of the united states to manifest some real changes . "
after travelling across europe to promote body of lies , a complex thriller about a covert cia agent operating in the middle east , the actor said he had found the reaction to obama 's triumph particularly gratifying .
body of lies sees him share the screen with actor russell crowe -lrb- left -rrb- " it 's beautiful to see how supportive the rest of the world has been , " he explains .
" it 's been more profound than i ever could have imagined . "
ten years ago , when dicaprio was still basking in his post-titanic fame , it is hard to imagine his opinions on the us presidency would have been as repeatedly courted as they were during his recent visit to london .
back then , the hollywood-born actor was better known for his late-night carousing and romantic dalliances than for any political insights he might offer .
but in the past decade , the erstwhile pin-up has effectively reinvented himself as a respected actor of note who has worked with some of the industry 's most revered film-makers .
' stressful ' he has used his celebrity to campaign tirelessly for environmental issues , most notably as producer and narrator of 2007 documentary the 11th hour .
" he 's come into his own , " agrees british director sir ridley scott , who sought out dicaprio to play body of lies ' conflicted hero roger ferris .
" he 's come to full maturity with great success .
dicaprio will soon be appearing with winslet -lrb- right -rrb- in revolutionary road " he 's one of the biggest stars in the united states , he 's a fantastic actor and the girls still love him . "
ask dicaprio how he feels about the screaming hordes who flocked to the film 's recent uk premiere , however , and you get a qualified response .
" most of the time it 's an out-of-body experience , " he shrugs .
" it 's fantastic to get a reaction like that , but it feels like it 's another person sometimes . "
he dismisses the notion that his character 's undercover activities in body of lies - which also stars russell crowe as the cynical cia veteran who supervises ferris from afar - echo with his own profession .
" the level of angst roger goes through and the life-and-death situations that are put in front of him are nothing like my life , " he grins .
" as much as the decisions i have to make can be stressful at times , it 's something i could never compare myself to . "
' comfortable ' with the film awards season fast approaching , dicaprio is already being touted as a potential nominee .
it is not his performance in body of lies that has provoked speculation , though , but his upcoming role as a young husband and father in 1950s drama revolutionary road .
dicaprio and winslet previously acted together in 1997 blockbuster titanic based on the novel by the late richard yates , the bbc co-production sees him reunited with kate winslet for the first time since their 1997 blockbuster titanic .
how did dicaprio find working with the british actress again , this time under the watchful eye of her director husband sam mendes ?
" sam made it very comfortable for both of us , " he says .
" but kate and i are such good friends that it felt very natural anyway .
" of course , we both knew all the stuff that would come with us working together again .
" but we said to ourselves , you know what ?
we love to work with each other , we love the material - let 's not let anything get in the way of that . "
body of lies is out in the uk on 21 november .
revolutionary road will be released on 30 january 2009 .

dicaprio on being tortured on camera eight years ago , leonardo dicaprio was in rome to shoot gangs of new york , his first of four collaborations with acclaimed film director martin scorsese .
it was there that the actor witnessed what he describes as the " debacle " of george w bush 's electoral victory over former vice-president al gore .
two weeks ago , he was back in the city for the italian premiere of his latest film body of lies , and stayed up all night to see barack obama named america 's next commander-in-chief .
" it was an overwhelming , resounding victory , " smiles the actor and environmentalist , who celebrated his 34th birthday on 11 november .
" i could n't be more excited .
" it 's up to our country now to support him in every way we can , " adds the oscar-nominated star of the aviator , blood diamond and the departed .
' profound ' " i think the rest of the world has been looking for somebody as the head of the united states to manifest some real changes . "
after travelling across europe to promote body of lies , a complex thriller about a covert cia agent operating in the middle east , the actor said he had found the reaction to obama 's triumph particularly gratifying .
body of lies sees him share the screen with actor russell crowe -lrb- left -rrb- " it 's beautiful to see how supportive the rest of the world has been , " he explains .
" it 's been more profound than i ever could have imagined . "
ten years ago , when dicaprio was still basking in his post-titanic fame , it is hard to imagine his opinions on the us presidency would have been as repeatedly courted as they were during his recent visit to london .
back then , the hollywood-born actor was better known for his late-night carousing and romantic dalliances than for any political insights he might offer .
but in the past decade , the erstwhile pin-up has effectively reinvented himself as a respected actor of note who has worked with some of the industry 's most revered film-makers .
' stressful ' he has used his celebrity to campaign tirelessly for environmental issues , most notably as producer and narrator of 2007 documentary the 11th hour .
" he 's come into his own , " agrees british director sir ridley scott , who sought out dicaprio to play body of lies ' conflicted hero roger ferris .
" he 's come to full maturity with great success .
dicaprio will soon be appearing with winslet -lrb- right -rrb- in revolutionary road " he 's one of the biggest stars in the united states , he 's a fantastic actor and the girls still love him . "
ask dicaprio how he feels about the screaming hordes who flocked to the film 's recent uk premiere , however , and you get a qualified response .
" most of the time it 's an out-of-body experience , " he shrugs .
" it 's fantastic to get a reaction like that , but it feels like it 's another person sometimes . "
he dismisses the notion that his character 's undercover activities in body of lies - which also stars russell crowe as the cynical cia veteran who supervises ferris from afar - echo with his own profession .
" the level of angst roger goes through and the life-and-death situations that are put in front of him are nothing like my life , " he grins .
" as much as the decisions i have to make can be stressful at times , it 's something i could never compare myself to . "

please turn on javascript .
media requires javascript to play .
dicaprio on being tortured on camera eight years ago , leonardo dicaprio was in rome to shoot gangs of new york , his first of four collaborations with acclaimed film director martin scorsese .
it was there that the actor witnessed what he describes as the " debacle " of george w bush 's electoral victory over former vice-president al gore .
two weeks ago , he was back in the city for the italian premiere of his latest film body of lies , and stayed up all night to see barack obama named america 's next commander-in-chief .
" it was an overwhelming , resounding victory , " smiles the actor and environmentalist , who celebrated his 34th birthday on 11 november .
" i could n't be more excited .
" it 's up to our country now to support him in every way we can , " adds the oscar-nominated star of the aviator , blood diamond and the departed .
' profound ' " i think the rest of the world has been looking for somebody as the head of the united states to manifest some real changes . "
after travelling across europe to promote body of lies , a complex thriller about a covert cia agent operating in the middle east , the actor said he had found the reaction to obama 's triumph particularly gratifying .
body of lies sees him share the screen with actor russell crowe -lrb- left -rrb- " it 's beautiful to see how supportive the rest of the world has been , " he explains .
" it 's been more profound than i ever could have imagined . "
ten years ago , when dicaprio was still basking in his post-titanic fame , it is hard to imagine his opinions on the us presidency would have been as repeatedly courted as they were during his recent visit to london .
back then , the hollywood-born actor was better known for his late-night carousing and romantic dalliances than for any political insights he might offer .
but in the past decade , the erstwhile pin-up has effectively reinvented himself as a respected actor of note who has worked with some of the industry 's most revered film-makers .
' stressful ' he has used his celebrity to campaign tirelessly for environmental issues , most notably as producer and narrator of 2007 documentary the 11th hour .
" he 's come into his own , " agrees british director sir ridley scott , who sought out dicaprio to play body of lies ' conflicted hero roger ferris .
" he 's come to full maturity with great success .
dicaprio will soon be appearing with winslet -lrb- right -rrb- in revolutionary road " he 's one of the biggest stars in the united states , he 's a fantastic actor and the girls still love him . "
ask dicaprio how he feels about the screaming hordes who flocked to the film 's recent uk premiere , however , and you get a qualified response .
" most of the time it 's an out-of-body experience , " he shrugs .
" it 's fantastic to get a reaction like that , but it feels like it 's another person sometimes . "
he dismisses the notion that his character 's undercover activities in body of lies - which also stars russell crowe as the cynical cia veteran who supervises ferris from afar - echo with his own profession .
" the level of angst roger goes through and the life-and-death situations that are put in front of him are nothing like my life , " he grins .
" as much as the decisions i have to make can be stressful at times , it 's something i could never compare myself to . "
' comfortable ' with the film awards season fast approaching , dicaprio is already being touted as a potential nominee .
it is not his performance in body of lies that has provoked speculation , though , but his upcoming role as a young husband and father in 1950s drama revolutionary road .
dicaprio and winslet previously acted together in 1997 blockbuster titanic based on the novel by the late richard yates , the bbc co-production sees him reunited with kate winslet for the first time since their 1997 blockbuster titanic .
how did dicaprio find working with the british actress again , this time under the watchful eye of her director husband sam mendes ?
" sam made it very comfortable for both of us , " he says .
" but kate and i are such good friends that it felt very natural anyway .
" of course , we both knew all the stuff that would come with us working together again .
" but we said to ourselves , you know what ?
we love to work with each other , we love the material - let 's not let anything get in the way of that . "
body of lies is out in the uk on 21 november .
revolutionary road will be released on 30 january 2009 .

the company 's founder charles dunstone wants to break up carphone warehouse as part of an overhaul of the company .
he said the firm was at a " watershed " and announced a corporate review .
the comments came as the company reported an interim net profit of £ 39m -lrb- $ 58.7m -rrb- for the six months to 27 october , down from £ 44m a year earlier .
formal review mr dunstone said : " we recognise that the structure of the group may now no longer be appropriate for the optimal development of the two businesses .
" the board has therefore initiated a formal review of the group 's corporate structure and capital requirements , which may lead to a separation of the two businesses . "
an update on the review 's progress will be made in spring 2009 .
the move comes six months after carphone sold a 50 % stake in its retail business to us electronics firm best buy for £ 1.1bn.
" all in all , 2008 has to date proved a transitional year for carphone warehouse , " said keith bowman , equity analyst at hargreaves lansdown stockbrokers .
" the growth in consumer spending which carphone has benefited from has now evaporated , although the group has gained significant economies of scale via its joint venture with us electrical retailing giant best buy . "

cast members imelda staunton and sir derek jacobi were there to greet them .
the film , which stars burt reynolds as a washed-up hollywood actor , was chosen last month to replace original choice harry potter and the half-blood prince .

it followed the cancellation of last year 's event , called off amid controversy surrounding the chosen film brick lane .

" i have never met her before , " said the former miss moneypenny on monday .
" we discussed the chilliness of filming on the isle of man in february . "
proceeds from the royal film performance go toward the cinema and television benevolent fund , which helps employees in the film and tv industry in times of hardship .
chief executive peter hore said the film , to be released in the uk in december , was " a feel-good movie " that would be " a classic movie after tonight " .
the event , he said , was " a really important night for british cinema .
it 's the only day the queen comes to the cinema in the west end . "
other guests at the screening , held at the odeon leicester square , included actress tamsin grieg and private eye editor ian hislop , one of the film 's screenwriters .

advertisement the queen met members of the film 's cast and crew at the event british comedy a bunch of amateurs received the regal seal of approval at the royal film performance , attended by the queen and prince philip in london .
cast members imelda staunton and sir derek jacobi were there to greet them .
the film , which stars burt reynolds as a washed-up hollywood actor , was chosen last month to replace original choice harry potter and the half-blood prince .
this year 's gala was thrown into doubt when the sixth potter film delayed its release until next summer .
it followed the cancellation of last year 's event , called off amid controversy surrounding the chosen film brick lane .

proceeds from the royal film performance go toward the cinema and television benevolent fund , which helps employees in the film and tv industry in times of hardship .
chief executive peter hore said the film , to be released in the uk in december , was " a feel-good movie " that would be " a classic movie after tonight " .
