the best hoaxes always have a ring of authenticity , and " from the fringe " knows that nowhere is the weird and wonderful more likely to be true than here in germany .
reality can still beat april fool 's pranks every time . according to bavarian media reports , the state government is finally to free up funds to complete the famously unfinished neuschwanstein castle built for king ludwig ii 125 years ago , but put on hold when public coffers ran empty . wolfsburg , apparently , is in talks with the deutsche bundesbank to commemorate the city 's 70th birthday with a limited edition 70 euro note . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coming soon to a plate near you in berlin , state finance minister thilo sarrazin suggested the cash-strapped capital make a fast buck by selling a few of the city zoo 's animals to chefs . " guests would come from as far away as japan and pay a small fortune for a taste of -lrb- world-famous polar bear -rrb- knut carpaccio with five spices powder and lovage jelly , " said celebrity chef tim raue . education authorities in lower saxony , meanwhile , have issued a warning about the risks of exposure to chalk dust faced by over-worked high school students . " now that high school students are required to graduate in eight instead of nine years , the increased concentration of chalk in the classroom is exacerbating cases of neurodermatitis and asthma , " said the authority in a press release dated april 1 . the mood was equally frisky in the western german state of north rhine-westphalia on tuesday , where traffic police revealed that they would be taking ballet classes with professional dancers in order to improve their coordination .
the office issued an announcement predicting that the plan " will help distract motorists from the bleak reality of traffic jams and reduce stress . " swedish furniture retail chain ikea got in on the act with the announcement of germany 's first drive-in store in berlin , where visitors will be able to place orders from behind the driver 's seat , sit back while staff members load the furniture into the trunk and enjoy a snack for just 10 euros -lrb- $ 15 -rrb- extra . looking foolish bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german obsession with nudity is hard to believe even dw-world.de was taken in by the german bookshop owner , who last week announced plans for a naked launch party in his shop for a forthcoming book about nudism . helmut maass admitted tuesday to german news service dpa that the invitation had been an april fool 's joke , after some 30 television , radio and newspaper reporters applied to attend the event . but even though no public reading - clothed or otherwise - was to take place tuesday , maass really is selling a book in his shop in the eastern town of pasewalk about the nudist minority in formerly communist east germany .
it draws on recollections - and indeed photographs - of holidaymakers in east germany before the berlin wall came down in 1989 . the region 's nudist movement has undergone a notable revival in recent years - and a dw-world.de story about a travel agent in the eastern city of erfurt introducing nude charter flights this summer to the baltic island resort of usedom is , believe it or not , definitely true . truth stranger than fiction the strangest story in the papers tuesday was also the honest-to-goodness truth - proving that the abundance of jaw-dropping stories in germany makes april 1 pretty superfluous . in fact , the media 's pranks seem somewhat sober in comparison to some of the real-life reports doing the rounds . take this tale of the 33-year-old woman allegedly suing doctors in the central german town of kassel after she checked in to have wrinkles removed and woke up with a new pair of breasts . " i had lost 100 kilos on a diet and wanted a tummy tuck , " she said . but when she came to after the operation she found doctors had put two 200 gram silicone implants into her breasts , increasing their size from a c cup to a d. you could n't make it up . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de east germany 's fascination with flesh gets more exposure a new book detailing east germany 's passion for nudity is set to be launched in typically candid style just weeks after a documentary exposed the communist regime 's secret porn industry .
-lrb- 28.03.2008 -rrb- german newspaper says it was duped by pro-smoker employer a hamburg-based newspaper that reported last week about a computer company manager who said he had fired non-smokers now says the whole issue was a hoax .

" the decision only applies in eu countries with gay partnership laws and it will be up to the national courts to decide " whether a surviving life partner is in a situation comparable to that of a spouse , " the court said in a statement . the lesbian and gay federation in germany welcomed the ruling .

german law grants legal rights to life partners that are similar to those of married couples .
gay marriage , however , is not recognized in germany . the eu commission welcomed tuesday 's ruling as " strengthening the principle of non-discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation , " while emphasizing that it was up to bloc 's 27 members to decide whether they would grant registered same-sex partners the same rights as married couples .

two mega-banks , swiss bank ubs and germany 's deutsche bank , announced fresh asset write-downs amounting to billions of euros . germany 's biggest bank announced tuesday , april 1 , that it will write down an estimated 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.9 billion -rrb- in its first quarter .
deutsche bank blamed bad loans in the housing sector and noted that conditions in international financial markets had become " significantly more challenging " in recent weeks . the announcement did not come as a complete surprise .
deutsche bank had warned last week it might miss 2008 earning targets . bad news , good timing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ubs is hoping for a sunnier future but deutsche bank 's bad news was dwarfed by that of swiss banking giant ubs , which announced it will write down 12 billion euros for the first three months of 2008 . " deutsche bank took advantage of the timing , coming on the heels of ubs so as not to have to rattle the market a second time , " said heino ruland , analyst at frankfurtfinanz told reuters . with tuesday 's announcement , usb had the dubious distinction of being the bank which has taken the worst hit from the us subprime mortgage crisis . ubs facing more red ink ubs chairman marcel ospel , seen by many as the man responsible for leading the bank into disastrous us subprime mortgages , announced his resignation tuesday . " i ultimately take responsibility for the bank 's situation , " ospel said in a statement . ubs 's new write-downs come on top of $ 18.4 billion the bank had written down in 2007 , bringing the bank 's total write-downs to $ 37.4 billion .
usb will turn to its shareholders to raise another 15 billion swiss francs -lrb- 9.5 billion euros , $ 14.8 billion -rrb- to shore up its financial base . the worst is over ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutschen bank 's josef ackermann in happier times while ubs finished last year in the red , deutsche bank posted a pretax profit of 8.7 billion euros in 2007 .
deutsche bank had hoped to post an 8.4 billion euro profit in 2008 , but said that might not happen . several public german banks are also among those hit hardest by the subprime crisis , with business lender ikb only surviving with help from the government and public savings banks , and regional bank sachenlb rescued by lbbw . yet there 's a sense among analysts that the worst might be over , and that optimism could be seen in the european stock market tuesday .
there was a sense that the banks are addressing the problems and a hope that the worst of the announcements might be over , peter dixon , an economist at commerzbank , told reuters news agency . " the one saving grace in this is that banks are acting quickly to highlight their exposure , " dixon said .
" the quicker the bad news is out in the open , then the quicker we can start to repair the problems . " but some analysts say the banking sector could face further problems and that european banks will face a lot of competition for funds when trying to rebuild their capital . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" deutsche bank took advantage of the timing , coming on the heels of ubs so as not to have to rattle the market a second time , " said heino ruland , analyst at frankfurtfinanz told reuters . with tuesday 's announcement , usb had the dubious distinction of being the bank which has taken the worst hit from the us subprime mortgage crisis . ubs facing more red ink ubs chairman marcel ospel , seen by many as the man responsible for leading the bank into disastrous us subprime mortgages , announced his resignation tuesday . " i ultimately take responsibility for the bank 's situation , " ospel said in a statement . ubs 's new write-downs come on top of $ 18.4 billion the bank had written down in 2007 , bringing the bank 's total write-downs to $ 37.4 billion .
usb will turn to its shareholders to raise another 15 billion swiss francs -lrb- 9.5 billion euros , $ 14.8 billion -rrb- to shore up its financial base . the worst is over ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutschen bank 's josef ackermann in happier times while ubs finished last year in the red , deutsche bank posted a pretax profit of 8.7 billion euros in 2007 .
deutsche bank had hoped to post an 8.4 billion euro profit in 2008 , but said that might not happen . several public german banks are also among those hit hardest by the subprime crisis , with business lender ikb only surviving with help from the government and public savings banks , and regional bank sachenlb rescued by lbbw . yet there 's a sense among analysts that the worst might be over , and that optimism could be seen in the european stock market tuesday .
there was a sense that the banks are addressing the problems and a hope that the worst of the announcements might be over , peter dixon , an economist at commerzbank , told reuters news agency . " the one saving grace in this is that banks are acting quickly to highlight their exposure , " dixon said .
" the quicker the bad news is out in the open , then the quicker we can start to repair the problems .

the election commission -lrb- zec -rrb- is counting with at an excessively leisurely pace .
this nourishes the suspicion that the results are being manipulated behind the scenes in order to secure another term in office for president robert mugabe . the opposition movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- sees itself as in the lead .
as does the ruling zanu-pf party .
an independent review is not possible .
nevertheless it seems extremely unlikely that mugabe would have managed convince a majority of zimbabweans to re-elect him .
he has managed to push the country 's economy over the brink .
chaos , scarcity and hyperinflation of more than 100,000 percent each year do n't create ideal election advertisements . in the run-up to the elections , human rights organizations , including amnesty international and human rights watch , complained of arbitrary arrests , one-sided media reports and government vote buying .
a free and just election was impossible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : johannes beck only friendly states such as china , russia , iran and neighboring african countries were allowed to send election monitors .
the involvement of southern african development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- countries remains a frustration , as does the lack of criticism from democratic neighboring countries such as mozambique .
joaquim chissano , the former president of mozambique , told deutsche welle that he has no right to question the intentions of other leaders .
and zimbabwe 's president insists that this election was free , transparent and lawful . chissano 's mindset is typical of the kind that allows african politicians to speaking out about the human rights abuses and poor governance of neighboring countries .
this practice of looking the other way and holding one 's tongue is a false understanding of african solidarity . growth and development require the ability to criticize and take criticism .
there are some examples of this in africa , such as the african peer review mechanism .
but , far too often , reflexes persist from the time of the common struggles against european colonial powers . during conversations with africans on this topic , one often hears that european governments have a double standard .
they are only interested in democracy when it fits their interests , africans say . and this is where africans are right .
zimbabwe 's former colonial power , great britain , only brought up the subject of human rights after british farmers lost their land .
there were very few protests from the west when , in the early 1980s , robert mugabe killed tens of thousands of opposition members in the matebeleland region . the discussions about mugabe 's participation in the eu-africa summit held in lisbon in december 2007 were also misguided .
at the same time as they were condemning mugabe , not a single european leader spoke out against libyan dictator moammar gadhafi 's summit attendance .
at least there are still elections in zimbabwe , something that the libyan opposition ca n't even dream about . european governments will likely criticize the elections in zimbabwe as neither free nor fair , as they should .
they should increase pressure and advocate for more democracy . but europeans must then live up to their own high standards , even when there are n't white farmers involved .

the government and opposition had been locked in weeks of feuding over the lisbon treaty , which replaces the failed eu constitution . the document has to be ratified by all 27 eu member states if it is to take effect by the 2009 target . there were worries that poland , which nearly derailed earlier european treaty negotiations , would vote it down .
in poland , the treaty required approval from two-thirds of parliamentarians to pass , and the euro-skeptic law and justice party had expressed strong reservations . conservative support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-eu parties needed a supermajority but in the end , the law and justice party threw their support behind the treaty .
liberal prime minister donald tusk and president lech kaczynski worked out a compromise two days before the vote and then jointly campaigned for their followers to go along .
all told , 384 members of parliament voted in favor of the treaty and 56 voted against it . as part of the compromise , tusk agreed to start working on new legislation that would amend the divisions of power between the president , government and parliament . kaczynski and tusk hailed the treaty as good news for both poland and europe . " poland needs europe and europe needs poland , " tusk said , quoting polish pope john paul ii . while ratification is now largely assured , the senate is set to consider the bill on wednesday and could approve it the same day .
it will then go back to kaczynski for final approval . the treaty , adopted by eu leaders in december , is designed to streamline the way the bloc is run .
it has already been ratified by lawmakers in bulgaria , france , hungary , malta , romania and slovenia . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the government and opposition had been locked in weeks of feuding over the lisbon treaty , which replaces the failed eu constitution . the document has to be ratified by all 27 eu member states if it is to take effect by the 2009 target . there were worries that poland , which nearly derailed earlier european treaty negotiations , would vote it down .
in poland , the treaty required approval from two-thirds of parliamentarians to pass , and the euro-skeptic law and justice party had expressed strong reservations . conservative support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-eu parties needed a supermajority but in the end , the law and justice party threw their support behind the treaty .
liberal prime minister donald tusk and president lech kaczynski worked out a compromise two days before the vote and then jointly campaigned for their followers to go along .
all told , 384 members of parliament voted in favor of the treaty and 56 voted against it . as part of the compromise , tusk agreed to start working on new legislation that would amend the divisions of power between the president , government and parliament . kaczynski and tusk hailed the treaty as good news for both poland and europe . " poland needs europe and europe needs poland , " tusk said , quoting polish pope john paul ii . while ratification is now largely assured , the senate is set to consider the bill on wednesday and could approve it the same day .
it will then go back to kaczynski for final approval . the treaty , adopted by eu leaders in december , is designed to streamline the way the bloc is run .
it has already been ratified by lawmakers in bulgaria , france , hungary , malta , romania and slovenia . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the election commission -lrb- zec -rrb- is counting with at an excessively leisurely pace .
this nourishes the suspicion that the results are being manipulated behind the scenes in order to secure another term in office for president robert mugabe . the opposition movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- sees itself as in the lead .
as does the ruling zanu-pf party .
an independent review is not possible .
nevertheless it seems extremely unlikely that mugabe would have managed convince a majority of zimbabweans to re-elect him .
he has managed to push the country 's economy over the brink .
chaos , scarcity and hyperinflation of more than 100,000 percent each year do n't create ideal election advertisements . in the run-up to the elections , human rights organizations , including amnesty international and human rights watch , complained of arbitrary arrests , one-sided media reports and government vote buying .
a free and just election was impossible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : johannes beck only friendly states such as china , russia , iran and neighboring african countries were allowed to send election monitors .
the involvement of southern african development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- countries remains a frustration , as does the lack of criticism from democratic neighboring countries such as mozambique .
joaquim chissano , the former president of mozambique , told deutsche welle that he has no right to question the intentions of other leaders .
and zimbabwe 's president insists that this election was free , transparent and lawful . chissano 's mindset is typical of the kind that allows african politicians to speaking out about the human rights abuses and poor governance of neighboring countries .
this practice of looking the other way and holding one 's tongue is a false understanding of african solidarity . growth and development require the ability to criticize and take criticism .
there are some examples of this in africa , such as the african peer review mechanism .
but , far too often , reflexes persist from the time of the common struggles against european colonial powers . during conversations with africans on this topic , one often hears that european governments have a double standard .
they are only interested in democracy when it fits their interests , africans say . and this is where africans are right .
zimbabwe 's former colonial power , great britain , only brought up the subject of human rights after british farmers lost their land .
there were very few protests from the west when , in the early 1980s , robert mugabe killed tens of thousands of opposition members in the matebeleland region . the discussions about mugabe 's participation in the eu-africa summit held in lisbon in december 2007 were also misguided .
at the same time as they were condemning mugabe , not a single european leader spoke out against libyan dictator moammar gadhafi 's summit attendance .
at least there are still elections in zimbabwe , something that the libyan opposition ca n't even dream about . european governments will likely criticize the elections in zimbabwe as neither free nor fair , as they should .
they should increase pressure and advocate for more democracy . but europeans must then live up to their own high standards , even when there are n't white farmers involved .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 01.04.2008 to stay in the game , more german stadiums going corporate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cash coming in for the stuttgart stadium 's new name will go toward a facelift stuttgart 's soccer stadium is becoming the mercedes benz arena .
it 's another example of the corporate rechristening of german stadiums that brings in cash for players or facility spruce-ups , but it has some crying foul . what 's in a name , after all ? when it comes to german stadiums , a lot of serious fans would say a lot .
there is tradition , the relationship with the fans , and the primacy of the sport over commerce . but those concerns appear to be falling on deaf ears as the trend of german stadiums selling their naming rights to corporations in multi-million-euro deals continues unabated . in the latest , carmaker daimler , stuttgart 's mayor and the head of the vfb stuttgart soccer club announced on monday , march 31 , that the city 's gottlieb daimler stadium will be renamed after the mercedes luxury automobile .
daimler bought the stadium 's naming rights for 23 million euros -lrb- $ 36 million -rrb- , according to the daily die welt . the club will use the money to cover most of its portion of a 66-million-euro stadium renovation , which will turn it from a mixed-use venue with track-and-field facilities to an arena solely dedicated to germany 's number one sport : soccer . slow rumble , then the avalanche vfb stuttgart is not breaking any new ground by changing its stadium 's name to that of a large company .
the trend in germany began in 1997 , when the city of fuerth 's ronhof sports park became playmobile stadium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bayarena stadium was germany 's second to get a new moniker two years later , leverkusen 's stadium was rebaptized the bayarena and then in 2001 , hamburg 's volksparkstadion got a new identity as the aol arena . since then , the process has accelerated , with at least one-half of the stadiums home to first-division teams getting new signage with names like commerzbank , insurer generali , or brewer veltins . " you can be sure that the stadiums that do n't currently have a commercial name are in negotiations about one now , " said maik thesing of the stadium web site stadionwelt-business.de. needed cash seen from the business side , a powerful corporate sponsor willing to write a big check to get its name on a building brings many benefits .
when teams or communities build new stadiums , selling the naming rights to companies with deep pockets can often take care of the largest part of their expenses , such as was the case with munich 's allianz arena . bildunterschrift : the allianz arena name was n't as controversial - it was never known as anything else if the stadium already exists , a new name can bring money into team coffers , money that can be used to renovate the facility , or , perhaps most importantly , fund expensive transfer fees to buy skilled players off other teams or pay the high salaries top talent requires .
average personnel costs for german league clubs were 29.5 million euros in the 2006-07 season . " if you want to survive on the international level , you have to buy in the best players , " said benedikt roemmelt , a sports economist at the institute for sports science in jena .
" if a german club ca n't afford to stay on the same financial level as , for example , an english club , then the german club does n't have a chance . " what a stadium gets for changing its name depends on its location and the reputation of its home club .
generali agreed to pay 400,000 euros a year to rename a stadium in the munich suburb of unterhaching , commerzbank is paying 3 million euros a year in frankfurt , and allianz pays 6 million euros annually to have its name on the new , architecturally significant arena in munich , home to bayern munich , one of germany 's top clubs . selling-out ? despite the benefits , many fans take a dimmer view as what many see as a corporate sell-out and the further commercialization of sport .
most renaming plans in germany have been accompanied by protest actions by fans . after hamburg 's stadium was renamed aol arena , fans brought a banner to matches that read " volkspark stadium forever ! " referring to its original identity .
in nuremberg , many were outraged when a local bank bought the naming rights to frankenstadion in 2006 and it became easycredit stadium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fans feel commercial interests are getting the upper hand " can nothing stop the commercialization of sports ?
can these financial sharks do anything they want ? " asked one irate individual in a fan club forum .
" what 's next , renaming nuremberg easycredit city ? " one fan group held a symbolic name change of its own , calling the facility max morlock stadium after a local soccer hero .
that name has proven much more popular . some media organizations have also refused to go along .
the daily westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung refuses to use the new names in its headlines , calling them " linguistic monsters " and not wanting to participate in what the paper calls " product placement .

it 's another example of the corporate rechristening of german stadiums that brings in cash for players or facility spruce-ups , but it has some crying foul . what 's in a name , after all ? when it comes to german stadiums , a lot of serious fans would say a lot .
there is tradition , the relationship with the fans , and the primacy of the sport over commerce . but those concerns appear to be falling on deaf ears as the trend of german stadiums selling their naming rights to corporations in multi-million-euro deals continues unabated . in the latest , carmaker daimler , stuttgart 's mayor and the head of the vfb stuttgart soccer club announced on monday , march 31 , that the city 's gottlieb daimler stadium will be renamed after the mercedes luxury automobile .
daimler bought the stadium 's naming rights for 23 million euros -lrb- $ 36 million -rrb- , according to the daily die welt . the club will use the money to cover most of its portion of a 66-million-euro stadium renovation , which will turn it from a mixed-use venue with track-and-field facilities to an arena solely dedicated to germany 's number one sport : soccer . slow rumble , then the avalanche vfb stuttgart is not breaking any new ground by changing its stadium 's name to that of a large company .
the trend in germany began in 1997 , when the city of fuerth 's ronhof sports park became playmobile stadium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bayarena stadium was germany 's second to get a new moniker two years later , leverkusen 's stadium was rebaptized the bayarena and then in 2001 , hamburg 's volksparkstadion got a new identity as the aol arena . since then , the process has accelerated , with at least one-half of the stadiums home to first-division teams getting new signage with names like commerzbank , insurer generali , or brewer veltins . " you can be sure that the stadiums that do n't currently have a commercial name are in negotiations about one now , " said maik thesing of the stadium web site stadionwelt-business.de. needed cash seen from the business side , a powerful corporate sponsor willing to write a big check to get its name on a building brings many benefits .
when teams or communities build new stadiums , selling the naming rights to companies with deep pockets can often take care of the largest part of their expenses , such as was the case with munich 's allianz arena . bildunterschrift : the allianz arena name was n't as controversial - it was never known as anything else if the stadium already exists , a new name can bring money into team coffers , money that can be used to renovate the facility , or , perhaps most importantly , fund expensive transfer fees to buy skilled players off other teams or pay the high salaries top talent requires .
average personnel costs for german league clubs were 29.5 million euros in the 2006-07 season . " if you want to survive on the international level , you have to buy in the best players , " said benedikt roemmelt , a sports economist at the institute for sports science in jena .
" if a german club ca n't afford to stay on the same financial level as , for example , an english club , then the german club does n't have a chance . " what a stadium gets for changing its name depends on its location and the reputation of its home club .
generali agreed to pay 400,000 euros a year to rename a stadium in the munich suburb of unterhaching , commerzbank is paying 3 million euros a year in frankfurt , and allianz pays 6 million euros annually to have its name on the new , architecturally significant arena in munich , home to bayern munich , one of germany 's top clubs . selling-out ? despite the benefits , many fans take a dimmer view as what many see as a corporate sell-out and the further commercialization of sport .
most renaming plans in germany have been accompanied by protest actions by fans . after hamburg 's stadium was renamed aol arena , fans brought a banner to matches that read " volkspark stadium forever ! " referring to its original identity .
in nuremberg , many were outraged when a local bank bought the naming rights to frankenstadion in 2006 and it became easycredit stadium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fans feel commercial interests are getting the upper hand " can nothing stop the commercialization of sports ?
can these financial sharks do anything they want ? " asked one irate individual in a fan club forum .
" what 's next , renaming nuremberg easycredit city ? " one fan group held a symbolic name change of its own , calling the facility max morlock stadium after a local soccer hero .
that name has proven much more popular . some media organizations have also refused to go along .

it 's another example of the corporate rechristening of german stadiums that brings in cash for players or facility spruce-ups , but it has some crying foul . what 's in a name , after all ? when it comes to german stadiums , a lot of serious fans would say a lot .
there is tradition , the relationship with the fans , and the primacy of the sport over commerce . but those concerns appear to be falling on deaf ears as the trend of german stadiums selling their naming rights to corporations in multi-million-euro deals continues unabated . in the latest , carmaker daimler , stuttgart 's mayor and the head of the vfb stuttgart soccer club announced on monday , march 31 , that the city 's gottlieb daimler stadium will be renamed after the mercedes luxury automobile .
daimler bought the stadium 's naming rights for 23 million euros -lrb- $ 36 million -rrb- , according to the daily die welt . the club will use the money to cover most of its portion of a 66-million-euro stadium renovation , which will turn it from a mixed-use venue with track-and-field facilities to an arena solely dedicated to germany 's number one sport : soccer . slow rumble , then the avalanche vfb stuttgart is not breaking any new ground by changing its stadium 's name to that of a large company .
the trend in germany began in 1997 , when the city of fuerth 's ronhof sports park became playmobile stadium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bayarena stadium was germany 's second to get a new moniker two years later , leverkusen 's stadium was rebaptized the bayarena and then in 2001 , hamburg 's volksparkstadion got a new identity as the aol arena . since then , the process has accelerated , with at least one-half of the stadiums home to first-division teams getting new signage with names like commerzbank , insurer generali , or brewer veltins . " you can be sure that the stadiums that do n't currently have a commercial name are in negotiations about one now , " said maik thesing of the stadium web site stadionwelt-business.de. needed cash seen from the business side , a powerful corporate sponsor willing to write a big check to get its name on a building brings many benefits .
when teams or communities build new stadiums , selling the naming rights to companies with deep pockets can often take care of the largest part of their expenses , such as was the case with munich 's allianz arena . bildunterschrift : the allianz arena name was n't as controversial - it was never known as anything else if the stadium already exists , a new name can bring money into team coffers , money that can be used to renovate the facility , or , perhaps most importantly , fund expensive transfer fees to buy skilled players off other teams or pay the high salaries top talent requires .
average personnel costs for german league clubs were 29.5 million euros in the 2006-07 season . " if you want to survive on the international level , you have to buy in the best players , " said benedikt roemmelt , a sports economist at the institute for sports science in jena .
" if a german club ca n't afford to stay on the same financial level as , for example , an english club , then the german club does n't have a chance . " what a stadium gets for changing its name depends on its location and the reputation of its home club .
generali agreed to pay 400,000 euros a year to rename a stadium in the munich suburb of unterhaching , commerzbank is paying 3 million euros a year in frankfurt , and allianz pays 6 million euros annually to have its name on the new , architecturally significant arena in munich , home to bayern munich , one of germany 's top clubs . selling-out ? despite the benefits , many fans take a dimmer view as what many see as a corporate sell-out and the further commercialization of sport .
most renaming plans in germany have been accompanied by protest actions by fans . after hamburg 's stadium was renamed aol arena , fans brought a banner to matches that read " volkspark stadium forever ! " referring to its original identity .
in nuremberg , many were outraged when a local bank bought the naming rights to frankenstadion in 2006 and it became easycredit stadium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fans feel commercial interests are getting the upper hand " can nothing stop the commercialization of sports ?
can these financial sharks do anything they want ? " asked one irate individual in a fan club forum .
" what 's next , renaming nuremberg easycredit city ? " one fan group held a symbolic name change of its own , calling the facility max morlock stadium after a local soccer hero .
that name has proven much more popular . some media organizations have also refused to go along .
the daily westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung refuses to use the new names in its headlines , calling them " linguistic monsters " and not wanting to participate in what the paper calls " product placement . " matter of getting used to but this trend toward new and sometimes temporary identities - hamburg 's renamed aol arena has been renamed again and is now hsh nordbank arena - appears to be going strong .
although according to sports economist roemmelt , because so many stadium operators want to get in on the corporate game , the amounts they can charge for naming rights is going down somewhat . and not every fan is against the practice , if it 's seen as bringing benefits .
mark friedrich , who is on the board of the fan club stuttgarter junxx , says he has n't heard that much negative reaction to the new mercedes-benz-arena , especially since the new money will cover a renovation project that will bring fans ' seats closer to the action on the field . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since mercedes is a home-town company , the renaming has n't ruffled as many feathers in stuttgart " we do n't want commercial interests to completely take over , but we do n't see that happening here , " he said .
" besides , mercedes has its home base here in stuttgart . " thesing of stadionwelt-business.de said he thinks there will likely be less furor in the future as the marketing of everything in sports , stadiums included , becomes more common , and finally accepted .
he pointed out that advertisements on jerseys and the advertising banners surrounding the soccer pitch have been around for decades and are not even registered by most fans these days . " a stadium renaming that 's happened in the past five years is still noticed , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 01.04.2008 opinion : zimbabwe 's election puts europe to the test großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while european governments should criticize the flawed elections in zimbabwe , they should also examine their double standards , says deutsche welle 's johannes beck . the first results have begun slowly trickling out of zimbabwe 's capital , harare .
the election commission -lrb- zec -rrb- is counting with at an excessively leisurely pace .
this nourishes the suspicion that the results are being manipulated behind the scenes in order to secure another term in office for president robert mugabe . the opposition movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- sees itself as in the lead .
as does the ruling zanu-pf party .
an independent review is not possible .
nevertheless it seems extremely unlikely that mugabe would have managed convince a majority of zimbabweans to re-elect him .
he has managed to push the country 's economy over the brink .
chaos , scarcity and hyperinflation of more than 100,000 percent each year do n't create ideal election advertisements . in the run-up to the elections , human rights organizations , including amnesty international and human rights watch , complained of arbitrary arrests , one-sided media reports and government vote buying .
a free and just election was impossible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : johannes beck only friendly states such as china , russia , iran and neighboring african countries were allowed to send election monitors .
the involvement of southern african development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- countries remains a frustration , as does the lack of criticism from democratic neighboring countries such as mozambique .
joaquim chissano , the former president of mozambique , told deutsche welle that he has no right to question the intentions of other leaders .
and zimbabwe 's president insists that this election was free , transparent and lawful . chissano 's mindset is typical of the kind that allows african politicians to speaking out about the human rights abuses and poor governance of neighboring countries .
this practice of looking the other way and holding one 's tongue is a false understanding of african solidarity . growth and development require the ability to criticize and take criticism .
there are some examples of this in africa , such as the african peer review mechanism .
but , far too often , reflexes persist from the time of the common struggles against european colonial powers . during conversations with africans on this topic , one often hears that european governments have a double standard .
they are only interested in democracy when it fits their interests , africans say . and this is where africans are right .
zimbabwe 's former colonial power , great britain , only brought up the subject of human rights after british farmers lost their land .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 01.04.2008 eu 's invitation to dalai lama incenses china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beijing accuses the dalai lama of attempting to split tibet from china after protests by tibetan monks in lhasa and other groups supporting tibetan independence , the eu is to invite the dalai lama to brussels , french foreign minister bernard kouchner said tuesday .
china is furious . kouchner told rtl radio tuesday , april 1 , that he and the bloc 's other 26 foreign ministers will formally invite the dalai lama once a final decision has been made by slovenia , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency . " it sounds like a do-able idea , but this has to be discussed , " slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel told several journalists at the european parliament in brussels .
" to invite the dalai lama , certainly that would be a great honor , a great event .
the dalai lama is a very important religious leader . " neither kouchner nor rupel suggested a date for the proposed meeting . hans-gert poettering , the president of the european parliament has already invited the dalai lama to speak to the assembly in strasbourg , france . outrage in china bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people around the world , including a baby in frankfurt , showed support for the monks chinese state media said china had voiced " strong dissatisfaction " after the eu foreign ministers ' statement . chinese authorities are claiming that the dalai lama 's followers orchestrated the unrest that broke out in the himalayan region last month , when peaceful marches by tibetan monks turned violent .
exiled tibetans currently put the death toll from the chinese crackdown at up to 140 , with another 1000 injured and many detained . beijing strongly opposes talks between the dalai lama and foreign government officials and was angered by his meeting last september with german chancellor angela merkel . " we oppose his separatist activities , " chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman jiang yu told reporters on tuesday .
" we oppose any officials of foreign countries providing support for the separatist activities by the dalai lama . " the government reiterated tuesday that it opposed foreign nations providing support to what it believes is the dalai lama 's attempts to split tibet from china , reacting to reports that he may go to japan and europe . " the tibet issue is completely china 's internal affair , " jiang yu said , according to xinhua news agency .
" no foreign countries or international organizations have the right to interfere in it . " suicide squad accusations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests last month extended to nepal in a recent dramatic statement by beijing in its offensive against the dalai lama , tibetan independence forces were accused of planning to deploy " suicide squads " to carry out bloody attacks . " to our knowledge , the next plan of the tibetan independence forces is to organize suicide squads to launch violent attacks , " said public security bureau spokesman wu heping at a news conference tuesday , without giving details of the alleged suicide squads . he said police had arrested an individual who he claimed was an operative of the " dalai lama clique , " responsible for gathering intelligence and distributing pamphlets calling for an uprising . wu also maintained that searches of monasteries had turned up large numbers of weapons . rebuttals call for proof tibetan authorities quickly dismissed the chinese allegations and asked beijing for evidence . the india-based tibetan government-in-exile said the claims were propaganda and reiterated the tibetan spiritual leader the dalai lama was not opposed to beijing hosting the olympics games in the summer . " instead of making baseless accusations , they , the chinese government , need to give evidence in support of what they say , " thubten samphel , spokesman of the tibetan government-in-exile , told afp . speaking by telephone from northern hill town of dharamshala , where the tibetan administration is headquartered , he said buddhists see suicide as the " worst form of crime " " our struggle is non-violent and suicide attacks are unheard of in buddhism .
we believe the human form the most precious form on earth and such unsubstantiated claims do no service either to the chinese or the tibetan people , " samphel said . iconic figure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us called the dalai lama " a man of peace " the dalai lama , who won the nobel peace prize in 1989 , has repeatedly denied orchestrating the unrest and spoke out against the protests as soon as they turned violent in the restive region 's capital lhasa in march .
he has always said he wants greater autonomy for tibet under chinese rule , but also an end to repression there . nearly six decades after the himalayan region was occupied by china , the dalai lama is widely seen as an iconic figure representing the tibetan people on the world stage . he has lived in exile in india since fleeing tibet in 1959 following a failed uprising against chinese rule . the us on tuesday also rejected china 's charges that the spiritual leader would back suicide attacks and called on the chinese to engage in dialog with the dalai lama . " the dalai lama is a man of peace , " us state department deputy spokesman tom casey told reporters .
" there 's absolutely no indication that he wants to do anything other than have a dialogue with china to discuss how to deal with some of the serious issues there .

the best hoaxes always have a ring of authenticity , and " from the fringe " knows that nowhere is the weird and wonderful more likely to be true than here in germany .
reality can still beat april fool 's pranks every time . according to bavarian media reports , the state government is finally to free up funds to complete the famously unfinished neuschwanstein castle built for king ludwig ii 125 years ago , but put on hold when public coffers ran empty . wolfsburg , apparently , is in talks with the deutsche bundesbank to commemorate the city 's 70th birthday with a limited edition 70 euro note . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coming soon to a plate near you in berlin , state finance minister thilo sarrazin suggested the cash-strapped capital make a fast buck by selling a few of the city zoo 's animals to chefs . " guests would come from as far away as japan and pay a small fortune for a taste of -lrb- world-famous polar bear -rrb- knut carpaccio with five spices powder and lovage jelly , " said celebrity chef tim raue . education authorities in lower saxony , meanwhile , have issued a warning about the risks of exposure to chalk dust faced by over-worked high school students . " now that high school students are required to graduate in eight instead of nine years , the increased concentration of chalk in the classroom is exacerbating cases of neurodermatitis and asthma , " said the authority in a press release dated april 1 . the mood was equally frisky in the western german state of north rhine-westphalia on tuesday , where traffic police revealed that they would be taking ballet classes with professional dancers in order to improve their coordination .
the office issued an announcement predicting that the plan " will help distract motorists from the bleak reality of traffic jams and reduce stress . " swedish furniture retail chain ikea got in on the act with the announcement of germany 's first drive-in store in berlin , where visitors will be able to place orders from behind the driver 's seat , sit back while staff members load the furniture into the trunk and enjoy a snack for just 10 euros -lrb- $ 15 -rrb- extra . looking foolish bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german obsession with nudity is hard to believe even dw-world.de was taken in by the german bookshop owner , who last week announced plans for a naked launch party in his shop for a forthcoming book about nudism . helmut maass admitted tuesday to german news service dpa that the invitation had been an april fool 's joke , after some 30 television , radio and newspaper reporters applied to attend the event . but even though no public reading - clothed or otherwise - was to take place tuesday , maass really is selling a book in his shop in the eastern town of pasewalk about the nudist minority in formerly communist east germany .
it draws on recollections - and indeed photographs - of holidaymakers in east germany before the berlin wall came down in 1989 . the region 's nudist movement has undergone a notable revival in recent years - and a dw-world.de story about a travel agent in the eastern city of erfurt introducing nude charter flights this summer to the baltic island resort of usedom is , believe it or not , definitely true . truth stranger than fiction the strangest story in the papers tuesday was also the honest-to-goodness truth - proving that the abundance of jaw-dropping stories in germany makes april 1 pretty superfluous . in fact , the media 's pranks seem somewhat sober in comparison to some of the real-life reports doing the rounds . take this tale of the 33-year-old woman allegedly suing doctors in the central german town of kassel after she checked in to have wrinkles removed and woke up with a new pair of breasts . " i had lost 100 kilos on a diet and wanted a tummy tuck , " she said . but when she came to after the operation she found doctors had put two 200 gram silicone implants into her breasts , increasing their size from a c cup to a d. you could n't make it up . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 01.04.2008 to stay in the game , more german stadiums going corporate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cash coming in for the stuttgart stadium 's new name will go toward a facelift stuttgart 's soccer stadium is becoming the mercedes benz arena .
it 's another example of the corporate rechristening of german stadiums that brings in cash for players or facility spruce-ups , but it has some crying foul . what 's in a name , after all ? when it comes to german stadiums , a lot of serious fans would say a lot .
there is tradition , the relationship with the fans , and the primacy of the sport over commerce . but those concerns appear to be falling on deaf ears as the trend of german stadiums selling their naming rights to corporations in multi-million-euro deals continues unabated . in the latest , carmaker daimler , stuttgart 's mayor and the head of the vfb stuttgart soccer club announced on monday , march 31 , that the city 's gottlieb daimler stadium will be renamed after the mercedes luxury automobile .
daimler bought the stadium 's naming rights for 23 million euros -lrb- $ 36 million -rrb- , according to the daily die welt . the club will use the money to cover most of its portion of a 66-million-euro stadium renovation , which will turn it from a mixed-use venue with track-and-field facilities to an arena solely dedicated to germany 's number one sport : soccer . slow rumble , then the avalanche vfb stuttgart is not breaking any new ground by changing its stadium 's name to that of a large company .
the trend in germany began in 1997 , when the city of fuerth 's ronhof sports park became playmobile stadium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bayarena stadium was germany 's second to get a new moniker two years later , leverkusen 's stadium was rebaptized the bayarena and then in 2001 , hamburg 's volksparkstadion got a new identity as the aol arena . since then , the process has accelerated , with at least one-half of the stadiums home to first-division teams getting new signage with names like commerzbank , insurer generali , or brewer veltins . " you can be sure that the stadiums that do n't currently have a commercial name are in negotiations about one now , " said maik thesing of the stadium web site stadionwelt-business.de. needed cash seen from the business side , a powerful corporate sponsor willing to write a big check to get its name on a building brings many benefits .
when teams or communities build new stadiums , selling the naming rights to companies with deep pockets can often take care of the largest part of their expenses , such as was the case with munich 's allianz arena . bildunterschrift : the allianz arena name was n't as controversial - it was never known as anything else if the stadium already exists , a new name can bring money into team coffers , money that can be used to renovate the facility , or , perhaps most importantly , fund expensive transfer fees to buy skilled players off other teams or pay the high salaries top talent requires .
average personnel costs for german league clubs were 29.5 million euros in the 2006-07 season . " if you want to survive on the international level , you have to buy in the best players , " said benedikt roemmelt , a sports economist at the institute for sports science in jena .
" if a german club ca n't afford to stay on the same financial level as , for example , an english club , then the german club does n't have a chance . " what a stadium gets for changing its name depends on its location and the reputation of its home club .
generali agreed to pay 400,000 euros a year to rename a stadium in the munich suburb of unterhaching , commerzbank is paying 3 million euros a year in frankfurt , and allianz pays 6 million euros annually to have its name on the new , architecturally significant arena in munich , home to bayern munich , one of germany 's top clubs . selling-out ? despite the benefits , many fans take a dimmer view as what many see as a corporate sell-out and the further commercialization of sport .
most renaming plans in germany have been accompanied by protest actions by fans . after hamburg 's stadium was renamed aol arena , fans brought a banner to matches that read " volkspark stadium forever ! " referring to its original identity .
in nuremberg , many were outraged when a local bank bought the naming rights to frankenstadion in 2006 and it became easycredit stadium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fans feel commercial interests are getting the upper hand " can nothing stop the commercialization of sports ?
can these financial sharks do anything they want ? " asked one irate individual in a fan club forum .
" what 's next , renaming nuremberg easycredit city ? " one fan group held a symbolic name change of its own , calling the facility max morlock stadium after a local soccer hero .
that name has proven much more popular . some media organizations have also refused to go along .
the daily westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung refuses to use the new names in its headlines , calling them " linguistic monsters " and not wanting to participate in what the paper calls " product placement . " matter of getting used to but this trend toward new and sometimes temporary identities - hamburg 's renamed aol arena has been renamed again and is now hsh nordbank arena - appears to be going strong .
although according to sports economist roemmelt , because so many stadium operators want to get in on the corporate game , the amounts they can charge for naming rights is going down somewhat . and not every fan is against the practice , if it 's seen as bringing benefits .
mark friedrich , who is on the board of the fan club stuttgarter junxx , says he has n't heard that much negative reaction to the new mercedes-benz-arena , especially since the new money will cover a renovation project that will bring fans ' seats closer to the action on the field . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since mercedes is a home-town company , the renaming has n't ruffled as many feathers in stuttgart " we do n't want commercial interests to completely take over , but we do n't see that happening here , " he said .
" besides , mercedes has its home base here in stuttgart . " thesing of stadionwelt-business.de said he thinks there will likely be less furor in the future as the marketing of everything in sports , stadiums included , becomes more common , and finally accepted .
he pointed out that advertisements on jerseys and the advertising banners surrounding the soccer pitch have been around for decades and are not even registered by most fans these days . " a stadium renaming that 's happened in the past five years is still noticed , " he said .
" but in 20 years , it 's likely no one find it objectionable . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 01.04.2008 to stay in the game , more german stadiums going corporate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cash coming in for the stuttgart stadium 's new name will go toward a facelift stuttgart 's soccer stadium is becoming the mercedes benz arena .
it 's another example of the corporate rechristening of german stadiums that brings in cash for players or facility spruce-ups , but it has some crying foul . what 's in a name , after all ? when it comes to german stadiums , a lot of serious fans would say a lot .
there is tradition , the relationship with the fans , and the primacy of the sport over commerce . but those concerns appear to be falling on deaf ears as the trend of german stadiums selling their naming rights to corporations in multi-million-euro deals continues unabated . in the latest , carmaker daimler , stuttgart 's mayor and the head of the vfb stuttgart soccer club announced on monday , march 31 , that the city 's gottlieb daimler stadium will be renamed after the mercedes luxury automobile .
daimler bought the stadium 's naming rights for 23 million euros -lrb- $ 36 million -rrb- , according to the daily die welt . the club will use the money to cover most of its portion of a 66-million-euro stadium renovation , which will turn it from a mixed-use venue with track-and-field facilities to an arena solely dedicated to germany 's number one sport : soccer . slow rumble , then the avalanche vfb stuttgart is not breaking any new ground by changing its stadium 's name to that of a large company .
the trend in germany began in 1997 , when the city of fuerth 's ronhof sports park became playmobile stadium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bayarena stadium was germany 's second to get a new moniker two years later , leverkusen 's stadium was rebaptized the bayarena and then in 2001 , hamburg 's volksparkstadion got a new identity as the aol arena . since then , the process has accelerated , with at least one-half of the stadiums home to first-division teams getting new signage with names like commerzbank , insurer generali , or brewer veltins . " you can be sure that the stadiums that do n't currently have a commercial name are in negotiations about one now , " said maik thesing of the stadium web site stadionwelt-business.de. needed cash seen from the business side , a powerful corporate sponsor willing to write a big check to get its name on a building brings many benefits .
when teams or communities build new stadiums , selling the naming rights to companies with deep pockets can often take care of the largest part of their expenses , such as was the case with munich 's allianz arena . bildunterschrift : the allianz arena name was n't as controversial - it was never known as anything else if the stadium already exists , a new name can bring money into team coffers , money that can be used to renovate the facility , or , perhaps most importantly , fund expensive transfer fees to buy skilled players off other teams or pay the high salaries top talent requires .
average personnel costs for german league clubs were 29.5 million euros in the 2006-07 season . " if you want to survive on the international level , you have to buy in the best players , " said benedikt roemmelt , a sports economist at the institute for sports science in jena .
" if a german club ca n't afford to stay on the same financial level as , for example , an english club , then the german club does n't have a chance . " what a stadium gets for changing its name depends on its location and the reputation of its home club .
generali agreed to pay 400,000 euros a year to rename a stadium in the munich suburb of unterhaching , commerzbank is paying 3 million euros a year in frankfurt , and allianz pays 6 million euros annually to have its name on the new , architecturally significant arena in munich , home to bayern munich , one of germany 's top clubs . selling-out ? despite the benefits , many fans take a dimmer view as what many see as a corporate sell-out and the further commercialization of sport .
most renaming plans in germany have been accompanied by protest actions by fans . after hamburg 's stadium was renamed aol arena , fans brought a banner to matches that read " volkspark stadium forever ! " referring to its original identity .
in nuremberg , many were outraged when a local bank bought the naming rights to frankenstadion in 2006 and it became easycredit stadium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fans feel commercial interests are getting the upper hand " can nothing stop the commercialization of sports ?
can these financial sharks do anything they want ? " asked one irate individual in a fan club forum .
" what 's next , renaming nuremberg easycredit city ? " one fan group held a symbolic name change of its own , calling the facility max morlock stadium after a local soccer hero .
that name has proven much more popular . some media organizations have also refused to go along .
the daily westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung refuses to use the new names in its headlines , calling them " linguistic monsters " and not wanting to participate in what the paper calls " product placement . " matter of getting used to but this trend toward new and sometimes temporary identities - hamburg 's renamed aol arena has been renamed again and is now hsh nordbank arena - appears to be going strong .
although according to sports economist roemmelt , because so many stadium operators want to get in on the corporate game , the amounts they can charge for naming rights is going down somewhat . and not every fan is against the practice , if it 's seen as bringing benefits .
mark friedrich , who is on the board of the fan club stuttgarter junxx , says he has n't heard that much negative reaction to the new mercedes-benz-arena , especially since the new money will cover a renovation project that will bring fans ' seats closer to the action on the field . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since mercedes is a home-town company , the renaming has n't ruffled as many feathers in stuttgart " we do n't want commercial interests to completely take over , but we do n't see that happening here , " he said .
" besides , mercedes has its home base here in stuttgart . " thesing of stadionwelt-business.de said he thinks there will likely be less furor in the future as the marketing of everything in sports , stadiums included , becomes more common , and finally accepted .
he pointed out that advertisements on jerseys and the advertising banners surrounding the soccer pitch have been around for decades and are not even registered by most fans these days . " a stadium renaming that 's happened in the past five years is still noticed , " he said .
" but in 20 years , it 's likely no one find it objectionable . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 01.04.2008 opinion : zimbabwe 's election puts europe to the test großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while european governments should criticize the flawed elections in zimbabwe , they should also examine their double standards , says deutsche welle 's johannes beck . the first results have begun slowly trickling out of zimbabwe 's capital , harare .
the election commission -lrb- zec -rrb- is counting with at an excessively leisurely pace .
this nourishes the suspicion that the results are being manipulated behind the scenes in order to secure another term in office for president robert mugabe . the opposition movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- sees itself as in the lead .
as does the ruling zanu-pf party .
an independent review is not possible .
nevertheless it seems extremely unlikely that mugabe would have managed convince a majority of zimbabweans to re-elect him .
he has managed to push the country 's economy over the brink .
chaos , scarcity and hyperinflation of more than 100,000 percent each year do n't create ideal election advertisements . in the run-up to the elections , human rights organizations , including amnesty international and human rights watch , complained of arbitrary arrests , one-sided media reports and government vote buying .
a free and just election was impossible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : johannes beck only friendly states such as china , russia , iran and neighboring african countries were allowed to send election monitors .
the involvement of southern african development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- countries remains a frustration , as does the lack of criticism from democratic neighboring countries such as mozambique .
joaquim chissano , the former president of mozambique , told deutsche welle that he has no right to question the intentions of other leaders .
and zimbabwe 's president insists that this election was free , transparent and lawful . chissano 's mindset is typical of the kind that allows african politicians to speaking out about the human rights abuses and poor governance of neighboring countries .
this practice of looking the other way and holding one 's tongue is a false understanding of african solidarity . growth and development require the ability to criticize and take criticism .
there are some examples of this in africa , such as the african peer review mechanism .
but , far too often , reflexes persist from the time of the common struggles against european colonial powers . during conversations with africans on this topic , one often hears that european governments have a double standard .
they are only interested in democracy when it fits their interests , africans say . and this is where africans are right .
zimbabwe 's former colonial power , great britain , only brought up the subject of human rights after british farmers lost their land .
there were very few protests from the west when , in the early 1980s , robert mugabe killed tens of thousands of opposition members in the matebeleland region . the discussions about mugabe 's participation in the eu-africa summit held in lisbon in december 2007 were also misguided .
at the same time as they were condemning mugabe , not a single european leader spoke out against libyan dictator moammar gadhafi 's summit attendance .
at least there are still elections in zimbabwe , something that the libyan opposition ca n't even dream about . european governments will likely criticize the elections in zimbabwe as neither free nor fair , as they should .
they should increase pressure and advocate for more democracy . but europeans must then live up to their own high standards , even when there are n't white farmers involved .
let 's not forget that other african countries , such as libya , gambia and ethiopia also have poor track records in the areas of democracy , human rights and freedom of speech . johannes beck is the deputy head of dw-radio 's africa desk and heads the dw-radio portuguese service -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 01.04.2008 to stay in the game , more german stadiums going corporate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cash coming in for the stuttgart stadium 's new name will go toward a facelift stuttgart 's soccer stadium is becoming the mercedes benz arena .
it 's another example of the corporate rechristening of german stadiums that brings in cash for players or facility spruce-ups , but it has some crying foul . what 's in a name , after all ? when it comes to german stadiums , a lot of serious fans would say a lot .
there is tradition , the relationship with the fans , and the primacy of the sport over commerce . but those concerns appear to be falling on deaf ears as the trend of german stadiums selling their naming rights to corporations in multi-million-euro deals continues unabated . in the latest , carmaker daimler , stuttgart 's mayor and the head of the vfb stuttgart soccer club announced on monday , march 31 , that the city 's gottlieb daimler stadium will be renamed after the mercedes luxury automobile .
daimler bought the stadium 's naming rights for 23 million euros -lrb- $ 36 million -rrb- , according to the daily die welt . the club will use the money to cover most of its portion of a 66-million-euro stadium renovation , which will turn it from a mixed-use venue with track-and-field facilities to an arena solely dedicated to germany 's number one sport : soccer . slow rumble , then the avalanche vfb stuttgart is not breaking any new ground by changing its stadium 's name to that of a large company .
the trend in germany began in 1997 , when the city of fuerth 's ronhof sports park became playmobile stadium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bayarena stadium was germany 's second to get a new moniker two years later , leverkusen 's stadium was rebaptized the bayarena and then in 2001 , hamburg 's volksparkstadion got a new identity as the aol arena . since then , the process has accelerated , with at least one-half of the stadiums home to first-division teams getting new signage with names like commerzbank , insurer generali , or brewer veltins . " you can be sure that the stadiums that do n't currently have a commercial name are in negotiations about one now , " said maik thesing of the stadium web site stadionwelt-business.de. needed cash seen from the business side , a powerful corporate sponsor willing to write a big check to get its name on a building brings many benefits .
when teams or communities build new stadiums , selling the naming rights to companies with deep pockets can often take care of the largest part of their expenses , such as was the case with munich 's allianz arena . bildunterschrift : the allianz arena name was n't as controversial - it was never known as anything else if the stadium already exists , a new name can bring money into team coffers , money that can be used to renovate the facility , or , perhaps most importantly , fund expensive transfer fees to buy skilled players off other teams or pay the high salaries top talent requires .
average personnel costs for german league clubs were 29.5 million euros in the 2006-07 season . " if you want to survive on the international level , you have to buy in the best players , " said benedikt roemmelt , a sports economist at the institute for sports science in jena .
" if a german club ca n't afford to stay on the same financial level as , for example , an english club , then the german club does n't have a chance . " what a stadium gets for changing its name depends on its location and the reputation of its home club .
generali agreed to pay 400,000 euros a year to rename a stadium in the munich suburb of unterhaching , commerzbank is paying 3 million euros a year in frankfurt , and allianz pays 6 million euros annually to have its name on the new , architecturally significant arena in munich , home to bayern munich , one of germany 's top clubs . selling-out ? despite the benefits , many fans take a dimmer view as what many see as a corporate sell-out and the further commercialization of sport .
most renaming plans in germany have been accompanied by protest actions by fans . after hamburg 's stadium was renamed aol arena , fans brought a banner to matches that read " volkspark stadium forever ! " referring to its original identity .
in nuremberg , many were outraged when a local bank bought the naming rights to frankenstadion in 2006 and it became easycredit stadium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fans feel commercial interests are getting the upper hand " can nothing stop the commercialization of sports ?
can these financial sharks do anything they want ? " asked one irate individual in a fan club forum .
" what 's next , renaming nuremberg easycredit city ? " one fan group held a symbolic name change of its own , calling the facility max morlock stadium after a local soccer hero .
that name has proven much more popular . some media organizations have also refused to go along .
the daily westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung refuses to use the new names in its headlines , calling them " linguistic monsters " and not wanting to participate in what the paper calls " product placement . " matter of getting used to but this trend toward new and sometimes temporary identities - hamburg 's renamed aol arena has been renamed again and is now hsh nordbank arena - appears to be going strong .
although according to sports economist roemmelt , because so many stadium operators want to get in on the corporate game , the amounts they can charge for naming rights is going down somewhat . and not every fan is against the practice , if it 's seen as bringing benefits .

it 's another example of the corporate rechristening of german stadiums that brings in cash for players or facility spruce-ups , but it has some crying foul . what 's in a name , after all ? when it comes to german stadiums , a lot of serious fans would say a lot .
there is tradition , the relationship with the fans , and the primacy of the sport over commerce . but those concerns appear to be falling on deaf ears as the trend of german stadiums selling their naming rights to corporations in multi-million-euro deals continues unabated . in the latest , carmaker daimler , stuttgart 's mayor and the head of the vfb stuttgart soccer club announced on monday , march 31 , that the city 's gottlieb daimler stadium will be renamed after the mercedes luxury automobile .
daimler bought the stadium 's naming rights for 23 million euros -lrb- $ 36 million -rrb- , according to the daily die welt . the club will use the money to cover most of its portion of a 66-million-euro stadium renovation , which will turn it from a mixed-use venue with track-and-field facilities to an arena solely dedicated to germany 's number one sport : soccer . slow rumble , then the avalanche vfb stuttgart is not breaking any new ground by changing its stadium 's name to that of a large company .
the trend in germany began in 1997 , when the city of fuerth 's ronhof sports park became playmobile stadium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bayarena stadium was germany 's second to get a new moniker two years later , leverkusen 's stadium was rebaptized the bayarena and then in 2001 , hamburg 's volksparkstadion got a new identity as the aol arena . since then , the process has accelerated , with at least one-half of the stadiums home to first-division teams getting new signage with names like commerzbank , insurer generali , or brewer veltins . " you can be sure that the stadiums that do n't currently have a commercial name are in negotiations about one now , " said maik thesing of the stadium web site stadionwelt-business.de. needed cash seen from the business side , a powerful corporate sponsor willing to write a big check to get its name on a building brings many benefits .
when teams or communities build new stadiums , selling the naming rights to companies with deep pockets can often take care of the largest part of their expenses , such as was the case with munich 's allianz arena . bildunterschrift : the allianz arena name was n't as controversial - it was never known as anything else if the stadium already exists , a new name can bring money into team coffers , money that can be used to renovate the facility , or , perhaps most importantly , fund expensive transfer fees to buy skilled players off other teams or pay the high salaries top talent requires .
average personnel costs for german league clubs were 29.5 million euros in the 2006-07 season . " if you want to survive on the international level , you have to buy in the best players , " said benedikt roemmelt , a sports economist at the institute for sports science in jena .
" if a german club ca n't afford to stay on the same financial level as , for example , an english club , then the german club does n't have a chance . " what a stadium gets for changing its name depends on its location and the reputation of its home club .
generali agreed to pay 400,000 euros a year to rename a stadium in the munich suburb of unterhaching , commerzbank is paying 3 million euros a year in frankfurt , and allianz pays 6 million euros annually to have its name on the new , architecturally significant arena in munich , home to bayern munich , one of germany 's top clubs . selling-out ? despite the benefits , many fans take a dimmer view as what many see as a corporate sell-out and the further commercialization of sport .
most renaming plans in germany have been accompanied by protest actions by fans . after hamburg 's stadium was renamed aol arena , fans brought a banner to matches that read " volkspark stadium forever ! " referring to its original identity .
in nuremberg , many were outraged when a local bank bought the naming rights to frankenstadion in 2006 and it became easycredit stadium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fans feel commercial interests are getting the upper hand " can nothing stop the commercialization of sports ?
can these financial sharks do anything they want ? " asked one irate individual in a fan club forum .
" what 's next , renaming nuremberg easycredit city ? " one fan group held a symbolic name change of its own , calling the facility max morlock stadium after a local soccer hero .
that name has proven much more popular . some media organizations have also refused to go along .
the daily westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung refuses to use the new names in its headlines , calling them " linguistic monsters " and not wanting to participate in what the paper calls " product placement . " matter of getting used to but this trend toward new and sometimes temporary identities - hamburg 's renamed aol arena has been renamed again and is now hsh nordbank arena - appears to be going strong .
although according to sports economist roemmelt , because so many stadium operators want to get in on the corporate game , the amounts they can charge for naming rights is going down somewhat . and not every fan is against the practice , if it 's seen as bringing benefits .
mark friedrich , who is on the board of the fan club stuttgarter junxx , says he has n't heard that much negative reaction to the new mercedes-benz-arena , especially since the new money will cover a renovation project that will bring fans ' seats closer to the action on the field . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since mercedes is a home-town company , the renaming has n't ruffled as many feathers in stuttgart " we do n't want commercial interests to completely take over , but we do n't see that happening here , " he said .

the election commission -lrb- zec -rrb- is counting with at an excessively leisurely pace .
this nourishes the suspicion that the results are being manipulated behind the scenes in order to secure another term in office for president robert mugabe . the opposition movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- sees itself as in the lead .
as does the ruling zanu-pf party .
an independent review is not possible .
nevertheless it seems extremely unlikely that mugabe would have managed convince a majority of zimbabweans to re-elect him .
he has managed to push the country 's economy over the brink .
chaos , scarcity and hyperinflation of more than 100,000 percent each year do n't create ideal election advertisements . in the run-up to the elections , human rights organizations , including amnesty international and human rights watch , complained of arbitrary arrests , one-sided media reports and government vote buying .
a free and just election was impossible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : johannes beck only friendly states such as china , russia , iran and neighboring african countries were allowed to send election monitors .
the involvement of southern african development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- countries remains a frustration , as does the lack of criticism from democratic neighboring countries such as mozambique .
joaquim chissano , the former president of mozambique , told deutsche welle that he has no right to question the intentions of other leaders .
and zimbabwe 's president insists that this election was free , transparent and lawful . chissano 's mindset is typical of the kind that allows african politicians to speaking out about the human rights abuses and poor governance of neighboring countries .
this practice of looking the other way and holding one 's tongue is a false understanding of african solidarity . growth and development require the ability to criticize and take criticism .
there are some examples of this in africa , such as the african peer review mechanism .
but , far too often , reflexes persist from the time of the common struggles against european colonial powers . during conversations with africans on this topic , one often hears that european governments have a double standard .
they are only interested in democracy when it fits their interests , africans say . and this is where africans are right .
zimbabwe 's former colonial power , great britain , only brought up the subject of human rights after british farmers lost their land .
there were very few protests from the west when , in the early 1980s , robert mugabe killed tens of thousands of opposition members in the matebeleland region . the discussions about mugabe 's participation in the eu-africa summit held in lisbon in december 2007 were also misguided .
at the same time as they were condemning mugabe , not a single european leader spoke out against libyan dictator moammar gadhafi 's summit attendance .
at least there are still elections in zimbabwe , something that the libyan opposition ca n't even dream about . european governments will likely criticize the elections in zimbabwe as neither free nor fair , as they should .
they should increase pressure and advocate for more democracy . but europeans must then live up to their own high standards , even when there are n't white farmers involved .
let 's not forget that other african countries , such as libya , gambia and ethiopia also have poor track records in the areas of democracy , human rights and freedom of speech . johannes beck is the deputy head of dw-radio 's africa desk and heads the dw-radio portuguese service -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the election commission -lrb- zec -rrb- is counting with at an excessively leisurely pace .
this nourishes the suspicion that the results are being manipulated behind the scenes in order to secure another term in office for president robert mugabe . the opposition movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- sees itself as in the lead .
as does the ruling zanu-pf party .
an independent review is not possible .
nevertheless it seems extremely unlikely that mugabe would have managed convince a majority of zimbabweans to re-elect him .
he has managed to push the country 's economy over the brink .
chaos , scarcity and hyperinflation of more than 100,000 percent each year do n't create ideal election advertisements . in the run-up to the elections , human rights organizations , including amnesty international and human rights watch , complained of arbitrary arrests , one-sided media reports and government vote buying .
a free and just election was impossible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : johannes beck only friendly states such as china , russia , iran and neighboring african countries were allowed to send election monitors .
the involvement of southern african development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- countries remains a frustration , as does the lack of criticism from democratic neighboring countries such as mozambique .
joaquim chissano , the former president of mozambique , told deutsche welle that he has no right to question the intentions of other leaders .
and zimbabwe 's president insists that this election was free , transparent and lawful . chissano 's mindset is typical of the kind that allows african politicians to speaking out about the human rights abuses and poor governance of neighboring countries .
this practice of looking the other way and holding one 's tongue is a false understanding of african solidarity . growth and development require the ability to criticize and take criticism .
there are some examples of this in africa , such as the african peer review mechanism .
but , far too often , reflexes persist from the time of the common struggles against european colonial powers . during conversations with africans on this topic , one often hears that european governments have a double standard .
they are only interested in democracy when it fits their interests , africans say . and this is where africans are right .
zimbabwe 's former colonial power , great britain , only brought up the subject of human rights after british farmers lost their land .
there were very few protests from the west when , in the early 1980s , robert mugabe killed tens of thousands of opposition members in the matebeleland region . the discussions about mugabe 's participation in the eu-africa summit held in lisbon in december 2007 were also misguided .

" deutsche bank took advantage of the timing , coming on the heels of ubs so as not to have to rattle the market a second time , " said heino ruland , analyst at frankfurtfinanz told reuters . with tuesday 's announcement , usb had the dubious distinction of being the bank which has taken the worst hit from the us subprime mortgage crisis . ubs facing more red ink ubs chairman marcel ospel , seen by many as the man responsible for leading the bank into disastrous us subprime mortgages , announced his resignation tuesday . " i ultimately take responsibility for the bank 's situation , " ospel said in a statement . ubs 's new write-downs come on top of $ 18.4 billion the bank had written down in 2007 , bringing the bank 's total write-downs to $ 37.4 billion .
usb will turn to its shareholders to raise another 15 billion swiss francs -lrb- 9.5 billion euros , $ 14.8 billion -rrb- to shore up its financial base . the worst is over ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutschen bank 's josef ackermann in happier times while ubs finished last year in the red , deutsche bank posted a pretax profit of 8.7 billion euros in 2007 .
deutsche bank had hoped to post an 8.4 billion euro profit in 2008 , but said that might not happen . several public german banks are also among those hit hardest by the subprime crisis , with business lender ikb only surviving with help from the government and public savings banks , and regional bank sachenlb rescued by lbbw . yet there 's a sense among analysts that the worst might be over , and that optimism could be seen in the european stock market tuesday .
there was a sense that the banks are addressing the problems and a hope that the worst of the announcements might be over , peter dixon , an economist at commerzbank , told reuters news agency . " the one saving grace in this is that banks are acting quickly to highlight their exposure , " dixon said .
" the quicker the bad news is out in the open , then the quicker we can start to repair the problems . " but some analysts say the banking sector could face further problems and that european banks will face a lot of competition for funds when trying to rebuild their capital . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

two mega-banks , swiss bank ubs and germany 's deutsche bank , announced fresh asset write-downs amounting to billions of euros . germany 's biggest bank announced tuesday , april 1 , that it will write down an estimated 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.9 billion -rrb- in its first quarter .
deutsche bank blamed bad loans in the housing sector and noted that conditions in international financial markets had become " significantly more challenging " in recent weeks . the announcement did not come as a complete surprise .
deutsche bank had warned last week it might miss 2008 earning targets . bad news , good timing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ubs is hoping for a sunnier future but deutsche bank 's bad news was dwarfed by that of swiss banking giant ubs , which announced it will write down 12 billion euros for the first three months of 2008 . " deutsche bank took advantage of the timing , coming on the heels of ubs so as not to have to rattle the market a second time , " said heino ruland , analyst at frankfurtfinanz told reuters . with tuesday 's announcement , usb had the dubious distinction of being the bank which has taken the worst hit from the us subprime mortgage crisis . ubs facing more red ink ubs chairman marcel ospel , seen by many as the man responsible for leading the bank into disastrous us subprime mortgages , announced his resignation tuesday . " i ultimately take responsibility for the bank 's situation , " ospel said in a statement . ubs 's new write-downs come on top of $ 18.4 billion the bank had written down in 2007 , bringing the bank 's total write-downs to $ 37.4 billion .
usb will turn to its shareholders to raise another 15 billion swiss francs -lrb- 9.5 billion euros , $ 14.8 billion -rrb- to shore up its financial base . the worst is over ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutschen bank 's josef ackermann in happier times while ubs finished last year in the red , deutsche bank posted a pretax profit of 8.7 billion euros in 2007 .
deutsche bank had hoped to post an 8.4 billion euro profit in 2008 , but said that might not happen . several public german banks are also among those hit hardest by the subprime crisis , with business lender ikb only surviving with help from the government and public savings banks , and regional bank sachenlb rescued by lbbw . yet there 's a sense among analysts that the worst might be over , and that optimism could be seen in the european stock market tuesday .
there was a sense that the banks are addressing the problems and a hope that the worst of the announcements might be over , peter dixon , an economist at commerzbank , told reuters news agency . " the one saving grace in this is that banks are acting quickly to highlight their exposure , " dixon said .
" the quicker the bad news is out in the open , then the quicker we can start to repair the problems . " but some analysts say the banking sector could face further problems and that european banks will face a lot of competition for funds when trying to rebuild their capital . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the best hoaxes always have a ring of authenticity , and " from the fringe " knows that nowhere is the weird and wonderful more likely to be true than here in germany .
reality can still beat april fool 's pranks every time . according to bavarian media reports , the state government is finally to free up funds to complete the famously unfinished neuschwanstein castle built for king ludwig ii 125 years ago , but put on hold when public coffers ran empty . wolfsburg , apparently , is in talks with the deutsche bundesbank to commemorate the city 's 70th birthday with a limited edition 70 euro note . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coming soon to a plate near you in berlin , state finance minister thilo sarrazin suggested the cash-strapped capital make a fast buck by selling a few of the city zoo 's animals to chefs . " guests would come from as far away as japan and pay a small fortune for a taste of -lrb- world-famous polar bear -rrb- knut carpaccio with five spices powder and lovage jelly , " said celebrity chef tim raue . education authorities in lower saxony , meanwhile , have issued a warning about the risks of exposure to chalk dust faced by over-worked high school students . " now that high school students are required to graduate in eight instead of nine years , the increased concentration of chalk in the classroom is exacerbating cases of neurodermatitis and asthma , " said the authority in a press release dated april 1 . the mood was equally frisky in the western german state of north rhine-westphalia on tuesday , where traffic police revealed that they would be taking ballet classes with professional dancers in order to improve their coordination .
the office issued an announcement predicting that the plan " will help distract motorists from the bleak reality of traffic jams and reduce stress . " swedish furniture retail chain ikea got in on the act with the announcement of germany 's first drive-in store in berlin , where visitors will be able to place orders from behind the driver 's seat , sit back while staff members load the furniture into the trunk and enjoy a snack for just 10 euros -lrb- $ 15 -rrb- extra . looking foolish bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german obsession with nudity is hard to believe even dw-world.de was taken in by the german bookshop owner , who last week announced plans for a naked launch party in his shop for a forthcoming book about nudism . helmut maass admitted tuesday to german news service dpa that the invitation had been an april fool 's joke , after some 30 television , radio and newspaper reporters applied to attend the event . but even though no public reading - clothed or otherwise - was to take place tuesday , maass really is selling a book in his shop in the eastern town of pasewalk about the nudist minority in formerly communist east germany .
it draws on recollections - and indeed photographs - of holidaymakers in east germany before the berlin wall came down in 1989 . the region 's nudist movement has undergone a notable revival in recent years - and a dw-world.de story about a travel agent in the eastern city of erfurt introducing nude charter flights this summer to the baltic island resort of usedom is , believe it or not , definitely true . truth stranger than fiction the strangest story in the papers tuesday was also the honest-to-goodness truth - proving that the abundance of jaw-dropping stories in germany makes april 1 pretty superfluous . in fact , the media 's pranks seem somewhat sober in comparison to some of the real-life reports doing the rounds . take this tale of the 33-year-old woman allegedly suing doctors in the central german town of kassel after she checked in to have wrinkles removed and woke up with a new pair of breasts . " i had lost 100 kilos on a diet and wanted a tummy tuck , " she said . but when she came to after the operation she found doctors had put two 200 gram silicone implants into her breasts , increasing their size from a c cup to a d. you could n't make it up . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's another example of the corporate rechristening of german stadiums that brings in cash for players or facility spruce-ups , but it has some crying foul . what 's in a name , after all ? when it comes to german stadiums , a lot of serious fans would say a lot .
there is tradition , the relationship with the fans , and the primacy of the sport over commerce . but those concerns appear to be falling on deaf ears as the trend of german stadiums selling their naming rights to corporations in multi-million-euro deals continues unabated . in the latest , carmaker daimler , stuttgart 's mayor and the head of the vfb stuttgart soccer club announced on monday , march 31 , that the city 's gottlieb daimler stadium will be renamed after the mercedes luxury automobile .
daimler bought the stadium 's naming rights for 23 million euros -lrb- $ 36 million -rrb- , according to the daily die welt . the club will use the money to cover most of its portion of a 66-million-euro stadium renovation , which will turn it from a mixed-use venue with track-and-field facilities to an arena solely dedicated to germany 's number one sport : soccer . slow rumble , then the avalanche vfb stuttgart is not breaking any new ground by changing its stadium 's name to that of a large company .
the trend in germany began in 1997 , when the city of fuerth 's ronhof sports park became playmobile stadium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bayarena stadium was germany 's second to get a new moniker two years later , leverkusen 's stadium was rebaptized the bayarena and then in 2001 , hamburg 's volksparkstadion got a new identity as the aol arena . since then , the process has accelerated , with at least one-half of the stadiums home to first-division teams getting new signage with names like commerzbank , insurer generali , or brewer veltins . " you can be sure that the stadiums that do n't currently have a commercial name are in negotiations about one now , " said maik thesing of the stadium web site stadionwelt-business.de. needed cash seen from the business side , a powerful corporate sponsor willing to write a big check to get its name on a building brings many benefits .
when teams or communities build new stadiums , selling the naming rights to companies with deep pockets can often take care of the largest part of their expenses , such as was the case with munich 's allianz arena . bildunterschrift : the allianz arena name was n't as controversial - it was never known as anything else if the stadium already exists , a new name can bring money into team coffers , money that can be used to renovate the facility , or , perhaps most importantly , fund expensive transfer fees to buy skilled players off other teams or pay the high salaries top talent requires .
average personnel costs for german league clubs were 29.5 million euros in the 2006-07 season . " if you want to survive on the international level , you have to buy in the best players , " said benedikt roemmelt , a sports economist at the institute for sports science in jena .
" if a german club ca n't afford to stay on the same financial level as , for example , an english club , then the german club does n't have a chance . " what a stadium gets for changing its name depends on its location and the reputation of its home club .
generali agreed to pay 400,000 euros a year to rename a stadium in the munich suburb of unterhaching , commerzbank is paying 3 million euros a year in frankfurt , and allianz pays 6 million euros annually to have its name on the new , architecturally significant arena in munich , home to bayern munich , one of germany 's top clubs . selling-out ? despite the benefits , many fans take a dimmer view as what many see as a corporate sell-out and the further commercialization of sport .
most renaming plans in germany have been accompanied by protest actions by fans . after hamburg 's stadium was renamed aol arena , fans brought a banner to matches that read " volkspark stadium forever ! " referring to its original identity .
in nuremberg , many were outraged when a local bank bought the naming rights to frankenstadion in 2006 and it became easycredit stadium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fans feel commercial interests are getting the upper hand " can nothing stop the commercialization of sports ?
can these financial sharks do anything they want ? " asked one irate individual in a fan club forum .
" what 's next , renaming nuremberg easycredit city ? " one fan group held a symbolic name change of its own , calling the facility max morlock stadium after a local soccer hero .
that name has proven much more popular . some media organizations have also refused to go along .
the daily westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung refuses to use the new names in its headlines , calling them " linguistic monsters " and not wanting to participate in what the paper calls " product placement . " matter of getting used to but this trend toward new and sometimes temporary identities - hamburg 's renamed aol arena has been renamed again and is now hsh nordbank arena - appears to be going strong .
although according to sports economist roemmelt , because so many stadium operators want to get in on the corporate game , the amounts they can charge for naming rights is going down somewhat . and not every fan is against the practice , if it 's seen as bringing benefits .
mark friedrich , who is on the board of the fan club stuttgarter junxx , says he has n't heard that much negative reaction to the new mercedes-benz-arena , especially since the new money will cover a renovation project that will bring fans ' seats closer to the action on the field . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since mercedes is a home-town company , the renaming has n't ruffled as many feathers in stuttgart " we do n't want commercial interests to completely take over , but we do n't see that happening here , " he said .

two mega-banks , swiss bank ubs and germany 's deutsche bank , announced fresh asset write-downs amounting to billions of euros . germany 's biggest bank announced tuesday , april 1 , that it will write down an estimated 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.9 billion -rrb- in its first quarter .
deutsche bank blamed bad loans in the housing sector and noted that conditions in international financial markets had become " significantly more challenging " in recent weeks . the announcement did not come as a complete surprise .
deutsche bank had warned last week it might miss 2008 earning targets . bad news , good timing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ubs is hoping for a sunnier future but deutsche bank 's bad news was dwarfed by that of swiss banking giant ubs , which announced it will write down 12 billion euros for the first three months of 2008 . " deutsche bank took advantage of the timing , coming on the heels of ubs so as not to have to rattle the market a second time , " said heino ruland , analyst at frankfurtfinanz told reuters . with tuesday 's announcement , usb had the dubious distinction of being the bank which has taken the worst hit from the us subprime mortgage crisis . ubs facing more red ink ubs chairman marcel ospel , seen by many as the man responsible for leading the bank into disastrous us subprime mortgages , announced his resignation tuesday . " i ultimately take responsibility for the bank 's situation , " ospel said in a statement . ubs 's new write-downs come on top of $ 18.4 billion the bank had written down in 2007 , bringing the bank 's total write-downs to $ 37.4 billion .
usb will turn to its shareholders to raise another 15 billion swiss francs -lrb- 9.5 billion euros , $ 14.8 billion -rrb- to shore up its financial base . the worst is over ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutschen bank 's josef ackermann in happier times while ubs finished last year in the red , deutsche bank posted a pretax profit of 8.7 billion euros in 2007 .
deutsche bank had hoped to post an 8.4 billion euro profit in 2008 , but said that might not happen . several public german banks are also among those hit hardest by the subprime crisis , with business lender ikb only surviving with help from the government and public savings banks , and regional bank sachenlb rescued by lbbw . yet there 's a sense among analysts that the worst might be over , and that optimism could be seen in the european stock market tuesday .
there was a sense that the banks are addressing the problems and a hope that the worst of the announcements might be over , peter dixon , an economist at commerzbank , told reuters news agency . " the one saving grace in this is that banks are acting quickly to highlight their exposure , " dixon said .
" the quicker the bad news is out in the open , then the quicker we can start to repair the problems . " but some analysts say the banking sector could face further problems and that european banks will face a lot of competition for funds when trying to rebuild their capital . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the election commission -lrb- zec -rrb- is counting with at an excessively leisurely pace .
this nourishes the suspicion that the results are being manipulated behind the scenes in order to secure another term in office for president robert mugabe . the opposition movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- sees itself as in the lead .
as does the ruling zanu-pf party .
an independent review is not possible .
nevertheless it seems extremely unlikely that mugabe would have managed convince a majority of zimbabweans to re-elect him .
he has managed to push the country 's economy over the brink .
chaos , scarcity and hyperinflation of more than 100,000 percent each year do n't create ideal election advertisements . in the run-up to the elections , human rights organizations , including amnesty international and human rights watch , complained of arbitrary arrests , one-sided media reports and government vote buying .
a free and just election was impossible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : johannes beck only friendly states such as china , russia , iran and neighboring african countries were allowed to send election monitors .
the involvement of southern african development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- countries remains a frustration , as does the lack of criticism from democratic neighboring countries such as mozambique .
joaquim chissano , the former president of mozambique , told deutsche welle that he has no right to question the intentions of other leaders .
and zimbabwe 's president insists that this election was free , transparent and lawful . chissano 's mindset is typical of the kind that allows african politicians to speaking out about the human rights abuses and poor governance of neighboring countries .
this practice of looking the other way and holding one 's tongue is a false understanding of african solidarity . growth and development require the ability to criticize and take criticism .
there are some examples of this in africa , such as the african peer review mechanism .
but , far too often , reflexes persist from the time of the common struggles against european colonial powers . during conversations with africans on this topic , one often hears that european governments have a double standard .
they are only interested in democracy when it fits their interests , africans say . and this is where africans are right .
zimbabwe 's former colonial power , great britain , only brought up the subject of human rights after british farmers lost their land .
there were very few protests from the west when , in the early 1980s , robert mugabe killed tens of thousands of opposition members in the matebeleland region . the discussions about mugabe 's participation in the eu-africa summit held in lisbon in december 2007 were also misguided .
at the same time as they were condemning mugabe , not a single european leader spoke out against libyan dictator moammar gadhafi 's summit attendance .
at least there are still elections in zimbabwe , something that the libyan opposition ca n't even dream about . european governments will likely criticize the elections in zimbabwe as neither free nor fair , as they should .
they should increase pressure and advocate for more democracy . but europeans must then live up to their own high standards , even when there are n't white farmers involved .
let 's not forget that other african countries , such as libya , gambia and ethiopia also have poor track records in the areas of democracy , human rights and freedom of speech . johannes beck is the deputy head of dw-radio 's africa desk and heads the dw-radio portuguese service -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 01.04.2008 opinion : zimbabwe 's election puts europe to the test großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while european governments should criticize the flawed elections in zimbabwe , they should also examine their double standards , says deutsche welle 's johannes beck . the first results have begun slowly trickling out of zimbabwe 's capital , harare .
the election commission -lrb- zec -rrb- is counting with at an excessively leisurely pace .
this nourishes the suspicion that the results are being manipulated behind the scenes in order to secure another term in office for president robert mugabe . the opposition movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- sees itself as in the lead .
as does the ruling zanu-pf party .
an independent review is not possible .
nevertheless it seems extremely unlikely that mugabe would have managed convince a majority of zimbabweans to re-elect him .
he has managed to push the country 's economy over the brink .
chaos , scarcity and hyperinflation of more than 100,000 percent each year do n't create ideal election advertisements . in the run-up to the elections , human rights organizations , including amnesty international and human rights watch , complained of arbitrary arrests , one-sided media reports and government vote buying .
a free and just election was impossible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : johannes beck only friendly states such as china , russia , iran and neighboring african countries were allowed to send election monitors .
the involvement of southern african development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- countries remains a frustration , as does the lack of criticism from democratic neighboring countries such as mozambique .
joaquim chissano , the former president of mozambique , told deutsche welle that he has no right to question the intentions of other leaders .
and zimbabwe 's president insists that this election was free , transparent and lawful . chissano 's mindset is typical of the kind that allows african politicians to speaking out about the human rights abuses and poor governance of neighboring countries .
this practice of looking the other way and holding one 's tongue is a false understanding of african solidarity . growth and development require the ability to criticize and take criticism .
there are some examples of this in africa , such as the african peer review mechanism .
but , far too often , reflexes persist from the time of the common struggles against european colonial powers . during conversations with africans on this topic , one often hears that european governments have a double standard .
they are only interested in democracy when it fits their interests , africans say . and this is where africans are right .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 01.04.2008 to stay in the game , more german stadiums going corporate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cash coming in for the stuttgart stadium 's new name will go toward a facelift stuttgart 's soccer stadium is becoming the mercedes benz arena .
it 's another example of the corporate rechristening of german stadiums that brings in cash for players or facility spruce-ups , but it has some crying foul . what 's in a name , after all ? when it comes to german stadiums , a lot of serious fans would say a lot .
there is tradition , the relationship with the fans , and the primacy of the sport over commerce . but those concerns appear to be falling on deaf ears as the trend of german stadiums selling their naming rights to corporations in multi-million-euro deals continues unabated . in the latest , carmaker daimler , stuttgart 's mayor and the head of the vfb stuttgart soccer club announced on monday , march 31 , that the city 's gottlieb daimler stadium will be renamed after the mercedes luxury automobile .
daimler bought the stadium 's naming rights for 23 million euros -lrb- $ 36 million -rrb- , according to the daily die welt . the club will use the money to cover most of its portion of a 66-million-euro stadium renovation , which will turn it from a mixed-use venue with track-and-field facilities to an arena solely dedicated to germany 's number one sport : soccer . slow rumble , then the avalanche vfb stuttgart is not breaking any new ground by changing its stadium 's name to that of a large company .
the trend in germany began in 1997 , when the city of fuerth 's ronhof sports park became playmobile stadium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bayarena stadium was germany 's second to get a new moniker two years later , leverkusen 's stadium was rebaptized the bayarena and then in 2001 , hamburg 's volksparkstadion got a new identity as the aol arena . since then , the process has accelerated , with at least one-half of the stadiums home to first-division teams getting new signage with names like commerzbank , insurer generali , or brewer veltins . " you can be sure that the stadiums that do n't currently have a commercial name are in negotiations about one now , " said maik thesing of the stadium web site stadionwelt-business.de. needed cash seen from the business side , a powerful corporate sponsor willing to write a big check to get its name on a building brings many benefits .
when teams or communities build new stadiums , selling the naming rights to companies with deep pockets can often take care of the largest part of their expenses , such as was the case with munich 's allianz arena . bildunterschrift : the allianz arena name was n't as controversial - it was never known as anything else if the stadium already exists , a new name can bring money into team coffers , money that can be used to renovate the facility , or , perhaps most importantly , fund expensive transfer fees to buy skilled players off other teams or pay the high salaries top talent requires .
average personnel costs for german league clubs were 29.5 million euros in the 2006-07 season . " if you want to survive on the international level , you have to buy in the best players , " said benedikt roemmelt , a sports economist at the institute for sports science in jena .
" if a german club ca n't afford to stay on the same financial level as , for example , an english club , then the german club does n't have a chance . " what a stadium gets for changing its name depends on its location and the reputation of its home club .
generali agreed to pay 400,000 euros a year to rename a stadium in the munich suburb of unterhaching , commerzbank is paying 3 million euros a year in frankfurt , and allianz pays 6 million euros annually to have its name on the new , architecturally significant arena in munich , home to bayern munich , one of germany 's top clubs . selling-out ? despite the benefits , many fans take a dimmer view as what many see as a corporate sell-out and the further commercialization of sport .
most renaming plans in germany have been accompanied by protest actions by fans . after hamburg 's stadium was renamed aol arena , fans brought a banner to matches that read " volkspark stadium forever ! " referring to its original identity .
in nuremberg , many were outraged when a local bank bought the naming rights to frankenstadion in 2006 and it became easycredit stadium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fans feel commercial interests are getting the upper hand " can nothing stop the commercialization of sports ?
can these financial sharks do anything they want ? " asked one irate individual in a fan club forum .
" what 's next , renaming nuremberg easycredit city ? " one fan group held a symbolic name change of its own , calling the facility max morlock stadium after a local soccer hero .
that name has proven much more popular . some media organizations have also refused to go along .
the daily westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung refuses to use the new names in its headlines , calling them " linguistic monsters " and not wanting to participate in what the paper calls " product placement . " matter of getting used to but this trend toward new and sometimes temporary identities - hamburg 's renamed aol arena has been renamed again and is now hsh nordbank arena - appears to be going strong .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 01.04.2008 to stay in the game , more german stadiums going corporate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cash coming in for the stuttgart stadium 's new name will go toward a facelift stuttgart 's soccer stadium is becoming the mercedes benz arena .
it 's another example of the corporate rechristening of german stadiums that brings in cash for players or facility spruce-ups , but it has some crying foul . what 's in a name , after all ? when it comes to german stadiums , a lot of serious fans would say a lot .
there is tradition , the relationship with the fans , and the primacy of the sport over commerce . but those concerns appear to be falling on deaf ears as the trend of german stadiums selling their naming rights to corporations in multi-million-euro deals continues unabated . in the latest , carmaker daimler , stuttgart 's mayor and the head of the vfb stuttgart soccer club announced on monday , march 31 , that the city 's gottlieb daimler stadium will be renamed after the mercedes luxury automobile .
daimler bought the stadium 's naming rights for 23 million euros -lrb- $ 36 million -rrb- , according to the daily die welt . the club will use the money to cover most of its portion of a 66-million-euro stadium renovation , which will turn it from a mixed-use venue with track-and-field facilities to an arena solely dedicated to germany 's number one sport : soccer . slow rumble , then the avalanche vfb stuttgart is not breaking any new ground by changing its stadium 's name to that of a large company .
the trend in germany began in 1997 , when the city of fuerth 's ronhof sports park became playmobile stadium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bayarena stadium was germany 's second to get a new moniker two years later , leverkusen 's stadium was rebaptized the bayarena and then in 2001 , hamburg 's volksparkstadion got a new identity as the aol arena . since then , the process has accelerated , with at least one-half of the stadiums home to first-division teams getting new signage with names like commerzbank , insurer generali , or brewer veltins . " you can be sure that the stadiums that do n't currently have a commercial name are in negotiations about one now , " said maik thesing of the stadium web site stadionwelt-business.de. needed cash seen from the business side , a powerful corporate sponsor willing to write a big check to get its name on a building brings many benefits .
when teams or communities build new stadiums , selling the naming rights to companies with deep pockets can often take care of the largest part of their expenses , such as was the case with munich 's allianz arena . bildunterschrift : the allianz arena name was n't as controversial - it was never known as anything else if the stadium already exists , a new name can bring money into team coffers , money that can be used to renovate the facility , or , perhaps most importantly , fund expensive transfer fees to buy skilled players off other teams or pay the high salaries top talent requires .
average personnel costs for german league clubs were 29.5 million euros in the 2006-07 season . " if you want to survive on the international level , you have to buy in the best players , " said benedikt roemmelt , a sports economist at the institute for sports science in jena .
" if a german club ca n't afford to stay on the same financial level as , for example , an english club , then the german club does n't have a chance . " what a stadium gets for changing its name depends on its location and the reputation of its home club .
generali agreed to pay 400,000 euros a year to rename a stadium in the munich suburb of unterhaching , commerzbank is paying 3 million euros a year in frankfurt , and allianz pays 6 million euros annually to have its name on the new , architecturally significant arena in munich , home to bayern munich , one of germany 's top clubs . selling-out ? despite the benefits , many fans take a dimmer view as what many see as a corporate sell-out and the further commercialization of sport .
most renaming plans in germany have been accompanied by protest actions by fans . after hamburg 's stadium was renamed aol arena , fans brought a banner to matches that read " volkspark stadium forever ! " referring to its original identity .
in nuremberg , many were outraged when a local bank bought the naming rights to frankenstadion in 2006 and it became easycredit stadium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fans feel commercial interests are getting the upper hand " can nothing stop the commercialization of sports ?
can these financial sharks do anything they want ? " asked one irate individual in a fan club forum .
" what 's next , renaming nuremberg easycredit city ? " one fan group held a symbolic name change of its own , calling the facility max morlock stadium after a local soccer hero .
that name has proven much more popular . some media organizations have also refused to go along .
the daily westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung refuses to use the new names in its headlines , calling them " linguistic monsters " and not wanting to participate in what the paper calls " product placement . " matter of getting used to but this trend toward new and sometimes temporary identities - hamburg 's renamed aol arena has been renamed again and is now hsh nordbank arena - appears to be going strong .
although according to sports economist roemmelt , because so many stadium operators want to get in on the corporate game , the amounts they can charge for naming rights is going down somewhat . and not every fan is against the practice , if it 's seen as bringing benefits .
mark friedrich , who is on the board of the fan club stuttgarter junxx , says he has n't heard that much negative reaction to the new mercedes-benz-arena , especially since the new money will cover a renovation project that will bring fans ' seats closer to the action on the field . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since mercedes is a home-town company , the renaming has n't ruffled as many feathers in stuttgart " we do n't want commercial interests to completely take over , but we do n't see that happening here , " he said .

china is furious . kouchner told rtl radio tuesday , april 1 , that he and the bloc 's other 26 foreign ministers will formally invite the dalai lama once a final decision has been made by slovenia , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency . " it sounds like a do-able idea , but this has to be discussed , " slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel told several journalists at the european parliament in brussels .
" to invite the dalai lama , certainly that would be a great honor , a great event .
the dalai lama is a very important religious leader . " neither kouchner nor rupel suggested a date for the proposed meeting . hans-gert poettering , the president of the european parliament has already invited the dalai lama to speak to the assembly in strasbourg , france . outrage in china bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people around the world , including a baby in frankfurt , showed support for the monks chinese state media said china had voiced " strong dissatisfaction " after the eu foreign ministers ' statement . chinese authorities are claiming that the dalai lama 's followers orchestrated the unrest that broke out in the himalayan region last month , when peaceful marches by tibetan monks turned violent .
exiled tibetans currently put the death toll from the chinese crackdown at up to 140 , with another 1000 injured and many detained . beijing strongly opposes talks between the dalai lama and foreign government officials and was angered by his meeting last september with german chancellor angela merkel . " we oppose his separatist activities , " chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman jiang yu told reporters on tuesday .
" we oppose any officials of foreign countries providing support for the separatist activities by the dalai lama . " the government reiterated tuesday that it opposed foreign nations providing support to what it believes is the dalai lama 's attempts to split tibet from china , reacting to reports that he may go to japan and europe . " the tibet issue is completely china 's internal affair , " jiang yu said , according to xinhua news agency .
" no foreign countries or international organizations have the right to interfere in it .

all told , 384 members of parliament voted in favor of the treaty and 56 voted against it . as part of the compromise , tusk agreed to start working on new legislation that would amend the divisions of power between the president , government and parliament . kaczynski and tusk hailed the treaty as good news for both poland and europe . " poland needs europe and europe needs poland , " tusk said , quoting polish pope john paul ii . while ratification is now largely assured , the senate is set to consider the bill on wednesday and could approve it the same day .

it 's another example of the corporate rechristening of german stadiums that brings in cash for players or facility spruce-ups , but it has some crying foul . what 's in a name , after all ? when it comes to german stadiums , a lot of serious fans would say a lot .
there is tradition , the relationship with the fans , and the primacy of the sport over commerce . but those concerns appear to be falling on deaf ears as the trend of german stadiums selling their naming rights to corporations in multi-million-euro deals continues unabated . in the latest , carmaker daimler , stuttgart 's mayor and the head of the vfb stuttgart soccer club announced on monday , march 31 , that the city 's gottlieb daimler stadium will be renamed after the mercedes luxury automobile .
daimler bought the stadium 's naming rights for 23 million euros -lrb- $ 36 million -rrb- , according to the daily die welt . the club will use the money to cover most of its portion of a 66-million-euro stadium renovation , which will turn it from a mixed-use venue with track-and-field facilities to an arena solely dedicated to germany 's number one sport : soccer . slow rumble , then the avalanche vfb stuttgart is not breaking any new ground by changing its stadium 's name to that of a large company .
the trend in germany began in 1997 , when the city of fuerth 's ronhof sports park became playmobile stadium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bayarena stadium was germany 's second to get a new moniker two years later , leverkusen 's stadium was rebaptized the bayarena and then in 2001 , hamburg 's volksparkstadion got a new identity as the aol arena . since then , the process has accelerated , with at least one-half of the stadiums home to first-division teams getting new signage with names like commerzbank , insurer generali , or brewer veltins . " you can be sure that the stadiums that do n't currently have a commercial name are in negotiations about one now , " said maik thesing of the stadium web site stadionwelt-business.de. needed cash seen from the business side , a powerful corporate sponsor willing to write a big check to get its name on a building brings many benefits .
when teams or communities build new stadiums , selling the naming rights to companies with deep pockets can often take care of the largest part of their expenses , such as was the case with munich 's allianz arena . bildunterschrift : the allianz arena name was n't as controversial - it was never known as anything else if the stadium already exists , a new name can bring money into team coffers , money that can be used to renovate the facility , or , perhaps most importantly , fund expensive transfer fees to buy skilled players off other teams or pay the high salaries top talent requires .
average personnel costs for german league clubs were 29.5 million euros in the 2006-07 season . " if you want to survive on the international level , you have to buy in the best players , " said benedikt roemmelt , a sports economist at the institute for sports science in jena .
" if a german club ca n't afford to stay on the same financial level as , for example , an english club , then the german club does n't have a chance . " what a stadium gets for changing its name depends on its location and the reputation of its home club .
generali agreed to pay 400,000 euros a year to rename a stadium in the munich suburb of unterhaching , commerzbank is paying 3 million euros a year in frankfurt , and allianz pays 6 million euros annually to have its name on the new , architecturally significant arena in munich , home to bayern munich , one of germany 's top clubs . selling-out ? despite the benefits , many fans take a dimmer view as what many see as a corporate sell-out and the further commercialization of sport .
most renaming plans in germany have been accompanied by protest actions by fans . after hamburg 's stadium was renamed aol arena , fans brought a banner to matches that read " volkspark stadium forever ! " referring to its original identity .
in nuremberg , many were outraged when a local bank bought the naming rights to frankenstadion in 2006 and it became easycredit stadium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fans feel commercial interests are getting the upper hand " can nothing stop the commercialization of sports ?
can these financial sharks do anything they want ? " asked one irate individual in a fan club forum .
" what 's next , renaming nuremberg easycredit city ? " one fan group held a symbolic name change of its own , calling the facility max morlock stadium after a local soccer hero .
that name has proven much more popular . some media organizations have also refused to go along .
the daily westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung refuses to use the new names in its headlines , calling them " linguistic monsters " and not wanting to participate in what the paper calls " product placement . " matter of getting used to but this trend toward new and sometimes temporary identities - hamburg 's renamed aol arena has been renamed again and is now hsh nordbank arena - appears to be going strong .
although according to sports economist roemmelt , because so many stadium operators want to get in on the corporate game , the amounts they can charge for naming rights is going down somewhat . and not every fan is against the practice , if it 's seen as bringing benefits .
mark friedrich , who is on the board of the fan club stuttgarter junxx , says he has n't heard that much negative reaction to the new mercedes-benz-arena , especially since the new money will cover a renovation project that will bring fans ' seats closer to the action on the field . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since mercedes is a home-town company , the renaming has n't ruffled as many feathers in stuttgart " we do n't want commercial interests to completely take over , but we do n't see that happening here , " he said .
" besides , mercedes has its home base here in stuttgart . " thesing of stadionwelt-business.de said he thinks there will likely be less furor in the future as the marketing of everything in sports , stadiums included , becomes more common , and finally accepted .
he pointed out that advertisements on jerseys and the advertising banners surrounding the soccer pitch have been around for decades and are not even registered by most fans these days . " a stadium renaming that 's happened in the past five years is still noticed , " he said .
" but in 20 years , it 's likely no one find it objectionable . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the election commission -lrb- zec -rrb- is counting with at an excessively leisurely pace .
this nourishes the suspicion that the results are being manipulated behind the scenes in order to secure another term in office for president robert mugabe . the opposition movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- sees itself as in the lead .
as does the ruling zanu-pf party .
an independent review is not possible .
nevertheless it seems extremely unlikely that mugabe would have managed convince a majority of zimbabweans to re-elect him .
he has managed to push the country 's economy over the brink .
chaos , scarcity and hyperinflation of more than 100,000 percent each year do n't create ideal election advertisements . in the run-up to the elections , human rights organizations , including amnesty international and human rights watch , complained of arbitrary arrests , one-sided media reports and government vote buying .
a free and just election was impossible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : johannes beck only friendly states such as china , russia , iran and neighboring african countries were allowed to send election monitors .
the involvement of southern african development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- countries remains a frustration , as does the lack of criticism from democratic neighboring countries such as mozambique .
joaquim chissano , the former president of mozambique , told deutsche welle that he has no right to question the intentions of other leaders .
and zimbabwe 's president insists that this election was free , transparent and lawful . chissano 's mindset is typical of the kind that allows african politicians to speaking out about the human rights abuses and poor governance of neighboring countries .
this practice of looking the other way and holding one 's tongue is a false understanding of african solidarity . growth and development require the ability to criticize and take criticism .
there are some examples of this in africa , such as the african peer review mechanism .
but , far too often , reflexes persist from the time of the common struggles against european colonial powers . during conversations with africans on this topic , one often hears that european governments have a double standard .
they are only interested in democracy when it fits their interests , africans say . and this is where africans are right .
zimbabwe 's former colonial power , great britain , only brought up the subject of human rights after british farmers lost their land .
there were very few protests from the west when , in the early 1980s , robert mugabe killed tens of thousands of opposition members in the matebeleland region . the discussions about mugabe 's participation in the eu-africa summit held in lisbon in december 2007 were also misguided .

the election commission -lrb- zec -rrb- is counting with at an excessively leisurely pace .
this nourishes the suspicion that the results are being manipulated behind the scenes in order to secure another term in office for president robert mugabe . the opposition movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- sees itself as in the lead .
as does the ruling zanu-pf party .
an independent review is not possible .
nevertheless it seems extremely unlikely that mugabe would have managed convince a majority of zimbabweans to re-elect him .
he has managed to push the country 's economy over the brink .
chaos , scarcity and hyperinflation of more than 100,000 percent each year do n't create ideal election advertisements . in the run-up to the elections , human rights organizations , including amnesty international and human rights watch , complained of arbitrary arrests , one-sided media reports and government vote buying .
a free and just election was impossible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : johannes beck only friendly states such as china , russia , iran and neighboring african countries were allowed to send election monitors .
the involvement of southern african development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- countries remains a frustration , as does the lack of criticism from democratic neighboring countries such as mozambique .
joaquim chissano , the former president of mozambique , told deutsche welle that he has no right to question the intentions of other leaders .
and zimbabwe 's president insists that this election was free , transparent and lawful . chissano 's mindset is typical of the kind that allows african politicians to speaking out about the human rights abuses and poor governance of neighboring countries .
this practice of looking the other way and holding one 's tongue is a false understanding of african solidarity . growth and development require the ability to criticize and take criticism .
there are some examples of this in africa , such as the african peer review mechanism .
but , far too often , reflexes persist from the time of the common struggles against european colonial powers . during conversations with africans on this topic , one often hears that european governments have a double standard .
they are only interested in democracy when it fits their interests , africans say . and this is where africans are right .
zimbabwe 's former colonial power , great britain , only brought up the subject of human rights after british farmers lost their land .
there were very few protests from the west when , in the early 1980s , robert mugabe killed tens of thousands of opposition members in the matebeleland region . the discussions about mugabe 's participation in the eu-africa summit held in lisbon in december 2007 were also misguided .
at the same time as they were condemning mugabe , not a single european leader spoke out against libyan dictator moammar gadhafi 's summit attendance .
at least there are still elections in zimbabwe , something that the libyan opposition ca n't even dream about . european governments will likely criticize the elections in zimbabwe as neither free nor fair , as they should .
they should increase pressure and advocate for more democracy . but europeans must then live up to their own high standards , even when there are n't white farmers involved .
let 's not forget that other african countries , such as libya , gambia and ethiopia also have poor track records in the areas of democracy , human rights and freedom of speech . johannes beck is the deputy head of dw-radio 's africa desk and heads the dw-radio portuguese service -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 01.04.2008 opinion : zimbabwe 's election puts europe to the test großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while european governments should criticize the flawed elections in zimbabwe , they should also examine their double standards , says deutsche welle 's johannes beck . the first results have begun slowly trickling out of zimbabwe 's capital , harare .
the election commission -lrb- zec -rrb- is counting with at an excessively leisurely pace .
this nourishes the suspicion that the results are being manipulated behind the scenes in order to secure another term in office for president robert mugabe . the opposition movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- sees itself as in the lead .
as does the ruling zanu-pf party .
an independent review is not possible .
nevertheless it seems extremely unlikely that mugabe would have managed convince a majority of zimbabweans to re-elect him .
he has managed to push the country 's economy over the brink .
chaos , scarcity and hyperinflation of more than 100,000 percent each year do n't create ideal election advertisements . in the run-up to the elections , human rights organizations , including amnesty international and human rights watch , complained of arbitrary arrests , one-sided media reports and government vote buying .
a free and just election was impossible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : johannes beck only friendly states such as china , russia , iran and neighboring african countries were allowed to send election monitors .
the involvement of southern african development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- countries remains a frustration , as does the lack of criticism from democratic neighboring countries such as mozambique .
joaquim chissano , the former president of mozambique , told deutsche welle that he has no right to question the intentions of other leaders .
and zimbabwe 's president insists that this election was free , transparent and lawful . chissano 's mindset is typical of the kind that allows african politicians to speaking out about the human rights abuses and poor governance of neighboring countries .
this practice of looking the other way and holding one 's tongue is a false understanding of african solidarity . growth and development require the ability to criticize and take criticism .
there are some examples of this in africa , such as the african peer review mechanism .
but , far too often , reflexes persist from the time of the common struggles against european colonial powers . during conversations with africans on this topic , one often hears that european governments have a double standard .
they are only interested in democracy when it fits their interests , africans say . and this is where africans are right .
zimbabwe 's former colonial power , great britain , only brought up the subject of human rights after british farmers lost their land .
there were very few protests from the west when , in the early 1980s , robert mugabe killed tens of thousands of opposition members in the matebeleland region . the discussions about mugabe 's participation in the eu-africa summit held in lisbon in december 2007 were also misguided .
at the same time as they were condemning mugabe , not a single european leader spoke out against libyan dictator moammar gadhafi 's summit attendance .
at least there are still elections in zimbabwe , something that the libyan opposition ca n't even dream about . european governments will likely criticize the elections in zimbabwe as neither free nor fair , as they should .
they should increase pressure and advocate for more democracy . but europeans must then live up to their own high standards , even when there are n't white farmers involved .
let 's not forget that other african countries , such as libya , gambia and ethiopia also have poor track records in the areas of democracy , human rights and freedom of speech . johannes beck is the deputy head of dw-radio 's africa desk and heads the dw-radio portuguese service -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

china is furious . kouchner told rtl radio tuesday , april 1 , that he and the bloc 's other 26 foreign ministers will formally invite the dalai lama once a final decision has been made by slovenia , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency . " it sounds like a do-able idea , but this has to be discussed , " slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel told several journalists at the european parliament in brussels .
" to invite the dalai lama , certainly that would be a great honor , a great event .
the dalai lama is a very important religious leader . " neither kouchner nor rupel suggested a date for the proposed meeting . hans-gert poettering , the president of the european parliament has already invited the dalai lama to speak to the assembly in strasbourg , france . outrage in china bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people around the world , including a baby in frankfurt , showed support for the monks chinese state media said china had voiced " strong dissatisfaction " after the eu foreign ministers ' statement . chinese authorities are claiming that the dalai lama 's followers orchestrated the unrest that broke out in the himalayan region last month , when peaceful marches by tibetan monks turned violent .
exiled tibetans currently put the death toll from the chinese crackdown at up to 140 , with another 1000 injured and many detained . beijing strongly opposes talks between the dalai lama and foreign government officials and was angered by his meeting last september with german chancellor angela merkel . " we oppose his separatist activities , " chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman jiang yu told reporters on tuesday .
" we oppose any officials of foreign countries providing support for the separatist activities by the dalai lama . " the government reiterated tuesday that it opposed foreign nations providing support to what it believes is the dalai lama 's attempts to split tibet from china , reacting to reports that he may go to japan and europe . " the tibet issue is completely china 's internal affair , " jiang yu said , according to xinhua news agency .
" no foreign countries or international organizations have the right to interfere in it . " suicide squad accusations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests last month extended to nepal in a recent dramatic statement by beijing in its offensive against the dalai lama , tibetan independence forces were accused of planning to deploy " suicide squads " to carry out bloody attacks . " to our knowledge , the next plan of the tibetan independence forces is to organize suicide squads to launch violent attacks , " said public security bureau spokesman wu heping at a news conference tuesday , without giving details of the alleged suicide squads . he said police had arrested an individual who he claimed was an operative of the " dalai lama clique , " responsible for gathering intelligence and distributing pamphlets calling for an uprising . wu also maintained that searches of monasteries had turned up large numbers of weapons . rebuttals call for proof tibetan authorities quickly dismissed the chinese allegations and asked beijing for evidence . the india-based tibetan government-in-exile said the claims were propaganda and reiterated the tibetan spiritual leader the dalai lama was not opposed to beijing hosting the olympics games in the summer . " instead of making baseless accusations , they , the chinese government , need to give evidence in support of what they say , " thubten samphel , spokesman of the tibetan government-in-exile , told afp . speaking by telephone from northern hill town of dharamshala , where the tibetan administration is headquartered , he said buddhists see suicide as the " worst form of crime " " our struggle is non-violent and suicide attacks are unheard of in buddhism .
we believe the human form the most precious form on earth and such unsubstantiated claims do no service either to the chinese or the tibetan people , " samphel said . iconic figure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us called the dalai lama " a man of peace " the dalai lama , who won the nobel peace prize in 1989 , has repeatedly denied orchestrating the unrest and spoke out against the protests as soon as they turned violent in the restive region 's capital lhasa in march .
he has always said he wants greater autonomy for tibet under chinese rule , but also an end to repression there . nearly six decades after the himalayan region was occupied by china , the dalai lama is widely seen as an iconic figure representing the tibetan people on the world stage . he has lived in exile in india since fleeing tibet in 1959 following a failed uprising against chinese rule . the us on tuesday also rejected china 's charges that the spiritual leader would back suicide attacks and called on the chinese to engage in dialog with the dalai lama . " the dalai lama is a man of peace , " us state department deputy spokesman tom casey told reporters .
" there 's absolutely no indication that he wants to do anything other than have a dialogue with china to discuss how to deal with some of the serious issues there .

the government and opposition had been locked in weeks of feuding over the lisbon treaty , which replaces the failed eu constitution . the document has to be ratified by all 27 eu member states if it is to take effect by the 2009 target . there were worries that poland , which nearly derailed earlier european treaty negotiations , would vote it down .

liberal prime minister donald tusk and president lech kaczynski worked out a compromise two days before the vote and then jointly campaigned for their followers to go along .
all told , 384 members of parliament voted in favor of the treaty and 56 voted against it . as part of the compromise , tusk agreed to start working on new legislation that would amend the divisions of power between the president , government and parliament . kaczynski and tusk hailed the treaty as good news for both poland and europe . " poland needs europe and europe needs poland , " tusk said , quoting polish pope john paul ii . while ratification is now largely assured , the senate is set to consider the bill on wednesday and could approve it the same day .

in poland , the treaty required approval from two-thirds of parliamentarians to pass , and the euro-skeptic law and justice party had expressed strong reservations . conservative support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-eu parties needed a supermajority but in the end , the law and justice party threw their support behind the treaty .
liberal prime minister donald tusk and president lech kaczynski worked out a compromise two days before the vote and then jointly campaigned for their followers to go along .
all told , 384 members of parliament voted in favor of the treaty and 56 voted against it . as part of the compromise , tusk agreed to start working on new legislation that would amend the divisions of power between the president , government and parliament . kaczynski and tusk hailed the treaty as good news for both poland and europe . " poland needs europe and europe needs poland , " tusk said , quoting polish pope john paul ii . while ratification is now largely assured , the senate is set to consider the bill on wednesday and could approve it the same day .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 01.04.2008 eu 's invitation to dalai lama incenses china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beijing accuses the dalai lama of attempting to split tibet from china after protests by tibetan monks in lhasa and other groups supporting tibetan independence , the eu is to invite the dalai lama to brussels , french foreign minister bernard kouchner said tuesday .
china is furious . kouchner told rtl radio tuesday , april 1 , that he and the bloc 's other 26 foreign ministers will formally invite the dalai lama once a final decision has been made by slovenia , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency . " it sounds like a do-able idea , but this has to be discussed , " slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel told several journalists at the european parliament in brussels .
" to invite the dalai lama , certainly that would be a great honor , a great event .
the dalai lama is a very important religious leader . " neither kouchner nor rupel suggested a date for the proposed meeting . hans-gert poettering , the president of the european parliament has already invited the dalai lama to speak to the assembly in strasbourg , france . outrage in china bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people around the world , including a baby in frankfurt , showed support for the monks chinese state media said china had voiced " strong dissatisfaction " after the eu foreign ministers ' statement . chinese authorities are claiming that the dalai lama 's followers orchestrated the unrest that broke out in the himalayan region last month , when peaceful marches by tibetan monks turned violent .
exiled tibetans currently put the death toll from the chinese crackdown at up to 140 , with another 1000 injured and many detained . beijing strongly opposes talks between the dalai lama and foreign government officials and was angered by his meeting last september with german chancellor angela merkel . " we oppose his separatist activities , " chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman jiang yu told reporters on tuesday .
" we oppose any officials of foreign countries providing support for the separatist activities by the dalai lama . " the government reiterated tuesday that it opposed foreign nations providing support to what it believes is the dalai lama 's attempts to split tibet from china , reacting to reports that he may go to japan and europe . " the tibet issue is completely china 's internal affair , " jiang yu said , according to xinhua news agency .
" no foreign countries or international organizations have the right to interfere in it . " suicide squad accusations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests last month extended to nepal in a recent dramatic statement by beijing in its offensive against the dalai lama , tibetan independence forces were accused of planning to deploy " suicide squads " to carry out bloody attacks . " to our knowledge , the next plan of the tibetan independence forces is to organize suicide squads to launch violent attacks , " said public security bureau spokesman wu heping at a news conference tuesday , without giving details of the alleged suicide squads . he said police had arrested an individual who he claimed was an operative of the " dalai lama clique , " responsible for gathering intelligence and distributing pamphlets calling for an uprising . wu also maintained that searches of monasteries had turned up large numbers of weapons . rebuttals call for proof tibetan authorities quickly dismissed the chinese allegations and asked beijing for evidence . the india-based tibetan government-in-exile said the claims were propaganda and reiterated the tibetan spiritual leader the dalai lama was not opposed to beijing hosting the olympics games in the summer . " instead of making baseless accusations , they , the chinese government , need to give evidence in support of what they say , " thubten samphel , spokesman of the tibetan government-in-exile , told afp . speaking by telephone from northern hill town of dharamshala , where the tibetan administration is headquartered , he said buddhists see suicide as the " worst form of crime " " our struggle is non-violent and suicide attacks are unheard of in buddhism .
we believe the human form the most precious form on earth and such unsubstantiated claims do no service either to the chinese or the tibetan people , " samphel said . iconic figure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us called the dalai lama " a man of peace " the dalai lama , who won the nobel peace prize in 1989 , has repeatedly denied orchestrating the unrest and spoke out against the protests as soon as they turned violent in the restive region 's capital lhasa in march .
he has always said he wants greater autonomy for tibet under chinese rule , but also an end to repression there . nearly six decades after the himalayan region was occupied by china , the dalai lama is widely seen as an iconic figure representing the tibetan people on the world stage . he has lived in exile in india since fleeing tibet in 1959 following a failed uprising against chinese rule . the us on tuesday also rejected china 's charges that the spiritual leader would back suicide attacks and called on the chinese to engage in dialog with the dalai lama . " the dalai lama is a man of peace , " us state department deputy spokesman tom casey told reporters .
" there 's absolutely no indication that he wants to do anything other than have a dialogue with china to discuss how to deal with some of the serious issues there .

the best hoaxes always have a ring of authenticity , and " from the fringe " knows that nowhere is the weird and wonderful more likely to be true than here in germany .
reality can still beat april fool 's pranks every time . according to bavarian media reports , the state government is finally to free up funds to complete the famously unfinished neuschwanstein castle built for king ludwig ii 125 years ago , but put on hold when public coffers ran empty . wolfsburg , apparently , is in talks with the deutsche bundesbank to commemorate the city 's 70th birthday with a limited edition 70 euro note . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coming soon to a plate near you in berlin , state finance minister thilo sarrazin suggested the cash-strapped capital make a fast buck by selling a few of the city zoo 's animals to chefs . " guests would come from as far away as japan and pay a small fortune for a taste of -lrb- world-famous polar bear -rrb- knut carpaccio with five spices powder and lovage jelly , " said celebrity chef tim raue . education authorities in lower saxony , meanwhile , have issued a warning about the risks of exposure to chalk dust faced by over-worked high school students . " now that high school students are required to graduate in eight instead of nine years , the increased concentration of chalk in the classroom is exacerbating cases of neurodermatitis and asthma , " said the authority in a press release dated april 1 . the mood was equally frisky in the western german state of north rhine-westphalia on tuesday , where traffic police revealed that they would be taking ballet classes with professional dancers in order to improve their coordination .
the office issued an announcement predicting that the plan " will help distract motorists from the bleak reality of traffic jams and reduce stress . " swedish furniture retail chain ikea got in on the act with the announcement of germany 's first drive-in store in berlin , where visitors will be able to place orders from behind the driver 's seat , sit back while staff members load the furniture into the trunk and enjoy a snack for just 10 euros -lrb- $ 15 -rrb- extra . looking foolish bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german obsession with nudity is hard to believe even dw-world.de was taken in by the german bookshop owner , who last week announced plans for a naked launch party in his shop for a forthcoming book about nudism . helmut maass admitted tuesday to german news service dpa that the invitation had been an april fool 's joke , after some 30 television , radio and newspaper reporters applied to attend the event . but even though no public reading - clothed or otherwise - was to take place tuesday , maass really is selling a book in his shop in the eastern town of pasewalk about the nudist minority in formerly communist east germany .
it draws on recollections - and indeed photographs - of holidaymakers in east germany before the berlin wall came down in 1989 . the region 's nudist movement has undergone a notable revival in recent years - and a dw-world.de story about a travel agent in the eastern city of erfurt introducing nude charter flights this summer to the baltic island resort of usedom is , believe it or not , definitely true . truth stranger than fiction the strangest story in the papers tuesday was also the honest-to-goodness truth - proving that the abundance of jaw-dropping stories in germany makes april 1 pretty superfluous . in fact , the media 's pranks seem somewhat sober in comparison to some of the real-life reports doing the rounds . take this tale of the 33-year-old woman allegedly suing doctors in the central german town of kassel after she checked in to have wrinkles removed and woke up with a new pair of breasts . " i had lost 100 kilos on a diet and wanted a tummy tuck , " she said . but when she came to after the operation she found doctors had put two 200 gram silicone implants into her breasts , increasing their size from a c cup to a d. you could n't make it up . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

-lrb- 28.03.2008 -rrb- german newspaper says it was duped by pro-smoker employer a hamburg-based newspaper that reported last week about a computer company manager who said he had fired non-smokers now says the whole issue was a hoax .

reality can still beat april fool 's pranks every time . according to bavarian media reports , the state government is finally to free up funds to complete the famously unfinished neuschwanstein castle built for king ludwig ii 125 years ago , but put on hold when public coffers ran empty . wolfsburg , apparently , is in talks with the deutsche bundesbank to commemorate the city 's 70th birthday with a limited edition 70 euro note . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coming soon to a plate near you in berlin , state finance minister thilo sarrazin suggested the cash-strapped capital make a fast buck by selling a few of the city zoo 's animals to chefs . " guests would come from as far away as japan and pay a small fortune for a taste of -lrb- world-famous polar bear -rrb- knut carpaccio with five spices powder and lovage jelly , " said celebrity chef tim raue . education authorities in lower saxony , meanwhile , have issued a warning about the risks of exposure to chalk dust faced by over-worked high school students . " now that high school students are required to graduate in eight instead of nine years , the increased concentration of chalk in the classroom is exacerbating cases of neurodermatitis and asthma , " said the authority in a press release dated april 1 . the mood was equally frisky in the western german state of north rhine-westphalia on tuesday , where traffic police revealed that they would be taking ballet classes with professional dancers in order to improve their coordination .
the office issued an announcement predicting that the plan " will help distract motorists from the bleak reality of traffic jams and reduce stress . " swedish furniture retail chain ikea got in on the act with the announcement of germany 's first drive-in store in berlin , where visitors will be able to place orders from behind the driver 's seat , sit back while staff members load the furniture into the trunk and enjoy a snack for just 10 euros -lrb- $ 15 -rrb- extra . looking foolish bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german obsession with nudity is hard to believe even dw-world.de was taken in by the german bookshop owner , who last week announced plans for a naked launch party in his shop for a forthcoming book about nudism . helmut maass admitted tuesday to german news service dpa that the invitation had been an april fool 's joke , after some 30 television , radio and newspaper reporters applied to attend the event . but even though no public reading - clothed or otherwise - was to take place tuesday , maass really is selling a book in his shop in the eastern town of pasewalk about the nudist minority in formerly communist east germany .

the government and opposition had been locked in weeks of feuding over the lisbon treaty , which replaces the failed eu constitution . the document has to be ratified by all 27 eu member states if it is to take effect by the 2009 target . there were worries that poland , which nearly derailed earlier european treaty negotiations , would vote it down .
in poland , the treaty required approval from two-thirds of parliamentarians to pass , and the euro-skeptic law and justice party had expressed strong reservations . conservative support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-eu parties needed a supermajority but in the end , the law and justice party threw their support behind the treaty .
liberal prime minister donald tusk and president lech kaczynski worked out a compromise two days before the vote and then jointly campaigned for their followers to go along .
all told , 384 members of parliament voted in favor of the treaty and 56 voted against it . as part of the compromise , tusk agreed to start working on new legislation that would amend the divisions of power between the president , government and parliament . kaczynski and tusk hailed the treaty as good news for both poland and europe . " poland needs europe and europe needs poland , " tusk said , quoting polish pope john paul ii . while ratification is now largely assured , the senate is set to consider the bill on wednesday and could approve it the same day .
it will then go back to kaczynski for final approval . the treaty , adopted by eu leaders in december , is designed to streamline the way the bloc is run .
it has already been ratified by lawmakers in bulgaria , france , hungary , malta , romania and slovenia . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's another example of the corporate rechristening of german stadiums that brings in cash for players or facility spruce-ups , but it has some crying foul . what 's in a name , after all ? when it comes to german stadiums , a lot of serious fans would say a lot .
there is tradition , the relationship with the fans , and the primacy of the sport over commerce . but those concerns appear to be falling on deaf ears as the trend of german stadiums selling their naming rights to corporations in multi-million-euro deals continues unabated . in the latest , carmaker daimler , stuttgart 's mayor and the head of the vfb stuttgart soccer club announced on monday , march 31 , that the city 's gottlieb daimler stadium will be renamed after the mercedes luxury automobile .
daimler bought the stadium 's naming rights for 23 million euros -lrb- $ 36 million -rrb- , according to the daily die welt . the club will use the money to cover most of its portion of a 66-million-euro stadium renovation , which will turn it from a mixed-use venue with track-and-field facilities to an arena solely dedicated to germany 's number one sport : soccer . slow rumble , then the avalanche vfb stuttgart is not breaking any new ground by changing its stadium 's name to that of a large company .
the trend in germany began in 1997 , when the city of fuerth 's ronhof sports park became playmobile stadium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bayarena stadium was germany 's second to get a new moniker two years later , leverkusen 's stadium was rebaptized the bayarena and then in 2001 , hamburg 's volksparkstadion got a new identity as the aol arena . since then , the process has accelerated , with at least one-half of the stadiums home to first-division teams getting new signage with names like commerzbank , insurer generali , or brewer veltins . " you can be sure that the stadiums that do n't currently have a commercial name are in negotiations about one now , " said maik thesing of the stadium web site stadionwelt-business.de. needed cash seen from the business side , a powerful corporate sponsor willing to write a big check to get its name on a building brings many benefits .
when teams or communities build new stadiums , selling the naming rights to companies with deep pockets can often take care of the largest part of their expenses , such as was the case with munich 's allianz arena . bildunterschrift : the allianz arena name was n't as controversial - it was never known as anything else if the stadium already exists , a new name can bring money into team coffers , money that can be used to renovate the facility , or , perhaps most importantly , fund expensive transfer fees to buy skilled players off other teams or pay the high salaries top talent requires .
average personnel costs for german league clubs were 29.5 million euros in the 2006-07 season . " if you want to survive on the international level , you have to buy in the best players , " said benedikt roemmelt , a sports economist at the institute for sports science in jena .
" if a german club ca n't afford to stay on the same financial level as , for example , an english club , then the german club does n't have a chance . " what a stadium gets for changing its name depends on its location and the reputation of its home club .
generali agreed to pay 400,000 euros a year to rename a stadium in the munich suburb of unterhaching , commerzbank is paying 3 million euros a year in frankfurt , and allianz pays 6 million euros annually to have its name on the new , architecturally significant arena in munich , home to bayern munich , one of germany 's top clubs . selling-out ? despite the benefits , many fans take a dimmer view as what many see as a corporate sell-out and the further commercialization of sport .
most renaming plans in germany have been accompanied by protest actions by fans . after hamburg 's stadium was renamed aol arena , fans brought a banner to matches that read " volkspark stadium forever ! " referring to its original identity .
in nuremberg , many were outraged when a local bank bought the naming rights to frankenstadion in 2006 and it became easycredit stadium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fans feel commercial interests are getting the upper hand " can nothing stop the commercialization of sports ?
can these financial sharks do anything they want ? " asked one irate individual in a fan club forum .
" what 's next , renaming nuremberg easycredit city ? " one fan group held a symbolic name change of its own , calling the facility max morlock stadium after a local soccer hero .
that name has proven much more popular . some media organizations have also refused to go along .
the daily westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung refuses to use the new names in its headlines , calling them " linguistic monsters " and not wanting to participate in what the paper calls " product placement . " matter of getting used to but this trend toward new and sometimes temporary identities - hamburg 's renamed aol arena has been renamed again and is now hsh nordbank arena - appears to be going strong .
although according to sports economist roemmelt , because so many stadium operators want to get in on the corporate game , the amounts they can charge for naming rights is going down somewhat . and not every fan is against the practice , if it 's seen as bringing benefits .
mark friedrich , who is on the board of the fan club stuttgarter junxx , says he has n't heard that much negative reaction to the new mercedes-benz-arena , especially since the new money will cover a renovation project that will bring fans ' seats closer to the action on the field . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since mercedes is a home-town company , the renaming has n't ruffled as many feathers in stuttgart " we do n't want commercial interests to completely take over , but we do n't see that happening here , " he said .
" besides , mercedes has its home base here in stuttgart . " thesing of stadionwelt-business.de said he thinks there will likely be less furor in the future as the marketing of everything in sports , stadiums included , becomes more common , and finally accepted .
he pointed out that advertisements on jerseys and the advertising banners surrounding the soccer pitch have been around for decades and are not even registered by most fans these days . " a stadium renaming that 's happened in the past five years is still noticed , " he said .
" but in 20 years , it 's likely no one find it objectionable . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

two mega-banks , swiss bank ubs and germany 's deutsche bank , announced fresh asset write-downs amounting to billions of euros . germany 's biggest bank announced tuesday , april 1 , that it will write down an estimated 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.9 billion -rrb- in its first quarter .
deutsche bank blamed bad loans in the housing sector and noted that conditions in international financial markets had become " significantly more challenging " in recent weeks . the announcement did not come as a complete surprise .
deutsche bank had warned last week it might miss 2008 earning targets . bad news , good timing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ubs is hoping for a sunnier future but deutsche bank 's bad news was dwarfed by that of swiss banking giant ubs , which announced it will write down 12 billion euros for the first three months of 2008 . " deutsche bank took advantage of the timing , coming on the heels of ubs so as not to have to rattle the market a second time , " said heino ruland , analyst at frankfurtfinanz told reuters . with tuesday 's announcement , usb had the dubious distinction of being the bank which has taken the worst hit from the us subprime mortgage crisis . ubs facing more red ink ubs chairman marcel ospel , seen by many as the man responsible for leading the bank into disastrous us subprime mortgages , announced his resignation tuesday . " i ultimately take responsibility for the bank 's situation , " ospel said in a statement . ubs 's new write-downs come on top of $ 18.4 billion the bank had written down in 2007 , bringing the bank 's total write-downs to $ 37.4 billion .
usb will turn to its shareholders to raise another 15 billion swiss francs -lrb- 9.5 billion euros , $ 14.8 billion -rrb- to shore up its financial base . the worst is over ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutschen bank 's josef ackermann in happier times while ubs finished last year in the red , deutsche bank posted a pretax profit of 8.7 billion euros in 2007 .
deutsche bank had hoped to post an 8.4 billion euro profit in 2008 , but said that might not happen . several public german banks are also among those hit hardest by the subprime crisis , with business lender ikb only surviving with help from the government and public savings banks , and regional bank sachenlb rescued by lbbw . yet there 's a sense among analysts that the worst might be over , and that optimism could be seen in the european stock market tuesday .
there was a sense that the banks are addressing the problems and a hope that the worst of the announcements might be over , peter dixon , an economist at commerzbank , told reuters news agency . " the one saving grace in this is that banks are acting quickly to highlight their exposure , " dixon said .
" the quicker the bad news is out in the open , then the quicker we can start to repair the problems . " but some analysts say the banking sector could face further problems and that european banks will face a lot of competition for funds when trying to rebuild their capital . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's another example of the corporate rechristening of german stadiums that brings in cash for players or facility spruce-ups , but it has some crying foul . what 's in a name , after all ? when it comes to german stadiums , a lot of serious fans would say a lot .
there is tradition , the relationship with the fans , and the primacy of the sport over commerce . but those concerns appear to be falling on deaf ears as the trend of german stadiums selling their naming rights to corporations in multi-million-euro deals continues unabated . in the latest , carmaker daimler , stuttgart 's mayor and the head of the vfb stuttgart soccer club announced on monday , march 31 , that the city 's gottlieb daimler stadium will be renamed after the mercedes luxury automobile .
daimler bought the stadium 's naming rights for 23 million euros -lrb- $ 36 million -rrb- , according to the daily die welt . the club will use the money to cover most of its portion of a 66-million-euro stadium renovation , which will turn it from a mixed-use venue with track-and-field facilities to an arena solely dedicated to germany 's number one sport : soccer . slow rumble , then the avalanche vfb stuttgart is not breaking any new ground by changing its stadium 's name to that of a large company .
the trend in germany began in 1997 , when the city of fuerth 's ronhof sports park became playmobile stadium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bayarena stadium was germany 's second to get a new moniker two years later , leverkusen 's stadium was rebaptized the bayarena and then in 2001 , hamburg 's volksparkstadion got a new identity as the aol arena . since then , the process has accelerated , with at least one-half of the stadiums home to first-division teams getting new signage with names like commerzbank , insurer generali , or brewer veltins . " you can be sure that the stadiums that do n't currently have a commercial name are in negotiations about one now , " said maik thesing of the stadium web site stadionwelt-business.de. needed cash seen from the business side , a powerful corporate sponsor willing to write a big check to get its name on a building brings many benefits .
when teams or communities build new stadiums , selling the naming rights to companies with deep pockets can often take care of the largest part of their expenses , such as was the case with munich 's allianz arena . bildunterschrift : the allianz arena name was n't as controversial - it was never known as anything else if the stadium already exists , a new name can bring money into team coffers , money that can be used to renovate the facility , or , perhaps most importantly , fund expensive transfer fees to buy skilled players off other teams or pay the high salaries top talent requires .
average personnel costs for german league clubs were 29.5 million euros in the 2006-07 season . " if you want to survive on the international level , you have to buy in the best players , " said benedikt roemmelt , a sports economist at the institute for sports science in jena .
" if a german club ca n't afford to stay on the same financial level as , for example , an english club , then the german club does n't have a chance . " what a stadium gets for changing its name depends on its location and the reputation of its home club .
generali agreed to pay 400,000 euros a year to rename a stadium in the munich suburb of unterhaching , commerzbank is paying 3 million euros a year in frankfurt , and allianz pays 6 million euros annually to have its name on the new , architecturally significant arena in munich , home to bayern munich , one of germany 's top clubs . selling-out ? despite the benefits , many fans take a dimmer view as what many see as a corporate sell-out and the further commercialization of sport .
most renaming plans in germany have been accompanied by protest actions by fans . after hamburg 's stadium was renamed aol arena , fans brought a banner to matches that read " volkspark stadium forever ! " referring to its original identity .
in nuremberg , many were outraged when a local bank bought the naming rights to frankenstadion in 2006 and it became easycredit stadium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fans feel commercial interests are getting the upper hand " can nothing stop the commercialization of sports ?
can these financial sharks do anything they want ? " asked one irate individual in a fan club forum .
" what 's next , renaming nuremberg easycredit city ? " one fan group held a symbolic name change of its own , calling the facility max morlock stadium after a local soccer hero .
that name has proven much more popular . some media organizations have also refused to go along .
the daily westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung refuses to use the new names in its headlines , calling them " linguistic monsters " and not wanting to participate in what the paper calls " product placement . " matter of getting used to but this trend toward new and sometimes temporary identities - hamburg 's renamed aol arena has been renamed again and is now hsh nordbank arena - appears to be going strong .
although according to sports economist roemmelt , because so many stadium operators want to get in on the corporate game , the amounts they can charge for naming rights is going down somewhat . and not every fan is against the practice , if it 's seen as bringing benefits .
mark friedrich , who is on the board of the fan club stuttgarter junxx , says he has n't heard that much negative reaction to the new mercedes-benz-arena , especially since the new money will cover a renovation project that will bring fans ' seats closer to the action on the field . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since mercedes is a home-town company , the renaming has n't ruffled as many feathers in stuttgart " we do n't want commercial interests to completely take over , but we do n't see that happening here , " he said .

when teams or communities build new stadiums , selling the naming rights to companies with deep pockets can often take care of the largest part of their expenses , such as was the case with munich 's allianz arena . bildunterschrift : the allianz arena name was n't as controversial - it was never known as anything else if the stadium already exists , a new name can bring money into team coffers , money that can be used to renovate the facility , or , perhaps most importantly , fund expensive transfer fees to buy skilled players off other teams or pay the high salaries top talent requires .
average personnel costs for german league clubs were 29.5 million euros in the 2006-07 season . " if you want to survive on the international level , you have to buy in the best players , " said benedikt roemmelt , a sports economist at the institute for sports science in jena .
" if a german club ca n't afford to stay on the same financial level as , for example , an english club , then the german club does n't have a chance . " what a stadium gets for changing its name depends on its location and the reputation of its home club .
generali agreed to pay 400,000 euros a year to rename a stadium in the munich suburb of unterhaching , commerzbank is paying 3 million euros a year in frankfurt , and allianz pays 6 million euros annually to have its name on the new , architecturally significant arena in munich , home to bayern munich , one of germany 's top clubs . selling-out ? despite the benefits , many fans take a dimmer view as what many see as a corporate sell-out and the further commercialization of sport .
most renaming plans in germany have been accompanied by protest actions by fans . after hamburg 's stadium was renamed aol arena , fans brought a banner to matches that read " volkspark stadium forever ! " referring to its original identity .
in nuremberg , many were outraged when a local bank bought the naming rights to frankenstadion in 2006 and it became easycredit stadium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fans feel commercial interests are getting the upper hand " can nothing stop the commercialization of sports ?
can these financial sharks do anything they want ? " asked one irate individual in a fan club forum .
" what 's next , renaming nuremberg easycredit city ? " one fan group held a symbolic name change of its own , calling the facility max morlock stadium after a local soccer hero .
that name has proven much more popular . some media organizations have also refused to go along .
the daily westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung refuses to use the new names in its headlines , calling them " linguistic monsters " and not wanting to participate in what the paper calls " product placement . " matter of getting used to but this trend toward new and sometimes temporary identities - hamburg 's renamed aol arena has been renamed again and is now hsh nordbank arena - appears to be going strong .
although according to sports economist roemmelt , because so many stadium operators want to get in on the corporate game , the amounts they can charge for naming rights is going down somewhat . and not every fan is against the practice , if it 's seen as bringing benefits .
mark friedrich , who is on the board of the fan club stuttgarter junxx , says he has n't heard that much negative reaction to the new mercedes-benz-arena , especially since the new money will cover a renovation project that will bring fans ' seats closer to the action on the field . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since mercedes is a home-town company , the renaming has n't ruffled as many feathers in stuttgart " we do n't want commercial interests to completely take over , but we do n't see that happening here , " he said .

it 's another example of the corporate rechristening of german stadiums that brings in cash for players or facility spruce-ups , but it has some crying foul . what 's in a name , after all ? when it comes to german stadiums , a lot of serious fans would say a lot .
there is tradition , the relationship with the fans , and the primacy of the sport over commerce . but those concerns appear to be falling on deaf ears as the trend of german stadiums selling their naming rights to corporations in multi-million-euro deals continues unabated . in the latest , carmaker daimler , stuttgart 's mayor and the head of the vfb stuttgart soccer club announced on monday , march 31 , that the city 's gottlieb daimler stadium will be renamed after the mercedes luxury automobile .
daimler bought the stadium 's naming rights for 23 million euros -lrb- $ 36 million -rrb- , according to the daily die welt . the club will use the money to cover most of its portion of a 66-million-euro stadium renovation , which will turn it from a mixed-use venue with track-and-field facilities to an arena solely dedicated to germany 's number one sport : soccer . slow rumble , then the avalanche vfb stuttgart is not breaking any new ground by changing its stadium 's name to that of a large company .
the trend in germany began in 1997 , when the city of fuerth 's ronhof sports park became playmobile stadium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bayarena stadium was germany 's second to get a new moniker two years later , leverkusen 's stadium was rebaptized the bayarena and then in 2001 , hamburg 's volksparkstadion got a new identity as the aol arena . since then , the process has accelerated , with at least one-half of the stadiums home to first-division teams getting new signage with names like commerzbank , insurer generali , or brewer veltins .

two mega-banks , swiss bank ubs and germany 's deutsche bank , announced fresh asset write-downs amounting to billions of euros . germany 's biggest bank announced tuesday , april 1 , that it will write down an estimated 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.9 billion -rrb- in its first quarter .
deutsche bank blamed bad loans in the housing sector and noted that conditions in international financial markets had become " significantly more challenging " in recent weeks . the announcement did not come as a complete surprise .
deutsche bank had warned last week it might miss 2008 earning targets . bad news , good timing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ubs is hoping for a sunnier future but deutsche bank 's bad news was dwarfed by that of swiss banking giant ubs , which announced it will write down 12 billion euros for the first three months of 2008 . " deutsche bank took advantage of the timing , coming on the heels of ubs so as not to have to rattle the market a second time , " said heino ruland , analyst at frankfurtfinanz told reuters . with tuesday 's announcement , usb had the dubious distinction of being the bank which has taken the worst hit from the us subprime mortgage crisis . ubs facing more red ink ubs chairman marcel ospel , seen by many as the man responsible for leading the bank into disastrous us subprime mortgages , announced his resignation tuesday . " i ultimately take responsibility for the bank 's situation , " ospel said in a statement . ubs 's new write-downs come on top of $ 18.4 billion the bank had written down in 2007 , bringing the bank 's total write-downs to $ 37.4 billion .
usb will turn to its shareholders to raise another 15 billion swiss francs -lrb- 9.5 billion euros , $ 14.8 billion -rrb- to shore up its financial base . the worst is over ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutschen bank 's josef ackermann in happier times while ubs finished last year in the red , deutsche bank posted a pretax profit of 8.7 billion euros in 2007 .
deutsche bank had hoped to post an 8.4 billion euro profit in 2008 , but said that might not happen . several public german banks are also among those hit hardest by the subprime crisis , with business lender ikb only surviving with help from the government and public savings banks , and regional bank sachenlb rescued by lbbw . yet there 's a sense among analysts that the worst might be over , and that optimism could be seen in the european stock market tuesday .
there was a sense that the banks are addressing the problems and a hope that the worst of the announcements might be over , peter dixon , an economist at commerzbank , told reuters news agency . " the one saving grace in this is that banks are acting quickly to highlight their exposure , " dixon said .
" the quicker the bad news is out in the open , then the quicker we can start to repair the problems . " but some analysts say the banking sector could face further problems and that european banks will face a lot of competition for funds when trying to rebuild their capital . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 01.04.2008 opinion : zimbabwe 's election puts europe to the test großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while european governments should criticize the flawed elections in zimbabwe , they should also examine their double standards , says deutsche welle 's johannes beck . the first results have begun slowly trickling out of zimbabwe 's capital , harare .
the election commission -lrb- zec -rrb- is counting with at an excessively leisurely pace .
this nourishes the suspicion that the results are being manipulated behind the scenes in order to secure another term in office for president robert mugabe . the opposition movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- sees itself as in the lead .
as does the ruling zanu-pf party .
an independent review is not possible .
nevertheless it seems extremely unlikely that mugabe would have managed convince a majority of zimbabweans to re-elect him .
he has managed to push the country 's economy over the brink .
chaos , scarcity and hyperinflation of more than 100,000 percent each year do n't create ideal election advertisements . in the run-up to the elections , human rights organizations , including amnesty international and human rights watch , complained of arbitrary arrests , one-sided media reports and government vote buying .
a free and just election was impossible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : johannes beck only friendly states such as china , russia , iran and neighboring african countries were allowed to send election monitors .
the involvement of southern african development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- countries remains a frustration , as does the lack of criticism from democratic neighboring countries such as mozambique .
joaquim chissano , the former president of mozambique , told deutsche welle that he has no right to question the intentions of other leaders .
and zimbabwe 's president insists that this election was free , transparent and lawful . chissano 's mindset is typical of the kind that allows african politicians to speaking out about the human rights abuses and poor governance of neighboring countries .
this practice of looking the other way and holding one 's tongue is a false understanding of african solidarity . growth and development require the ability to criticize and take criticism .
there are some examples of this in africa , such as the african peer review mechanism .
but , far too often , reflexes persist from the time of the common struggles against european colonial powers . during conversations with africans on this topic , one often hears that european governments have a double standard .
they are only interested in democracy when it fits their interests , africans say . and this is where africans are right .
zimbabwe 's former colonial power , great britain , only brought up the subject of human rights after british farmers lost their land .
there were very few protests from the west when , in the early 1980s , robert mugabe killed tens of thousands of opposition members in the matebeleland region . the discussions about mugabe 's participation in the eu-africa summit held in lisbon in december 2007 were also misguided .
at the same time as they were condemning mugabe , not a single european leader spoke out against libyan dictator moammar gadhafi 's summit attendance .
at least there are still elections in zimbabwe , something that the libyan opposition ca n't even dream about . european governments will likely criticize the elections in zimbabwe as neither free nor fair , as they should .
they should increase pressure and advocate for more democracy . but europeans must then live up to their own high standards , even when there are n't white farmers involved .
let 's not forget that other african countries , such as libya , gambia and ethiopia also have poor track records in the areas of democracy , human rights and freedom of speech . johannes beck is the deputy head of dw-radio 's africa desk and heads the dw-radio portuguese service -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the best hoaxes always have a ring of authenticity , and " from the fringe " knows that nowhere is the weird and wonderful more likely to be true than here in germany .
reality can still beat april fool 's pranks every time . according to bavarian media reports , the state government is finally to free up funds to complete the famously unfinished neuschwanstein castle built for king ludwig ii 125 years ago , but put on hold when public coffers ran empty . wolfsburg , apparently , is in talks with the deutsche bundesbank to commemorate the city 's 70th birthday with a limited edition 70 euro note . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coming soon to a plate near you in berlin , state finance minister thilo sarrazin suggested the cash-strapped capital make a fast buck by selling a few of the city zoo 's animals to chefs . " guests would come from as far away as japan and pay a small fortune for a taste of -lrb- world-famous polar bear -rrb- knut carpaccio with five spices powder and lovage jelly , " said celebrity chef tim raue . education authorities in lower saxony , meanwhile , have issued a warning about the risks of exposure to chalk dust faced by over-worked high school students . " now that high school students are required to graduate in eight instead of nine years , the increased concentration of chalk in the classroom is exacerbating cases of neurodermatitis and asthma , " said the authority in a press release dated april 1 . the mood was equally frisky in the western german state of north rhine-westphalia on tuesday , where traffic police revealed that they would be taking ballet classes with professional dancers in order to improve their coordination .

it draws on recollections - and indeed photographs - of holidaymakers in east germany before the berlin wall came down in 1989 . the region 's nudist movement has undergone a notable revival in recent years - and a dw-world.de story about a travel agent in the eastern city of erfurt introducing nude charter flights this summer to the baltic island resort of usedom is , believe it or not , definitely true . truth stranger than fiction the strangest story in the papers tuesday was also the honest-to-goodness truth - proving that the abundance of jaw-dropping stories in germany makes april 1 pretty superfluous . in fact , the media 's pranks seem somewhat sober in comparison to some of the real-life reports doing the rounds . take this tale of the 33-year-old woman allegedly suing doctors in the central german town of kassel after she checked in to have wrinkles removed and woke up with a new pair of breasts .

it 's another example of the corporate rechristening of german stadiums that brings in cash for players or facility spruce-ups , but it has some crying foul . what 's in a name , after all ? when it comes to german stadiums , a lot of serious fans would say a lot .
there is tradition , the relationship with the fans , and the primacy of the sport over commerce . but those concerns appear to be falling on deaf ears as the trend of german stadiums selling their naming rights to corporations in multi-million-euro deals continues unabated . in the latest , carmaker daimler , stuttgart 's mayor and the head of the vfb stuttgart soccer club announced on monday , march 31 , that the city 's gottlieb daimler stadium will be renamed after the mercedes luxury automobile .
daimler bought the stadium 's naming rights for 23 million euros -lrb- $ 36 million -rrb- , according to the daily die welt . the club will use the money to cover most of its portion of a 66-million-euro stadium renovation , which will turn it from a mixed-use venue with track-and-field facilities to an arena solely dedicated to germany 's number one sport : soccer . slow rumble , then the avalanche vfb stuttgart is not breaking any new ground by changing its stadium 's name to that of a large company .
the trend in germany began in 1997 , when the city of fuerth 's ronhof sports park became playmobile stadium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bayarena stadium was germany 's second to get a new moniker two years later , leverkusen 's stadium was rebaptized the bayarena and then in 2001 , hamburg 's volksparkstadion got a new identity as the aol arena . since then , the process has accelerated , with at least one-half of the stadiums home to first-division teams getting new signage with names like commerzbank , insurer generali , or brewer veltins . " you can be sure that the stadiums that do n't currently have a commercial name are in negotiations about one now , " said maik thesing of the stadium web site stadionwelt-business.de. needed cash seen from the business side , a powerful corporate sponsor willing to write a big check to get its name on a building brings many benefits .
when teams or communities build new stadiums , selling the naming rights to companies with deep pockets can often take care of the largest part of their expenses , such as was the case with munich 's allianz arena . bildunterschrift : the allianz arena name was n't as controversial - it was never known as anything else if the stadium already exists , a new name can bring money into team coffers , money that can be used to renovate the facility , or , perhaps most importantly , fund expensive transfer fees to buy skilled players off other teams or pay the high salaries top talent requires .
average personnel costs for german league clubs were 29.5 million euros in the 2006-07 season . " if you want to survive on the international level , you have to buy in the best players , " said benedikt roemmelt , a sports economist at the institute for sports science in jena .
" if a german club ca n't afford to stay on the same financial level as , for example , an english club , then the german club does n't have a chance . " what a stadium gets for changing its name depends on its location and the reputation of its home club .
generali agreed to pay 400,000 euros a year to rename a stadium in the munich suburb of unterhaching , commerzbank is paying 3 million euros a year in frankfurt , and allianz pays 6 million euros annually to have its name on the new , architecturally significant arena in munich , home to bayern munich , one of germany 's top clubs . selling-out ? despite the benefits , many fans take a dimmer view as what many see as a corporate sell-out and the further commercialization of sport .
most renaming plans in germany have been accompanied by protest actions by fans . after hamburg 's stadium was renamed aol arena , fans brought a banner to matches that read " volkspark stadium forever ! " referring to its original identity .
in nuremberg , many were outraged when a local bank bought the naming rights to frankenstadion in 2006 and it became easycredit stadium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fans feel commercial interests are getting the upper hand " can nothing stop the commercialization of sports ?
can these financial sharks do anything they want ? " asked one irate individual in a fan club forum .
" what 's next , renaming nuremberg easycredit city ? " one fan group held a symbolic name change of its own , calling the facility max morlock stadium after a local soccer hero .
that name has proven much more popular . some media organizations have also refused to go along .
the daily westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung refuses to use the new names in its headlines , calling them " linguistic monsters " and not wanting to participate in what the paper calls " product placement . " matter of getting used to but this trend toward new and sometimes temporary identities - hamburg 's renamed aol arena has been renamed again and is now hsh nordbank arena - appears to be going strong .
although according to sports economist roemmelt , because so many stadium operators want to get in on the corporate game , the amounts they can charge for naming rights is going down somewhat . and not every fan is against the practice , if it 's seen as bringing benefits .
mark friedrich , who is on the board of the fan club stuttgarter junxx , says he has n't heard that much negative reaction to the new mercedes-benz-arena , especially since the new money will cover a renovation project that will bring fans ' seats closer to the action on the field . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since mercedes is a home-town company , the renaming has n't ruffled as many feathers in stuttgart " we do n't want commercial interests to completely take over , but we do n't see that happening here , " he said .
" besides , mercedes has its home base here in stuttgart . " thesing of stadionwelt-business.de said he thinks there will likely be less furor in the future as the marketing of everything in sports , stadiums included , becomes more common , and finally accepted .
he pointed out that advertisements on jerseys and the advertising banners surrounding the soccer pitch have been around for decades and are not even registered by most fans these days . " a stadium renaming that 's happened in the past five years is still noticed , " he said .

the election commission -lrb- zec -rrb- is counting with at an excessively leisurely pace .
this nourishes the suspicion that the results are being manipulated behind the scenes in order to secure another term in office for president robert mugabe . the opposition movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- sees itself as in the lead .
as does the ruling zanu-pf party .
an independent review is not possible .
nevertheless it seems extremely unlikely that mugabe would have managed convince a majority of zimbabweans to re-elect him .
he has managed to push the country 's economy over the brink .
chaos , scarcity and hyperinflation of more than 100,000 percent each year do n't create ideal election advertisements . in the run-up to the elections , human rights organizations , including amnesty international and human rights watch , complained of arbitrary arrests , one-sided media reports and government vote buying .
a free and just election was impossible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : johannes beck only friendly states such as china , russia , iran and neighboring african countries were allowed to send election monitors .
the involvement of southern african development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- countries remains a frustration , as does the lack of criticism from democratic neighboring countries such as mozambique .
joaquim chissano , the former president of mozambique , told deutsche welle that he has no right to question the intentions of other leaders .
and zimbabwe 's president insists that this election was free , transparent and lawful . chissano 's mindset is typical of the kind that allows african politicians to speaking out about the human rights abuses and poor governance of neighboring countries .
this practice of looking the other way and holding one 's tongue is a false understanding of african solidarity . growth and development require the ability to criticize and take criticism .
there are some examples of this in africa , such as the african peer review mechanism .
but , far too often , reflexes persist from the time of the common struggles against european colonial powers . during conversations with africans on this topic , one often hears that european governments have a double standard .
they are only interested in democracy when it fits their interests , africans say . and this is where africans are right .
zimbabwe 's former colonial power , great britain , only brought up the subject of human rights after british farmers lost their land .
there were very few protests from the west when , in the early 1980s , robert mugabe killed tens of thousands of opposition members in the matebeleland region . the discussions about mugabe 's participation in the eu-africa summit held in lisbon in december 2007 were also misguided .
at the same time as they were condemning mugabe , not a single european leader spoke out against libyan dictator moammar gadhafi 's summit attendance .
at least there are still elections in zimbabwe , something that the libyan opposition ca n't even dream about . european governments will likely criticize the elections in zimbabwe as neither free nor fair , as they should .
they should increase pressure and advocate for more democracy . but europeans must then live up to their own high standards , even when there are n't white farmers involved .
let 's not forget that other african countries , such as libya , gambia and ethiopia also have poor track records in the areas of democracy , human rights and freedom of speech . johannes beck is the deputy head of dw-radio 's africa desk and heads the dw-radio portuguese service -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

two mega-banks , swiss bank ubs and germany 's deutsche bank , announced fresh asset write-downs amounting to billions of euros . germany 's biggest bank announced tuesday , april 1 , that it will write down an estimated 2.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.9 billion -rrb- in its first quarter .
deutsche bank blamed bad loans in the housing sector and noted that conditions in international financial markets had become " significantly more challenging " in recent weeks . the announcement did not come as a complete surprise .
deutsche bank had warned last week it might miss 2008 earning targets . bad news , good timing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ubs is hoping for a sunnier future but deutsche bank 's bad news was dwarfed by that of swiss banking giant ubs , which announced it will write down 12 billion euros for the first three months of 2008 . " deutsche bank took advantage of the timing , coming on the heels of ubs so as not to have to rattle the market a second time , " said heino ruland , analyst at frankfurtfinanz told reuters . with tuesday 's announcement , usb had the dubious distinction of being the bank which has taken the worst hit from the us subprime mortgage crisis . ubs facing more red ink ubs chairman marcel ospel , seen by many as the man responsible for leading the bank into disastrous us subprime mortgages , announced his resignation tuesday . " i ultimately take responsibility for the bank 's situation , " ospel said in a statement . ubs 's new write-downs come on top of $ 18.4 billion the bank had written down in 2007 , bringing the bank 's total write-downs to $ 37.4 billion .
usb will turn to its shareholders to raise another 15 billion swiss francs -lrb- 9.5 billion euros , $ 14.8 billion -rrb- to shore up its financial base . the worst is over ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutschen bank 's josef ackermann in happier times while ubs finished last year in the red , deutsche bank posted a pretax profit of 8.7 billion euros in 2007 .
deutsche bank had hoped to post an 8.4 billion euro profit in 2008 , but said that might not happen . several public german banks are also among those hit hardest by the subprime crisis , with business lender ikb only surviving with help from the government and public savings banks , and regional bank sachenlb rescued by lbbw . yet there 's a sense among analysts that the worst might be over , and that optimism could be seen in the european stock market tuesday .
there was a sense that the banks are addressing the problems and a hope that the worst of the announcements might be over , peter dixon , an economist at commerzbank , told reuters news agency . " the one saving grace in this is that banks are acting quickly to highlight their exposure , " dixon said .
" the quicker the bad news is out in the open , then the quicker we can start to repair the problems . " but some analysts say the banking sector could face further problems and that european banks will face a lot of competition for funds when trying to rebuild their capital . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

china is furious . kouchner told rtl radio tuesday , april 1 , that he and the bloc 's other 26 foreign ministers will formally invite the dalai lama once a final decision has been made by slovenia , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency . " it sounds like a do-able idea , but this has to be discussed , " slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel told several journalists at the european parliament in brussels .
" to invite the dalai lama , certainly that would be a great honor , a great event .
the dalai lama is a very important religious leader . " neither kouchner nor rupel suggested a date for the proposed meeting . hans-gert poettering , the president of the european parliament has already invited the dalai lama to speak to the assembly in strasbourg , france . outrage in china bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people around the world , including a baby in frankfurt , showed support for the monks chinese state media said china had voiced " strong dissatisfaction " after the eu foreign ministers ' statement . chinese authorities are claiming that the dalai lama 's followers orchestrated the unrest that broke out in the himalayan region last month , when peaceful marches by tibetan monks turned violent .
exiled tibetans currently put the death toll from the chinese crackdown at up to 140 , with another 1000 injured and many detained . beijing strongly opposes talks between the dalai lama and foreign government officials and was angered by his meeting last september with german chancellor angela merkel . " we oppose his separatist activities , " chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman jiang yu told reporters on tuesday .
" we oppose any officials of foreign countries providing support for the separatist activities by the dalai lama . " the government reiterated tuesday that it opposed foreign nations providing support to what it believes is the dalai lama 's attempts to split tibet from china , reacting to reports that he may go to japan and europe . " the tibet issue is completely china 's internal affair , " jiang yu said , according to xinhua news agency .
" no foreign countries or international organizations have the right to interfere in it . " suicide squad accusations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests last month extended to nepal in a recent dramatic statement by beijing in its offensive against the dalai lama , tibetan independence forces were accused of planning to deploy " suicide squads " to carry out bloody attacks . " to our knowledge , the next plan of the tibetan independence forces is to organize suicide squads to launch violent attacks , " said public security bureau spokesman wu heping at a news conference tuesday , without giving details of the alleged suicide squads . he said police had arrested an individual who he claimed was an operative of the " dalai lama clique , " responsible for gathering intelligence and distributing pamphlets calling for an uprising . wu also maintained that searches of monasteries had turned up large numbers of weapons . rebuttals call for proof tibetan authorities quickly dismissed the chinese allegations and asked beijing for evidence . the india-based tibetan government-in-exile said the claims were propaganda and reiterated the tibetan spiritual leader the dalai lama was not opposed to beijing hosting the olympics games in the summer . " instead of making baseless accusations , they , the chinese government , need to give evidence in support of what they say , " thubten samphel , spokesman of the tibetan government-in-exile , told afp . speaking by telephone from northern hill town of dharamshala , where the tibetan administration is headquartered , he said buddhists see suicide as the " worst form of crime " " our struggle is non-violent and suicide attacks are unheard of in buddhism .
we believe the human form the most precious form on earth and such unsubstantiated claims do no service either to the chinese or the tibetan people , " samphel said . iconic figure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us called the dalai lama " a man of peace " the dalai lama , who won the nobel peace prize in 1989 , has repeatedly denied orchestrating the unrest and spoke out against the protests as soon as they turned violent in the restive region 's capital lhasa in march .
he has always said he wants greater autonomy for tibet under chinese rule , but also an end to repression there . nearly six decades after the himalayan region was occupied by china , the dalai lama is widely seen as an iconic figure representing the tibetan people on the world stage . he has lived in exile in india since fleeing tibet in 1959 following a failed uprising against chinese rule . the us on tuesday also rejected china 's charges that the spiritual leader would back suicide attacks and called on the chinese to engage in dialog with the dalai lama . " the dalai lama is a man of peace , " us state department deputy spokesman tom casey told reporters .
" there 's absolutely no indication that he wants to do anything other than have a dialogue with china to discuss how to deal with some of the serious issues there .

the government and opposition had been locked in weeks of feuding over the lisbon treaty , which replaces the failed eu constitution . the document has to be ratified by all 27 eu member states if it is to take effect by the 2009 target . there were worries that poland , which nearly derailed earlier european treaty negotiations , would vote it down .
in poland , the treaty required approval from two-thirds of parliamentarians to pass , and the euro-skeptic law and justice party had expressed strong reservations . conservative support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-eu parties needed a supermajority but in the end , the law and justice party threw their support behind the treaty .
liberal prime minister donald tusk and president lech kaczynski worked out a compromise two days before the vote and then jointly campaigned for their followers to go along .
all told , 384 members of parliament voted in favor of the treaty and 56 voted against it . as part of the compromise , tusk agreed to start working on new legislation that would amend the divisions of power between the president , government and parliament . kaczynski and tusk hailed the treaty as good news for both poland and europe . " poland needs europe and europe needs poland , " tusk said , quoting polish pope john paul ii . while ratification is now largely assured , the senate is set to consider the bill on wednesday and could approve it the same day .
it will then go back to kaczynski for final approval . the treaty , adopted by eu leaders in december , is designed to streamline the way the bloc is run .
it has already been ratified by lawmakers in bulgaria , france , hungary , malta , romania and slovenia . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

liberal prime minister donald tusk and president lech kaczynski worked out a compromise two days before the vote and then jointly campaigned for their followers to go along .

" poland needs europe and europe needs poland , " tusk said , quoting polish pope john paul ii . while ratification is now largely assured , the senate is set to consider the bill on wednesday and could approve it the same day .

german law grants legal rights to life partners that are similar to those of married couples .
gay marriage , however , is not recognized in germany . the eu commission welcomed tuesday 's ruling as " strengthening the principle of non-discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation , " while emphasizing that it was up to bloc 's 27 members to decide whether they would grant registered same-sex partners the same rights as married couples .

now , one of the three parties can demand a paternity test in a family court , even if one or both of the other parties are opposed .
secret tests are still not recognized by law and have no influence on custody rights and child support . the law effectively allows a man to request a paternity test against the will of his alleged child 's mother and without needing to resort to a legal challenge , which would automatically sever his legal ties to the child . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

china is furious . kouchner told rtl radio tuesday , april 1 , that he and the bloc 's other 26 foreign ministers will formally invite the dalai lama once a final decision has been made by slovenia , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency . " it sounds like a do-able idea , but this has to be discussed , " slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel told several journalists at the european parliament in brussels .
" to invite the dalai lama , certainly that would be a great honor , a great event .
the dalai lama is a very important religious leader .

exiled tibetans currently put the death toll from the chinese crackdown at up to 140 , with another 1000 injured and many detained . beijing strongly opposes talks between the dalai lama and foreign government officials and was angered by his meeting last september with german chancellor angela merkel . " we oppose his separatist activities , " chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman jiang yu told reporters on tuesday .
" we oppose any officials of foreign countries providing support for the separatist activities by the dalai lama . " the government reiterated tuesday that it opposed foreign nations providing support to what it believes is the dalai lama 's attempts to split tibet from china , reacting to reports that he may go to japan and europe . " the tibet issue is completely china 's internal affair , " jiang yu said , according to xinhua news agency .
" no foreign countries or international organizations have the right to interfere in it . " suicide squad accusations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests last month extended to nepal in a recent dramatic statement by beijing in its offensive against the dalai lama , tibetan independence forces were accused of planning to deploy " suicide squads " to carry out bloody attacks . " to our knowledge , the next plan of the tibetan independence forces is to organize suicide squads to launch violent attacks , " said public security bureau spokesman wu heping at a news conference tuesday , without giving details of the alleged suicide squads . he said police had arrested an individual who he claimed was an operative of the " dalai lama clique , " responsible for gathering intelligence and distributing pamphlets calling for an uprising . wu also maintained that searches of monasteries had turned up large numbers of weapons . rebuttals call for proof tibetan authorities quickly dismissed the chinese allegations and asked beijing for evidence . the india-based tibetan government-in-exile said the claims were propaganda and reiterated the tibetan spiritual leader the dalai lama was not opposed to beijing hosting the olympics games in the summer . " instead of making baseless accusations , they , the chinese government , need to give evidence in support of what they say , " thubten samphel , spokesman of the tibetan government-in-exile , told afp . speaking by telephone from northern hill town of dharamshala , where the tibetan administration is headquartered , he said buddhists see suicide as the " worst form of crime " " our struggle is non-violent and suicide attacks are unheard of in buddhism .
we believe the human form the most precious form on earth and such unsubstantiated claims do no service either to the chinese or the tibetan people , " samphel said . iconic figure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us called the dalai lama " a man of peace " the dalai lama , who won the nobel peace prize in 1989 , has repeatedly denied orchestrating the unrest and spoke out against the protests as soon as they turned violent in the restive region 's capital lhasa in march .
he has always said he wants greater autonomy for tibet under chinese rule , but also an end to repression there . nearly six decades after the himalayan region was occupied by china , the dalai lama is widely seen as an iconic figure representing the tibetan people on the world stage . he has lived in exile in india since fleeing tibet in 1959 following a failed uprising against chinese rule . the us on tuesday also rejected china 's charges that the spiritual leader would back suicide attacks and called on the chinese to engage in dialog with the dalai lama . " the dalai lama is a man of peace , " us state department deputy spokesman tom casey told reporters .

china is furious . kouchner told rtl radio tuesday , april 1 , that he and the bloc 's other 26 foreign ministers will formally invite the dalai lama once a final decision has been made by slovenia , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency . " it sounds like a do-able idea , but this has to be discussed , " slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel told several journalists at the european parliament in brussels .
" to invite the dalai lama , certainly that would be a great honor , a great event .
the dalai lama is a very important religious leader . " neither kouchner nor rupel suggested a date for the proposed meeting . hans-gert poettering , the president of the european parliament has already invited the dalai lama to speak to the assembly in strasbourg , france . outrage in china bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people around the world , including a baby in frankfurt , showed support for the monks chinese state media said china had voiced " strong dissatisfaction " after the eu foreign ministers ' statement . chinese authorities are claiming that the dalai lama 's followers orchestrated the unrest that broke out in the himalayan region last month , when peaceful marches by tibetan monks turned violent .
exiled tibetans currently put the death toll from the chinese crackdown at up to 140 , with another 1000 injured and many detained . beijing strongly opposes talks between the dalai lama and foreign government officials and was angered by his meeting last september with german chancellor angela merkel . " we oppose his separatist activities , " chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman jiang yu told reporters on tuesday .

the government and opposition had been locked in weeks of feuding over the lisbon treaty , which replaces the failed eu constitution . the document has to be ratified by all 27 eu member states if it is to take effect by the 2009 target . there were worries that poland , which nearly derailed earlier european treaty negotiations , would vote it down .

liberal prime minister donald tusk and president lech kaczynski worked out a compromise two days before the vote and then jointly campaigned for their followers to go along .
all told , 384 members of parliament voted in favor of the treaty and 56 voted against it . as part of the compromise , tusk agreed to start working on new legislation that would amend the divisions of power between the president , government and parliament . kaczynski and tusk hailed the treaty as good news for both poland and europe . " poland needs europe and europe needs poland , " tusk said , quoting polish pope john paul ii . while ratification is now largely assured , the senate is set to consider the bill on wednesday and could approve it the same day .

the judges did decide , however , that they 'd allow an exception to the rule . forcing a parent to visit their child is in most cases not in the best interest of the child , concluded germany 's constitutional court in karlsruhe on tuesday , april 1 . the issue of forced visitation reached the constitutional court after a father in brandenburg refused contact with his nine-year-old son , who had been conceived as a result of an extra-marital affair . the married father had been threatened with a fine of 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 39,000 -rrb- for not visiting the boy , which the high court decided was a violation of his personal rights . however , the court ruled that , in exceptional cases where contact with the parent is in the best interest of the child , the state could force visitation by levying fines . mine or his ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paternity tests can be ordered by court but ca n't be done secretly the court decision coincides with a new law in germany that makes it legally easier to carry out paternity tests .
it takes effect on april 1 . until now , both would-be parents and the child had to agree to the test .

the judges did decide , however , that they 'd allow an exception to the rule . forcing a parent to visit their child is in most cases not in the best interest of the child , concluded germany 's constitutional court in karlsruhe on tuesday , april 1 . the issue of forced visitation reached the constitutional court after a father in brandenburg refused contact with his nine-year-old son , who had been conceived as a result of an extra-marital affair . the married father had been threatened with a fine of 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 39,000 -rrb- for not visiting the boy , which the high court decided was a violation of his personal rights . however , the court ruled that , in exceptional cases where contact with the parent is in the best interest of the child , the state could force visitation by levying fines . mine or his ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paternity tests can be ordered by court but ca n't be done secretly the court decision coincides with a new law in germany that makes it legally easier to carry out paternity tests .

the best hoaxes always have a ring of authenticity , and " from the fringe " knows that nowhere is the weird and wonderful more likely to be true than here in germany .
reality can still beat april fool 's pranks every time . according to bavarian media reports , the state government is finally to free up funds to complete the famously unfinished neuschwanstein castle built for king ludwig ii 125 years ago , but put on hold when public coffers ran empty . wolfsburg , apparently , is in talks with the deutsche bundesbank to commemorate the city 's 70th birthday with a limited edition 70 euro note . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coming soon to a plate near you in berlin , state finance minister thilo sarrazin suggested the cash-strapped capital make a fast buck by selling a few of the city zoo 's animals to chefs . " guests would come from as far away as japan and pay a small fortune for a taste of -lrb- world-famous polar bear -rrb- knut carpaccio with five spices powder and lovage jelly , " said celebrity chef tim raue . education authorities in lower saxony , meanwhile , have issued a warning about the risks of exposure to chalk dust faced by over-worked high school students . " now that high school students are required to graduate in eight instead of nine years , the increased concentration of chalk in the classroom is exacerbating cases of neurodermatitis and asthma , " said the authority in a press release dated april 1 . the mood was equally frisky in the western german state of north rhine-westphalia on tuesday , where traffic police revealed that they would be taking ballet classes with professional dancers in order to improve their coordination .
the office issued an announcement predicting that the plan " will help distract motorists from the bleak reality of traffic jams and reduce stress . " swedish furniture retail chain ikea got in on the act with the announcement of germany 's first drive-in store in berlin , where visitors will be able to place orders from behind the driver 's seat , sit back while staff members load the furniture into the trunk and enjoy a snack for just 10 euros -lrb- $ 15 -rrb- extra . looking foolish bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german obsession with nudity is hard to believe even dw-world.de was taken in by the german bookshop owner , who last week announced plans for a naked launch party in his shop for a forthcoming book about nudism . helmut maass admitted tuesday to german news service dpa that the invitation had been an april fool 's joke , after some 30 television , radio and newspaper reporters applied to attend the event . but even though no public reading - clothed or otherwise - was to take place tuesday , maass really is selling a book in his shop in the eastern town of pasewalk about the nudist minority in formerly communist east germany .
it draws on recollections - and indeed photographs - of holidaymakers in east germany before the berlin wall came down in 1989 . the region 's nudist movement has undergone a notable revival in recent years - and a dw-world.de story about a travel agent in the eastern city of erfurt introducing nude charter flights this summer to the baltic island resort of usedom is , believe it or not , definitely true . truth stranger than fiction the strangest story in the papers tuesday was also the honest-to-goodness truth - proving that the abundance of jaw-dropping stories in germany makes april 1 pretty superfluous . in fact , the media 's pranks seem somewhat sober in comparison to some of the real-life reports doing the rounds . take this tale of the 33-year-old woman allegedly suing doctors in the central german town of kassel after she checked in to have wrinkles removed and woke up with a new pair of breasts . " i had lost 100 kilos on a diet and wanted a tummy tuck , " she said . but when she came to after the operation she found doctors had put two 200 gram silicone implants into her breasts , increasing their size from a c cup to a d. you could n't make it up . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

reality can still beat april fool 's pranks every time . according to bavarian media reports , the state government is finally to free up funds to complete the famously unfinished neuschwanstein castle built for king ludwig ii 125 years ago , but put on hold when public coffers ran empty . wolfsburg , apparently , is in talks with the deutsche bundesbank to commemorate the city 's 70th birthday with a limited edition 70 euro note . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coming soon to a plate near you in berlin , state finance minister thilo sarrazin suggested the cash-strapped capital make a fast buck by selling a few of the city zoo 's animals to chefs . " guests would come from as far away as japan and pay a small fortune for a taste of -lrb- world-famous polar bear -rrb- knut carpaccio with five spices powder and lovage jelly , " said celebrity chef tim raue . education authorities in lower saxony , meanwhile , have issued a warning about the risks of exposure to chalk dust faced by over-worked high school students . " now that high school students are required to graduate in eight instead of nine years , the increased concentration of chalk in the classroom is exacerbating cases of neurodermatitis and asthma , " said the authority in a press release dated april 1 . the mood was equally frisky in the western german state of north rhine-westphalia on tuesday , where traffic police revealed that they would be taking ballet classes with professional dancers in order to improve their coordination .
the office issued an announcement predicting that the plan " will help distract motorists from the bleak reality of traffic jams and reduce stress . " swedish furniture retail chain ikea got in on the act with the announcement of germany 's first drive-in store in berlin , where visitors will be able to place orders from behind the driver 's seat , sit back while staff members load the furniture into the trunk and enjoy a snack for just 10 euros -lrb- $ 15 -rrb- extra . looking foolish bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german obsession with nudity is hard to believe even dw-world.de was taken in by the german bookshop owner , who last week announced plans for a naked launch party in his shop for a forthcoming book about nudism . helmut maass admitted tuesday to german news service dpa that the invitation had been an april fool 's joke , after some 30 television , radio and newspaper reporters applied to attend the event . but even though no public reading - clothed or otherwise - was to take place tuesday , maass really is selling a book in his shop in the eastern town of pasewalk about the nudist minority in formerly communist east germany .
it draws on recollections - and indeed photographs - of holidaymakers in east germany before the berlin wall came down in 1989 . the region 's nudist movement has undergone a notable revival in recent years - and a dw-world.de story about a travel agent in the eastern city of erfurt introducing nude charter flights this summer to the baltic island resort of usedom is , believe it or not , definitely true . truth stranger than fiction the strangest story in the papers tuesday was also the honest-to-goodness truth - proving that the abundance of jaw-dropping stories in germany makes april 1 pretty superfluous . in fact , the media 's pranks seem somewhat sober in comparison to some of the real-life reports doing the rounds . take this tale of the 33-year-old woman allegedly suing doctors in the central german town of kassel after she checked in to have wrinkles removed and woke up with a new pair of breasts . " i had lost 100 kilos on a diet and wanted a tummy tuck , " she said . but when she came to after the operation she found doctors had put two 200 gram silicone implants into her breasts , increasing their size from a c cup to a d. you could n't make it up . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the judges did decide , however , that they 'd allow an exception to the rule . forcing a parent to visit their child is in most cases not in the best interest of the child , concluded germany 's constitutional court in karlsruhe on tuesday , april 1 . the issue of forced visitation reached the constitutional court after a father in brandenburg refused contact with his nine-year-old son , who had been conceived as a result of an extra-marital affair . the married father had been threatened with a fine of 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 39,000 -rrb- for not visiting the boy , which the high court decided was a violation of his personal rights . however , the court ruled that , in exceptional cases where contact with the parent is in the best interest of the child , the state could force visitation by levying fines . mine or his ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paternity tests can be ordered by court but ca n't be done secretly the court decision coincides with a new law in germany that makes it legally easier to carry out paternity tests .
it takes effect on april 1 . until now , both would-be parents and the child had to agree to the test .
now , one of the three parties can demand a paternity test in a family court , even if one or both of the other parties are opposed .
secret tests are still not recognized by law and have no influence on custody rights and child support . the law effectively allows a man to request a paternity test against the will of his alleged child 's mother and without needing to resort to a legal challenge , which would automatically sever his legal ties to the child . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the decision only applies in eu countries with gay partnership laws and it will be up to the national courts to decide " whether a surviving life partner is in a situation comparable to that of a spouse , " the court said in a statement . the lesbian and gay federation in germany welcomed the ruling .

" it 's not the commission or any other european institution that imposes on germany or any other member state whether or not marriage or registered couples must be treated equally , " a european commission spokeswoman said . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche bank had hoped to post an 8.4 billion euro profit in 2008 , but said that might not happen . several public german banks are also among those hit hardest by the subprime crisis , with business lender ikb only surviving with help from the government and public savings banks , and regional bank sachenlb rescued by lbbw . yet there 's a sense among analysts that the worst might be over , and that optimism could be seen in the european stock market tuesday .
there was a sense that the banks are addressing the problems and a hope that the worst of the announcements might be over , peter dixon , an economist at commerzbank , told reuters news agency .

the election commission -lrb- zec -rrb- is counting with at an excessively leisurely pace .
this nourishes the suspicion that the results are being manipulated behind the scenes in order to secure another term in office for president robert mugabe . the opposition movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- sees itself as in the lead .
as does the ruling zanu-pf party .
an independent review is not possible .
nevertheless it seems extremely unlikely that mugabe would have managed convince a majority of zimbabweans to re-elect him .
he has managed to push the country 's economy over the brink .
chaos , scarcity and hyperinflation of more than 100,000 percent each year do n't create ideal election advertisements . in the run-up to the elections , human rights organizations , including amnesty international and human rights watch , complained of arbitrary arrests , one-sided media reports and government vote buying .
a free and just election was impossible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : johannes beck only friendly states such as china , russia , iran and neighboring african countries were allowed to send election monitors .
the involvement of southern african development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- countries remains a frustration , as does the lack of criticism from democratic neighboring countries such as mozambique .
joaquim chissano , the former president of mozambique , told deutsche welle that he has no right to question the intentions of other leaders .
and zimbabwe 's president insists that this election was free , transparent and lawful . chissano 's mindset is typical of the kind that allows african politicians to speaking out about the human rights abuses and poor governance of neighboring countries .
this practice of looking the other way and holding one 's tongue is a false understanding of african solidarity . growth and development require the ability to criticize and take criticism .
there are some examples of this in africa , such as the african peer review mechanism .
but , far too often , reflexes persist from the time of the common struggles against european colonial powers . during conversations with africans on this topic , one often hears that european governments have a double standard .
they are only interested in democracy when it fits their interests , africans say . and this is where africans are right .
zimbabwe 's former colonial power , great britain , only brought up the subject of human rights after british farmers lost their land .
there were very few protests from the west when , in the early 1980s , robert mugabe killed tens of thousands of opposition members in the matebeleland region . the discussions about mugabe 's participation in the eu-africa summit held in lisbon in december 2007 were also misguided .
at the same time as they were condemning mugabe , not a single european leader spoke out against libyan dictator moammar gadhafi 's summit attendance .
at least there are still elections in zimbabwe , something that the libyan opposition ca n't even dream about . european governments will likely criticize the elections in zimbabwe as neither free nor fair , as they should .
they should increase pressure and advocate for more democracy . but europeans must then live up to their own high standards , even when there are n't white farmers involved .
let 's not forget that other african countries , such as libya , gambia and ethiopia also have poor track records in the areas of democracy , human rights and freedom of speech . johannes beck is the deputy head of dw-radio 's africa desk and heads the dw-radio portuguese service -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the election commission -lrb- zec -rrb- is counting with at an excessively leisurely pace .
this nourishes the suspicion that the results are being manipulated behind the scenes in order to secure another term in office for president robert mugabe . the opposition movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- sees itself as in the lead .
as does the ruling zanu-pf party .
an independent review is not possible .
nevertheless it seems extremely unlikely that mugabe would have managed convince a majority of zimbabweans to re-elect him .
he has managed to push the country 's economy over the brink .
chaos , scarcity and hyperinflation of more than 100,000 percent each year do n't create ideal election advertisements . in the run-up to the elections , human rights organizations , including amnesty international and human rights watch , complained of arbitrary arrests , one-sided media reports and government vote buying .
a free and just election was impossible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : johannes beck only friendly states such as china , russia , iran and neighboring african countries were allowed to send election monitors .
the involvement of southern african development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- countries remains a frustration , as does the lack of criticism from democratic neighboring countries such as mozambique .
joaquim chissano , the former president of mozambique , told deutsche welle that he has no right to question the intentions of other leaders .
and zimbabwe 's president insists that this election was free , transparent and lawful . chissano 's mindset is typical of the kind that allows african politicians to speaking out about the human rights abuses and poor governance of neighboring countries .
this practice of looking the other way and holding one 's tongue is a false understanding of african solidarity . growth and development require the ability to criticize and take criticism .
there are some examples of this in africa , such as the african peer review mechanism .
but , far too often , reflexes persist from the time of the common struggles against european colonial powers . during conversations with africans on this topic , one often hears that european governments have a double standard .
they are only interested in democracy when it fits their interests , africans say . and this is where africans are right .
zimbabwe 's former colonial power , great britain , only brought up the subject of human rights after british farmers lost their land .
there were very few protests from the west when , in the early 1980s , robert mugabe killed tens of thousands of opposition members in the matebeleland region . the discussions about mugabe 's participation in the eu-africa summit held in lisbon in december 2007 were also misguided .
at the same time as they were condemning mugabe , not a single european leader spoke out against libyan dictator moammar gadhafi 's summit attendance .
at least there are still elections in zimbabwe , something that the libyan opposition ca n't even dream about . european governments will likely criticize the elections in zimbabwe as neither free nor fair , as they should .
they should increase pressure and advocate for more democracy . but europeans must then live up to their own high standards , even when there are n't white farmers involved .
let 's not forget that other african countries , such as libya , gambia and ethiopia also have poor track records in the areas of democracy , human rights and freedom of speech . johannes beck is the deputy head of dw-radio 's africa desk and heads the dw-radio portuguese service -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 01.04.2008 opinion : zimbabwe 's election puts europe to the test großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while european governments should criticize the flawed elections in zimbabwe , they should also examine their double standards , says deutsche welle 's johannes beck . the first results have begun slowly trickling out of zimbabwe 's capital , harare .
the election commission -lrb- zec -rrb- is counting with at an excessively leisurely pace .
this nourishes the suspicion that the results are being manipulated behind the scenes in order to secure another term in office for president robert mugabe . the opposition movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- sees itself as in the lead .
as does the ruling zanu-pf party .
an independent review is not possible .
nevertheless it seems extremely unlikely that mugabe would have managed convince a majority of zimbabweans to re-elect him .
he has managed to push the country 's economy over the brink .
chaos , scarcity and hyperinflation of more than 100,000 percent each year do n't create ideal election advertisements . in the run-up to the elections , human rights organizations , including amnesty international and human rights watch , complained of arbitrary arrests , one-sided media reports and government vote buying .
a free and just election was impossible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : johannes beck only friendly states such as china , russia , iran and neighboring african countries were allowed to send election monitors .
the involvement of southern african development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- countries remains a frustration , as does the lack of criticism from democratic neighboring countries such as mozambique .
joaquim chissano , the former president of mozambique , told deutsche welle that he has no right to question the intentions of other leaders .
and zimbabwe 's president insists that this election was free , transparent and lawful . chissano 's mindset is typical of the kind that allows african politicians to speaking out about the human rights abuses and poor governance of neighboring countries .
this practice of looking the other way and holding one 's tongue is a false understanding of african solidarity . growth and development require the ability to criticize and take criticism .
there are some examples of this in africa , such as the african peer review mechanism .
but , far too often , reflexes persist from the time of the common struggles against european colonial powers . during conversations with africans on this topic , one often hears that european governments have a double standard .
they are only interested in democracy when it fits their interests , africans say . and this is where africans are right .
zimbabwe 's former colonial power , great britain , only brought up the subject of human rights after british farmers lost their land .
there were very few protests from the west when , in the early 1980s , robert mugabe killed tens of thousands of opposition members in the matebeleland region . the discussions about mugabe 's participation in the eu-africa summit held in lisbon in december 2007 were also misguided .
at the same time as they were condemning mugabe , not a single european leader spoke out against libyan dictator moammar gadhafi 's summit attendance .

the judges did decide , however , that they 'd allow an exception to the rule . forcing a parent to visit their child is in most cases not in the best interest of the child , concluded germany 's constitutional court in karlsruhe on tuesday , april 1 . the issue of forced visitation reached the constitutional court after a father in brandenburg refused contact with his nine-year-old son , who had been conceived as a result of an extra-marital affair . the married father had been threatened with a fine of 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 39,000 -rrb- for not visiting the boy , which the high court decided was a violation of his personal rights . however , the court ruled that , in exceptional cases where contact with the parent is in the best interest of the child , the state could force visitation by levying fines . mine or his ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paternity tests can be ordered by court but ca n't be done secretly the court decision coincides with a new law in germany that makes it legally easier to carry out paternity tests .
it takes effect on april 1 . until now , both would-be parents and the child had to agree to the test .
now , one of the three parties can demand a paternity test in a family court , even if one or both of the other parties are opposed .
secret tests are still not recognized by law and have no influence on custody rights and child support . the law effectively allows a man to request a paternity test against the will of his alleged child 's mother and without needing to resort to a legal challenge , which would automatically sever his legal ties to the child . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 01.04.2008 to stay in the game , more german stadiums going corporate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cash coming in for the stuttgart stadium 's new name will go toward a facelift stuttgart 's soccer stadium is becoming the mercedes benz arena .
it 's another example of the corporate rechristening of german stadiums that brings in cash for players or facility spruce-ups , but it has some crying foul . what 's in a name , after all ? when it comes to german stadiums , a lot of serious fans would say a lot .
there is tradition , the relationship with the fans , and the primacy of the sport over commerce . but those concerns appear to be falling on deaf ears as the trend of german stadiums selling their naming rights to corporations in multi-million-euro deals continues unabated . in the latest , carmaker daimler , stuttgart 's mayor and the head of the vfb stuttgart soccer club announced on monday , march 31 , that the city 's gottlieb daimler stadium will be renamed after the mercedes luxury automobile .
daimler bought the stadium 's naming rights for 23 million euros -lrb- $ 36 million -rrb- , according to the daily die welt . the club will use the money to cover most of its portion of a 66-million-euro stadium renovation , which will turn it from a mixed-use venue with track-and-field facilities to an arena solely dedicated to germany 's number one sport : soccer . slow rumble , then the avalanche vfb stuttgart is not breaking any new ground by changing its stadium 's name to that of a large company .
the trend in germany began in 1997 , when the city of fuerth 's ronhof sports park became playmobile stadium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bayarena stadium was germany 's second to get a new moniker two years later , leverkusen 's stadium was rebaptized the bayarena and then in 2001 , hamburg 's volksparkstadion got a new identity as the aol arena . since then , the process has accelerated , with at least one-half of the stadiums home to first-division teams getting new signage with names like commerzbank , insurer generali , or brewer veltins . " you can be sure that the stadiums that do n't currently have a commercial name are in negotiations about one now , " said maik thesing of the stadium web site stadionwelt-business.de. needed cash seen from the business side , a powerful corporate sponsor willing to write a big check to get its name on a building brings many benefits .
when teams or communities build new stadiums , selling the naming rights to companies with deep pockets can often take care of the largest part of their expenses , such as was the case with munich 's allianz arena . bildunterschrift : the allianz arena name was n't as controversial - it was never known as anything else if the stadium already exists , a new name can bring money into team coffers , money that can be used to renovate the facility , or , perhaps most importantly , fund expensive transfer fees to buy skilled players off other teams or pay the high salaries top talent requires .
average personnel costs for german league clubs were 29.5 million euros in the 2006-07 season . " if you want to survive on the international level , you have to buy in the best players , " said benedikt roemmelt , a sports economist at the institute for sports science in jena .
" if a german club ca n't afford to stay on the same financial level as , for example , an english club , then the german club does n't have a chance . " what a stadium gets for changing its name depends on its location and the reputation of its home club .
generali agreed to pay 400,000 euros a year to rename a stadium in the munich suburb of unterhaching , commerzbank is paying 3 million euros a year in frankfurt , and allianz pays 6 million euros annually to have its name on the new , architecturally significant arena in munich , home to bayern munich , one of germany 's top clubs . selling-out ? despite the benefits , many fans take a dimmer view as what many see as a corporate sell-out and the further commercialization of sport .
most renaming plans in germany have been accompanied by protest actions by fans . after hamburg 's stadium was renamed aol arena , fans brought a banner to matches that read " volkspark stadium forever ! " referring to its original identity .
in nuremberg , many were outraged when a local bank bought the naming rights to frankenstadion in 2006 and it became easycredit stadium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fans feel commercial interests are getting the upper hand " can nothing stop the commercialization of sports ?
can these financial sharks do anything they want ? " asked one irate individual in a fan club forum .
" what 's next , renaming nuremberg easycredit city ? " one fan group held a symbolic name change of its own , calling the facility max morlock stadium after a local soccer hero .
that name has proven much more popular . some media organizations have also refused to go along .
the daily westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung refuses to use the new names in its headlines , calling them " linguistic monsters " and not wanting to participate in what the paper calls " product placement . " matter of getting used to but this trend toward new and sometimes temporary identities - hamburg 's renamed aol arena has been renamed again and is now hsh nordbank arena - appears to be going strong .
although according to sports economist roemmelt , because so many stadium operators want to get in on the corporate game , the amounts they can charge for naming rights is going down somewhat . and not every fan is against the practice , if it 's seen as bringing benefits .
mark friedrich , who is on the board of the fan club stuttgarter junxx , says he has n't heard that much negative reaction to the new mercedes-benz-arena , especially since the new money will cover a renovation project that will bring fans ' seats closer to the action on the field . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since mercedes is a home-town company , the renaming has n't ruffled as many feathers in stuttgart " we do n't want commercial interests to completely take over , but we do n't see that happening here , " he said .
" besides , mercedes has its home base here in stuttgart . " thesing of stadionwelt-business.de said he thinks there will likely be less furor in the future as the marketing of everything in sports , stadiums included , becomes more common , and finally accepted .
he pointed out that advertisements on jerseys and the advertising banners surrounding the soccer pitch have been around for decades and are not even registered by most fans these days . " a stadium renaming that 's happened in the past five years is still noticed , " he said .
" but in 20 years , it 's likely no one find it objectionable . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's another example of the corporate rechristening of german stadiums that brings in cash for players or facility spruce-ups , but it has some crying foul . what 's in a name , after all ? when it comes to german stadiums , a lot of serious fans would say a lot .
there is tradition , the relationship with the fans , and the primacy of the sport over commerce . but those concerns appear to be falling on deaf ears as the trend of german stadiums selling their naming rights to corporations in multi-million-euro deals continues unabated . in the latest , carmaker daimler , stuttgart 's mayor and the head of the vfb stuttgart soccer club announced on monday , march 31 , that the city 's gottlieb daimler stadium will be renamed after the mercedes luxury automobile .
daimler bought the stadium 's naming rights for 23 million euros -lrb- $ 36 million -rrb- , according to the daily die welt . the club will use the money to cover most of its portion of a 66-million-euro stadium renovation , which will turn it from a mixed-use venue with track-and-field facilities to an arena solely dedicated to germany 's number one sport : soccer . slow rumble , then the avalanche vfb stuttgart is not breaking any new ground by changing its stadium 's name to that of a large company .
the trend in germany began in 1997 , when the city of fuerth 's ronhof sports park became playmobile stadium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bayarena stadium was germany 's second to get a new moniker two years later , leverkusen 's stadium was rebaptized the bayarena and then in 2001 , hamburg 's volksparkstadion got a new identity as the aol arena . since then , the process has accelerated , with at least one-half of the stadiums home to first-division teams getting new signage with names like commerzbank , insurer generali , or brewer veltins .

when teams or communities build new stadiums , selling the naming rights to companies with deep pockets can often take care of the largest part of their expenses , such as was the case with munich 's allianz arena . bildunterschrift : the allianz arena name was n't as controversial - it was never known as anything else if the stadium already exists , a new name can bring money into team coffers , money that can be used to renovate the facility , or , perhaps most importantly , fund expensive transfer fees to buy skilled players off other teams or pay the high salaries top talent requires .

" if a german club ca n't afford to stay on the same financial level as , for example , an english club , then the german club does n't have a chance . " what a stadium gets for changing its name depends on its location and the reputation of its home club .
generali agreed to pay 400,000 euros a year to rename a stadium in the munich suburb of unterhaching , commerzbank is paying 3 million euros a year in frankfurt , and allianz pays 6 million euros annually to have its name on the new , architecturally significant arena in munich , home to bayern munich , one of germany 's top clubs . selling-out ? despite the benefits , many fans take a dimmer view as what many see as a corporate sell-out and the further commercialization of sport .
most renaming plans in germany have been accompanied by protest actions by fans . after hamburg 's stadium was renamed aol arena , fans brought a banner to matches that read " volkspark stadium forever ! " referring to its original identity .
in nuremberg , many were outraged when a local bank bought the naming rights to frankenstadion in 2006 and it became easycredit stadium . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some fans feel commercial interests are getting the upper hand " can nothing stop the commercialization of sports ?

" what 's next , renaming nuremberg easycredit city ? " one fan group held a symbolic name change of its own , calling the facility max morlock stadium after a local soccer hero .
that name has proven much more popular . some media organizations have also refused to go along .

the judges did decide , however , that they 'd allow an exception to the rule . forcing a parent to visit their child is in most cases not in the best interest of the child , concluded germany 's constitutional court in karlsruhe on tuesday , april 1 . the issue of forced visitation reached the constitutional court after a father in brandenburg refused contact with his nine-year-old son , who had been conceived as a result of an extra-marital affair . the married father had been threatened with a fine of 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 39,000 -rrb- for not visiting the boy , which the high court decided was a violation of his personal rights . however , the court ruled that , in exceptional cases where contact with the parent is in the best interest of the child , the state could force visitation by levying fines . mine or his ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paternity tests can be ordered by court but ca n't be done secretly the court decision coincides with a new law in germany that makes it legally easier to carry out paternity tests .
it takes effect on april 1 . until now , both would-be parents and the child had to agree to the test .
now , one of the three parties can demand a paternity test in a family court , even if one or both of the other parties are opposed .
secret tests are still not recognized by law and have no influence on custody rights and child support . the law effectively allows a man to request a paternity test against the will of his alleged child 's mother and without needing to resort to a legal challenge , which would automatically sever his legal ties to the child . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the ruling , however , only applies in member states where gay partnerships are legally recognized . the european court of justice in luxemburg ruled on tuesday , april 1 , that , " a life partner of the same sex may be entitled to a survivor 's pension under an occupational pension scheme . " the decision only applies in eu countries with gay partnership laws and it will be up to the national courts to decide " whether a surviving life partner is in a situation comparable to that of a spouse , " the court said in a statement . the lesbian and gay federation in germany welcomed the ruling . " now the german courts only have to decide whether life partners are comparable to spouses in this case , and that can hardly be denied , " the organization 's spokesman manfred bruns told the associated press . german took pension case to court bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gay partnership , but not marriage , is recognized in germany the case was initiated by tadao maruko , who was in a registered partnership under german law with a costume designer .
when his partner died in 2005 , maruko was denied his pension and took the matter to a german court , which passed it on to the eu court . maruko had been discriminated against on the grounds of his sexual orientation , concluded the eu court .
german law grants legal rights to life partners that are similar to those of married couples .
gay marriage , however , is not recognized in germany . the eu commission welcomed tuesday 's ruling as " strengthening the principle of non-discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation , " while emphasizing that it was up to bloc 's 27 members to decide whether they would grant registered same-sex partners the same rights as married couples . " it 's not the commission or any other european institution that imposes on germany or any other member state whether or not marriage or registered couples must be treated equally , " a european commission spokeswoman said . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the remainder , where parking is run by private companies , will have to reduce costs from june until contracts expire .
the move , the first in the uk , was announced last month in a bid by ministers to end an " unfair expense " .
meanwhile , from today children in wales will be issued with free toothpaste and brushes as part of a campaign to improve the poor state of their teeth .
' inconvenience ' the commitment to free hospital parking was contained in the coalition agreement for the welsh assembly government by labour and plaid cymru .
welsh health minister edwina hart said : " today 's car parking changes mean the start of a fairer and more consistent policy for hospitals across wales .
" over time , all nhs patients , visitors and those who care for them will not have the expense or inconvenience of charges . "
welsh nhs trusts collected £ 5.4m from car parks in 2006/07 .
but major hospitals including the university hospital of wales in cardiff , glan clwyd in denbighshire , neath port talbot and the west wales general at carmarthen will still have charges , as they are run by private contractors .
patients , staff and visitors will only have to pay at four sites by may 2011 under the welsh assembly government scheme .
the move previously provoked a row between cardiff and westminster .
privately-run hospital parking princess of wales , bridgend 2006-2011 glanrhyd , bridgend 2006-2011 neath port talbot 2002-2032 univ hospital of wales , cardiff 1996-2021 west wales general , carmarthen 2003-2018 prince phillip , llanelli 2003-2018 glan clwyd , bodelwyddan 2006-2011 wrexham maelor 2005-2008 royal glamorgan 2006-2011 withybush , pembs 2004-2009 contracts for private contractors operating hospital parking .
source : welsh assembly government department of health minister ben bradshaw said the money would be better spent on patient care .
but the assembly government said waiting time comparisons can not be made because its figures are compiled differently .
meanwhile , it is also the first anniversary of free prescriptions in wales , while in scotland the cost of a prescription has been reduced to £ 5 after a cut of almost £ 2 as part of a wider scheme to make them free by 2011 .
however , in england , the cost of a prescription rises by 25p to £ 7.10 .
and two " super " trusts in south wales will be formed from the merger of nhs trusts .
the former north glamorgan nhs trust has been merged with pontypridd and rhondda nhs trust to create the new cwm taf nhs trust .
it will provide services to around 333,000 people , primarily in the communities of merthyr tydfil and rhondda cynon taff .
the new merged trust will oversee two general hospitals - prince charles in merthyr and the royal glamorgan in llantrisant - along with seven community hospitals and other services .
swansea and bro morgannwg nhs trusts have also been merged , amalgamating services and facilities in the swansea , bridgend , neath and port talbot areas .
it will be called abertawe bro morgannwg university nhs trust .
paul williams , chief executive of bro morgannwg nhs trust , said the merger would bring benefits to patients , staff and the local economy .
" it will strengthen hospital services in the region and enhance teaching and research opportunities , " he said .
the trusts said the mergers will provide a large enough patient base to sustain and enhance services , including specialist ones , and will pool staff expertise and experience .

the world 's largest marsupial carnivore is facing extinction from a mystery facial cancer .
but scientists say cedric appears to be naturally resistant to the contagious tumours which have killed half the devil population in tasmania .
cedric is the first tasmanian devil to have shown any immunity from the disfiguring disease .
infected animals become so consumed by the cancer they can no longer eat or see and eventually die of starvation .
breakthrough cedric was captured in western tasmania last year , along with his half-brother , clinky .
both were injected with dead tumours by scientists .
clinky produced no antibodies , but cedric did and appears to have built-in defences against the mystery illness .
the experiments have now moved up a gear .
researcher alex kriess says the pair have had live cancer cells inserted into their faces .
" they have n't developed a tumour so far , " he said .
" we injected very few cells so it might take a while until they develop anything that we can see . "
cedric 's apparent resistance to the disease has been seen as a significant breakthrough .
the facial tumours are decimating devil numbers on tasmania 's east coast .
cedric is from a genetically different population on the other side of the island .
scientists hope marsupials that share his genetic pattern could also be immune to the cancer or capable of responding to a vaccine .
if real progress is not made soon , experts worry that the tasmanian devil could be extinct within 20 years .

infected animals become so consumed by the cancer they can no longer eat or see and eventually die of starvation .
breakthrough cedric was captured in western tasmania last year , along with his half-brother , clinky .
both were injected with dead tumours by scientists .
clinky produced no antibodies , but cedric did and appears to have built-in defences against the mystery illness .
the experiments have now moved up a gear .
researcher alex kriess says the pair have had live cancer cells inserted into their faces .
" they have n't developed a tumour so far , " he said .
" we injected very few cells so it might take a while until they develop anything that we can see . "
cedric 's apparent resistance to the disease has been seen as a significant breakthrough .
the facial tumours are decimating devil numbers on tasmania 's east coast .
cedric is from a genetically different population on the other side of the island .
scientists hope marsupials that share his genetic pattern could also be immune to the cancer or capable of responding to a vaccine .
if real progress is not made soon , experts worry that the tasmanian devil could be extinct within 20 years .

the discovery was announced at the royal astronomical society 's largest ever national astronomy meeting at queen 's .
the extrasolar planets - which orbit around other stars - were found by an international team using cameras in the canary islands and south africa .
the queen 's astronomers are using cameras designed and manufactured by belfast company andor technology .
the wide area search for planets -lrb- superwasp -rrb- project uses two sets of cameras to watch for events known as transits , in which a planet passes directly in front of a star and blocks out some of its light , so from the earth , the star temporarily appears a little fainter .
the cameras work as robots , surveying a large area of the sky at once .
each night , astronomers have data from millions of stars which they check for transits .
the transit method also allows scientists to deduce the size and mass of each planet .
forty-five planets have now been discovered using the transit method , and since they were set up in 2004 , the superwasp cameras have found 15 of them - making them the most successful discovery instruments for this type of work in the world .
announcing the results was qub 's dr don pollacco .
speaking before the meeting , he said : " superwasp is now a planet-finding production line and will revolutionise the detection of large planets and our understanding of how they were formed .
" it 's a great triumph for european astronomers .
" queen 's and the particle physics and astronomy research council funded the first superwasp on la palma ; the camera was designed and built at queen 's . "
among the planets discovered using superwasp are wasp-12b .
a year - its orbital period - on wasp-12b is just 1.1 days .
the planet is so close to its star that its daytime temperature could reach a searing 2,300c .
scientists have found more than 270 extrasolar planets since the first one was discovered in the early 1990s , but the pace of discovery has been accelerated by superwasp technology .
the particle physics and astronomy research council has changed its name to the science and technology facilities council .
it is the main astronomy funding body in the uk .

the discovery was announced at the royal astronomical society 's largest ever national astronomy meeting at queen 's .
the extrasolar planets - which orbit around other stars - were found by an international team using cameras in the canary islands and south africa .
the queen 's astronomers are using cameras designed and manufactured by belfast company andor technology .
the wide area search for planets -lrb- superwasp -rrb- project uses two sets of cameras to watch for events known as transits , in which a planet passes directly in front of a star and blocks out some of its light , so from the earth , the star temporarily appears a little fainter .
dr don pollacco from queen 's university will announce discoveries the cameras work as robots , surveying a large area of the sky at once .
each night , astronomers have data from millions of stars which they check for transits .
the transit method also allows scientists to deduce the size and mass of each planet .
forty-five planets have now been discovered using the transit method , and since they were set up in 2004 , the superwasp cameras have found 15 of them - making them the most successful discovery instruments for this type of work in the world .
announcing the results was qub 's dr don pollacco .
speaking before the meeting , he said : " superwasp is now a planet-finding production line and will revolutionise the detection of large planets and our understanding of how they were formed .
" it 's a great triumph for european astronomers .
the cameras were designed by andor technology " queen 's and the particle physics and astronomy research council funded the first superwasp on la palma ; the camera was designed and built at queen 's . "
among the planets discovered using superwasp are wasp-12b .
a year - its orbital period - on wasp-12b is just 1.1 days .
the planet is so close to its star that its daytime temperature could reach a searing 2,300c .
scientists have found more than 270 extrasolar planets since the first one was discovered in the early 1990s , but the pace of discovery has been accelerated by superwasp technology .
the particle physics and astronomy research council has changed its name to the science and technology facilities council .
it is the main astronomy funding body in the uk .

the arch bridge for pedestrians and cyclists has met with continued local opposition despite being approved by the county council .
a district council poll found 3,173 people against the plans and 441 in favour , with a turnout of 18.1 % .
a clear majority wanted lucy 's mill bridge upgraded or a new bridge nearby .
in 2006 , 56 % of townspeople who responded to a questionnaire said they did not want the new bridge .

the findings follow an 18-month amf probe into whether managers at the firm were aware of problems affecting its a380 planes before they sold shares .
when details of delays to the superjumbo project were announced in june 2006 , shares in eads slumped .
eads said that it would " exercise vigorously " its right to defend itself .
" eads will support its managers in their defence , it intends to demonstrate that it has applied standards of excellence when communicating to the market and has acted with full transparency . "
however it accepted that the proceedings may have " significant consequences on its image and reputation " .
and one of its key shareholders , lagardere , said that it was " confident of its ability to provide all explanations needed to clear it " .
the regulator will now refer the case to paris prosecutors .
it added that despite its findings no one had yet been found guilty of any illegal activity .
the trading in shares occurred shortly before news about delays to the a380 superjumbo were made public last june .
eads denies it knew about delays when millions of euros of shares were sold .
the announcement wiped 26 % off the value of the franco-german aerospace giant .

the findings follow an 18-month amf probe into whether managers at the firm were aware of problems affecting its a380 planes before they sold shares .
when details of delays to the superjumbo project were announced in june 2006 , shares in eads slumped .
eads said that it would " exercise vigorously " its right to defend itself .
" eads will support its managers in their defence , it intends to demonstrate that it has applied standards of excellence when communicating to the market and has acted with full transparency . "
however it accepted that the proceedings may have " significant consequences on its image and reputation " .
and one of its key shareholders , lagardere , said that it was " confident of its ability to provide all explanations needed to clear it " .
the regulator will now refer the case to paris prosecutors .
it added that despite its findings no one had yet been found guilty of any illegal activity .
the trading in shares occurred shortly before news about delays to the a380 superjumbo were made public last june .
eads denies it knew about delays when millions of euros of shares were sold .
the announcement wiped 26 % off the value of the franco-german aerospace giant .

surrey was one of seven police authorities to be threatened with a budget cap for forcing council tax rises beyond the government 's limit .
it could take up to three months for a final decision to be agreed .
at a meeting in guildford , members endorsed the local policing plan , but would not give any official approval .
mark rowley , temporary chief constable of surrey police , said : " we will continue to pursue our priorities although we are being forced to delay and disrupt our plans . "
plan ' deplored ' he said the risk of capping meant investment in some operations would be delayed " until the funding situation becomes clearer " .
initiatives such as operation shield , which will tackle criminals who target surrey from outside the county , and operation contest , an anti-terrorism plan , will be affected .
jim smith , chairman of surrey police authority , said it " deplored " the government 's plan .
he said : " the authority worked very carefully through the options available as part of a three-year plan , and we are disappointed that the local government minister has not even looked at our plan in making his decision .
' great concern ' " the authority calls on government to give proper consideration to our proposals and recognise that the authority 's budget is part of a three-year plan . "
he added : " a reduction of around £ 2m means surrey police will be prevented from effectively tackling the risks facing the public , and this causes me great concern . "
council tax gathered from local residents is shared among a number of bodies , including the council , police and fire services .
if any of these stakeholders demand an excessive share of the pot , then the council passes on a rise in council tax to residents .

surrey was one of seven police authorities to be threatened with a budget cap for forcing council tax rises beyond the government 's limit .
it could take up to three months for a final decision to be agreed .
at a meeting in guildford , members endorsed the local policing plan , but would not give any official approval .
mark rowley , temporary chief constable of surrey police , said : " we will continue to pursue our priorities although we are being forced to delay and disrupt our plans . "
plan ' deplored ' he said the risk of capping meant investment in some operations would be delayed " until the funding situation becomes clearer " .
initiatives such as operation shield , which will tackle criminals who target surrey from outside the county , and operation contest , an anti-terrorism plan , will be affected .
jim smith , chairman of surrey police authority , said it " deplored " the government 's plan .
he said : " the authority worked very carefully through the options available as part of a three-year plan , and we are disappointed that the local government minister has not even looked at our plan in making his decision .
' great concern ' " the authority calls on government to give proper consideration to our proposals and recognise that the authority 's budget is part of a three-year plan . "
he added : " a reduction of around £ 2m means surrey police will be prevented from effectively tackling the risks facing the public , and this causes me great concern . "
council tax gathered from local residents is shared among a number of bodies , including the council , police and fire services .

the service , which is based at east midlands airport , will need £ 1.5m a year to keep it running .
leicester resident engelbert humperdink has agreed to be the charity 's patron and will head up fundraising campaigns .
organisers have contacted 300,000 households in the three counties to appeal for further donations for the service which is staffed by a doctor .
financial future andy williamson , director of the derbyshire , leicestershire and rutland air ambulance -lrb- dlraa -rrb- , said : " we urgently need people to become regular donors .
" if everyone in the area signs up to make a monthly donation of just £ 2 , we will create a good financial foundation for the service .
" we ca n't afford to lose this type of service . "
the dlraa is managed by warwickshire and northamptonshire air ambulance .

the military helicopter was intercepted on sunday by two colombian aircraft before returning , colombia said .
ecuador says it was an accident .
relations have been tense since a colombian raid into ecuador on 1 march killed a senior farc rebel leader .
the charge came after ecuador sued colombia in the international court at the hague over anti-drug fumigation .
in the lawsuit , filed at the international court of justice in the netherlands on monday , ecuador alleges that colombian efforts to eradicate illicit coca crops is damaging legitimate crops in ecuador .
quito says the aerial crop spraying is also a violation of ecuador 's sovereignty .
colombia has used aerial spraying in an effort to wipe out the coca crops used to produce the cocaine which helps fuel the country 's four-decade civil conflict .

the colombian helicopters " tried to establish radio contact with said helicopter with negative results " , the statement said .
colombia 's raid into ecuador sparked a regional crisis the gazelle was escorted by the colombian helicopters and ordered to land at an airport in tumaco but it " descended suddenly and flew low to the south " .
the colombians then called off the interception , their statement said .
in response , the ecuadorean foreign ministry said the helicopter had been on a supply mission to a base near the border and had strayed into colombian airspace due to a " navigation error " .
" the government of ecuador regrets the involuntary overflight ... and stresses that it was a completely accidental event of no significant import or duration , " a statement said .
colombia 's 1 march raid into ecuador struck a revolutionary armed forces of colombia -lrb- farc -rrb- camp located just across the border .
a senior farc commander , raul reyes , and more than 20 other people , including an ecuadorean and four mexican nationals , were killed .
the raid provoked the worst regional crisis in recent years .
ecuador and venezuela sent troops to their borders , withdrawing them several days later after a meeting of regional leaders in the dominican republic soothed tensions .
