12 , in paris of the 15 euro zone leaders , she said that the intervention had to be internationally coordinated . " we are not doing this for the sake of the banks but in the interests of the people , " she told the mass-market bild . as in the united states , the german left has grumbled at a rescue likely to cost tens of billions of euros , saying it comes only a few years after a reduction in the scale of welfare handouts to the german poor . though she called sunday 's euro-zone meeting important to bring a return of confidence in european markets , merkel reiterated her opposition to a joint bail-out by the euro zone , saying each country must deal with its own troubles . " this meeting is to decide on coordinated joint action in the euro zone so that every country in the coming days can put in place measures that stabilize the financial markets , " merkel told reporters as she arrived for the meeting at the elysee presidential palace . four of the g7 nations which set out the broad direction of the plan on friday in washington will be represented at the 16-nation paris summit , which will embrace britain although the british do not use the euro currency . four-point rescue plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bailout is rumored to include an option of partially nationalizing banks a week ago berlin put together a 50-billion-euro rescue of hypo real estate , the country 's fourth biggest bank , but this took the form of guaranteeing badly needed credit lines rather than the state taking a stake in the stricken commercial property lender . after a severe deterioration of german banks ' liquidity shortages , as markets have tumbled in the past week and short-term lending among banks has become even more difficult to come by , has forced policy reversal in berlin . merkel has not detailed berlin 's actions and the finance ministry said information about the plans would be announced monday at the earliest , but sources in berlin told german news agency dpa they would comprise four elements . one would be a government guarantee to encourage the german banks to lend one another money .
many were nervously parking money at tiny rates of interest with the central banks at the end of last week rather than lending it where it is needed . reviving inter-bank lending would allow credit to resume flowing into the wider economy . a second part would be copied from the $ 700 billion -lrb- 522 billion euro -rrb- us bail-out , with toxic assets at the banks , such as investment certificates based on worthless real estate , being shifted to a so- called bad bank , which would buy the assets with taxpayer money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : falling stock prices across europe played a role in germany 's policy re-think a third element would be to recapitalize the banks , which have exhausted most of their shareholder funds as they write off vast quantities of worthless debt . britain has already made that move , saying last week it will invest at least 50 billion pounds -lrb- $ 87 billion , 63.7 billion euros -rrb- to recapitalize eight or more banks including barclays and royal bank of scotland group .
the government could sell the stakes again later . tough rules expected for nationalized banks bild as well as weekly welt am sonntag reported sunday that the worst hit institutions are not private german banks but the landebanks , the regional lending powerhouses that are owned by germany 's 16 states . merkel also committed herself in a statement to parliament on tuesday to alter accounting rules , as the us congress has just done , so that tainted assets can be taken off bank balance sheets in all the european union nations . the online version of german business daily handelsblatt said berlin was likely to dictate some strict terms to the banks for rescuing them . the banks would be required to reform their business models and make fundamental changes to executive pay , altering the incentive systems and retirement bonuses that have prompted accusations that bank chiefs are greedy . the german legislation is likely to be discussed monday in merkel 's cabinet before it is sent to parliament . merkel leads a grand coalition between her own christian democrats and the german social democrats , which can comfortably pass any legislation .

" " the crisis has over the past days entered into a phase that makes it intolerable to opt for procrastination and a go-it-alone approach , " he said , adding that the european union would ask the united states to jointly organize an international summit to reform the international finance system . leaders did not reveal the total size of the cash engagement implied by their measures for taxpayers across the continent . much work remains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many hope the weekend 's news will bring relief when market reopen european central bank head jean-claude trichet endorsed the plans made at the summit , saying they showed a " fundamental element of confidence .

he called for european union member states to coordinate their policies for the gradual restoration of confidence . " we have taken the right course for europe , for our businesses and our citizens , " barroso said , adding that it would " bring to an end the excessive pessimism of the markets .

berlin 's bail-out package could cost german taxpayers billions of euros . in remarks to a sunday newspaper , bild am sonntag , merkel said , " only action by the state can restore necessary confidence now . " before a meeting sunday , oct .
12 , in paris of the 15 euro zone leaders , she said that the intervention had to be internationally coordinated . " we are not doing this for the sake of the banks but in the interests of the people , " she told the mass-market bild . as in the united states , the german left has grumbled at a rescue likely to cost tens of billions of euros , saying it comes only a few years after a reduction in the scale of welfare handouts to the german poor . though she called sunday 's euro-zone meeting important to bring a return of confidence in european markets , merkel reiterated her opposition to a joint bail-out by the euro zone , saying each country must deal with its own troubles . " this meeting is to decide on coordinated joint action in the euro zone so that every country in the coming days can put in place measures that stabilize the financial markets , " merkel told reporters as she arrived for the meeting at the elysee presidential palace . four of the g7 nations which set out the broad direction of the plan on friday in washington will be represented at the 16-nation paris summit , which will embrace britain although the british do not use the euro currency . four-point rescue plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bailout is rumored to include an option of partially nationalizing banks a week ago berlin put together a 50-billion-euro rescue of hypo real estate , the country 's fourth biggest bank , but this took the form of guaranteeing badly needed credit lines rather than the state taking a stake in the stricken commercial property lender . after a severe deterioration of german banks ' liquidity shortages , as markets have tumbled in the past week and short-term lending among banks has become even more difficult to come by , has forced policy reversal in berlin . merkel has not detailed berlin 's actions and the finance ministry said information about the plans would be announced monday at the earliest , but sources in berlin told german news agency dpa they would comprise four elements . one would be a government guarantee to encourage the german banks to lend one another money .
many were nervously parking money at tiny rates of interest with the central banks at the end of last week rather than lending it where it is needed . reviving inter-bank lending would allow credit to resume flowing into the wider economy . a second part would be copied from the $ 700 billion -lrb- 522 billion euro -rrb- us bail-out , with toxic assets at the banks , such as investment certificates based on worthless real estate , being shifted to a so- called bad bank , which would buy the assets with taxpayer money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : falling stock prices across europe played a role in germany 's policy re-think a third element would be to recapitalize the banks , which have exhausted most of their shareholder funds as they write off vast quantities of worthless debt . britain has already made that move , saying last week it will invest at least 50 billion pounds -lrb- $ 87 billion , 63.7 billion euros -rrb- to recapitalize eight or more banks including barclays and royal bank of scotland group .
the government could sell the stakes again later . tough rules expected for nationalized banks bild as well as weekly welt am sonntag reported sunday that the worst hit institutions are not private german banks but the landebanks , the regional lending powerhouses that are owned by germany 's 16 states . merkel also committed herself in a statement to parliament on tuesday to alter accounting rules , as the us congress has just done , so that tainted assets can be taken off bank balance sheets in all the european union nations . the online version of german business daily handelsblatt said berlin was likely to dictate some strict terms to the banks for rescuing them . the banks would be required to reform their business models and make fundamental changes to executive pay , altering the incentive systems and retirement bonuses that have prompted accusations that bank chiefs are greedy . the german legislation is likely to be discussed monday in merkel 's cabinet before it is sent to parliament . merkel leads a grand coalition between her own christian democrats and the german social democrats , which can comfortably pass any legislation .
the key debates are therefore likely to take place in the two parties ' caucuses before the issue is put to vote . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

flight engineer john bremner will be laid to rest in berlin later this month . fondly known to wartime squadron members in england as " old flo , " the halifax bomber met a violent end on jan .
20 , 1944 when it was shot down by a german messerschmidt fighter over berlin . the 102 halifax squadron based at pockington in yorkshire had 15 aircrafts taking part in raids on the german capital that night , of which seven were lost .
it was the squadron 's greatest single loss in bombing raids carried out in both world wars . " old flo " was shot down by the german ace , captain leopold fellerer , who gunned down four other british aircrafts that night .
by war 's end he 'd destroyed 44 enemy planes , for which he was awarded the german knight 's cross . the body of flight engineer bremner was found only recently when experts working at the woodland site where the bomber crashed in southeast berlin finally identified his remains . funeral with full honors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : allied forces flew missions over all of germany during world war two now , 64 years after his death , bremner is to be laid to rest with full royal air force honors at the site , where the grave of the aircraft 's second pilot , sergeant kenneth standbridge , is also located . the burial , following a church service in berlin on oct .
16 , will be witnessed by bremner 's relatives and other crew members , as well as by two crash survivors : london-born pilot officer and navigator reg wilson and sergeant john bushell from oakley in bedfordshire . wilson , now in his late 80s , recently described the final moments of the doomed halifax , " her days ended on the night of january 20 , 1944 after we had dropped our bombs from 18,000 feet -lrb- 5,485 meters -rrb- above the center of the city . " recalling the blast german fighter pilot fellerer had flown beneath the bomber , " firing cannon upward into our starboard wing fuel tanks , causing ' old flo ' to catch fire from wing to wing , at 17,000 feet she went into a spiral dive .
then there was an explosion , " wilson said . wilson claimed the crash site was n't discovered until may 2006 . " of our crew of eight , four survived , all of us having had remarkable escapes , sustaining just a few cuts and sprains , " he said . just seconds before the halifax went into a dive , wilson and bomb aimer laurie underwood had succeeded in kicking out the jammed escape hatch , and bailing out . " a minute or so later , the pilot george griffiths and rear gunner john bushell were blown out with the explosion of fuel , " he said .
" both were unconscious and in free fall , but regained consciousness enough to be able to open their parachutes fully , only a few hundred feet before they hit the ground . " following the crash , the four survivors were interred in german prisoners of war camps . of the four killed , standbridge and wireless operator eric church are buried in berlin , and warrant officer charles dupueis , whose body has not been discovered , is remembered at the raf war memorial at runneymede in surrey , england . dpa news agency -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with global stock markets plunging and some banks teetering on bankruptcy , the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- is warning of a surge in suicides and mental illness .
just how depressing can it get ? as the number of foreclosures grow and the value of stock portfolios plummet , news reports from the us of the financial fallout are growing increasingly dire .
a 90-year-old woman in ohio shot herself while being served an eviction notice .
a 45-year-old businessman in los angeles murdered five members of his family before turning the gun on himself , saying in a suicide note that he had done so because of his troubling financial situation .
while these stories put a human face on the toll the financial crisis has taken , the director general of the world health organization this may only be the tip of the iceberg .
" we should not be surprised or underestimate the turbulence and the likely consequences of the financial crisis , ” margaret chan told a meeting of mental health care professionals in geneva , switzerland on thursday this week .
as people struggle to cope with losing their homes or livelihoods , she said , " it should not come as a surprise if we continue to see more stresses , more suicides and more mental disorders . "
financial crisis not the origin of the problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traders are n't the only ones feeling the pain to those who can recall the stories of bankers jumping out of windows across new york at the beginning of the great depression in 1929 , the correlation between a financial crisis and an increase in suicide seems quite real .
but to ulrich hegerl , director of the clinic for psychiatry and psychotherapy at the university of leipzig and spokesperson for german research network on depression and suicidality , the reality is more complicated than that .
“ a person with depression can blame their depression on whatever has been in the news recently , so some might begin to say that they are depressed because of the financial crisis .
but the financial crisis isn ’ t necessarily the basis for the illness in the first place . ”
indeed , one study conducted by the who / euro multicentre study on suicidal behavior showed that a majority of suicides and suicide attempts committed by men were done so by those who were considered “ economically active ” -lrb- i.e. employed -rrb- .
that same study showed little annual change in numbers of suicides from 1989 to 2002 , despite great economic changes after the fall of the iron curtain .

you wo n't be needing it anymore germany national soccer team coach joachim loew sunday barred striker kevin kuranyi from the national side after the schalke player went missing following the team 's world cup qualifier against russia . kuranyi , who had not been picked for saturday evening 's 2010 world cup qualifier in dortmund , had been watching in the stands but was found to be absent following the 2-1 win . loew said he would no longer select the 26-year-old player for the squad . " i can not accept the way kevin reacted and in future will not nominate him for the national team , " the coach said in dusseldorf . kuranyi is believed to have left the stadium during the game which germany won 2-1 thanks to goals from lukas podolski and michael ballack . " i can understand his disappointment , but the reaction on saturday evening is not acceptable or understandable , " loew said .
" at the national team we have 20 top people , and we trainers keep on having to make difficult decisions .
" it surprised us all .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health / wellness -pipe- 12.10.2008 financial crisis increasing suicide risk , who warns großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will financial woes increase depression worldwide ?
with global stock markets plunging and some banks teetering on bankruptcy , the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- is warning of a surge in suicides and mental illness .
just how depressing can it get ? as the number of foreclosures grow and the value of stock portfolios plummet , news reports from the us of the financial fallout are growing increasingly dire .
a 90-year-old woman in ohio shot herself while being served an eviction notice .
a 45-year-old businessman in los angeles murdered five members of his family before turning the gun on himself , saying in a suicide note that he had done so because of his troubling financial situation .
while these stories put a human face on the toll the financial crisis has taken , the director general of the world health organization this may only be the tip of the iceberg .
" we should not be surprised or underestimate the turbulence and the likely consequences of the financial crisis , ” margaret chan told a meeting of mental health care professionals in geneva , switzerland on thursday this week .
as people struggle to cope with losing their homes or livelihoods , she said , " it should not come as a surprise if we continue to see more stresses , more suicides and more mental disorders . "
financial crisis not the origin of the problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traders are n't the only ones feeling the pain to those who can recall the stories of bankers jumping out of windows across new york at the beginning of the great depression in 1929 , the correlation between a financial crisis and an increase in suicide seems quite real .
but to ulrich hegerl , director of the clinic for psychiatry and psychotherapy at the university of leipzig and spokesperson for german research network on depression and suicidality , the reality is more complicated than that .
“ a person with depression can blame their depression on whatever has been in the news recently , so some might begin to say that they are depressed because of the financial crisis .
but the financial crisis isn ’ t necessarily the basis for the illness in the first place . ”
indeed , one study conducted by the who / euro multicentre study on suicidal behavior showed that a majority of suicides and suicide attempts committed by men were done so by those who were considered “ economically active ” -lrb- i.e. employed -rrb- .
that same study showed little annual change in numbers of suicides from 1989 to 2002 , despite great economic changes after the fall of the iron curtain .
lack of care at root of problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who is especially concerned about the mental health of those in low-income countries still , the problem is one that plagues many countries .
a study released by who in 2001 identified depression as heading the list of disorders responsible for the global burden of disease in industrial countries .
according to the european alliance against depression -lrb- eaad -rrb- , more than 58,000 persons in the countries of the european union commit suicide annually .
europe-wide , dying from suicide accounts for the second highest risk of death for young men and the third highest risk for young women .
who chief margaret chanvstressed that the majority of people worldwide suffering from mental illness live in low- and middle-income countries , where there is an " abysmal lack of care , " inadequate mental health care budgets and where victims suffer from social stigma and discrimination .
hegerl likewise says that proper treatment is the only effective way to lower the prevalence of depression and suicide .
and he warns against misinterpreting the statistics , which , according to the european depression association -lrb- eda -rrb- show the number of cases of depression steadily increasing over the next decade .
“ simply because the financial crisis exists doesn ’ t mean we can assume a higher number of cases of depressed persons .
it ’ s more complicated than that . ” courtney tenz send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de german politicians say bank managers should be held liable politicians from germany 's governing parties said bank managers should be held responsible if their institution gets into trouble .
meanwhile , berlin called for a solution after the collapse of hypo real estate 's bailout .

members of the imf have backed a promise by the world 's seven leading economies to do all they can to curb the raging global market turmoil as euro-zone countries meet sunday to announce new rescue plans for banks . at a meeting on saturday , oct .
11 , in washington , the imf 's 185 member countries also pushed for more coordination with developing nations which are beginning to feel the effects of the global credit crunch . with global stock markets plunging and access to credit severely curbed across the globe , tackling the crisis required " exceptional vigilance , coordination and readiness to take bold action , " read a statement from the international monetary and financial committee -lrb- imfc -rrb- , the imf 's policy-guiding body . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss-kahn has given a dire warning for the world economy imf head dominique strauss-kahn said the world 's reeling financial system was teetering on " the brink of systemic meltdown . " " the first coordination between advanced countries and the rest of the world is now on track , " he said at a news conference on the first day of annual international monetary fund and world bank meetings in washington . gloomy forecasts for world economy earlier , finance ministers and central bank heads from the group of seven -lrb- g7 -rrb- industrial nations promised to use " all necessary tools " and adopt a five-point action plan help stabilize the global financial system . us president george w. bush , who met saturday with the g7 finance ministers , said the world 's economic powers " will stand together in addressing this threat to our prosperity " and " do what it takes to resolve this crisis . " global stock markets suffered record declines over the last week amid gloomy forecasts from the imf and others over the state of the world economy . the imf forecast global growth of 3.9 percent in 2008 and 3 percent in 2009 .
all eyes will be on the reactions of investors at monday 's market openings in asia and europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : global markets have so far proved immune to reassurances by governments in another bleak prediction saturday , imf chief economist olivier blanchard told italian daily corriere della sera that stocks could fall another 20 percent in the coming weeks . critics of the g7 's meeting friday said their commitments lacked specifics , but strauss-kahn said saturday 's endorsement of the g7 's action plan marked the " first big success of coordination " on an international level . he pointed to the g7 's promise to keep " important financial institutions " in their countries from collapsing and said he expected the moves would help free up banks to start bringing in new capital . " in the coming days , what i expect is that the reaction by the different -lrb- financial -rrb- institutions will be positive enough to unfreeze the credit market and to restore the necessary funding , " strauss-kahn said . germany to unveil british-style rescue package a number of western countries are working on rescue plans to keep their own financial sectors afloat . us treasury secretary henry paulson on friday said it was " naive " of investors to expect countries with different financial , economic and political systems to come up with the same policies to stabilize their own financial sectors . the us was preparing to buy equity stakes in banks as part of a $ 700 billion bail-out package already passed by congress and signed into law .
britain has passed its own rescue plan , and germany will unveil its own version on monday . the german plan is expected to resemble the british rescue package that would offer the finance industry interbank guarantees worth " triple digit " billions , according to various german media . german chancellor angela merkel said germany may inject capital into its banks but it was not planning to take permanent stakes in them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has changed tack on plans to bail out tottering banks " only action by the state is capable of restoring the necessary trust , " merkel was quoted as saying by the bild am sonntag .
" in this it is important that countries do not act unilaterally , but that we coordinate at european and international level and then implement the measures within our national responsibilities . " media reports said germany 's rescue package could be adopted " in days " using accelerated legal proceedings , and that the cabinet aimed to approve the measures on monday . sarkozy and merkel paved the way on saturday for european measures to tackle the global financial crisis but revealed little about their plans . sarkozy , whose country holds the rotating six-month presidency of the european union , has called an emergency meeting on sunday of the 15 countries that have the euro as their currency , to take coordinate action to temper the financial storm . imf vows to help developing nations out of crisis strauss-kahn said the imf was ready to make emergency money available to developing countries with critical budget shortfalls . some poorer countries have already seen slowing exports and investment at home due to the sharp economic downturn in wealthy nations . developing countries have urged industrial nations to keep them in the loop about plans to address the financial crisis and warned against cutting back aid commitments . " who is going to compensate the innocent countries ?
who are likely to suffer from this debacle through no fault of their own ? " asked kenyan finance minister john michuki . the group of 20 - a wider bloc of advanced and emerging economies - was meeting saturday evening to discuss the crisis . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

members of the imf have backed a promise by the world 's seven leading economies to do all they can to curb the raging global market turmoil as euro-zone countries meet sunday to announce new rescue plans for banks . at a meeting on saturday , oct .
11 , in washington , the imf 's 185 member countries also pushed for more coordination with developing nations which are beginning to feel the effects of the global credit crunch . with global stock markets plunging and access to credit severely curbed across the globe , tackling the crisis required " exceptional vigilance , coordination and readiness to take bold action , " read a statement from the international monetary and financial committee -lrb- imfc -rrb- , the imf 's policy-guiding body . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss-kahn has given a dire warning for the world economy imf head dominique strauss-kahn said the world 's reeling financial system was teetering on " the brink of systemic meltdown . " " the first coordination between advanced countries and the rest of the world is now on track , " he said at a news conference on the first day of annual international monetary fund and world bank meetings in washington . gloomy forecasts for world economy earlier , finance ministers and central bank heads from the group of seven -lrb- g7 -rrb- industrial nations promised to use " all necessary tools " and adopt a five-point action plan help stabilize the global financial system . us president george w. bush , who met saturday with the g7 finance ministers , said the world 's economic powers " will stand together in addressing this threat to our prosperity " and " do what it takes to resolve this crisis . " global stock markets suffered record declines over the last week amid gloomy forecasts from the imf and others over the state of the world economy . the imf forecast global growth of 3.9 percent in 2008 and 3 percent in 2009 .
all eyes will be on the reactions of investors at monday 's market openings in asia and europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : global markets have so far proved immune to reassurances by governments in another bleak prediction saturday , imf chief economist olivier blanchard told italian daily corriere della sera that stocks could fall another 20 percent in the coming weeks . critics of the g7 's meeting friday said their commitments lacked specifics , but strauss-kahn said saturday 's endorsement of the g7 's action plan marked the " first big success of coordination " on an international level . he pointed to the g7 's promise to keep " important financial institutions " in their countries from collapsing and said he expected the moves would help free up banks to start bringing in new capital . " in the coming days , what i expect is that the reaction by the different -lrb- financial -rrb- institutions will be positive enough to unfreeze the credit market and to restore the necessary funding , " strauss-kahn said . germany to unveil british-style rescue package a number of western countries are working on rescue plans to keep their own financial sectors afloat . us treasury secretary henry paulson on friday said it was " naive " of investors to expect countries with different financial , economic and political systems to come up with the same policies to stabilize their own financial sectors . the us was preparing to buy equity stakes in banks as part of a $ 700 billion bail-out package already passed by congress and signed into law .
britain has passed its own rescue plan , and germany will unveil its own version on monday . the german plan is expected to resemble the british rescue package that would offer the finance industry interbank guarantees worth " triple digit " billions , according to various german media . german chancellor angela merkel said germany may inject capital into its banks but it was not planning to take permanent stakes in them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has changed tack on plans to bail out tottering banks " only action by the state is capable of restoring the necessary trust , " merkel was quoted as saying by the bild am sonntag .
" in this it is important that countries do not act unilaterally , but that we coordinate at european and international level and then implement the measures within our national responsibilities . " media reports said germany 's rescue package could be adopted " in days " using accelerated legal proceedings , and that the cabinet aimed to approve the measures on monday . sarkozy and merkel paved the way on saturday for european measures to tackle the global financial crisis but revealed little about their plans . sarkozy , whose country holds the rotating six-month presidency of the european union , has called an emergency meeting on sunday of the 15 countries that have the euro as their currency , to take coordinate action to temper the financial storm . imf vows to help developing nations out of crisis strauss-kahn said the imf was ready to make emergency money available to developing countries with critical budget shortfalls . some poorer countries have already seen slowing exports and investment at home due to the sharp economic downturn in wealthy nations . developing countries have urged industrial nations to keep them in the loop about plans to address the financial crisis and warned against cutting back aid commitments . " who is going to compensate the innocent countries ?
who are likely to suffer from this debacle through no fault of their own ?

you wo n't be needing it anymore germany national soccer team coach joachim loew sunday barred striker kevin kuranyi from the national side after the schalke player went missing following the team 's world cup qualifier against russia . kuranyi , who had not been picked for saturday evening 's 2010 world cup qualifier in dortmund , had been watching in the stands but was found to be absent following the 2-1 win . loew said he would no longer select the 26-year-old player for the squad . " i can not accept the way kevin reacted and in future will not nominate him for the national team , " the coach said in dusseldorf . kuranyi is believed to have left the stadium during the game which germany won 2-1 thanks to goals from lukas podolski and michael ballack . " i can understand his disappointment , but the reaction on saturday evening is not acceptable or understandable , " loew said .
" at the national team we have 20 top people , and we trainers keep on having to make difficult decisions .
" it surprised us all .
despite several attempts , neither -lrb- team manager -rrb- oliver bierhoff nor i could reach him on the phone . " the german soccer federation said there had been no contact with kuranyi up until the squad 's training on sunday morning . one of kuranyi 's advisors told reporters on sunday , " he decided what he for himself found to be right , which was to say i ’ m going home . " kuranyi was left off the 2006 world cup roster by then-coach juergen klinsmann .
klinsmann never stated why kuranyi had to watch the tournament on tv , but german media speculated the player 's egotistical reputation did n't fit the team klinsmann wanted to build at the time . kuranyi returned to the national team under loew in time for the 2008 european championships and has played in a total of 52 national team matches . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

you wo n't be needing it anymore germany national soccer team coach joachim loew sunday barred striker kevin kuranyi from the national side after the schalke player went missing following the team 's world cup qualifier against russia . kuranyi , who had not been picked for saturday evening 's 2010 world cup qualifier in dortmund , had been watching in the stands but was found to be absent following the 2-1 win . loew said he would no longer select the 26-year-old player for the squad . " i can not accept the way kevin reacted and in future will not nominate him for the national team , " the coach said in dusseldorf . kuranyi is believed to have left the stadium during the game which germany won 2-1 thanks to goals from lukas podolski and michael ballack . " i can understand his disappointment , but the reaction on saturday evening is not acceptable or understandable , " loew said .
" at the national team we have 20 top people , and we trainers keep on having to make difficult decisions .
" it surprised us all .
despite several attempts , neither -lrb- team manager -rrb- oliver bierhoff nor i could reach him on the phone . " the german soccer federation said there had been no contact with kuranyi up until the squad 's training on sunday morning . one of kuranyi 's advisors told reporters on sunday , " he decided what he for himself found to be right , which was to say i ’ m going home . " kuranyi was left off the 2006 world cup roster by then-coach juergen klinsmann .
klinsmann never stated why kuranyi had to watch the tournament on tv , but german media speculated the player 's egotistical reputation did n't fit the team klinsmann wanted to build at the time . kuranyi returned to the national team under loew in time for the 2008 european championships and has played in a total of 52 national team matches . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

berlin 's bail-out package could cost german taxpayers billions of euros . in remarks to a sunday newspaper , bild am sonntag , merkel said , " only action by the state can restore necessary confidence now . " before a meeting sunday , oct .
12 , in paris of the 15 euro zone leaders , she said that the intervention had to be internationally coordinated . " we are not doing this for the sake of the banks but in the interests of the people , " she told the mass-market bild . as in the united states , the german left has grumbled at a rescue likely to cost tens of billions of euros , saying it comes only a few years after a reduction in the scale of welfare handouts to the german poor . though she called sunday 's euro-zone meeting important to bring a return of confidence in european markets , merkel reiterated her opposition to a joint bail-out by the euro zone , saying each country must deal with its own troubles . " this meeting is to decide on coordinated joint action in the euro zone so that every country in the coming days can put in place measures that stabilize the financial markets , " merkel told reporters as she arrived for the meeting at the elysee presidential palace . four of the g7 nations which set out the broad direction of the plan on friday in washington will be represented at the 16-nation paris summit , which will embrace britain although the british do not use the euro currency . four-point rescue plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bailout is rumored to include an option of partially nationalizing banks a week ago berlin put together a 50-billion-euro rescue of hypo real estate , the country 's fourth biggest bank , but this took the form of guaranteeing badly needed credit lines rather than the state taking a stake in the stricken commercial property lender . after a severe deterioration of german banks ' liquidity shortages , as markets have tumbled in the past week and short-term lending among banks has become even more difficult to come by , has forced policy reversal in berlin . merkel has not detailed berlin 's actions and the finance ministry said information about the plans would be announced monday at the earliest , but sources in berlin told german news agency dpa they would comprise four elements . one would be a government guarantee to encourage the german banks to lend one another money .
many were nervously parking money at tiny rates of interest with the central banks at the end of last week rather than lending it where it is needed . reviving inter-bank lending would allow credit to resume flowing into the wider economy . a second part would be copied from the $ 700 billion -lrb- 522 billion euro -rrb- us bail-out , with toxic assets at the banks , such as investment certificates based on worthless real estate , being shifted to a so- called bad bank , which would buy the assets with taxpayer money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : falling stock prices across europe played a role in germany 's policy re-think a third element would be to recapitalize the banks , which have exhausted most of their shareholder funds as they write off vast quantities of worthless debt . britain has already made that move , saying last week it will invest at least 50 billion pounds -lrb- $ 87 billion , 63.7 billion euros -rrb- to recapitalize eight or more banks including barclays and royal bank of scotland group .
the government could sell the stakes again later . tough rules expected for nationalized banks bild as well as weekly welt am sonntag reported sunday that the worst hit institutions are not private german banks but the landebanks , the regional lending powerhouses that are owned by germany 's 16 states . merkel also committed herself in a statement to parliament on tuesday to alter accounting rules , as the us congress has just done , so that tainted assets can be taken off bank balance sheets in all the european union nations . the online version of german business daily handelsblatt said berlin was likely to dictate some strict terms to the banks for rescuing them . the banks would be required to reform their business models and make fundamental changes to executive pay , altering the incentive systems and retirement bonuses that have prompted accusations that bank chiefs are greedy . the german legislation is likely to be discussed monday in merkel 's cabinet before it is sent to parliament . merkel leads a grand coalition between her own christian democrats and the german social democrats , which can comfortably pass any legislation .
the key debates are therefore likely to take place in the two parties ' caucuses before the issue is put to vote . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the two parties could have potentially formed part of a coalition government had their respective leaders not been rivals . " freedom is clearly interested in alliance to grow , and now the old adversary joerg haider is gone too , " political analyst peter filzmaier told reuters news agency .

petzner , 27 , had been haider 's spokesman since 2004 . haider died in a car accident early on saturday near klagenfurt , capital of carinthia , when the car he was driving veered off the road after passing another vehicle at 142 km per hour -lrb- 88 mph -rrb- , twice the legal speed limit , and hit a number of obstacles , including a fence 's concrete foundation , state prosecutors said sunday . hundreds of people held prayers , lit candles and placed wreaths on sunday at government headquarters in the regional capital of klagenfurt , where haider had been governor , and at the accident site . " they are big shoes to fill , but i will keep moving , not stumble , " petzner was quoted as saying .
on saturday he had reacted to the news of haider 's death , saying , " for us , this is like the end of the world .

the two parties could have potentially formed part of a coalition government had their respective leaders not been rivals . " freedom is clearly interested in alliance to grow , and now the old adversary joerg haider is gone too , " political analyst peter filzmaier told reuters news agency .

germany , france and other nations also said they would announce details of national rescue plans soon . heads of the euro-zone members said they hoped by guaranteeing loans banks would once again begin extending credit to each other , the leaders said in a statement on sunday , oct .
12 .
the reluctance of banks to make loans is at the heart of the ongoing finance crisis . while saying market operators need to recognize the scale of the challenge the world faces , french president nicolas sarkozy , who chaired the meeting , said the common action plan " addresses all aspects of the financial crisis . " " the crisis has over the past days entered into a phase that makes it intolerable to opt for procrastination and a go-it-alone approach , " he said , adding that the european union would ask the united states to jointly organize an international summit to reform the international finance system . leaders did not reveal the total size of the cash engagement implied by their measures for taxpayers across the continent . much work remains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many hope the weekend 's news will bring relief when market reopen european central bank head jean-claude trichet endorsed the plans made at the summit , saying they showed a " fundamental element of confidence . "
but he also added that there was still much for europe to do in order to stabilize markets and improve the bloc 's economic situation . european commission president jose manuel barroso , who was also present at sunday 's meeting , called the decisions made by euro-zone leaders " an essential stage of a very urgent procedure . "
he called for european union member states to coordinate their policies for the gradual restoration of confidence . " we have taken the right course for europe , for our businesses and our citizens , " barroso said , adding that it would " bring to an end the excessive pessimism of the markets . " the european leaders were working against the clock to put together a bank rescue strategy that would restore at least some confidence in stock markets after a week of losses unseen since the financial crisis of the 1930s . british prime minister gordon brown said after the paris meeting , " i believe that in the next few days confidence in the banking system will be restored . " details of national plans to follow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany hopes to hammer out an agreement quickly on its rescue package france , germany and italy would all unveil the details of their national bail-out packages on monday , sarkozy said . germany is expected to guarantee interbank loans with between 300 euros and 400 billion euros and to provide banks with fresh capital in exchange for shares , according to media reports . german chancellor angela merkel said only the state could now restore " the necessary trust " to the public and financial markets . " tomorrow germany will get to grips with its package of measures , " merkel said , describing the action plan adopted with fellow european leaders as a " tool box " of possible measures .
" other countries too will also rapidly take measures so that ... an important signal can be given to the markets . " the french government will on monday propose a state guarantee for banks endangered by the financial crisis , a ruling party deputy told the afp news agency . european finance officials have said the news measures will cost several hundred billion euros on top of the huge sums already spent rescuing banks and supporting money markets .
britain , which has already committed more than $ 700 billion to a bank rescue , was to take controlling stakes monday in two major banks worst affected by the crisis , according to media reports . ahead of the euro-zone summit , international monetary fund head dominique strauss-kahn said " intensifying solvency concerns about a number of the largest us-based and european financial institutions have pushed the global financial system to the brink of systemic meltdown . " but he added that an action plan adopted by the group of seven most wealthy nations was a breakthrough with the first global pledge to cooperate to stabilize the turmoil at the meetings . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

berlin 's bail-out package could cost german taxpayers billions of euros . in remarks to a sunday newspaper , bild am sonntag , merkel said , " only action by the state can restore necessary confidence now . " before a meeting sunday , oct .
12 , in paris of the 15 euro zone leaders , she said that the intervention had to be internationally coordinated . " we are not doing this for the sake of the banks but in the interests of the people , " she told the mass-market bild . as in the united states , the german left has grumbled at a rescue likely to cost tens of billions of euros , saying it comes only a few years after a reduction in the scale of welfare handouts to the german poor . though she called sunday 's euro-zone meeting important to bring a return of confidence in european markets , merkel reiterated her opposition to a joint bail-out by the euro zone , saying each country must deal with its own troubles . " this meeting is to decide on coordinated joint action in the euro zone so that every country in the coming days can put in place measures that stabilize the financial markets , " merkel told reporters as she arrived for the meeting at the elysee presidential palace . four of the g7 nations which set out the broad direction of the plan on friday in washington will be represented at the 16-nation paris summit , which will embrace britain although the british do not use the euro currency . four-point rescue plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bailout is rumored to include an option of partially nationalizing banks a week ago berlin put together a 50-billion-euro rescue of hypo real estate , the country 's fourth biggest bank , but this took the form of guaranteeing badly needed credit lines rather than the state taking a stake in the stricken commercial property lender . after a severe deterioration of german banks ' liquidity shortages , as markets have tumbled in the past week and short-term lending among banks has become even more difficult to come by , has forced policy reversal in berlin . merkel has not detailed berlin 's actions and the finance ministry said information about the plans would be announced monday at the earliest , but sources in berlin told german news agency dpa they would comprise four elements . one would be a government guarantee to encourage the german banks to lend one another money .
many were nervously parking money at tiny rates of interest with the central banks at the end of last week rather than lending it where it is needed . reviving inter-bank lending would allow credit to resume flowing into the wider economy . a second part would be copied from the $ 700 billion -lrb- 522 billion euro -rrb- us bail-out , with toxic assets at the banks , such as investment certificates based on worthless real estate , being shifted to a so- called bad bank , which would buy the assets with taxpayer money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : falling stock prices across europe played a role in germany 's policy re-think a third element would be to recapitalize the banks , which have exhausted most of their shareholder funds as they write off vast quantities of worthless debt . britain has already made that move , saying last week it will invest at least 50 billion pounds -lrb- $ 87 billion , 63.7 billion euros -rrb- to recapitalize eight or more banks including barclays and royal bank of scotland group .
the government could sell the stakes again later . tough rules expected for nationalized banks bild as well as weekly welt am sonntag reported sunday that the worst hit institutions are not private german banks but the landebanks , the regional lending powerhouses that are owned by germany 's 16 states . merkel also committed herself in a statement to parliament on tuesday to alter accounting rules , as the us congress has just done , so that tainted assets can be taken off bank balance sheets in all the european union nations . the online version of german business daily handelsblatt said berlin was likely to dictate some strict terms to the banks for rescuing them . the banks would be required to reform their business models and make fundamental changes to executive pay , altering the incentive systems and retirement bonuses that have prompted accusations that bank chiefs are greedy . the german legislation is likely to be discussed monday in merkel 's cabinet before it is sent to parliament . merkel leads a grand coalition between her own christian democrats and the german social democrats , which can comfortably pass any legislation .
the key debates are therefore likely to take place in the two parties ' caucuses before the issue is put to vote . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

members of the imf have backed a promise by the world 's seven leading economies to do all they can to curb the raging global market turmoil as euro-zone countries meet sunday to announce new rescue plans for banks . at a meeting on saturday , oct .
11 , in washington , the imf 's 185 member countries also pushed for more coordination with developing nations which are beginning to feel the effects of the global credit crunch . with global stock markets plunging and access to credit severely curbed across the globe , tackling the crisis required " exceptional vigilance , coordination and readiness to take bold action , " read a statement from the international monetary and financial committee -lrb- imfc -rrb- , the imf 's policy-guiding body . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss-kahn has given a dire warning for the world economy imf head dominique strauss-kahn said the world 's reeling financial system was teetering on " the brink of systemic meltdown . " " the first coordination between advanced countries and the rest of the world is now on track , " he said at a news conference on the first day of annual international monetary fund and world bank meetings in washington . gloomy forecasts for world economy earlier , finance ministers and central bank heads from the group of seven -lrb- g7 -rrb- industrial nations promised to use " all necessary tools " and adopt a five-point action plan help stabilize the global financial system . us president george w. bush , who met saturday with the g7 finance ministers , said the world 's economic powers " will stand together in addressing this threat to our prosperity " and " do what it takes to resolve this crisis . " global stock markets suffered record declines over the last week amid gloomy forecasts from the imf and others over the state of the world economy . the imf forecast global growth of 3.9 percent in 2008 and 3 percent in 2009 .
all eyes will be on the reactions of investors at monday 's market openings in asia and europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : global markets have so far proved immune to reassurances by governments in another bleak prediction saturday , imf chief economist olivier blanchard told italian daily corriere della sera that stocks could fall another 20 percent in the coming weeks . critics of the g7 's meeting friday said their commitments lacked specifics , but strauss-kahn said saturday 's endorsement of the g7 's action plan marked the " first big success of coordination " on an international level . he pointed to the g7 's promise to keep " important financial institutions " in their countries from collapsing and said he expected the moves would help free up banks to start bringing in new capital . " in the coming days , what i expect is that the reaction by the different -lrb- financial -rrb- institutions will be positive enough to unfreeze the credit market and to restore the necessary funding , " strauss-kahn said . germany to unveil british-style rescue package a number of western countries are working on rescue plans to keep their own financial sectors afloat . us treasury secretary henry paulson on friday said it was " naive " of investors to expect countries with different financial , economic and political systems to come up with the same policies to stabilize their own financial sectors . the us was preparing to buy equity stakes in banks as part of a $ 700 billion bail-out package already passed by congress and signed into law .
britain has passed its own rescue plan , and germany will unveil its own version on monday . the german plan is expected to resemble the british rescue package that would offer the finance industry interbank guarantees worth " triple digit " billions , according to various german media . german chancellor angela merkel said germany may inject capital into its banks but it was not planning to take permanent stakes in them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has changed tack on plans to bail out tottering banks " only action by the state is capable of restoring the necessary trust , " merkel was quoted as saying by the bild am sonntag .
" in this it is important that countries do not act unilaterally , but that we coordinate at european and international level and then implement the measures within our national responsibilities . " media reports said germany 's rescue package could be adopted " in days " using accelerated legal proceedings , and that the cabinet aimed to approve the measures on monday . sarkozy and merkel paved the way on saturday for european measures to tackle the global financial crisis but revealed little about their plans . sarkozy , whose country holds the rotating six-month presidency of the european union , has called an emergency meeting on sunday of the 15 countries that have the euro as their currency , to take coordinate action to temper the financial storm . imf vows to help developing nations out of crisis strauss-kahn said the imf was ready to make emergency money available to developing countries with critical budget shortfalls . some poorer countries have already seen slowing exports and investment at home due to the sharp economic downturn in wealthy nations . developing countries have urged industrial nations to keep them in the loop about plans to address the financial crisis and warned against cutting back aid commitments . " who is going to compensate the innocent countries ?
who are likely to suffer from this debacle through no fault of their own ?

with global stock markets plunging and some banks teetering on bankruptcy , the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- is warning of a surge in suicides and mental illness .
just how depressing can it get ? as the number of foreclosures grow and the value of stock portfolios plummet , news reports from the us of the financial fallout are growing increasingly dire .
a 90-year-old woman in ohio shot herself while being served an eviction notice .
a 45-year-old businessman in los angeles murdered five members of his family before turning the gun on himself , saying in a suicide note that he had done so because of his troubling financial situation .
while these stories put a human face on the toll the financial crisis has taken , the director general of the world health organization this may only be the tip of the iceberg .
" we should not be surprised or underestimate the turbulence and the likely consequences of the financial crisis , ” margaret chan told a meeting of mental health care professionals in geneva , switzerland on thursday this week .
as people struggle to cope with losing their homes or livelihoods , she said , " it should not come as a surprise if we continue to see more stresses , more suicides and more mental disorders . "
financial crisis not the origin of the problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traders are n't the only ones feeling the pain to those who can recall the stories of bankers jumping out of windows across new york at the beginning of the great depression in 1929 , the correlation between a financial crisis and an increase in suicide seems quite real .
but to ulrich hegerl , director of the clinic for psychiatry and psychotherapy at the university of leipzig and spokesperson for german research network on depression and suicidality , the reality is more complicated than that .
“ a person with depression can blame their depression on whatever has been in the news recently , so some might begin to say that they are depressed because of the financial crisis .
but the financial crisis isn ’ t necessarily the basis for the illness in the first place . ”
indeed , one study conducted by the who / euro multicentre study on suicidal behavior showed that a majority of suicides and suicide attempts committed by men were done so by those who were considered “ economically active ” -lrb- i.e. employed -rrb- .
that same study showed little annual change in numbers of suicides from 1989 to 2002 , despite great economic changes after the fall of the iron curtain .
lack of care at root of problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who is especially concerned about the mental health of those in low-income countries still , the problem is one that plagues many countries .

berlin 's bail-out package could cost german taxpayers billions of euros . in remarks to a sunday newspaper , bild am sonntag , merkel said , " only action by the state can restore necessary confidence now . " before a meeting sunday , oct .
12 , in paris of the 15 euro zone leaders , she said that the intervention had to be internationally coordinated . " we are not doing this for the sake of the banks but in the interests of the people , " she told the mass-market bild . as in the united states , the german left has grumbled at a rescue likely to cost tens of billions of euros , saying it comes only a few years after a reduction in the scale of welfare handouts to the german poor . though she called sunday 's euro-zone meeting important to bring a return of confidence in european markets , merkel reiterated her opposition to a joint bail-out by the euro zone , saying each country must deal with its own troubles . " this meeting is to decide on coordinated joint action in the euro zone so that every country in the coming days can put in place measures that stabilize the financial markets , " merkel told reporters as she arrived for the meeting at the elysee presidential palace . four of the g7 nations which set out the broad direction of the plan on friday in washington will be represented at the 16-nation paris summit , which will embrace britain although the british do not use the euro currency . four-point rescue plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bailout is rumored to include an option of partially nationalizing banks a week ago berlin put together a 50-billion-euro rescue of hypo real estate , the country 's fourth biggest bank , but this took the form of guaranteeing badly needed credit lines rather than the state taking a stake in the stricken commercial property lender . after a severe deterioration of german banks ' liquidity shortages , as markets have tumbled in the past week and short-term lending among banks has become even more difficult to come by , has forced policy reversal in berlin . merkel has not detailed berlin 's actions and the finance ministry said information about the plans would be announced monday at the earliest , but sources in berlin told german news agency dpa they would comprise four elements . one would be a government guarantee to encourage the german banks to lend one another money .
many were nervously parking money at tiny rates of interest with the central banks at the end of last week rather than lending it where it is needed . reviving inter-bank lending would allow credit to resume flowing into the wider economy . a second part would be copied from the $ 700 billion -lrb- 522 billion euro -rrb- us bail-out , with toxic assets at the banks , such as investment certificates based on worthless real estate , being shifted to a so- called bad bank , which would buy the assets with taxpayer money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : falling stock prices across europe played a role in germany 's policy re-think a third element would be to recapitalize the banks , which have exhausted most of their shareholder funds as they write off vast quantities of worthless debt . britain has already made that move , saying last week it will invest at least 50 billion pounds -lrb- $ 87 billion , 63.7 billion euros -rrb- to recapitalize eight or more banks including barclays and royal bank of scotland group .
the government could sell the stakes again later . tough rules expected for nationalized banks bild as well as weekly welt am sonntag reported sunday that the worst hit institutions are not private german banks but the landebanks , the regional lending powerhouses that are owned by germany 's 16 states . merkel also committed herself in a statement to parliament on tuesday to alter accounting rules , as the us congress has just done , so that tainted assets can be taken off bank balance sheets in all the european union nations . the online version of german business daily handelsblatt said berlin was likely to dictate some strict terms to the banks for rescuing them . the banks would be required to reform their business models and make fundamental changes to executive pay , altering the incentive systems and retirement bonuses that have prompted accusations that bank chiefs are greedy . the german legislation is likely to be discussed monday in merkel 's cabinet before it is sent to parliament . merkel leads a grand coalition between her own christian democrats and the german social democrats , which can comfortably pass any legislation .
the key debates are therefore likely to take place in the two parties ' caucuses before the issue is put to vote . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

you wo n't be needing it anymore germany national soccer team coach joachim loew sunday barred striker kevin kuranyi from the national side after the schalke player went missing following the team 's world cup qualifier against russia . kuranyi , who had not been picked for saturday evening 's 2010 world cup qualifier in dortmund , had been watching in the stands but was found to be absent following the 2-1 win . loew said he would no longer select the 26-year-old player for the squad . " i can not accept the way kevin reacted and in future will not nominate him for the national team , " the coach said in dusseldorf . kuranyi is believed to have left the stadium during the game which germany won 2-1 thanks to goals from lukas podolski and michael ballack . " i can understand his disappointment , but the reaction on saturday evening is not acceptable or understandable , " loew said .
" at the national team we have 20 top people , and we trainers keep on having to make difficult decisions .
" it surprised us all .
despite several attempts , neither -lrb- team manager -rrb- oliver bierhoff nor i could reach him on the phone . " the german soccer federation said there had been no contact with kuranyi up until the squad 's training on sunday morning . one of kuranyi 's advisors told reporters on sunday , " he decided what he for himself found to be right , which was to say i ’ m going home . " kuranyi was left off the 2006 world cup roster by then-coach juergen klinsmann .
klinsmann never stated why kuranyi had to watch the tournament on tv , but german media speculated the player 's egotistical reputation did n't fit the team klinsmann wanted to build at the time . kuranyi returned to the national team under loew in time for the 2008 european championships and has played in a total of 52 national team matches . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" in the coming days , what i expect is that the reaction by the different -lrb- financial -rrb- institutions will be positive enough to unfreeze the credit market and to restore the necessary funding , " strauss-kahn said . germany to unveil british-style rescue package a number of western countries are working on rescue plans to keep their own financial sectors afloat . us treasury secretary henry paulson on friday said it was " naive " of investors to expect countries with different financial , economic and political systems to come up with the same policies to stabilize their own financial sectors . the us was preparing to buy equity stakes in banks as part of a $ 700 billion bail-out package already passed by congress and signed into law .
britain has passed its own rescue plan , and germany will unveil its own version on monday . the german plan is expected to resemble the british rescue package that would offer the finance industry interbank guarantees worth " triple digit " billions , according to various german media . german chancellor angela merkel said germany may inject capital into its banks but it was not planning to take permanent stakes in them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has changed tack on plans to bail out tottering banks " only action by the state is capable of restoring the necessary trust , " merkel was quoted as saying by the bild am sonntag .
" in this it is important that countries do not act unilaterally , but that we coordinate at european and international level and then implement the measures within our national responsibilities . " media reports said germany 's rescue package could be adopted " in days " using accelerated legal proceedings , and that the cabinet aimed to approve the measures on monday . sarkozy and merkel paved the way on saturday for european measures to tackle the global financial crisis but revealed little about their plans . sarkozy , whose country holds the rotating six-month presidency of the european union , has called an emergency meeting on sunday of the 15 countries that have the euro as their currency , to take coordinate action to temper the financial storm . imf vows to help developing nations out of crisis strauss-kahn said the imf was ready to make emergency money available to developing countries with critical budget shortfalls . some poorer countries have already seen slowing exports and investment at home due to the sharp economic downturn in wealthy nations . developing countries have urged industrial nations to keep them in the loop about plans to address the financial crisis and warned against cutting back aid commitments . " who is going to compensate the innocent countries ?
who are likely to suffer from this debacle through no fault of their own ? " asked kenyan finance minister john michuki . the group of 20 - a wider bloc of advanced and emerging economies - was meeting saturday evening to discuss the crisis . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the reluctance of banks to make loans is at the heart of the ongoing finance crisis . while saying market operators need to recognize the scale of the challenge the world faces , french president nicolas sarkozy , who chaired the meeting , said the common action plan " addresses all aspects of the financial crisis . " " the crisis has over the past days entered into a phase that makes it intolerable to opt for procrastination and a go-it-alone approach , " he said , adding that the european union would ask the united states to jointly organize an international summit to reform the international finance system . leaders did not reveal the total size of the cash engagement implied by their measures for taxpayers across the continent . much work remains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many hope the weekend 's news will bring relief when market reopen european central bank head jean-claude trichet endorsed the plans made at the summit , saying they showed a " fundamental element of confidence .

he called for european union member states to coordinate their policies for the gradual restoration of confidence .

" the european leaders were working against the clock to put together a bank rescue strategy that would restore at least some confidence in stock markets after a week of losses unseen since the financial crisis of the 1930s . british prime minister gordon brown said after the paris meeting , " i believe that in the next few days confidence in the banking system will be restored .

berlin 's bail-out package could cost german taxpayers billions of euros . in remarks to a sunday newspaper , bild am sonntag , merkel said , " only action by the state can restore necessary confidence now . " before a meeting sunday , oct .
12 , in paris of the 15 euro zone leaders , she said that the intervention had to be internationally coordinated . " we are not doing this for the sake of the banks but in the interests of the people , " she told the mass-market bild . as in the united states , the german left has grumbled at a rescue likely to cost tens of billions of euros , saying it comes only a few years after a reduction in the scale of welfare handouts to the german poor . though she called sunday 's euro-zone meeting important to bring a return of confidence in european markets , merkel reiterated her opposition to a joint bail-out by the euro zone , saying each country must deal with its own troubles . " this meeting is to decide on coordinated joint action in the euro zone so that every country in the coming days can put in place measures that stabilize the financial markets , " merkel told reporters as she arrived for the meeting at the elysee presidential palace . four of the g7 nations which set out the broad direction of the plan on friday in washington will be represented at the 16-nation paris summit , which will embrace britain although the british do not use the euro currency . four-point rescue plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bailout is rumored to include an option of partially nationalizing banks a week ago berlin put together a 50-billion-euro rescue of hypo real estate , the country 's fourth biggest bank , but this took the form of guaranteeing badly needed credit lines rather than the state taking a stake in the stricken commercial property lender . after a severe deterioration of german banks ' liquidity shortages , as markets have tumbled in the past week and short-term lending among banks has become even more difficult to come by , has forced policy reversal in berlin . merkel has not detailed berlin 's actions and the finance ministry said information about the plans would be announced monday at the earliest , but sources in berlin told german news agency dpa they would comprise four elements . one would be a government guarantee to encourage the german banks to lend one another money .
many were nervously parking money at tiny rates of interest with the central banks at the end of last week rather than lending it where it is needed . reviving inter-bank lending would allow credit to resume flowing into the wider economy . a second part would be copied from the $ 700 billion -lrb- 522 billion euro -rrb- us bail-out , with toxic assets at the banks , such as investment certificates based on worthless real estate , being shifted to a so- called bad bank , which would buy the assets with taxpayer money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : falling stock prices across europe played a role in germany 's policy re-think a third element would be to recapitalize the banks , which have exhausted most of their shareholder funds as they write off vast quantities of worthless debt . britain has already made that move , saying last week it will invest at least 50 billion pounds -lrb- $ 87 billion , 63.7 billion euros -rrb- to recapitalize eight or more banks including barclays and royal bank of scotland group .
the government could sell the stakes again later . tough rules expected for nationalized banks bild as well as weekly welt am sonntag reported sunday that the worst hit institutions are not private german banks but the landebanks , the regional lending powerhouses that are owned by germany 's 16 states . merkel also committed herself in a statement to parliament on tuesday to alter accounting rules , as the us congress has just done , so that tainted assets can be taken off bank balance sheets in all the european union nations . the online version of german business daily handelsblatt said berlin was likely to dictate some strict terms to the banks for rescuing them . the banks would be required to reform their business models and make fundamental changes to executive pay , altering the incentive systems and retirement bonuses that have prompted accusations that bank chiefs are greedy . the german legislation is likely to be discussed monday in merkel 's cabinet before it is sent to parliament . merkel leads a grand coalition between her own christian democrats and the german social democrats , which can comfortably pass any legislation .
the key debates are therefore likely to take place in the two parties ' caucuses before the issue is put to vote . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with global stock markets plunging and some banks teetering on bankruptcy , the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- is warning of a surge in suicides and mental illness .
just how depressing can it get ? as the number of foreclosures grow and the value of stock portfolios plummet , news reports from the us of the financial fallout are growing increasingly dire .
a 90-year-old woman in ohio shot herself while being served an eviction notice .
a 45-year-old businessman in los angeles murdered five members of his family before turning the gun on himself , saying in a suicide note that he had done so because of his troubling financial situation .
while these stories put a human face on the toll the financial crisis has taken , the director general of the world health organization this may only be the tip of the iceberg .
" we should not be surprised or underestimate the turbulence and the likely consequences of the financial crisis , ” margaret chan told a meeting of mental health care professionals in geneva , switzerland on thursday this week .
as people struggle to cope with losing their homes or livelihoods , she said , " it should not come as a surprise if we continue to see more stresses , more suicides and more mental disorders . "
financial crisis not the origin of the problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traders are n't the only ones feeling the pain to those who can recall the stories of bankers jumping out of windows across new york at the beginning of the great depression in 1929 , the correlation between a financial crisis and an increase in suicide seems quite real .
but to ulrich hegerl , director of the clinic for psychiatry and psychotherapy at the university of leipzig and spokesperson for german research network on depression and suicidality , the reality is more complicated than that .
“ a person with depression can blame their depression on whatever has been in the news recently , so some might begin to say that they are depressed because of the financial crisis .
but the financial crisis isn ’ t necessarily the basis for the illness in the first place . ”
indeed , one study conducted by the who / euro multicentre study on suicidal behavior showed that a majority of suicides and suicide attempts committed by men were done so by those who were considered “ economically active ” -lrb- i.e. employed -rrb- .
that same study showed little annual change in numbers of suicides from 1989 to 2002 , despite great economic changes after the fall of the iron curtain .
lack of care at root of problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who is especially concerned about the mental health of those in low-income countries still , the problem is one that plagues many countries .
a study released by who in 2001 identified depression as heading the list of disorders responsible for the global burden of disease in industrial countries .
according to the european alliance against depression -lrb- eaad -rrb- , more than 58,000 persons in the countries of the european union commit suicide annually .
europe-wide , dying from suicide accounts for the second highest risk of death for young men and the third highest risk for young women .
who chief margaret chanvstressed that the majority of people worldwide suffering from mental illness live in low- and middle-income countries , where there is an " abysmal lack of care , " inadequate mental health care budgets and where victims suffer from social stigma and discrimination .
hegerl likewise says that proper treatment is the only effective way to lower the prevalence of depression and suicide .
and he warns against misinterpreting the statistics , which , according to the european depression association -lrb- eda -rrb- show the number of cases of depression steadily increasing over the next decade .
“ simply because the financial crisis exists doesn ’ t mean we can assume a higher number of cases of depressed persons .
it ’ s more complicated than that . ” courtney tenz send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany , france and other nations also said they would announce details of national rescue plans soon . heads of the euro-zone members said they hoped by guaranteeing loans banks would once again begin extending credit to each other , the leaders said in a statement on sunday , oct .
12 .
the reluctance of banks to make loans is at the heart of the ongoing finance crisis . while saying market operators need to recognize the scale of the challenge the world faces , french president nicolas sarkozy , who chaired the meeting , said the common action plan " addresses all aspects of the financial crisis . " " the crisis has over the past days entered into a phase that makes it intolerable to opt for procrastination and a go-it-alone approach , " he said , adding that the european union would ask the united states to jointly organize an international summit to reform the international finance system . leaders did not reveal the total size of the cash engagement implied by their measures for taxpayers across the continent . much work remains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many hope the weekend 's news will bring relief when market reopen european central bank head jean-claude trichet endorsed the plans made at the summit , saying they showed a " fundamental element of confidence . "
but he also added that there was still much for europe to do in order to stabilize markets and improve the bloc 's economic situation . european commission president jose manuel barroso , who was also present at sunday 's meeting , called the decisions made by euro-zone leaders " an essential stage of a very urgent procedure . "
he called for european union member states to coordinate their policies for the gradual restoration of confidence . " we have taken the right course for europe , for our businesses and our citizens , " barroso said , adding that it would " bring to an end the excessive pessimism of the markets . " the european leaders were working against the clock to put together a bank rescue strategy that would restore at least some confidence in stock markets after a week of losses unseen since the financial crisis of the 1930s . british prime minister gordon brown said after the paris meeting , " i believe that in the next few days confidence in the banking system will be restored . " details of national plans to follow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany hopes to hammer out an agreement quickly on its rescue package france , germany and italy would all unveil the details of their national bail-out packages on monday , sarkozy said . germany is expected to guarantee interbank loans with between 300 euros and 400 billion euros and to provide banks with fresh capital in exchange for shares , according to media reports . german chancellor angela merkel said only the state could now restore " the necessary trust " to the public and financial markets . " tomorrow germany will get to grips with its package of measures , " merkel said , describing the action plan adopted with fellow european leaders as a " tool box " of possible measures .
" other countries too will also rapidly take measures so that ... an important signal can be given to the markets . " the french government will on monday propose a state guarantee for banks endangered by the financial crisis , a ruling party deputy told the afp news agency . european finance officials have said the news measures will cost several hundred billion euros on top of the huge sums already spent rescuing banks and supporting money markets .
britain , which has already committed more than $ 700 billion to a bank rescue , was to take controlling stakes monday in two major banks worst affected by the crisis , according to media reports . ahead of the euro-zone summit , international monetary fund head dominique strauss-kahn said " intensifying solvency concerns about a number of the largest us-based and european financial institutions have pushed the global financial system to the brink of systemic meltdown .

but experts say the change in leadership probably wo n't lead to a political shake-up in the austrian right in the near future . the alliance for the future of austria named stefan petzner as it new leader on sunday , oct .
12 , following the death of joerg haider on saturday , the austrian news agency -lrb- apa -rrb- reported .
petzner , 27 , had been haider 's spokesman since 2004 . haider died in a car accident early on saturday near klagenfurt , capital of carinthia , when the car he was driving veered off the road after passing another vehicle at 142 km per hour -lrb- 88 mph -rrb- , twice the legal speed limit , and hit a number of obstacles , including a fence 's concrete foundation , state prosecutors said sunday . hundreds of people held prayers , lit candles and placed wreaths on sunday at government headquarters in the regional capital of klagenfurt , where haider had been governor , and at the accident site . " they are big shoes to fill , but i will keep moving , not stumble , " petzner was quoted as saying .
on saturday he had reacted to the news of haider 's death , saying , " for us , this is like the end of the world . " in parliamentary elections in late september , the populist alliance won almost 11 percent of the ballots , nearly doubling its votes from the previous elections in 2006 . haider divided austrian right bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haider 's death came as a shock to austria and the world haider 's party split in 2005 from the freedom party , which gained prominence under haider 's leadership in the 1980s and 90s .
the two parties could have potentially formed part of a coalition government had their respective leaders not been rivals . " freedom is clearly interested in alliance to grow , and now the old adversary joerg haider is gone too , " political analyst peter filzmaier told reuters news agency .
" a deal would be possible without anybody losing his face after haider 's death .
the question is how quick can alliance get its act together again . " vienna daily der standard wrote sunday that the " far right would now be able to reunify " without the head of the freedom party having to fight for his position . other observers doubted haider 's death will have much of an impact on the austrian political landscape in the near future . " it does n't follow that everybody who voted for the alliance would transfer allegiance to freedom , " peter pulzer , an expert in austrian affairs at oxford university , told retuers .
" not everybody voted for alliance for political reasons , but rather on the grounds of personality . " neither of the parties has officially commented on whether a reunification of the two parties in the wake of haider 's death is on the cards . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i can not accept the way kevin reacted and in future will not nominate him for the national team , " the coach said in dusseldorf . kuranyi is believed to have left the stadium during the game which germany won 2-1 thanks to goals from lukas podolski and michael ballack . " i can understand his disappointment , but the reaction on saturday evening is not acceptable or understandable , " loew said .
" at the national team we have 20 top people , and we trainers keep on having to make difficult decisions .

despite several attempts , neither -lrb- team manager -rrb- oliver bierhoff nor i could reach him on the phone .

" kuranyi was left off the 2006 world cup roster by then-coach juergen klinsmann .
klinsmann never stated why kuranyi had to watch the tournament on tv , but german media speculated the player 's egotistical reputation did n't fit the team klinsmann wanted to build at the time . kuranyi returned to the national team under loew in time for the 2008 european championships and has played in a total of 52 national team matches . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with global stock markets plunging and some banks teetering on bankruptcy , the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- is warning of a surge in suicides and mental illness .
just how depressing can it get ? as the number of foreclosures grow and the value of stock portfolios plummet , news reports from the us of the financial fallout are growing increasingly dire .
a 90-year-old woman in ohio shot herself while being served an eviction notice .
a 45-year-old businessman in los angeles murdered five members of his family before turning the gun on himself , saying in a suicide note that he had done so because of his troubling financial situation .
while these stories put a human face on the toll the financial crisis has taken , the director general of the world health organization this may only be the tip of the iceberg .
" we should not be surprised or underestimate the turbulence and the likely consequences of the financial crisis , ” margaret chan told a meeting of mental health care professionals in geneva , switzerland on thursday this week .
as people struggle to cope with losing their homes or livelihoods , she said , " it should not come as a surprise if we continue to see more stresses , more suicides and more mental disorders . "
financial crisis not the origin of the problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traders are n't the only ones feeling the pain to those who can recall the stories of bankers jumping out of windows across new york at the beginning of the great depression in 1929 , the correlation between a financial crisis and an increase in suicide seems quite real .
but to ulrich hegerl , director of the clinic for psychiatry and psychotherapy at the university of leipzig and spokesperson for german research network on depression and suicidality , the reality is more complicated than that .
“ a person with depression can blame their depression on whatever has been in the news recently , so some might begin to say that they are depressed because of the financial crisis .
but the financial crisis isn ’ t necessarily the basis for the illness in the first place . ”
indeed , one study conducted by the who / euro multicentre study on suicidal behavior showed that a majority of suicides and suicide attempts committed by men were done so by those who were considered “ economically active ” -lrb- i.e. employed -rrb- .
that same study showed little annual change in numbers of suicides from 1989 to 2002 , despite great economic changes after the fall of the iron curtain .
lack of care at root of problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who is especially concerned about the mental health of those in low-income countries still , the problem is one that plagues many countries .
a study released by who in 2001 identified depression as heading the list of disorders responsible for the global burden of disease in industrial countries .
according to the european alliance against depression -lrb- eaad -rrb- , more than 58,000 persons in the countries of the european union commit suicide annually .
europe-wide , dying from suicide accounts for the second highest risk of death for young men and the third highest risk for young women .
who chief margaret chanvstressed that the majority of people worldwide suffering from mental illness live in low- and middle-income countries , where there is an " abysmal lack of care , " inadequate mental health care budgets and where victims suffer from social stigma and discrimination .
hegerl likewise says that proper treatment is the only effective way to lower the prevalence of depression and suicide .
and he warns against misinterpreting the statistics , which , according to the european depression association -lrb- eda -rrb- show the number of cases of depression steadily increasing over the next decade .
“ simply because the financial crisis exists doesn ’ t mean we can assume a higher number of cases of depressed persons .
it ’ s more complicated than that . ” courtney tenz send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

berlin 's bail-out package could cost german taxpayers billions of euros . in remarks to a sunday newspaper , bild am sonntag , merkel said , " only action by the state can restore necessary confidence now . " before a meeting sunday , oct .
12 , in paris of the 15 euro zone leaders , she said that the intervention had to be internationally coordinated . " we are not doing this for the sake of the banks but in the interests of the people , " she told the mass-market bild . as in the united states , the german left has grumbled at a rescue likely to cost tens of billions of euros , saying it comes only a few years after a reduction in the scale of welfare handouts to the german poor . though she called sunday 's euro-zone meeting important to bring a return of confidence in european markets , merkel reiterated her opposition to a joint bail-out by the euro zone , saying each country must deal with its own troubles . " this meeting is to decide on coordinated joint action in the euro zone so that every country in the coming days can put in place measures that stabilize the financial markets , " merkel told reporters as she arrived for the meeting at the elysee presidential palace . four of the g7 nations which set out the broad direction of the plan on friday in washington will be represented at the 16-nation paris summit , which will embrace britain although the british do not use the euro currency . four-point rescue plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bailout is rumored to include an option of partially nationalizing banks a week ago berlin put together a 50-billion-euro rescue of hypo real estate , the country 's fourth biggest bank , but this took the form of guaranteeing badly needed credit lines rather than the state taking a stake in the stricken commercial property lender . after a severe deterioration of german banks ' liquidity shortages , as markets have tumbled in the past week and short-term lending among banks has become even more difficult to come by , has forced policy reversal in berlin . merkel has not detailed berlin 's actions and the finance ministry said information about the plans would be announced monday at the earliest , but sources in berlin told german news agency dpa they would comprise four elements . one would be a government guarantee to encourage the german banks to lend one another money .
many were nervously parking money at tiny rates of interest with the central banks at the end of last week rather than lending it where it is needed . reviving inter-bank lending would allow credit to resume flowing into the wider economy . a second part would be copied from the $ 700 billion -lrb- 522 billion euro -rrb- us bail-out , with toxic assets at the banks , such as investment certificates based on worthless real estate , being shifted to a so- called bad bank , which would buy the assets with taxpayer money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : falling stock prices across europe played a role in germany 's policy re-think a third element would be to recapitalize the banks , which have exhausted most of their shareholder funds as they write off vast quantities of worthless debt . britain has already made that move , saying last week it will invest at least 50 billion pounds -lrb- $ 87 billion , 63.7 billion euros -rrb- to recapitalize eight or more banks including barclays and royal bank of scotland group .
the government could sell the stakes again later . tough rules expected for nationalized banks bild as well as weekly welt am sonntag reported sunday that the worst hit institutions are not private german banks but the landebanks , the regional lending powerhouses that are owned by germany 's 16 states . merkel also committed herself in a statement to parliament on tuesday to alter accounting rules , as the us congress has just done , so that tainted assets can be taken off bank balance sheets in all the european union nations . the online version of german business daily handelsblatt said berlin was likely to dictate some strict terms to the banks for rescuing them . the banks would be required to reform their business models and make fundamental changes to executive pay , altering the incentive systems and retirement bonuses that have prompted accusations that bank chiefs are greedy . the german legislation is likely to be discussed monday in merkel 's cabinet before it is sent to parliament . merkel leads a grand coalition between her own christian democrats and the german social democrats , which can comfortably pass any legislation .
the key debates are therefore likely to take place in the two parties ' caucuses before the issue is put to vote . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

berlin 's bail-out package could cost german taxpayers billions of euros . in remarks to a sunday newspaper , bild am sonntag , merkel said , " only action by the state can restore necessary confidence now . " before a meeting sunday , oct .
12 , in paris of the 15 euro zone leaders , she said that the intervention had to be internationally coordinated . " we are not doing this for the sake of the banks but in the interests of the people , " she told the mass-market bild . as in the united states , the german left has grumbled at a rescue likely to cost tens of billions of euros , saying it comes only a few years after a reduction in the scale of welfare handouts to the german poor . though she called sunday 's euro-zone meeting important to bring a return of confidence in european markets , merkel reiterated her opposition to a joint bail-out by the euro zone , saying each country must deal with its own troubles . " this meeting is to decide on coordinated joint action in the euro zone so that every country in the coming days can put in place measures that stabilize the financial markets , " merkel told reporters as she arrived for the meeting at the elysee presidential palace . four of the g7 nations which set out the broad direction of the plan on friday in washington will be represented at the 16-nation paris summit , which will embrace britain although the british do not use the euro currency . four-point rescue plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bailout is rumored to include an option of partially nationalizing banks a week ago berlin put together a 50-billion-euro rescue of hypo real estate , the country 's fourth biggest bank , but this took the form of guaranteeing badly needed credit lines rather than the state taking a stake in the stricken commercial property lender . after a severe deterioration of german banks ' liquidity shortages , as markets have tumbled in the past week and short-term lending among banks has become even more difficult to come by , has forced policy reversal in berlin . merkel has not detailed berlin 's actions and the finance ministry said information about the plans would be announced monday at the earliest , but sources in berlin told german news agency dpa they would comprise four elements . one would be a government guarantee to encourage the german banks to lend one another money .
many were nervously parking money at tiny rates of interest with the central banks at the end of last week rather than lending it where it is needed . reviving inter-bank lending would allow credit to resume flowing into the wider economy . a second part would be copied from the $ 700 billion -lrb- 522 billion euro -rrb- us bail-out , with toxic assets at the banks , such as investment certificates based on worthless real estate , being shifted to a so- called bad bank , which would buy the assets with taxpayer money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : falling stock prices across europe played a role in germany 's policy re-think a third element would be to recapitalize the banks , which have exhausted most of their shareholder funds as they write off vast quantities of worthless debt . britain has already made that move , saying last week it will invest at least 50 billion pounds -lrb- $ 87 billion , 63.7 billion euros -rrb- to recapitalize eight or more banks including barclays and royal bank of scotland group .
the government could sell the stakes again later . tough rules expected for nationalized banks bild as well as weekly welt am sonntag reported sunday that the worst hit institutions are not private german banks but the landebanks , the regional lending powerhouses that are owned by germany 's 16 states . merkel also committed herself in a statement to parliament on tuesday to alter accounting rules , as the us congress has just done , so that tainted assets can be taken off bank balance sheets in all the european union nations . the online version of german business daily handelsblatt said berlin was likely to dictate some strict terms to the banks for rescuing them . the banks would be required to reform their business models and make fundamental changes to executive pay , altering the incentive systems and retirement bonuses that have prompted accusations that bank chiefs are greedy . the german legislation is likely to be discussed monday in merkel 's cabinet before it is sent to parliament . merkel leads a grand coalition between her own christian democrats and the german social democrats , which can comfortably pass any legislation .
the key debates are therefore likely to take place in the two parties ' caucuses before the issue is put to vote . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health / wellness -pipe- 12.10.2008 financial crisis increasing suicide risk , who warns großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will financial woes increase depression worldwide ?
with global stock markets plunging and some banks teetering on bankruptcy , the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- is warning of a surge in suicides and mental illness .
just how depressing can it get ? as the number of foreclosures grow and the value of stock portfolios plummet , news reports from the us of the financial fallout are growing increasingly dire .
a 90-year-old woman in ohio shot herself while being served an eviction notice .
a 45-year-old businessman in los angeles murdered five members of his family before turning the gun on himself , saying in a suicide note that he had done so because of his troubling financial situation .
while these stories put a human face on the toll the financial crisis has taken , the director general of the world health organization this may only be the tip of the iceberg .
" we should not be surprised or underestimate the turbulence and the likely consequences of the financial crisis , ” margaret chan told a meeting of mental health care professionals in geneva , switzerland on thursday this week .
as people struggle to cope with losing their homes or livelihoods , she said , " it should not come as a surprise if we continue to see more stresses , more suicides and more mental disorders . "
financial crisis not the origin of the problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traders are n't the only ones feeling the pain to those who can recall the stories of bankers jumping out of windows across new york at the beginning of the great depression in 1929 , the correlation between a financial crisis and an increase in suicide seems quite real .
but to ulrich hegerl , director of the clinic for psychiatry and psychotherapy at the university of leipzig and spokesperson for german research network on depression and suicidality , the reality is more complicated than that .
“ a person with depression can blame their depression on whatever has been in the news recently , so some might begin to say that they are depressed because of the financial crisis .
but the financial crisis isn ’ t necessarily the basis for the illness in the first place . ”
indeed , one study conducted by the who / euro multicentre study on suicidal behavior showed that a majority of suicides and suicide attempts committed by men were done so by those who were considered “ economically active ” -lrb- i.e. employed -rrb- .
that same study showed little annual change in numbers of suicides from 1989 to 2002 , despite great economic changes after the fall of the iron curtain .
lack of care at root of problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who is especially concerned about the mental health of those in low-income countries still , the problem is one that plagues many countries .
a study released by who in 2001 identified depression as heading the list of disorders responsible for the global burden of disease in industrial countries .
according to the european alliance against depression -lrb- eaad -rrb- , more than 58,000 persons in the countries of the european union commit suicide annually .
europe-wide , dying from suicide accounts for the second highest risk of death for young men and the third highest risk for young women .
who chief margaret chanvstressed that the majority of people worldwide suffering from mental illness live in low- and middle-income countries , where there is an " abysmal lack of care , " inadequate mental health care budgets and where victims suffer from social stigma and discrimination .
hegerl likewise says that proper treatment is the only effective way to lower the prevalence of depression and suicide .
and he warns against misinterpreting the statistics , which , according to the european depression association -lrb- eda -rrb- show the number of cases of depression steadily increasing over the next decade .
“ simply because the financial crisis exists doesn ’ t mean we can assume a higher number of cases of depressed persons .
it ’ s more complicated than that . ” courtney tenz send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

you wo n't be needing it anymore germany national soccer team coach joachim loew sunday barred striker kevin kuranyi from the national side after the schalke player went missing following the team 's world cup qualifier against russia . kuranyi , who had not been picked for saturday evening 's 2010 world cup qualifier in dortmund , had been watching in the stands but was found to be absent following the 2-1 win . loew said he would no longer select the 26-year-old player for the squad . " i can not accept the way kevin reacted and in future will not nominate him for the national team , " the coach said in dusseldorf . kuranyi is believed to have left the stadium during the game which germany won 2-1 thanks to goals from lukas podolski and michael ballack . " i can understand his disappointment , but the reaction on saturday evening is not acceptable or understandable , " loew said .
" at the national team we have 20 top people , and we trainers keep on having to make difficult decisions .
" it surprised us all .
despite several attempts , neither -lrb- team manager -rrb- oliver bierhoff nor i could reach him on the phone . " the german soccer federation said there had been no contact with kuranyi up until the squad 's training on sunday morning . one of kuranyi 's advisors told reporters on sunday , " he decided what he for himself found to be right , which was to say i ’ m going home . " kuranyi was left off the 2006 world cup roster by then-coach juergen klinsmann .
klinsmann never stated why kuranyi had to watch the tournament on tv , but german media speculated the player 's egotistical reputation did n't fit the team klinsmann wanted to build at the time . kuranyi returned to the national team under loew in time for the 2008 european championships and has played in a total of 52 national team matches . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany , france and other nations also said they would announce details of national rescue plans soon . heads of the euro-zone members said they hoped by guaranteeing loans banks would once again begin extending credit to each other , the leaders said in a statement on sunday , oct .

the reluctance of banks to make loans is at the heart of the ongoing finance crisis . while saying market operators need to recognize the scale of the challenge the world faces , french president nicolas sarkozy , who chaired the meeting , said the common action plan " addresses all aspects of the financial crisis . " " the crisis has over the past days entered into a phase that makes it intolerable to opt for procrastination and a go-it-alone approach , " he said , adding that the european union would ask the united states to jointly organize an international summit to reform the international finance system . leaders did not reveal the total size of the cash engagement implied by their measures for taxpayers across the continent . much work remains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many hope the weekend 's news will bring relief when market reopen european central bank head jean-claude trichet endorsed the plans made at the summit , saying they showed a " fundamental element of confidence . "
but he also added that there was still much for europe to do in order to stabilize markets and improve the bloc 's economic situation . european commission president jose manuel barroso , who was also present at sunday 's meeting , called the decisions made by euro-zone leaders " an essential stage of a very urgent procedure . "
he called for european union member states to coordinate their policies for the gradual restoration of confidence . " we have taken the right course for europe , for our businesses and our citizens , " barroso said , adding that it would " bring to an end the excessive pessimism of the markets . " the european leaders were working against the clock to put together a bank rescue strategy that would restore at least some confidence in stock markets after a week of losses unseen since the financial crisis of the 1930s . british prime minister gordon brown said after the paris meeting , " i believe that in the next few days confidence in the banking system will be restored . " details of national plans to follow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany hopes to hammer out an agreement quickly on its rescue package france , germany and italy would all unveil the details of their national bail-out packages on monday , sarkozy said . germany is expected to guarantee interbank loans with between 300 euros and 400 billion euros and to provide banks with fresh capital in exchange for shares , according to media reports . german chancellor angela merkel said only the state could now restore " the necessary trust " to the public and financial markets . " tomorrow germany will get to grips with its package of measures , " merkel said , describing the action plan adopted with fellow european leaders as a " tool box " of possible measures .
" other countries too will also rapidly take measures so that ... an important signal can be given to the markets . " the french government will on monday propose a state guarantee for banks endangered by the financial crisis , a ruling party deputy told the afp news agency . european finance officials have said the news measures will cost several hundred billion euros on top of the huge sums already spent rescuing banks and supporting money markets .
britain , which has already committed more than $ 700 billion to a bank rescue , was to take controlling stakes monday in two major banks worst affected by the crisis , according to media reports . ahead of the euro-zone summit , international monetary fund head dominique strauss-kahn said " intensifying solvency concerns about a number of the largest us-based and european financial institutions have pushed the global financial system to the brink of systemic meltdown . " but he added that an action plan adopted by the group of seven most wealthy nations was a breakthrough with the first global pledge to cooperate to stabilize the turmoil at the meetings . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with global stock markets plunging and some banks teetering on bankruptcy , the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- is warning of a surge in suicides and mental illness .
just how depressing can it get ? as the number of foreclosures grow and the value of stock portfolios plummet , news reports from the us of the financial fallout are growing increasingly dire .
a 90-year-old woman in ohio shot herself while being served an eviction notice .
a 45-year-old businessman in los angeles murdered five members of his family before turning the gun on himself , saying in a suicide note that he had done so because of his troubling financial situation .
while these stories put a human face on the toll the financial crisis has taken , the director general of the world health organization this may only be the tip of the iceberg .
" we should not be surprised or underestimate the turbulence and the likely consequences of the financial crisis , ” margaret chan told a meeting of mental health care professionals in geneva , switzerland on thursday this week .
as people struggle to cope with losing their homes or livelihoods , she said , " it should not come as a surprise if we continue to see more stresses , more suicides and more mental disorders . "
financial crisis not the origin of the problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traders are n't the only ones feeling the pain to those who can recall the stories of bankers jumping out of windows across new york at the beginning of the great depression in 1929 , the correlation between a financial crisis and an increase in suicide seems quite real .
but to ulrich hegerl , director of the clinic for psychiatry and psychotherapy at the university of leipzig and spokesperson for german research network on depression and suicidality , the reality is more complicated than that .
“ a person with depression can blame their depression on whatever has been in the news recently , so some might begin to say that they are depressed because of the financial crisis .
but the financial crisis isn ’ t necessarily the basis for the illness in the first place . ”
indeed , one study conducted by the who / euro multicentre study on suicidal behavior showed that a majority of suicides and suicide attempts committed by men were done so by those who were considered “ economically active ” -lrb- i.e. employed -rrb- .
that same study showed little annual change in numbers of suicides from 1989 to 2002 , despite great economic changes after the fall of the iron curtain .
lack of care at root of problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who is especially concerned about the mental health of those in low-income countries still , the problem is one that plagues many countries .
a study released by who in 2001 identified depression as heading the list of disorders responsible for the global burden of disease in industrial countries .
according to the european alliance against depression -lrb- eaad -rrb- , more than 58,000 persons in the countries of the european union commit suicide annually .
europe-wide , dying from suicide accounts for the second highest risk of death for young men and the third highest risk for young women .
who chief margaret chanvstressed that the majority of people worldwide suffering from mental illness live in low- and middle-income countries , where there is an " abysmal lack of care , " inadequate mental health care budgets and where victims suffer from social stigma and discrimination .
hegerl likewise says that proper treatment is the only effective way to lower the prevalence of depression and suicide .
and he warns against misinterpreting the statistics , which , according to the european depression association -lrb- eda -rrb- show the number of cases of depression steadily increasing over the next decade .
“ simply because the financial crisis exists doesn ’ t mean we can assume a higher number of cases of depressed persons .
it ’ s more complicated than that . ” courtney tenz send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with global stock markets plunging and some banks teetering on bankruptcy , the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- is warning of a surge in suicides and mental illness .
just how depressing can it get ? as the number of foreclosures grow and the value of stock portfolios plummet , news reports from the us of the financial fallout are growing increasingly dire .
a 90-year-old woman in ohio shot herself while being served an eviction notice .
a 45-year-old businessman in los angeles murdered five members of his family before turning the gun on himself , saying in a suicide note that he had done so because of his troubling financial situation .
while these stories put a human face on the toll the financial crisis has taken , the director general of the world health organization this may only be the tip of the iceberg .
" we should not be surprised or underestimate the turbulence and the likely consequences of the financial crisis , ” margaret chan told a meeting of mental health care professionals in geneva , switzerland on thursday this week .
as people struggle to cope with losing their homes or livelihoods , she said , " it should not come as a surprise if we continue to see more stresses , more suicides and more mental disorders . "
financial crisis not the origin of the problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traders are n't the only ones feeling the pain to those who can recall the stories of bankers jumping out of windows across new york at the beginning of the great depression in 1929 , the correlation between a financial crisis and an increase in suicide seems quite real .
but to ulrich hegerl , director of the clinic for psychiatry and psychotherapy at the university of leipzig and spokesperson for german research network on depression and suicidality , the reality is more complicated than that .
“ a person with depression can blame their depression on whatever has been in the news recently , so some might begin to say that they are depressed because of the financial crisis .
but the financial crisis isn ’ t necessarily the basis for the illness in the first place . ”
indeed , one study conducted by the who / euro multicentre study on suicidal behavior showed that a majority of suicides and suicide attempts committed by men were done so by those who were considered “ economically active ” -lrb- i.e. employed -rrb- .
that same study showed little annual change in numbers of suicides from 1989 to 2002 , despite great economic changes after the fall of the iron curtain .
lack of care at root of problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who is especially concerned about the mental health of those in low-income countries still , the problem is one that plagues many countries .
a study released by who in 2001 identified depression as heading the list of disorders responsible for the global burden of disease in industrial countries .
according to the european alliance against depression -lrb- eaad -rrb- , more than 58,000 persons in the countries of the european union commit suicide annually .
europe-wide , dying from suicide accounts for the second highest risk of death for young men and the third highest risk for young women .
who chief margaret chanvstressed that the majority of people worldwide suffering from mental illness live in low- and middle-income countries , where there is an " abysmal lack of care , " inadequate mental health care budgets and where victims suffer from social stigma and discrimination .
hegerl likewise says that proper treatment is the only effective way to lower the prevalence of depression and suicide .
and he warns against misinterpreting the statistics , which , according to the european depression association -lrb- eda -rrb- show the number of cases of depression steadily increasing over the next decade .

you wo n't be needing it anymore germany national soccer team coach joachim loew sunday barred striker kevin kuranyi from the national side after the schalke player went missing following the team 's world cup qualifier against russia . kuranyi , who had not been picked for saturday evening 's 2010 world cup qualifier in dortmund , had been watching in the stands but was found to be absent following the 2-1 win . loew said he would no longer select the 26-year-old player for the squad . " i can not accept the way kevin reacted and in future will not nominate him for the national team , " the coach said in dusseldorf . kuranyi is believed to have left the stadium during the game which germany won 2-1 thanks to goals from lukas podolski and michael ballack . " i can understand his disappointment , but the reaction on saturday evening is not acceptable or understandable , " loew said .
" at the national team we have 20 top people , and we trainers keep on having to make difficult decisions .
" it surprised us all .
despite several attempts , neither -lrb- team manager -rrb- oliver bierhoff nor i could reach him on the phone . " the german soccer federation said there had been no contact with kuranyi up until the squad 's training on sunday morning . one of kuranyi 's advisors told reporters on sunday , " he decided what he for himself found to be right , which was to say i ’ m going home . " kuranyi was left off the 2006 world cup roster by then-coach juergen klinsmann .
klinsmann never stated why kuranyi had to watch the tournament on tv , but german media speculated the player 's egotistical reputation did n't fit the team klinsmann wanted to build at the time . kuranyi returned to the national team under loew in time for the 2008 european championships and has played in a total of 52 national team matches . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but experts say the change in leadership probably wo n't lead to a political shake-up in the austrian right in the near future . the alliance for the future of austria named stefan petzner as it new leader on sunday , oct .
12 , following the death of joerg haider on saturday , the austrian news agency -lrb- apa -rrb- reported .
petzner , 27 , had been haider 's spokesman since 2004 . haider died in a car accident early on saturday near klagenfurt , capital of carinthia , when the car he was driving veered off the road after passing another vehicle at 142 km per hour -lrb- 88 mph -rrb- , twice the legal speed limit , and hit a number of obstacles , including a fence 's concrete foundation , state prosecutors said sunday . hundreds of people held prayers , lit candles and placed wreaths on sunday at government headquarters in the regional capital of klagenfurt , where haider had been governor , and at the accident site . " they are big shoes to fill , but i will keep moving , not stumble , " petzner was quoted as saying .
on saturday he had reacted to the news of haider 's death , saying , " for us , this is like the end of the world . " in parliamentary elections in late september , the populist alliance won almost 11 percent of the ballots , nearly doubling its votes from the previous elections in 2006 . haider divided austrian right bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haider 's death came as a shock to austria and the world haider 's party split in 2005 from the freedom party , which gained prominence under haider 's leadership in the 1980s and 90s .
the two parties could have potentially formed part of a coalition government had their respective leaders not been rivals . " freedom is clearly interested in alliance to grow , and now the old adversary joerg haider is gone too , " political analyst peter filzmaier told reuters news agency .
" a deal would be possible without anybody losing his face after haider 's death .
the question is how quick can alliance get its act together again . " vienna daily der standard wrote sunday that the " far right would now be able to reunify " without the head of the freedom party having to fight for his position . other observers doubted haider 's death will have much of an impact on the austrian political landscape in the near future . " it does n't follow that everybody who voted for the alliance would transfer allegiance to freedom , " peter pulzer , an expert in austrian affairs at oxford university , told retuers .
" not everybody voted for alliance for political reasons , but rather on the grounds of personality . " neither of the parties has officially commented on whether a reunification of the two parties in the wake of haider 's death is on the cards . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but experts say the change in leadership probably wo n't lead to a political shake-up in the austrian right in the near future . the alliance for the future of austria named stefan petzner as it new leader on sunday , oct .
12 , following the death of joerg haider on saturday , the austrian news agency -lrb- apa -rrb- reported .
petzner , 27 , had been haider 's spokesman since 2004 . haider died in a car accident early on saturday near klagenfurt , capital of carinthia , when the car he was driving veered off the road after passing another vehicle at 142 km per hour -lrb- 88 mph -rrb- , twice the legal speed limit , and hit a number of obstacles , including a fence 's concrete foundation , state prosecutors said sunday . hundreds of people held prayers , lit candles and placed wreaths on sunday at government headquarters in the regional capital of klagenfurt , where haider had been governor , and at the accident site . " they are big shoes to fill , but i will keep moving , not stumble , " petzner was quoted as saying .
on saturday he had reacted to the news of haider 's death , saying , " for us , this is like the end of the world . " in parliamentary elections in late september , the populist alliance won almost 11 percent of the ballots , nearly doubling its votes from the previous elections in 2006 . haider divided austrian right bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haider 's death came as a shock to austria and the world haider 's party split in 2005 from the freedom party , which gained prominence under haider 's leadership in the 1980s and 90s .
the two parties could have potentially formed part of a coalition government had their respective leaders not been rivals . " freedom is clearly interested in alliance to grow , and now the old adversary joerg haider is gone too , " political analyst peter filzmaier told reuters news agency .
" a deal would be possible without anybody losing his face after haider 's death .
the question is how quick can alliance get its act together again . " vienna daily der standard wrote sunday that the " far right would now be able to reunify " without the head of the freedom party having to fight for his position . other observers doubted haider 's death will have much of an impact on the austrian political landscape in the near future . " it does n't follow that everybody who voted for the alliance would transfer allegiance to freedom , " peter pulzer , an expert in austrian affairs at oxford university , told retuers .
" not everybody voted for alliance for political reasons , but rather on the grounds of personality . " neither of the parties has officially commented on whether a reunification of the two parties in the wake of haider 's death is on the cards . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

you wo n't be needing it anymore germany national soccer team coach joachim loew sunday barred striker kevin kuranyi from the national side after the schalke player went missing following the team 's world cup qualifier against russia . kuranyi , who had not been picked for saturday evening 's 2010 world cup qualifier in dortmund , had been watching in the stands but was found to be absent following the 2-1 win . loew said he would no longer select the 26-year-old player for the squad . " i can not accept the way kevin reacted and in future will not nominate him for the national team , " the coach said in dusseldorf . kuranyi is believed to have left the stadium during the game which germany won 2-1 thanks to goals from lukas podolski and michael ballack . " i can understand his disappointment , but the reaction on saturday evening is not acceptable or understandable , " loew said .
" at the national team we have 20 top people , and we trainers keep on having to make difficult decisions .
" it surprised us all .
despite several attempts , neither -lrb- team manager -rrb- oliver bierhoff nor i could reach him on the phone . " the german soccer federation said there had been no contact with kuranyi up until the squad 's training on sunday morning . one of kuranyi 's advisors told reporters on sunday , " he decided what he for himself found to be right , which was to say i ’ m going home . " kuranyi was left off the 2006 world cup roster by then-coach juergen klinsmann .
klinsmann never stated why kuranyi had to watch the tournament on tv , but german media speculated the player 's egotistical reputation did n't fit the team klinsmann wanted to build at the time . kuranyi returned to the national team under loew in time for the 2008 european championships and has played in a total of 52 national team matches . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i can not accept the way kevin reacted and in future will not nominate him for the national team , " the coach said in dusseldorf . kuranyi is believed to have left the stadium during the game which germany won 2-1 thanks to goals from lukas podolski and michael ballack .

members of the imf have backed a promise by the world 's seven leading economies to do all they can to curb the raging global market turmoil as euro-zone countries meet sunday to announce new rescue plans for banks . at a meeting on saturday , oct .
11 , in washington , the imf 's 185 member countries also pushed for more coordination with developing nations which are beginning to feel the effects of the global credit crunch . with global stock markets plunging and access to credit severely curbed across the globe , tackling the crisis required " exceptional vigilance , coordination and readiness to take bold action , " read a statement from the international monetary and financial committee -lrb- imfc -rrb- , the imf 's policy-guiding body . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss-kahn has given a dire warning for the world economy imf head dominique strauss-kahn said the world 's reeling financial system was teetering on " the brink of systemic meltdown . " " the first coordination between advanced countries and the rest of the world is now on track , " he said at a news conference on the first day of annual international monetary fund and world bank meetings in washington . gloomy forecasts for world economy earlier , finance ministers and central bank heads from the group of seven -lrb- g7 -rrb- industrial nations promised to use " all necessary tools " and adopt a five-point action plan help stabilize the global financial system . us president george w. bush , who met saturday with the g7 finance ministers , said the world 's economic powers " will stand together in addressing this threat to our prosperity " and " do what it takes to resolve this crisis . " global stock markets suffered record declines over the last week amid gloomy forecasts from the imf and others over the state of the world economy . the imf forecast global growth of 3.9 percent in 2008 and 3 percent in 2009 .
all eyes will be on the reactions of investors at monday 's market openings in asia and europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : global markets have so far proved immune to reassurances by governments in another bleak prediction saturday , imf chief economist olivier blanchard told italian daily corriere della sera that stocks could fall another 20 percent in the coming weeks . critics of the g7 's meeting friday said their commitments lacked specifics , but strauss-kahn said saturday 's endorsement of the g7 's action plan marked the " first big success of coordination " on an international level . he pointed to the g7 's promise to keep " important financial institutions " in their countries from collapsing and said he expected the moves would help free up banks to start bringing in new capital . " in the coming days , what i expect is that the reaction by the different -lrb- financial -rrb- institutions will be positive enough to unfreeze the credit market and to restore the necessary funding , " strauss-kahn said . germany to unveil british-style rescue package a number of western countries are working on rescue plans to keep their own financial sectors afloat . us treasury secretary henry paulson on friday said it was " naive " of investors to expect countries with different financial , economic and political systems to come up with the same policies to stabilize their own financial sectors . the us was preparing to buy equity stakes in banks as part of a $ 700 billion bail-out package already passed by congress and signed into law .
britain has passed its own rescue plan , and germany will unveil its own version on monday . the german plan is expected to resemble the british rescue package that would offer the finance industry interbank guarantees worth " triple digit " billions , according to various german media . german chancellor angela merkel said germany may inject capital into its banks but it was not planning to take permanent stakes in them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has changed tack on plans to bail out tottering banks " only action by the state is capable of restoring the necessary trust , " merkel was quoted as saying by the bild am sonntag .
" in this it is important that countries do not act unilaterally , but that we coordinate at european and international level and then implement the measures within our national responsibilities . " media reports said germany 's rescue package could be adopted " in days " using accelerated legal proceedings , and that the cabinet aimed to approve the measures on monday . sarkozy and merkel paved the way on saturday for european measures to tackle the global financial crisis but revealed little about their plans . sarkozy , whose country holds the rotating six-month presidency of the european union , has called an emergency meeting on sunday of the 15 countries that have the euro as their currency , to take coordinate action to temper the financial storm . imf vows to help developing nations out of crisis strauss-kahn said the imf was ready to make emergency money available to developing countries with critical budget shortfalls . some poorer countries have already seen slowing exports and investment at home due to the sharp economic downturn in wealthy nations . developing countries have urged industrial nations to keep them in the loop about plans to address the financial crisis and warned against cutting back aid commitments . " who is going to compensate the innocent countries ?
who are likely to suffer from this debacle through no fault of their own ? " asked kenyan finance minister john michuki . the group of 20 - a wider bloc of advanced and emerging economies - was meeting saturday evening to discuss the crisis . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with global stock markets plunging and some banks teetering on bankruptcy , the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- is warning of a surge in suicides and mental illness .
just how depressing can it get ? as the number of foreclosures grow and the value of stock portfolios plummet , news reports from the us of the financial fallout are growing increasingly dire .
a 90-year-old woman in ohio shot herself while being served an eviction notice .
a 45-year-old businessman in los angeles murdered five members of his family before turning the gun on himself , saying in a suicide note that he had done so because of his troubling financial situation .
while these stories put a human face on the toll the financial crisis has taken , the director general of the world health organization this may only be the tip of the iceberg .
" we should not be surprised or underestimate the turbulence and the likely consequences of the financial crisis , ” margaret chan told a meeting of mental health care professionals in geneva , switzerland on thursday this week .
as people struggle to cope with losing their homes or livelihoods , she said , " it should not come as a surprise if we continue to see more stresses , more suicides and more mental disorders . "
financial crisis not the origin of the problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traders are n't the only ones feeling the pain to those who can recall the stories of bankers jumping out of windows across new york at the beginning of the great depression in 1929 , the correlation between a financial crisis and an increase in suicide seems quite real .
but to ulrich hegerl , director of the clinic for psychiatry and psychotherapy at the university of leipzig and spokesperson for german research network on depression and suicidality , the reality is more complicated than that .
“ a person with depression can blame their depression on whatever has been in the news recently , so some might begin to say that they are depressed because of the financial crisis .
but the financial crisis isn ’ t necessarily the basis for the illness in the first place . ”
indeed , one study conducted by the who / euro multicentre study on suicidal behavior showed that a majority of suicides and suicide attempts committed by men were done so by those who were considered “ economically active ” -lrb- i.e. employed -rrb- .
that same study showed little annual change in numbers of suicides from 1989 to 2002 , despite great economic changes after the fall of the iron curtain .
lack of care at root of problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who is especially concerned about the mental health of those in low-income countries still , the problem is one that plagues many countries .
a study released by who in 2001 identified depression as heading the list of disorders responsible for the global burden of disease in industrial countries .
according to the european alliance against depression -lrb- eaad -rrb- , more than 58,000 persons in the countries of the european union commit suicide annually .
europe-wide , dying from suicide accounts for the second highest risk of death for young men and the third highest risk for young women .
who chief margaret chanvstressed that the majority of people worldwide suffering from mental illness live in low- and middle-income countries , where there is an " abysmal lack of care , " inadequate mental health care budgets and where victims suffer from social stigma and discrimination .
hegerl likewise says that proper treatment is the only effective way to lower the prevalence of depression and suicide .
and he warns against misinterpreting the statistics , which , according to the european depression association -lrb- eda -rrb- show the number of cases of depression steadily increasing over the next decade .
“ simply because the financial crisis exists doesn ’ t mean we can assume a higher number of cases of depressed persons .
it ’ s more complicated than that . ” courtney tenz send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with global stock markets plunging and some banks teetering on bankruptcy , the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- is warning of a surge in suicides and mental illness .
just how depressing can it get ? as the number of foreclosures grow and the value of stock portfolios plummet , news reports from the us of the financial fallout are growing increasingly dire .
a 90-year-old woman in ohio shot herself while being served an eviction notice .
a 45-year-old businessman in los angeles murdered five members of his family before turning the gun on himself , saying in a suicide note that he had done so because of his troubling financial situation .
while these stories put a human face on the toll the financial crisis has taken , the director general of the world health organization this may only be the tip of the iceberg .
" we should not be surprised or underestimate the turbulence and the likely consequences of the financial crisis , ” margaret chan told a meeting of mental health care professionals in geneva , switzerland on thursday this week .
as people struggle to cope with losing their homes or livelihoods , she said , " it should not come as a surprise if we continue to see more stresses , more suicides and more mental disorders . "
financial crisis not the origin of the problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traders are n't the only ones feeling the pain to those who can recall the stories of bankers jumping out of windows across new york at the beginning of the great depression in 1929 , the correlation between a financial crisis and an increase in suicide seems quite real .
but to ulrich hegerl , director of the clinic for psychiatry and psychotherapy at the university of leipzig and spokesperson for german research network on depression and suicidality , the reality is more complicated than that .
“ a person with depression can blame their depression on whatever has been in the news recently , so some might begin to say that they are depressed because of the financial crisis .
but the financial crisis isn ’ t necessarily the basis for the illness in the first place . ”
indeed , one study conducted by the who / euro multicentre study on suicidal behavior showed that a majority of suicides and suicide attempts committed by men were done so by those who were considered “ economically active ” -lrb- i.e. employed -rrb- .
that same study showed little annual change in numbers of suicides from 1989 to 2002 , despite great economic changes after the fall of the iron curtain .
lack of care at root of problem bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who is especially concerned about the mental health of those in low-income countries still , the problem is one that plagues many countries .
a study released by who in 2001 identified depression as heading the list of disorders responsible for the global burden of disease in industrial countries .
according to the european alliance against depression -lrb- eaad -rrb- , more than 58,000 persons in the countries of the european union commit suicide annually .
europe-wide , dying from suicide accounts for the second highest risk of death for young men and the third highest risk for young women .
who chief margaret chanvstressed that the majority of people worldwide suffering from mental illness live in low- and middle-income countries , where there is an " abysmal lack of care , " inadequate mental health care budgets and where victims suffer from social stigma and discrimination .
hegerl likewise says that proper treatment is the only effective way to lower the prevalence of depression and suicide .
and he warns against misinterpreting the statistics , which , according to the european depression association -lrb- eda -rrb- show the number of cases of depression steadily increasing over the next decade .
“ simply because the financial crisis exists doesn ’ t mean we can assume a higher number of cases of depressed persons .
it ’ s more complicated than that . ” courtney tenz send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

all eyes will be on the reactions of investors at monday 's market openings in asia and europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : global markets have so far proved immune to reassurances by governments in another bleak prediction saturday , imf chief economist olivier blanchard told italian daily corriere della sera that stocks could fall another 20 percent in the coming weeks . critics of the g7 's meeting friday said their commitments lacked specifics , but strauss-kahn said saturday 's endorsement of the g7 's action plan marked the " first big success of coordination " on an international level . he pointed to the g7 's promise to keep " important financial institutions " in their countries from collapsing and said he expected the moves would help free up banks to start bringing in new capital . " in the coming days , what i expect is that the reaction by the different -lrb- financial -rrb- institutions will be positive enough to unfreeze the credit market and to restore the necessary funding , " strauss-kahn said . germany to unveil british-style rescue package a number of western countries are working on rescue plans to keep their own financial sectors afloat . us treasury secretary henry paulson on friday said it was " naive " of investors to expect countries with different financial , economic and political systems to come up with the same policies to stabilize their own financial sectors . the us was preparing to buy equity stakes in banks as part of a $ 700 billion bail-out package already passed by congress and signed into law .
britain has passed its own rescue plan , and germany will unveil its own version on monday . the german plan is expected to resemble the british rescue package that would offer the finance industry interbank guarantees worth " triple digit " billions , according to various german media . german chancellor angela merkel said germany may inject capital into its banks but it was not planning to take permanent stakes in them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has changed tack on plans to bail out tottering banks " only action by the state is capable of restoring the necessary trust , " merkel was quoted as saying by the bild am sonntag .
" in this it is important that countries do not act unilaterally , but that we coordinate at european and international level and then implement the measures within our national responsibilities . " media reports said germany 's rescue package could be adopted " in days " using accelerated legal proceedings , and that the cabinet aimed to approve the measures on monday . sarkozy and merkel paved the way on saturday for european measures to tackle the global financial crisis but revealed little about their plans . sarkozy , whose country holds the rotating six-month presidency of the european union , has called an emergency meeting on sunday of the 15 countries that have the euro as their currency , to take coordinate action to temper the financial storm . imf vows to help developing nations out of crisis strauss-kahn said the imf was ready to make emergency money available to developing countries with critical budget shortfalls . some poorer countries have already seen slowing exports and investment at home due to the sharp economic downturn in wealthy nations . developing countries have urged industrial nations to keep them in the loop about plans to address the financial crisis and warned against cutting back aid commitments . " who is going to compensate the innocent countries ?
who are likely to suffer from this debacle through no fault of their own ? " asked kenyan finance minister john michuki . the group of 20 - a wider bloc of advanced and emerging economies - was meeting saturday evening to discuss the crisis . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" " the crisis has over the past days entered into a phase that makes it intolerable to opt for procrastination and a go-it-alone approach , " he said , adding that the european union would ask the united states to jointly organize an international summit to reform the international finance system . leaders did not reveal the total size of the cash engagement implied by their measures for taxpayers across the continent . much work remains bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many hope the weekend 's news will bring relief when market reopen european central bank head jean-claude trichet endorsed the plans made at the summit , saying they showed a " fundamental element of confidence . "
but he also added that there was still much for europe to do in order to stabilize markets and improve the bloc 's economic situation . european commission president jose manuel barroso , who was also present at sunday 's meeting , called the decisions made by euro-zone leaders " an essential stage of a very urgent procedure . "
he called for european union member states to coordinate their policies for the gradual restoration of confidence . " we have taken the right course for europe , for our businesses and our citizens , " barroso said , adding that it would " bring to an end the excessive pessimism of the markets . " the european leaders were working against the clock to put together a bank rescue strategy that would restore at least some confidence in stock markets after a week of losses unseen since the financial crisis of the 1930s . british prime minister gordon brown said after the paris meeting , " i believe that in the next few days confidence in the banking system will be restored . " details of national plans to follow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany hopes to hammer out an agreement quickly on its rescue package france , germany and italy would all unveil the details of their national bail-out packages on monday , sarkozy said . germany is expected to guarantee interbank loans with between 300 euros and 400 billion euros and to provide banks with fresh capital in exchange for shares , according to media reports . german chancellor angela merkel said only the state could now restore " the necessary trust " to the public and financial markets . " tomorrow germany will get to grips with its package of measures , " merkel said , describing the action plan adopted with fellow european leaders as a " tool box " of possible measures .
" other countries too will also rapidly take measures so that ... an important signal can be given to the markets . " the french government will on monday propose a state guarantee for banks endangered by the financial crisis , a ruling party deputy told the afp news agency . european finance officials have said the news measures will cost several hundred billion euros on top of the huge sums already spent rescuing banks and supporting money markets .
britain , which has already committed more than $ 700 billion to a bank rescue , was to take controlling stakes monday in two major banks worst affected by the crisis , according to media reports . ahead of the euro-zone summit , international monetary fund head dominique strauss-kahn said " intensifying solvency concerns about a number of the largest us-based and european financial institutions have pushed the global financial system to the brink of systemic meltdown . " but he added that an action plan adopted by the group of seven most wealthy nations was a breakthrough with the first global pledge to cooperate to stabilize the turmoil at the meetings . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

members of the imf have backed a promise by the world 's seven leading economies to do all they can to curb the raging global market turmoil as euro-zone countries meet sunday to announce new rescue plans for banks . at a meeting on saturday , oct .
11 , in washington , the imf 's 185 member countries also pushed for more coordination with developing nations which are beginning to feel the effects of the global credit crunch . with global stock markets plunging and access to credit severely curbed across the globe , tackling the crisis required " exceptional vigilance , coordination and readiness to take bold action , " read a statement from the international monetary and financial committee -lrb- imfc -rrb- , the imf 's policy-guiding body . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strauss-kahn has given a dire warning for the world economy imf head dominique strauss-kahn said the world 's reeling financial system was teetering on " the brink of systemic meltdown . " " the first coordination between advanced countries and the rest of the world is now on track , " he said at a news conference on the first day of annual international monetary fund and world bank meetings in washington . gloomy forecasts for world economy earlier , finance ministers and central bank heads from the group of seven -lrb- g7 -rrb- industrial nations promised to use " all necessary tools " and adopt a five-point action plan help stabilize the global financial system . us president george w. bush , who met saturday with the g7 finance ministers , said the world 's economic powers " will stand together in addressing this threat to our prosperity " and " do what it takes to resolve this crisis . " global stock markets suffered record declines over the last week amid gloomy forecasts from the imf and others over the state of the world economy . the imf forecast global growth of 3.9 percent in 2008 and 3 percent in 2009 .
all eyes will be on the reactions of investors at monday 's market openings in asia and europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : global markets have so far proved immune to reassurances by governments in another bleak prediction saturday , imf chief economist olivier blanchard told italian daily corriere della sera that stocks could fall another 20 percent in the coming weeks . critics of the g7 's meeting friday said their commitments lacked specifics , but strauss-kahn said saturday 's endorsement of the g7 's action plan marked the " first big success of coordination " on an international level . he pointed to the g7 's promise to keep " important financial institutions " in their countries from collapsing and said he expected the moves would help free up banks to start bringing in new capital . " in the coming days , what i expect is that the reaction by the different -lrb- financial -rrb- institutions will be positive enough to unfreeze the credit market and to restore the necessary funding , " strauss-kahn said . germany to unveil british-style rescue package a number of western countries are working on rescue plans to keep their own financial sectors afloat . us treasury secretary henry paulson on friday said it was " naive " of investors to expect countries with different financial , economic and political systems to come up with the same policies to stabilize their own financial sectors . the us was preparing to buy equity stakes in banks as part of a $ 700 billion bail-out package already passed by congress and signed into law .
britain has passed its own rescue plan , and germany will unveil its own version on monday . the german plan is expected to resemble the british rescue package that would offer the finance industry interbank guarantees worth " triple digit " billions , according to various german media . german chancellor angela merkel said germany may inject capital into its banks but it was not planning to take permanent stakes in them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has changed tack on plans to bail out tottering banks " only action by the state is capable of restoring the necessary trust , " merkel was quoted as saying by the bild am sonntag .
" in this it is important that countries do not act unilaterally , but that we coordinate at european and international level and then implement the measures within our national responsibilities . " media reports said germany 's rescue package could be adopted " in days " using accelerated legal proceedings , and that the cabinet aimed to approve the measures on monday . sarkozy and merkel paved the way on saturday for european measures to tackle the global financial crisis but revealed little about their plans . sarkozy , whose country holds the rotating six-month presidency of the european union , has called an emergency meeting on sunday of the 15 countries that have the euro as their currency , to take coordinate action to temper the financial storm . imf vows to help developing nations out of crisis strauss-kahn said the imf was ready to make emergency money available to developing countries with critical budget shortfalls . some poorer countries have already seen slowing exports and investment at home due to the sharp economic downturn in wealthy nations . developing countries have urged industrial nations to keep them in the loop about plans to address the financial crisis and warned against cutting back aid commitments . " who is going to compensate the innocent countries ?
who are likely to suffer from this debacle through no fault of their own ? " asked kenyan finance minister john michuki . the group of 20 - a wider bloc of advanced and emerging economies - was meeting saturday evening to discuss the crisis . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

you wo n't be needing it anymore germany national soccer team coach joachim loew sunday barred striker kevin kuranyi from the national side after the schalke player went missing following the team 's world cup qualifier against russia . kuranyi , who had not been picked for saturday evening 's 2010 world cup qualifier in dortmund , had been watching in the stands but was found to be absent following the 2-1 win . loew said he would no longer select the 26-year-old player for the squad . " i can not accept the way kevin reacted and in future will not nominate him for the national team , " the coach said in dusseldorf . kuranyi is believed to have left the stadium during the game which germany won 2-1 thanks to goals from lukas podolski and michael ballack . " i can understand his disappointment , but the reaction on saturday evening is not acceptable or understandable , " loew said .
" at the national team we have 20 top people , and we trainers keep on having to make difficult decisions .
" it surprised us all .
despite several attempts , neither -lrb- team manager -rrb- oliver bierhoff nor i could reach him on the phone . " the german soccer federation said there had been no contact with kuranyi up until the squad 's training on sunday morning . one of kuranyi 's advisors told reporters on sunday , " he decided what he for himself found to be right , which was to say i ’ m going home . " kuranyi was left off the 2006 world cup roster by then-coach juergen klinsmann .
klinsmann never stated why kuranyi had to watch the tournament on tv , but german media speculated the player 's egotistical reputation did n't fit the team klinsmann wanted to build at the time . kuranyi returned to the national team under loew in time for the 2008 european championships and has played in a total of 52 national team matches . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

berlin 's bail-out package could cost german taxpayers billions of euros . in remarks to a sunday newspaper , bild am sonntag , merkel said , " only action by the state can restore necessary confidence now . " before a meeting sunday , oct .
12 , in paris of the 15 euro zone leaders , she said that the intervention had to be internationally coordinated . " we are not doing this for the sake of the banks but in the interests of the people , " she told the mass-market bild . as in the united states , the german left has grumbled at a rescue likely to cost tens of billions of euros , saying it comes only a few years after a reduction in the scale of welfare handouts to the german poor . though she called sunday 's euro-zone meeting important to bring a return of confidence in european markets , merkel reiterated her opposition to a joint bail-out by the euro zone , saying each country must deal with its own troubles . " this meeting is to decide on coordinated joint action in the euro zone so that every country in the coming days can put in place measures that stabilize the financial markets , " merkel told reporters as she arrived for the meeting at the elysee presidential palace . four of the g7 nations which set out the broad direction of the plan on friday in washington will be represented at the 16-nation paris summit , which will embrace britain although the british do not use the euro currency . four-point rescue plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bailout is rumored to include an option of partially nationalizing banks a week ago berlin put together a 50-billion-euro rescue of hypo real estate , the country 's fourth biggest bank , but this took the form of guaranteeing badly needed credit lines rather than the state taking a stake in the stricken commercial property lender . after a severe deterioration of german banks ' liquidity shortages , as markets have tumbled in the past week and short-term lending among banks has become even more difficult to come by , has forced policy reversal in berlin . merkel has not detailed berlin 's actions and the finance ministry said information about the plans would be announced monday at the earliest , but sources in berlin told german news agency dpa they would comprise four elements . one would be a government guarantee to encourage the german banks to lend one another money .
many were nervously parking money at tiny rates of interest with the central banks at the end of last week rather than lending it where it is needed . reviving inter-bank lending would allow credit to resume flowing into the wider economy . a second part would be copied from the $ 700 billion -lrb- 522 billion euro -rrb- us bail-out , with toxic assets at the banks , such as investment certificates based on worthless real estate , being shifted to a so- called bad bank , which would buy the assets with taxpayer money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : falling stock prices across europe played a role in germany 's policy re-think a third element would be to recapitalize the banks , which have exhausted most of their shareholder funds as they write off vast quantities of worthless debt . britain has already made that move , saying last week it will invest at least 50 billion pounds -lrb- $ 87 billion , 63.7 billion euros -rrb- to recapitalize eight or more banks including barclays and royal bank of scotland group .
the government could sell the stakes again later . tough rules expected for nationalized banks bild as well as weekly welt am sonntag reported sunday that the worst hit institutions are not private german banks but the landebanks , the regional lending powerhouses that are owned by germany 's 16 states . merkel also committed herself in a statement to parliament on tuesday to alter accounting rules , as the us congress has just done , so that tainted assets can be taken off bank balance sheets in all the european union nations . the online version of german business daily handelsblatt said berlin was likely to dictate some strict terms to the banks for rescuing them . the banks would be required to reform their business models and make fundamental changes to executive pay , altering the incentive systems and retirement bonuses that have prompted accusations that bank chiefs are greedy . the german legislation is likely to be discussed monday in merkel 's cabinet before it is sent to parliament . merkel leads a grand coalition between her own christian democrats and the german social democrats , which can comfortably pass any legislation .
the key debates are therefore likely to take place in the two parties ' caucuses before the issue is put to vote . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

you wo n't be needing it anymore germany national soccer team coach joachim loew sunday barred striker kevin kuranyi from the national side after the schalke player went missing following the team 's world cup qualifier against russia . kuranyi , who had not been picked for saturday evening 's 2010 world cup qualifier in dortmund , had been watching in the stands but was found to be absent following the 2-1 win . loew said he would no longer select the 26-year-old player for the squad . " i can not accept the way kevin reacted and in future will not nominate him for the national team , " the coach said in dusseldorf . kuranyi is believed to have left the stadium during the game which germany won 2-1 thanks to goals from lukas podolski and michael ballack . " i can understand his disappointment , but the reaction on saturday evening is not acceptable or understandable , " loew said .
" at the national team we have 20 top people , and we trainers keep on having to make difficult decisions .
" it surprised us all .
despite several attempts , neither -lrb- team manager -rrb- oliver bierhoff nor i could reach him on the phone . " the german soccer federation said there had been no contact with kuranyi up until the squad 's training on sunday morning . one of kuranyi 's advisors told reporters on sunday , " he decided what he for himself found to be right , which was to say i ’ m going home . " kuranyi was left off the 2006 world cup roster by then-coach juergen klinsmann .
klinsmann never stated why kuranyi had to watch the tournament on tv , but german media speculated the player 's egotistical reputation did n't fit the team klinsmann wanted to build at the time . kuranyi returned to the national team under loew in time for the 2008 european championships and has played in a total of 52 national team matches . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

council leaders are understood to have asked the government to help tide them over the current financial crisis .
about 100 councils in england , scotland and wales have deposits in collapsed icelandic banks worth £ 842.5m.
council leaders are to meet the icelandic ambassador next week to seek assurances over their investments .
they plan to press the government in reykjavik to ensure that deposits held by uk councils in the now nationalised icelandic banks are fully repaid .
most of the money invested by local authorities in icelandic banks is over the longer term , although some councils deposit payroll money to earn interest - money which is now out of reach because of the collapse of iceland 's banks .
talks are also continuing between the british treasury and icelandic officials over frozen uk deposits held in the banks .
council reserves councils affected want the government to tide them over by allowing them to keep the revenue from business rates , which they normally pass onto government first .
unions are watching with concern and want to know how many workers could be affected .
the local government association -lrb- lga -rrb- , which represents councils in england and wales , said all councils held reserves and in the majority of cases there would be no impact on staff pay or services .
the government has ruled out any large-scale bail-out of councils , instead promising assistance to those facing severe short-term difficulties .
taxpayers ' cash the lga said the meeting with the icelandic ambassador would take place next week .
it wants taxpayers ' money to be a top priority when repayments are made , and says if it fails to win assurances from the ambassador , it will take its case directly to the icelandic government .
it insisted councils had not been " reckless " with taxpayers ' cash by depositing it in icelandic banks .
the uk chancellor has said all uk private accounts affected by the iceland bank crisis will be protected .
a treasury delegation , which includes officials from the bank of england and the financial services authority , is in reykjavik trying to establish a claims procedure for british depositors to get their money back as soon as possible .
the talks are expected to last all weekend and the early signs are that significant progress has been made .

joanne segars national association of pension funds a pension is there to provide happiness in retirement ...
against the background of the extreme conditions that we have seen this week , in one area it is important to keep a keen a sense of perspective and proportion - workplace pensions .
looking at the uk as a whole , we have one of the best protected systems in the eu , with the pension protection fund , the pensions regulator and the financial services authority .
in addition , confidence amongst employees of pensions as the best way to save for retirement has also been improving throughout 2008 .
twice a year , the napf measures the pensions confidence rating amongst workers and earlier in 2008 the rating was a mere + 3 % , but by mid-september it was + 22 % .
partly , this is due to people " psychologically ring-fencing " their pension despite the pressures on household incomes .
they are going back to the traditional " at least i have got my pension " .
in addition , falling house prices have meant that a number of people are thinking again about relying on property to save for their retirement .
there are two types of private sector workplace pensions in the uk .
one -rsb- defined benefit pensions which are salary-related -lrb- often referred to as ' final-salary ' pensions -rrb- and two -rsb- defined contribution pensions which are based on the performance of the money invested by the employer and employee .
the latter includes group personal pensions and group stakeholder pensions .
it is important to look at the effect for those with retirement savings in these different types of schemes .
defined benefit many go to great lengths to protect their pensions ...
pension funds are long-term investors and members of these pension schemes will not be directly affected by the recent stock market falls as , in the first instance , the employer will be expected to make up any shortfall .
in addition , uk pension funds have been reducing the amount of money they hold in the uk stock markets and also stock markets around the world .
for example , in 2006 , uk pension funds had 28 % invested in the uk stock market , this year that figure had reduced to 21 % .
it means they are not better cushioned from the effects of the stock market than previously .
it would be naive though to think that this week and the market volatility of the past year will have no effect .
for those already in these schemes , as stated , it is the responsibility of the employer to deliver the pension promised to people .
however , over the longer term , a prolonged adverse economic climate may make some employers review their commitment to keeping this form of pension scheme open to new employees .
currently , 28 % of these schemes , covering 1.3 million people , are still open to new members .
defined contribution schemes there are approximately five million members of these schemes , and for people who are more than five or 10 years from retirement , past experience suggests that asset values will recover in advance of their retirement date .
our message is ' do n't panic ' joanne segars it is true , however , that those within a few years of retirement age , might potentially see a fall in their pension fund value and that this could result in a lower pension .
however , fortunately , around 75 % of members are in lifestyle funds which means that if they are close to retirement , their fund will already have been switched to less volatile assets such as bonds or cash .
they are , therefore , cushioned from the impact of recent falls .
conclusion in conclusion , it is important that both commentators and employees maintain a sense of perspective amongst the turmoil currently taking place .
a minority of people with a workplace pension could be affected but only really if they are approaching retirement with a defined contribution pension that is not in a lifestyle fund .
for others , the effects should be relatively neutral .
our message is ' do n't panic ' .
