3 , miliband said no decision would be taken until after the united nations security council had met on the issue .
" we 're talking about the work of the 17,000 un peacekeepers there at the moment and the role of the european union in supporting that politically , diplomatically , and no-one 's ruling out a military role , " he told reporters .
un secretary general ban-ki moon has sent his deputy in charge of peacekeeping to the drc to investigate and report on an upsurge in violence .
aiming to avoid genocide " it will be for the united nations including eu countries in the un to listen to that report , " miliband said .

subsequently , both ministers travelled together to the region .
" the world 's political leaders are determined to make sure there 's no repeat of the murderous activities of the 1990s , " miliband added , referring to the genocide in rwanda and civil war in eastern congo .

a ceasefire declared last week by rebels who took over parts of goma appeared to be holding , but prodhan warned the un peacekeeping force must be reinforced .
" given the fragility of the ceasefire and fears for another outbreak of intense fighting around goma , more troops must be deployed as soon as possible , " prodhan said .
of the 17,000 un peacekeeping troops in congo , only 850 of them are in goma .
speaking to reporters in dar es salaam on sunday , where he and kouchner held talks with tanzanian president jakaya kikwete , miliband said : " we agree that the monuc troops currently in the drc are inadequate given the size of the country . "
prodhan said the european troops could help create a secure environment for humanitarian agencies to help people who were in desperate need .
oxfam has began trucking water sunday to people sheltering in the area of kanyabayonga , north of goma , and is providing water and sanitation to 65,000 people in four displaced-persons camps in goma .

dressed in a green beret , military fatigues and dark sunglasses , nkunda accused the international community of failing ethnic tutsis in a meeting with reporters at his jungle base on sunday .
" we want direct negotiations with the government , i am waiting for an answer , " said the 41-year-old rebel .

now , with the financial crisis affecting auto makers and other giant producers , tens of thousands of temp workers stand to lose their jobs . they are cheaper than their salaried colleagues .
they do n't get extra bonuses for christmas and vacations .
but most importantly , car makers and other manufacturers can get rid of temporary workers in a pinch .
" there are of course good people who you are sad to see go .
but it is the quickest and least bureaucratic way to cut the payrolls , " said ottmar zwiebelhofer , the head of a auto-parts maker koenig metall in the western state of baden wuerttemberg . his company makes airbags and car mufflers , so when car companies ' profits suffer , koenig metall feels the pain .
zwiebelhofer expects volume to drop by 20 percent this year .
pink slips abound it is a given that the first to lose their jobs in hard times are temp workers - and that 's not just the case at koenig metall .
auto supplier hella is n't renewing the contracts of some 200 of its temporary workers ; its competitor honsel is giving 100 temps pink slips .
at german car giant vw , thousands of temporary jobs are hanging in the balance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many workers hold the same temp job for years it 's not only short-term hires who are affected .
some workers have had their factory jobs for years , but continue to be officially employed and paid through a temp firm .
just a few weeks ago , many of them hoped to be taken over by the companies themselves .
but while metal-industry companies have been swimming in orders in the past years , the boon has n't translated into many employment contracts .
instead , companies have chosen to benefit from the flexibility of workers from temp agencies .
that system that is now turning on itself , said hartmut seifert , labor market expert for the union-affiliated hans-böckler-stiftung foundation .
" we know that there is a two percent quota of temporary workers .
but there are companies whose work force is made up of over 20 percent temps , " said siefert .
boom started with agenda 2010 the boom in temp agency work was started by the last german administration , a coalition of social democrats and greens that devised the agenda 2010 package of social reforms .
the watchword back in 2003 was " marketplace flexibility . "
since then , temp workers have been allowed to be in a job for more than one year - a ruling that was embraced enthusiastically by companies .
the government 's goal at the time was to use temp work to create more permanent employment , but things did n't work out that way .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those in export industries , like cars , will be hardest hit instead , well known temp agencies like randstad , adecco and permacon were booking heavy profits , and looking desperately for qualified personnel .
in the last year alone , the number of temp workers in germany has doubled to 750,000 , even while unemployment figures have fallen .
those days are over , labor-market expert seifert said .
" it is entirely possible that a third of this number will lose their job in the next months . "
it 's not just the auto industry where temp workers face hard times . many temp workers are employed by companies in machine-making , pharmaceuticals and chemicals - industries that live from exports and could run into serious problems amid the world economic crisis .
less opportunity seen for temps temp workers " have a higher risk of being laid off .
they earn less than permanent employees , and have less access to further job training , " siefert said .
this means they have less opportunity to improve their chances at getting another job , he noted .
he believes temp workers should get a " risk premium " - in the form of higher wages - for taking so much risk in their employment .
while it may be small comfort for those who could lose their jobs in the coming months , the european union is trying to make the equation fairer .
new guidelines on temporary workers signed last week by the european parliament demand that temps get equal wages for equal work . manfred götzke -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the talks will be held in the same manner as with michael ballack , " loew said .
the coach also plans further talks with ballack ahead of the forthcoming friendly international against england in berlin .
" we have agreed that we will speak on the telephone again this week , " he said , dismissing fears his authority could have suffered after it was decided to take no action against his captain following critical remarks made in a newspaper interview .
loew is still hoping the chelsea midfielder will recover in time following foot surgery to play against england on nov .
19 .
" he has had the stitches removed and now has to see from day to day how his recovery is going , " loew said .
" this was not about winners or losers .
michael ballack has assured me that he did n't intend to criticize our work . "
i was in the wrong : ballack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael ballack , right , and coach joachim loew have resolved their differences ballack will remain germany captain after apologizing in a meeting with loew , who had summoned the player for talks at the german soccer federation headquarters in frankfurt .
ballack , 32 , said in a statement after the talks : " i realize it was not okay to go public .
i regret that this led to the impression that i wanted to criticise joachim loew in his position as coach .
" i apologized to joachim loew .
he is the coach , he makes the decisions and we have to respect them . "
ballack was critical of the fact that loew had benched 31-year-old frings for two world cup qualifiers .
he also accused loew of not showing enough respect for veteran players .
germany last month enjoyed 2-1 and 1-0 wins over russia and wales respectively in the qualifiers .
loew 's side is sitting top of group 4 with 10 points from four games .
however , the germany coach has found himself having to deal with disgruntled players , with the ballack and frings incidences coming soon after kevin kuranyi 's decision to walk from the stands during the clash against russia after failing to make the 18-man squad for the game .

" the talks will be held in the same manner as with michael ballack , " loew said .
the coach also plans further talks with ballack ahead of the forthcoming friendly international against england in berlin .
" we have agreed that we will speak on the telephone again this week , " he said , dismissing fears his authority could have suffered after it was decided to take no action against his captain following critical remarks made in a newspaper interview .
loew is still hoping the chelsea midfielder will recover in time following foot surgery to play against england on nov .
19 .
" he has had the stitches removed and now has to see from day to day how his recovery is going , " loew said .
" this was not about winners or losers .
michael ballack has assured me that he did n't intend to criticize our work . "
i was in the wrong : ballack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael ballack , right , and coach joachim loew have resolved their differences ballack will remain germany captain after apologizing in a meeting with loew , who had summoned the player for talks at the german soccer federation headquarters in frankfurt .
ballack , 32 , said in a statement after the talks : " i realize it was not okay to go public .
i regret that this led to the impression that i wanted to criticise joachim loew in his position as coach .
" i apologized to joachim loew .
he is the coach , he makes the decisions and we have to respect them . "
ballack was critical of the fact that loew had benched 31-year-old frings for two world cup qualifiers .
he also accused loew of not showing enough respect for veteran players .
germany last month enjoyed 2-1 and 1-0 wins over russia and wales respectively in the qualifiers .
loew 's side is sitting top of group 4 with 10 points from four games .
however , the germany coach has found himself having to deal with disgruntled players , with the ballack and frings incidences coming soon after kevin kuranyi 's decision to walk from the stands during the clash against russia after failing to make the 18-man squad for the game .
although kuranyi has since also apologized , loew said he would no longer consider the schalke striker for selection . dpa news agency -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world takes a look at what it and other media have said in the campaign 's final hours . the british business weekly , the economist , has " wholeheartedly " endorsed barack obama , saying the democratic candidate has " clearly shown that he offers the better chance of restoring america 's self-confidence . "
the magazine admits it was disappointed that the john mccain on the campaign stump has been a weaker , more indecisive and more right-wing version of the john mccain who made a name for himself as a senator .
his choice of sarah palin as a running mate was the epitome of the " sloppiness " exhibited by candidate mccain , the economist says , writing : " it is not just that she is an unconvincing stand-in , nor even that she seems to have been chosen partly for her views on divisive social issues , notably abortion . "
rather , the magazine deplores the fact that mccain made his most important appointment after meeting palin only twice .
in contrast , the economist commends obama for running an exceptionally assured campaign .
" a man who started out with no money and few supporters has out-thought , out-organized and out-fought the two mightiest machines in american politics - the clintons and the conservative right , " the magazine opines , concluding that obama deserves the presidency .
the french paper dernières nouvelles d 'alsace from strasbourg conceded that for months now , europeans have only had eyes for barack obama .
" that 's because he stands for real change , but also because mccain wears the republican banner that - perhaps unfairly - puts him on equal footing with the incumbent president , " the paper wrote .
it added that what europeans are expecting is an end to the bush era , and an end to eight years of lack of understanding between the united states and the rest of the world .
the world would be better off with barack obama as the next us president , said the dutch de volkskrant newspaper in its weekend edition .
" everything points to the fact that diplomacy plays a far bigger role for him than it does for the incumbent president , and that he would handle it with far more aplomb , " the paper wrote .
it also echoed a popular european view that with obama in the white house , america would show the world a completely different face in every respect than it has with the much-vilified bush , or the respectable but somewhat rusty veteran mccain .
the luxemburger wort focused on the foreign policy tasks facing the winner of the election .
" the leader of the united states can and should give decisive impulses for peace in the middle east , for the future vitality of nato , for a new order of the world 's financial systems , and for the west 's energy security , " the paper said , adding that the president of the free world must also ensure that international terrorism is fought with the right weapons .
the german rhein zeitung commented that after eight disastrous years of the bush administration , it does n't really matter who becomes the 44th president - things can only get better .
whether the victor is obama or mccain , the " chief firefighter " will have several blazes to attend to , the paper wrote , adding : " he 'll have to repair his country 's damaged reputation worldwide , and give americans a new sense of optimism . "
finally , the swiss tages-anzeiger newspaper warned its readers not to put too much faith in national opinion polls which put obama ahead of mccain in the final hours of the campaign .
it said that the polls are treading exceptionally thin ice this year because the favored candidate is an african american .
" did white voters not want to admit to their prejudice and say they were supporting a black man , only to then choose the white candidate in the privacy of the voting booth ? " the paper asked .

lewis hamilton has become f1 's youngest ever world champion .
the british mclaren mercedes driver clinched the title by the skin of his teeth , beating rival felipe massa .
but how many more could hamilton win ? lewis hamilton snatched victory from the jaws of defeat at sunday 's brazilian grand prix , the last on the f1 calendar .
finishing fifth on the day , hamilton secured the formula one world championship thanks to an overtaking move less than 20 seconds before the end of the race .
germany 's timo glock elected to stay on the track on dry weather tires when the rain began to fall with minutes remaining in the brazilian grand prix , whilst the rest of the front runners flocked to the pits .
this gamble won glock fourth position on the track , but sebastian vettel and lewis hamilton , both on wet weather tires , were gaining fast .
so very close " i was on dry tires at the end of the race when it was raining quite badly , and it was just impossible on the last lap , " glock told reporters .
hamilton and vettel both passed glock with moments remaining , meaning hamilton finished in fifth position , just enough to clinch the title .
" i thought , ' do i have it ?
do i have it ? " '
hamilton said after the race .
" and when they -lsb- the team -rsb- told me -lsb- on the in-car radio -rsb- , i was ecstatic . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : massa was just seconds away from overall victory .
hamilton 's win came at the expense of the local hero and ferrari hopeful felipe massa .
the brazilian , who won the race comfortably , thought he had pulled off the unthinkable in front of a raucous crowd in sao paulo .
" i had completely mixed emotions because by the time i had crossed the line , i was still the champion and then suddenly my engineer was telling me everything on the radio , " said massa .
the first of many ?
speculation abounds on just how many titles hamilton could go on to win .

lewis hamilton has become f1 's youngest ever world champion .
the british mclaren mercedes driver clinched the title by the skin of his teeth , beating rival felipe massa .
but how many more could hamilton win ? lewis hamilton snatched victory from the jaws of defeat at sunday 's brazilian grand prix , the last on the f1 calendar .
finishing fifth on the day , hamilton secured the formula one world championship thanks to an overtaking move less than 20 seconds before the end of the race .
germany 's timo glock elected to stay on the track on dry weather tires when the rain began to fall with minutes remaining in the brazilian grand prix , whilst the rest of the front runners flocked to the pits .
this gamble won glock fourth position on the track , but sebastian vettel and lewis hamilton , both on wet weather tires , were gaining fast .
so very close " i was on dry tires at the end of the race when it was raining quite badly , and it was just impossible on the last lap , " glock told reporters .
hamilton and vettel both passed glock with moments remaining , meaning hamilton finished in fifth position , just enough to clinch the title .
" i thought , ' do i have it ?

hamilton said after the race .
" and when they -lsb- the team -rsb- told me -lsb- on the in-car radio -rsb- , i was ecstatic . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : massa was just seconds away from overall victory .
hamilton 's win came at the expense of the local hero and ferrari hopeful felipe massa .
the brazilian , who won the race comfortably , thought he had pulled off the unthinkable in front of a raucous crowd in sao paulo .
" i had completely mixed emotions because by the time i had crossed the line , i was still the champion and then suddenly my engineer was telling me everything on the radio , " said massa .

lewis hamilton has become f1 's youngest ever world champion .
the british mclaren mercedes driver clinched the title by the skin of his teeth , beating rival felipe massa .
but how many more could hamilton win ? lewis hamilton snatched victory from the jaws of defeat at sunday 's brazilian grand prix , the last on the f1 calendar .
finishing fifth on the day , hamilton secured the formula one world championship thanks to an overtaking move less than 20 seconds before the end of the race .
germany 's timo glock elected to stay on the track on dry weather tires when the rain began to fall with minutes remaining in the brazilian grand prix , whilst the rest of the front runners flocked to the pits .
this gamble won glock fourth position on the track , but sebastian vettel and lewis hamilton , both on wet weather tires , were gaining fast .
so very close " i was on dry tires at the end of the race when it was raining quite badly , and it was just impossible on the last lap , " glock told reporters .
hamilton and vettel both passed glock with moments remaining , meaning hamilton finished in fifth position , just enough to clinch the title .
" i thought , ' do i have it ?
do i have it ? " '
hamilton said after the race .
" and when they -lsb- the team -rsb- told me -lsb- on the in-car radio -rsb- , i was ecstatic . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : massa was just seconds away from overall victory .
hamilton 's win came at the expense of the local hero and ferrari hopeful felipe massa .
the brazilian , who won the race comfortably , thought he had pulled off the unthinkable in front of a raucous crowd in sao paulo .
" i had completely mixed emotions because by the time i had crossed the line , i was still the champion and then suddenly my engineer was telling me everything on the radio , " said massa .
the first of many ?
speculation abounds on just how many titles hamilton could go on to win .
he 's still just 23 years old , he 's at a competitive team -lrb- mclaren mercedes -rrb- and he 's proved himself to be an exciting talent behind the wheel .
germany 's michael schumacher holds the all-time record with seven world titles .
theoretically , hamilton could break this record , but there are many other gifted racers on the grid right now .
the competition is much tougher than it was when michael schumacher dominated f1 .
felipe massa nearly beat hamilton this year , and driving for ferrari in 2009 he will want revenge . ferrari also have the 2007 world champion kimi raikonnen in their other car , and there 's two time world champion fernando alonso - currently with the renault team - to consider as well .
a new generation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was vettel 's italy win also the first of many ?

" recession is a real risk , for some countries , for the euro area , and for the eu , " european economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said . the overall gross domestic product gdp of the euro zone is expected to grow by only 0.1 percent in 2009 and by 0.9 percent in 2010 . the economy of the 15 nations that use the euro shrank by 0.2 percent in the second quarter of this year and is forecast to contract by 0.1 percent in both the third and fourth quarters . this would be the first time the euro zone will have entered recession territory since the euro was introduced in 1999 . europe 's engine at a standstill " the eu economy is hit by the financial crisis that deepened during the autumn and is taking a toll on business and consumer confidence " , almunia said . as a result , " the european growth engine is at a standstill , " he said . while they make for bleak reading , the eu 's 2009 figures are better than those of the united states and japan , whose economies are expected to shrink by 0.5 per cent and 0.4 per cent respectively . jeffery lacker , richmond federal reserve bank president , said that in other parts of the world , recession had most certainly kicked in .
" i think it 's definitely a recession at this point -lrb- in the us -rrb- .
how deep , how steep , and long it 's going to be is uncertain , " he said . but with officials in brussels stressing that their predictions are surrounded by " considerable uncertainty and downside risks " , almunia urged member states to rapidly adopt a common recovery program in order to avoid a prolonged period of economic decline . " national action is needed , and national action is much more efficient when it is coordinated with a common vision and a common discussion on who , when and how should strengthen investment decisions or fiscal policies or structural reforms , " almunia said . recession for the uk as others hit zero growth bildunterschrift : the leaders of europe 's largest economies will all struggle with impending downturns of the eu 's four biggest economies , britain is almost certain of facing a full-blown recession in 2009 , with its gross domestic product shrinking by 1 per cent .
germany , france and italy are all expected to post zero growth rates next year . and with europe 's economic locomotives all grinding to a halt , gdp in the expanding euro zone is set to grow by just 0.1 per cent in 2009 and by 0.9 per cent in 2010 . among the eu member states expected to feel the full pain of the downturn are its so-called " tiger economies " - ireland , estonia and latvia - which after recording double-digit growth rates over the last five years are now facing a lasting recession . spain , the eu 's fifth-biggest economy and formerly once of its strongest economic performers , is also set to tip into recession , with its economy shrinking by 0.2 per cent in 2009 before growing by a painfully slow 0.5 per cent in 2010 . new members reacting optimistically and only among the eu states which joined the bloc in 2004 and 2007 does the economic outlook seem more promising . slovakia , which is set to become the 16th country to adopt the euro in 2009 , will likely see its economy grow by 4.9 per cent , the best in the bloc ahead of romania -lrb- 4.7 per cent -rrb- and bulgaria -lrb- 4.5 per cent -rrb- . because tax receipts tend to fall - and public spending to increase - during times of crisis , the economic slowdown is also expected to worsen the budget deficits of many eu member states . france , which has already been cautioned by almunia , is expected to see its deficit hit the 3 per cent of gdp upper limit this year and to exceed this limit in 2010 . ireland , meanwhile , is already facing disciplinary action from the eu , with forecasts showing its budget deficit surging to 5.5 per cent of gdp this year and to 7.2 per cent in 2010 . worst still , the eu 's overall budgetary position is also set to deteriorate as a result of the various financial rescue packages being put into place by member states in order to counter the effects of the credit crunch , officials warned . and with unemployment also set to rise by a full percentage point to 8.1 per cent in 2010 , the only good news is likely to come from inflation , which is expected to fall rapidly to 2.5 per cent in 2009 after peaking in 2008 . banks reveal extent of crunch the grim economic outlook comes as europe 's top banks revealed how much they were being squeezed of profits by the credit crunch . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few banks have escaped the deluge of the financial crisis germany 's second-biggest bank , commerzbank , said monday it had lost 285 million euros and would seek an 8.2 billion euro -lrb- $ 10.5 billion -rrb- " stabilization " injection from the government and another 15 billion euro to secure financing . french bank societe generale registered an 83.7 percent drop in third-quarter net profit after being hit hard by the collapse of us lender lehman brothers . britain 's biggest home lender hbos plc reported it could lose as much as 5 billion pounds from risky assets and bad loans . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany , france and italy are all expected to post zero growth rates next year . and with europe 's economic locomotives all grinding to a halt , gdp in the expanding euro zone is set to grow by just 0.1 per cent in 2009 and by 0.9 per cent in 2010 . among the eu member states expected to feel the full pain of the downturn are its so-called " tiger economies " - ireland , estonia and latvia - which after recording double-digit growth rates over the last five years are now facing a lasting recession . spain , the eu 's fifth-biggest economy and formerly once of its strongest economic performers , is also set to tip into recession , with its economy shrinking by 0.2 per cent in 2009 before growing by a painfully slow 0.5 per cent in 2010 . new members reacting optimistically and only among the eu states which joined the bloc in 2004 and 2007 does the economic outlook seem more promising . slovakia , which is set to become the 16th country to adopt the euro in 2009 , will likely see its economy grow by 4.9 per cent , the best in the bloc ahead of romania -lrb- 4.7 per cent -rrb- and bulgaria -lrb- 4.5 per cent -rrb- . because tax receipts tend to fall - and public spending to increase - during times of crisis , the economic slowdown is also expected to worsen the budget deficits of many eu member states . france , which has already been cautioned by almunia , is expected to see its deficit hit the 3 per cent of gdp upper limit this year and to exceed this limit in 2010 . ireland , meanwhile , is already facing disciplinary action from the eu , with forecasts showing its budget deficit surging to 5.5 per cent of gdp this year and to 7.2 per cent in 2010 . worst still , the eu 's overall budgetary position is also set to deteriorate as a result of the various financial rescue packages being put into place by member states in order to counter the effects of the credit crunch , officials warned . and with unemployment also set to rise by a full percentage point to 8.1 per cent in 2010 , the only good news is likely to come from inflation , which is expected to fall rapidly to 2.5 per cent in 2009 after peaking in 2008 . banks reveal extent of crunch the grim economic outlook comes as europe 's top banks revealed how much they were being squeezed of profits by the credit crunch . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few banks have escaped the deluge of the financial crisis germany 's second-biggest bank , commerzbank , said monday it had lost 285 million euros and would seek an 8.2 billion euro -lrb- $ 10.5 billion -rrb- " stabilization " injection from the government and another 15 billion euro to secure financing . french bank societe generale registered an 83.7 percent drop in third-quarter net profit after being hit hard by the collapse of us lender lehman brothers . britain 's biggest home lender hbos plc reported it could lose as much as 5 billion pounds from risky assets and bad loans . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de us election -pipe- 03.11.2008 european press review : obama the better choice großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it 's time , " the economist 's cover said the economist is one of the latest influential publications to support democrat barack obama in the us presidential election .
dw-world takes a look at what it and other media have said in the campaign 's final hours . the british business weekly , the economist , has " wholeheartedly " endorsed barack obama , saying the democratic candidate has " clearly shown that he offers the better chance of restoring america 's self-confidence . "
the magazine admits it was disappointed that the john mccain on the campaign stump has been a weaker , more indecisive and more right-wing version of the john mccain who made a name for himself as a senator .
his choice of sarah palin as a running mate was the epitome of the " sloppiness " exhibited by candidate mccain , the economist says , writing : " it is not just that she is an unconvincing stand-in , nor even that she seems to have been chosen partly for her views on divisive social issues , notably abortion . "
rather , the magazine deplores the fact that mccain made his most important appointment after meeting palin only twice .
in contrast , the economist commends obama for running an exceptionally assured campaign .
" a man who started out with no money and few supporters has out-thought , out-organized and out-fought the two mightiest machines in american politics - the clintons and the conservative right , " the magazine opines , concluding that obama deserves the presidency .
the french paper dernières nouvelles d 'alsace from strasbourg conceded that for months now , europeans have only had eyes for barack obama .
" that 's because he stands for real change , but also because mccain wears the republican banner that - perhaps unfairly - puts him on equal footing with the incumbent president , " the paper wrote .
it added that what europeans are expecting is an end to the bush era , and an end to eight years of lack of understanding between the united states and the rest of the world .
the world would be better off with barack obama as the next us president , said the dutch de volkskrant newspaper in its weekend edition .
" everything points to the fact that diplomacy plays a far bigger role for him than it does for the incumbent president , and that he would handle it with far more aplomb , " the paper wrote .
it also echoed a popular european view that with obama in the white house , america would show the world a completely different face in every respect than it has with the much-vilified bush , or the respectable but somewhat rusty veteran mccain .
the luxemburger wort focused on the foreign policy tasks facing the winner of the election .
" the leader of the united states can and should give decisive impulses for peace in the middle east , for the future vitality of nato , for a new order of the world 's financial systems , and for the west 's energy security , " the paper said , adding that the president of the free world must also ensure that international terrorism is fought with the right weapons .
the german rhein zeitung commented that after eight disastrous years of the bush administration , it does n't really matter who becomes the 44th president - things can only get better .
whether the victor is obama or mccain , the " chief firefighter " will have several blazes to attend to , the paper wrote , adding : " he 'll have to repair his country 's damaged reputation worldwide , and give americans a new sense of optimism . "
finally , the swiss tages-anzeiger newspaper warned its readers not to put too much faith in national opinion polls which put obama ahead of mccain in the final hours of the campaign .
it said that the polls are treading exceptionally thin ice this year because the favored candidate is an african american .
" did white voters not want to admit to their prejudice and say they were supporting a black man , only to then choose the white candidate in the privacy of the voting booth ? " the paper asked .
and anyway , it continued , with the election likely to come down to a handful of swing states , a healthy dose of skepticism is justified . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de fear of a palin presidency drives us expats to vote for obama the economy , taxes and america 's image are hot-button issues for us expats in germany .
but even republicans are now going democrat for a far more compelling reason : fear that sarah palin could become president .
-lrb- 02.11.2008 -rrb- opinion : obama will go down in history if barack obama is elected , the us will wake up to a dramatically different government on nov .

" the talks will be held in the same manner as with michael ballack , " loew said .
the coach also plans further talks with ballack ahead of the forthcoming friendly international against england in berlin .
" we have agreed that we will speak on the telephone again this week , " he said , dismissing fears his authority could have suffered after it was decided to take no action against his captain following critical remarks made in a newspaper interview .

even with the tacit support of the left party , this would have left ypsilanti three votes short .
the four dissident members told a press conference in the state capital that they could not in good conscience support the plan , under which the spd and the greens were to form a minority government .
the left party had agreed to keep the coalition in power by supporting it in key parliamentary votes .
planned election cooperation in tatters bildunterschrift : ypsilanti was hoping that her plan would be a blueprint for a new national government some observers had seen ypsilanti 's plan to cooperate with the left party , which is made up of disaffected former spd member and former members of the east german communists , as a possible model for a federal government following next september 's general election .
but this may not be the case after ypsilanti failed in her second attempt to oust christian democratic union premier roland koch since last january 's state elections failed to produce a clear winner .
since then , koch 's cdu has been governing the state on a caretaker basis .
the left party is anathema to many western german voters due to their communist roots and the whole idea of cooperating with it has been hotly debated within the social democrats .

some states are forecasting a turnout of 80 to 90 percent .
that compares with nearly 60 percent in the 2004 presidential election , which itself was the highest participation rate since 1968 .
" we will get closer to 100 percent turnout on election day this year than ever before , " said doug chapin of electiononline.org , a non-partisan web site run by the pew charitable trust .
tens of millions of people have already taken to the polls in recent weeks for early or absentee voting allowed in 31 states , including key battlegrounds florida , north carolina , colorado and nevada .
as many as 40 percent of voters are expected to have voted before the election proper on tuesday .
the election stands to make history regardless of which candidate wins tuesday .
john mccain , at 72 , would be the oldest president to begin a first term , while barack obama , 47 , would become the first african-american president .
polls lean toward obama bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has the ascendancy , but mccain has pledged not to give up opinion polls continue to give obama a significant edge over mccain in the run-up to the general election .
the economic crisis , compounding george w. bush 's unpopularity , helped lift obama and his message of " change " from a race that was too close to call in august to a significant lead in opinion polls during the closing weeks .
an aggregate of major national polls compiled by realclearpolitics.com gave obama 50.7 percent to mccain 's 44.3 percent as of sunday night .
of those heading to polling stations early , registered democrats have outnumbered registered republicans in some states by 2 to 1 .
the closing pre-election poll of gallup-usa today published monday gave obama a lead of 11 points - 55 percent to 44 for mccain .
a new wall street journal-nbc news poll put obama ahead on 51 percent to 43 , while cnn 's latest poll on sunday had obama with a 53-46 percent edge .
mccain remains upbeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccain has warned against writing off his chances in the coming election but mccain 's campaign has vowed a comeback in the final days , pointing to polls that show as many as one in seven voters remain undecided .
" my opponent is measuring the drapes at the white house , " mccain said , as he wrapped up a frenzied day of campaigning with a midnight rally in miami .
" the mac is back .
and we 're going to win this election . "
in an election climate stacked against the incumbent republican party , both obama and mccain have promised change from what they call the failed policies of the last eight years .
" this is a defining moment in our history , " obama wrote in an article published in the wall street journal .
" tomorrow , i ask you to write our nation 's next great chapter ...
if you give me your vote , we wo n't just win this election - together , we will change this country and change the world . "

mccain has leaned hard on his self-styled " maverick " image , unafraid to take on his own party in the us senate , while touting his 26 years in congress , military career and expertise in foreign policy as making him the safer choice .
obama has consistently sought to link mccain with the bush administration , and his campaign was given last-minute fodder when vice president dick cheney said he was " delighted " to support mccain in a weekend speech in wyoming .
both bush and cheney have been otherwise absent from the campaign trail .
the looming recession has become the dominant force in the race since september , overshadowing major foreign policy issues like the wars in iraq and afghanistan , iranian and north korean nuclear activities , and a resurgent russia .
fund-raising volunteers from both sides made millions of phone calls and knocked on millions of doors over the final weekend , while the campaigns made last-minute pleas for donations to mount massive television advertising .
obama 's campaign has been fuelled by an unprecedented fundraising prowess that comes mainly from small donors over the internet .
obama raised more than $ 600 million over the last 20 months , nearly twice as much as mccain , according to the federal election commission .
yet mccain 's campaign manager , rick davis , predicted that his side would outspend democrats by 10 million dollars in the final week . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some states are forecasting a turnout of 80 to 90 percent .
that compares with nearly 60 percent in the 2004 presidential election , which itself was the highest participation rate since 1968 .
" we will get closer to 100 percent turnout on election day this year than ever before , " said doug chapin of electiononline.org , a non-partisan web site run by the pew charitable trust .
tens of millions of people have already taken to the polls in recent weeks for early or absentee voting allowed in 31 states , including key battlegrounds florida , north carolina , colorado and nevada .
as many as 40 percent of voters are expected to have voted before the election proper on tuesday .
the election stands to make history regardless of which candidate wins tuesday .
john mccain , at 72 , would be the oldest president to begin a first term , while barack obama , 47 , would become the first african-american president .
polls lean toward obama bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has the ascendancy , but mccain has pledged not to give up opinion polls continue to give obama a significant edge over mccain in the run-up to the general election .
the economic crisis , compounding george w. bush 's unpopularity , helped lift obama and his message of " change " from a race that was too close to call in august to a significant lead in opinion polls during the closing weeks .
an aggregate of major national polls compiled by realclearpolitics.com gave obama 50.7 percent to mccain 's 44.3 percent as of sunday night .
of those heading to polling stations early , registered democrats have outnumbered registered republicans in some states by 2 to 1 .
the closing pre-election poll of gallup-usa today published monday gave obama a lead of 11 points - 55 percent to 44 for mccain .
a new wall street journal-nbc news poll put obama ahead on 51 percent to 43 , while cnn 's latest poll on sunday had obama with a 53-46 percent edge .
mccain remains upbeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccain has warned against writing off his chances in the coming election but mccain 's campaign has vowed a comeback in the final days , pointing to polls that show as many as one in seven voters remain undecided .
" my opponent is measuring the drapes at the white house , " mccain said , as he wrapped up a frenzied day of campaigning with a midnight rally in miami .
" the mac is back .
and we 're going to win this election . "
in an election climate stacked against the incumbent republican party , both obama and mccain have promised change from what they call the failed policies of the last eight years .
" this is a defining moment in our history , " obama wrote in an article published in the wall street journal .
" tomorrow , i ask you to write our nation 's next great chapter ...
if you give me your vote , we wo n't just win this election - together , we will change this country and change the world . "
deciding factors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next president will inherit the quagmire of the war in iraq the next president will assume the mantle in january in the midst of two wars , an economy tail-spinning into recession and a global financial system on the verge of collapse .
mccain has leaned hard on his self-styled " maverick " image , unafraid to take on his own party in the us senate , while touting his 26 years in congress , military career and expertise in foreign policy as making him the safer choice .
obama has consistently sought to link mccain with the bush administration , and his campaign was given last-minute fodder when vice president dick cheney said he was " delighted " to support mccain in a weekend speech in wyoming .
both bush and cheney have been otherwise absent from the campaign trail .
the looming recession has become the dominant force in the race since september , overshadowing major foreign policy issues like the wars in iraq and afghanistan , iranian and north korean nuclear activities , and a resurgent russia .
fund-raising volunteers from both sides made millions of phone calls and knocked on millions of doors over the final weekend , while the campaigns made last-minute pleas for donations to mount massive television advertising .
obama 's campaign has been fuelled by an unprecedented fundraising prowess that comes mainly from small donors over the internet .
obama raised more than $ 600 million over the last 20 months , nearly twice as much as mccain , according to the federal election commission .
yet mccain 's campaign manager , rick davis , predicted that his side would outspend democrats by 10 million dollars in the final week . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some states are forecasting a turnout of 80 to 90 percent .
that compares with nearly 60 percent in the 2004 presidential election , which itself was the highest participation rate since 1968 .
" we will get closer to 100 percent turnout on election day this year than ever before , " said doug chapin of electiononline.org , a non-partisan web site run by the pew charitable trust .
tens of millions of people have already taken to the polls in recent weeks for early or absentee voting allowed in 31 states , including key battlegrounds florida , north carolina , colorado and nevada .
as many as 40 percent of voters are expected to have voted before the election proper on tuesday .
the election stands to make history regardless of which candidate wins tuesday .
john mccain , at 72 , would be the oldest president to begin a first term , while barack obama , 47 , would become the first african-american president .
polls lean toward obama bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has the ascendancy , but mccain has pledged not to give up opinion polls continue to give obama a significant edge over mccain in the run-up to the general election .
the economic crisis , compounding george w. bush 's unpopularity , helped lift obama and his message of " change " from a race that was too close to call in august to a significant lead in opinion polls during the closing weeks .
an aggregate of major national polls compiled by realclearpolitics.com gave obama 50.7 percent to mccain 's 44.3 percent as of sunday night .
of those heading to polling stations early , registered democrats have outnumbered registered republicans in some states by 2 to 1 .
the closing pre-election poll of gallup-usa today published monday gave obama a lead of 11 points - 55 percent to 44 for mccain .
a new wall street journal-nbc news poll put obama ahead on 51 percent to 43 , while cnn 's latest poll on sunday had obama with a 53-46 percent edge .
mccain remains upbeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccain has warned against writing off his chances in the coming election but mccain 's campaign has vowed a comeback in the final days , pointing to polls that show as many as one in seven voters remain undecided .
" my opponent is measuring the drapes at the white house , " mccain said , as he wrapped up a frenzied day of campaigning with a midnight rally in miami .
" the mac is back .
and we 're going to win this election . "
in an election climate stacked against the incumbent republican party , both obama and mccain have promised change from what they call the failed policies of the last eight years .
" this is a defining moment in our history , " obama wrote in an article published in the wall street journal .
" tomorrow , i ask you to write our nation 's next great chapter ...
if you give me your vote , we wo n't just win this election - together , we will change this country and change the world . "

mccain has leaned hard on his self-styled " maverick " image , unafraid to take on his own party in the us senate , while touting his 26 years in congress , military career and expertise in foreign policy as making him the safer choice .
obama has consistently sought to link mccain with the bush administration , and his campaign was given last-minute fodder when vice president dick cheney said he was " delighted " to support mccain in a weekend speech in wyoming .
both bush and cheney have been otherwise absent from the campaign trail .
the looming recession has become the dominant force in the race since september , overshadowing major foreign policy issues like the wars in iraq and afghanistan , iranian and north korean nuclear activities , and a resurgent russia .
fund-raising volunteers from both sides made millions of phone calls and knocked on millions of doors over the final weekend , while the campaigns made last-minute pleas for donations to mount massive television advertising .
obama 's campaign has been fuelled by an unprecedented fundraising prowess that comes mainly from small donors over the internet .
obama raised more than $ 600 million over the last 20 months , nearly twice as much as mccain , according to the federal election commission .
yet mccain 's campaign manager , rick davis , predicted that his side would outspend democrats by 10 million dollars in the final week . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some states are forecasting a turnout of 80 to 90 percent .
that compares with nearly 60 percent in the 2004 presidential election , which itself was the highest participation rate since 1968 .
" we will get closer to 100 percent turnout on election day this year than ever before , " said doug chapin of electiononline.org , a non-partisan web site run by the pew charitable trust .
tens of millions of people have already taken to the polls in recent weeks for early or absentee voting allowed in 31 states , including key battlegrounds florida , north carolina , colorado and nevada .

auto supplier hella is n't renewing the contracts of some 200 of its temporary workers ; its competitor honsel is giving 100 temps pink slips .
at german car giant vw , thousands of temporary jobs are hanging in the balance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many workers hold the same temp job for years it 's not only short-term hires who are affected .
some workers have had their factory jobs for years , but continue to be officially employed and paid through a temp firm .
just a few weeks ago , many of them hoped to be taken over by the companies themselves .
but while metal-industry companies have been swimming in orders in the past years , the boon has n't translated into many employment contracts .
instead , companies have chosen to benefit from the flexibility of workers from temp agencies .
that system that is now turning on itself , said hartmut seifert , labor market expert for the union-affiliated hans-böckler-stiftung foundation .
" we know that there is a two percent quota of temporary workers .
but there are companies whose work force is made up of over 20 percent temps , " said siefert .
boom started with agenda 2010 the boom in temp agency work was started by the last german administration , a coalition of social democrats and greens that devised the agenda 2010 package of social reforms .
the watchword back in 2003 was " marketplace flexibility . "
since then , temp workers have been allowed to be in a job for more than one year - a ruling that was embraced enthusiastically by companies .
the government 's goal at the time was to use temp work to create more permanent employment , but things did n't work out that way .

in the last year alone , the number of temp workers in germany has doubled to 750,000 , even while unemployment figures have fallen .
those days are over , labor-market expert seifert said .
" it is entirely possible that a third of this number will lose their job in the next months . "
it 's not just the auto industry where temp workers face hard times . many temp workers are employed by companies in machine-making , pharmaceuticals and chemicals - industries that live from exports and could run into serious problems amid the world economic crisis .
less opportunity seen for temps temp workers " have a higher risk of being laid off .
they earn less than permanent employees , and have less access to further job training , " siefert said .
this means they have less opportunity to improve their chances at getting another job , he noted .
he believes temp workers should get a " risk premium " - in the form of higher wages - for taking so much risk in their employment .
while it may be small comfort for those who could lose their jobs in the coming months , the european union is trying to make the equation fairer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 03.11.2008 germany 's army of temp workers may suffer amid cutbacks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german temp workers in a number of sectors face hard times the german government has advocated inexpensive temporary employment for years .
now , with the financial crisis affecting auto makers and other giant producers , tens of thousands of temp workers stand to lose their jobs . they are cheaper than their salaried colleagues .
they do n't get extra bonuses for christmas and vacations .
but most importantly , car makers and other manufacturers can get rid of temporary workers in a pinch .
" there are of course good people who you are sad to see go .
but it is the quickest and least bureaucratic way to cut the payrolls , " said ottmar zwiebelhofer , the head of a auto-parts maker koenig metall in the western state of baden wuerttemberg . his company makes airbags and car mufflers , so when car companies ' profits suffer , koenig metall feels the pain .
zwiebelhofer expects volume to drop by 20 percent this year .
pink slips abound it is a given that the first to lose their jobs in hard times are temp workers - and that 's not just the case at koenig metall .
auto supplier hella is n't renewing the contracts of some 200 of its temporary workers ; its competitor honsel is giving 100 temps pink slips .
at german car giant vw , thousands of temporary jobs are hanging in the balance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many workers hold the same temp job for years it 's not only short-term hires who are affected .
some workers have had their factory jobs for years , but continue to be officially employed and paid through a temp firm .
just a few weeks ago , many of them hoped to be taken over by the companies themselves .
but while metal-industry companies have been swimming in orders in the past years , the boon has n't translated into many employment contracts .
instead , companies have chosen to benefit from the flexibility of workers from temp agencies .
that system that is now turning on itself , said hartmut seifert , labor market expert for the union-affiliated hans-böckler-stiftung foundation .
" we know that there is a two percent quota of temporary workers .
but there are companies whose work force is made up of over 20 percent temps , " said siefert .
boom started with agenda 2010 the boom in temp agency work was started by the last german administration , a coalition of social democrats and greens that devised the agenda 2010 package of social reforms .
the watchword back in 2003 was " marketplace flexibility . "
since then , temp workers have been allowed to be in a job for more than one year - a ruling that was embraced enthusiastically by companies .
the government 's goal at the time was to use temp work to create more permanent employment , but things did n't work out that way .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those in export industries , like cars , will be hardest hit instead , well known temp agencies like randstad , adecco and permacon were booking heavy profits , and looking desperately for qualified personnel .
in the last year alone , the number of temp workers in germany has doubled to 750,000 , even while unemployment figures have fallen .
those days are over , labor-market expert seifert said .
" it is entirely possible that a third of this number will lose their job in the next months . "
it 's not just the auto industry where temp workers face hard times . many temp workers are employed by companies in machine-making , pharmaceuticals and chemicals - industries that live from exports and could run into serious problems amid the world economic crisis .
less opportunity seen for temps temp workers " have a higher risk of being laid off .
they earn less than permanent employees , and have less access to further job training , " siefert said .
this means they have less opportunity to improve their chances at getting another job , he noted .
he believes temp workers should get a " risk premium " - in the form of higher wages - for taking so much risk in their employment .
while it may be small comfort for those who could lose their jobs in the coming months , the european union is trying to make the equation fairer .
new guidelines on temporary workers signed last week by the european parliament demand that temps get equal wages for equal work . manfred götzke -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world takes a look at what it and other media have said in the campaign 's final hours . the british business weekly , the economist , has " wholeheartedly " endorsed barack obama , saying the democratic candidate has " clearly shown that he offers the better chance of restoring america 's self-confidence . "
the magazine admits it was disappointed that the john mccain on the campaign stump has been a weaker , more indecisive and more right-wing version of the john mccain who made a name for himself as a senator .
his choice of sarah palin as a running mate was the epitome of the " sloppiness " exhibited by candidate mccain , the economist says , writing : " it is not just that she is an unconvincing stand-in , nor even that she seems to have been chosen partly for her views on divisive social issues , notably abortion . "
rather , the magazine deplores the fact that mccain made his most important appointment after meeting palin only twice .
in contrast , the economist commends obama for running an exceptionally assured campaign .
" a man who started out with no money and few supporters has out-thought , out-organized and out-fought the two mightiest machines in american politics - the clintons and the conservative right , " the magazine opines , concluding that obama deserves the presidency .
the french paper dernières nouvelles d 'alsace from strasbourg conceded that for months now , europeans have only had eyes for barack obama .
" that 's because he stands for real change , but also because mccain wears the republican banner that - perhaps unfairly - puts him on equal footing with the incumbent president , " the paper wrote .
it added that what europeans are expecting is an end to the bush era , and an end to eight years of lack of understanding between the united states and the rest of the world .
the world would be better off with barack obama as the next us president , said the dutch de volkskrant newspaper in its weekend edition .
" everything points to the fact that diplomacy plays a far bigger role for him than it does for the incumbent president , and that he would handle it with far more aplomb , " the paper wrote .
it also echoed a popular european view that with obama in the white house , america would show the world a completely different face in every respect than it has with the much-vilified bush , or the respectable but somewhat rusty veteran mccain .
the luxemburger wort focused on the foreign policy tasks facing the winner of the election .
" the leader of the united states can and should give decisive impulses for peace in the middle east , for the future vitality of nato , for a new order of the world 's financial systems , and for the west 's energy security , " the paper said , adding that the president of the free world must also ensure that international terrorism is fought with the right weapons .
the german rhein zeitung commented that after eight disastrous years of the bush administration , it does n't really matter who becomes the 44th president - things can only get better .
whether the victor is obama or mccain , the " chief firefighter " will have several blazes to attend to , the paper wrote , adding : " he 'll have to repair his country 's damaged reputation worldwide , and give americans a new sense of optimism . "
finally , the swiss tages-anzeiger newspaper warned its readers not to put too much faith in national opinion polls which put obama ahead of mccain in the final hours of the campaign .
it said that the polls are treading exceptionally thin ice this year because the favored candidate is an african american .
" did white voters not want to admit to their prejudice and say they were supporting a black man , only to then choose the white candidate in the privacy of the voting booth ? " the paper asked .
and anyway , it continued , with the election likely to come down to a handful of swing states , a healthy dose of skepticism is justified . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" recession is a real risk , for some countries , for the euro area , and for the eu , " european economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said . the overall gross domestic product gdp of the euro zone is expected to grow by only 0.1 percent in 2009 and by 0.9 percent in 2010 . the economy of the 15 nations that use the euro shrank by 0.2 percent in the second quarter of this year and is forecast to contract by 0.1 percent in both the third and fourth quarters . this would be the first time the euro zone will have entered recession territory since the euro was introduced in 1999 . europe 's engine at a standstill " the eu economy is hit by the financial crisis that deepened during the autumn and is taking a toll on business and consumer confidence " , almunia said . as a result , " the european growth engine is at a standstill , " he said . while they make for bleak reading , the eu 's 2009 figures are better than those of the united states and japan , whose economies are expected to shrink by 0.5 per cent and 0.4 per cent respectively . jeffery lacker , richmond federal reserve bank president , said that in other parts of the world , recession had most certainly kicked in .
" i think it 's definitely a recession at this point -lrb- in the us -rrb- .
how deep , how steep , and long it 's going to be is uncertain , " he said . but with officials in brussels stressing that their predictions are surrounded by " considerable uncertainty and downside risks " , almunia urged member states to rapidly adopt a common recovery program in order to avoid a prolonged period of economic decline . " national action is needed , and national action is much more efficient when it is coordinated with a common vision and a common discussion on who , when and how should strengthen investment decisions or fiscal policies or structural reforms , " almunia said . recession for the uk as others hit zero growth bildunterschrift : the leaders of europe 's largest economies will all struggle with impending downturns of the eu 's four biggest economies , britain is almost certain of facing a full-blown recession in 2009 , with its gross domestic product shrinking by 1 per cent .
germany , france and italy are all expected to post zero growth rates next year . and with europe 's economic locomotives all grinding to a halt , gdp in the expanding euro zone is set to grow by just 0.1 per cent in 2009 and by 0.9 per cent in 2010 . among the eu member states expected to feel the full pain of the downturn are its so-called " tiger economies " - ireland , estonia and latvia - which after recording double-digit growth rates over the last five years are now facing a lasting recession . spain , the eu 's fifth-biggest economy and formerly once of its strongest economic performers , is also set to tip into recession , with its economy shrinking by 0.2 per cent in 2009 before growing by a painfully slow 0.5 per cent in 2010 . new members reacting optimistically and only among the eu states which joined the bloc in 2004 and 2007 does the economic outlook seem more promising . slovakia , which is set to become the 16th country to adopt the euro in 2009 , will likely see its economy grow by 4.9 per cent , the best in the bloc ahead of romania -lrb- 4.7 per cent -rrb- and bulgaria -lrb- 4.5 per cent -rrb- . because tax receipts tend to fall - and public spending to increase - during times of crisis , the economic slowdown is also expected to worsen the budget deficits of many eu member states . france , which has already been cautioned by almunia , is expected to see its deficit hit the 3 per cent of gdp upper limit this year and to exceed this limit in 2010 . ireland , meanwhile , is already facing disciplinary action from the eu , with forecasts showing its budget deficit surging to 5.5 per cent of gdp this year and to 7.2 per cent in 2010 . worst still , the eu 's overall budgetary position is also set to deteriorate as a result of the various financial rescue packages being put into place by member states in order to counter the effects of the credit crunch , officials warned . and with unemployment also set to rise by a full percentage point to 8.1 per cent in 2010 , the only good news is likely to come from inflation , which is expected to fall rapidly to 2.5 per cent in 2009 after peaking in 2008 . banks reveal extent of crunch the grim economic outlook comes as europe 's top banks revealed how much they were being squeezed of profits by the credit crunch . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few banks have escaped the deluge of the financial crisis germany 's second-biggest bank , commerzbank , said monday it had lost 285 million euros and would seek an 8.2 billion euro -lrb- $ 10.5 billion -rrb- " stabilization " injection from the government and another 15 billion euro to secure financing . french bank societe generale registered an 83.7 percent drop in third-quarter net profit after being hit hard by the collapse of us lender lehman brothers . britain 's biggest home lender hbos plc reported it could lose as much as 5 billion pounds from risky assets and bad loans . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

even with the tacit support of the left party , this would have left ypsilanti three votes short .
the four dissident members told a press conference in the state capital that they could not in good conscience support the plan , under which the spd and the greens were to form a minority government .
the left party had agreed to keep the coalition in power by supporting it in key parliamentary votes .
planned election cooperation in tatters bildunterschrift : ypsilanti was hoping that her plan would be a blueprint for a new national government some observers had seen ypsilanti 's plan to cooperate with the left party , which is made up of disaffected former spd member and former members of the east german communists , as a possible model for a federal government following next september 's general election .
but this may not be the case after ypsilanti failed in her second attempt to oust christian democratic union premier roland koch since last january 's state elections failed to produce a clear winner .
since then , koch 's cdu has been governing the state on a caretaker basis .
the left party is anathema to many western german voters due to their communist roots and the whole idea of cooperating with it has been hotly debated within the social democrats .
dissenters derail spd , anger party chairman bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muentefering was less than happy with the four rebels prior to the january state election , ypsilanti and the chairman of the federal party , kurt beck , had ruled out cooperating with the left party .
but they backtracked on the issue following the inconclusive outcome of the vote in hesse .
this was in part what forced beck to resign as party leader two months ago .
the man who has since replaced him , franz muentefering , has lashed out at the four dissenters in wiesbaden .
muentefering told reporters in berlin that they had chosen the worst possible point to make their intentions clear .
the coalition agreement was reached only after weeks of consultations between the spd and the green party . he said the federal party executive had received the news with a mixture of " shock and disgust . " muentefering also expressed confidence that events in the state of hesse would have no impact on september 's election , because the party had ruled out co-operating with the left on the federal level . dw staff -lrb- cp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the talks will be held in the same manner as with michael ballack , " loew said .
the coach also plans further talks with ballack ahead of the forthcoming friendly international against england in berlin .
" we have agreed that we will speak on the telephone again this week , " he said , dismissing fears his authority could have suffered after it was decided to take no action against his captain following critical remarks made in a newspaper interview .
loew is still hoping the chelsea midfielder will recover in time following foot surgery to play against england on nov .
19 .
" he has had the stitches removed and now has to see from day to day how his recovery is going , " loew said .
" this was not about winners or losers .
michael ballack has assured me that he did n't intend to criticize our work . "
i was in the wrong : ballack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael ballack , right , and coach joachim loew have resolved their differences ballack will remain germany captain after apologizing in a meeting with loew , who had summoned the player for talks at the german soccer federation headquarters in frankfurt .
ballack , 32 , said in a statement after the talks : " i realize it was not okay to go public .
i regret that this led to the impression that i wanted to criticise joachim loew in his position as coach .
" i apologized to joachim loew .
he is the coach , he makes the decisions and we have to respect them . "
ballack was critical of the fact that loew had benched 31-year-old frings for two world cup qualifiers .
he also accused loew of not showing enough respect for veteran players .
germany last month enjoyed 2-1 and 1-0 wins over russia and wales respectively in the qualifiers .
loew 's side is sitting top of group 4 with 10 points from four games .
however , the germany coach has found himself having to deal with disgruntled players , with the ballack and frings incidences coming soon after kevin kuranyi 's decision to walk from the stands during the clash against russia after failing to make the 18-man squad for the game .
although kuranyi has since also apologized , loew said he would no longer consider the schalke striker for selection . dpa news agency -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

even with the tacit support of the left party , this would have left ypsilanti three votes short .
the four dissident members told a press conference in the state capital that they could not in good conscience support the plan , under which the spd and the greens were to form a minority government .
the left party had agreed to keep the coalition in power by supporting it in key parliamentary votes .
planned election cooperation in tatters bildunterschrift : ypsilanti was hoping that her plan would be a blueprint for a new national government some observers had seen ypsilanti 's plan to cooperate with the left party , which is made up of disaffected former spd member and former members of the east german communists , as a possible model for a federal government following next september 's general election .
but this may not be the case after ypsilanti failed in her second attempt to oust christian democratic union premier roland koch since last january 's state elections failed to produce a clear winner .
since then , koch 's cdu has been governing the state on a caretaker basis .
the left party is anathema to many western german voters due to their communist roots and the whole idea of cooperating with it has been hotly debated within the social democrats .

this was in part what forced beck to resign as party leader two months ago .
the man who has since replaced him , franz muentefering , has lashed out at the four dissenters in wiesbaden .
muentefering told reporters in berlin that they had chosen the worst possible point to make their intentions clear .
the coalition agreement was reached only after weeks of consultations between the spd and the green party . he said the federal party executive had received the news with a mixture of " shock and disgust .

even with the tacit support of the left party , this would have left ypsilanti three votes short .
the four dissident members told a press conference in the state capital that they could not in good conscience support the plan , under which the spd and the greens were to form a minority government .
the left party had agreed to keep the coalition in power by supporting it in key parliamentary votes .
planned election cooperation in tatters bildunterschrift : ypsilanti was hoping that her plan would be a blueprint for a new national government some observers had seen ypsilanti 's plan to cooperate with the left party , which is made up of disaffected former spd member and former members of the east german communists , as a possible model for a federal government following next september 's general election .
but this may not be the case after ypsilanti failed in her second attempt to oust christian democratic union premier roland koch since last january 's state elections failed to produce a clear winner .
since then , koch 's cdu has been governing the state on a caretaker basis .
the left party is anathema to many western german voters due to their communist roots and the whole idea of cooperating with it has been hotly debated within the social democrats .
dissenters derail spd , anger party chairman bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muentefering was less than happy with the four rebels prior to the january state election , ypsilanti and the chairman of the federal party , kurt beck , had ruled out cooperating with the left party .
but they backtracked on the issue following the inconclusive outcome of the vote in hesse .
this was in part what forced beck to resign as party leader two months ago .
the man who has since replaced him , franz muentefering , has lashed out at the four dissenters in wiesbaden .
muentefering told reporters in berlin that they had chosen the worst possible point to make their intentions clear .
the coalition agreement was reached only after weeks of consultations between the spd and the green party . he said the federal party executive had received the news with a mixture of " shock and disgust . " muentefering also expressed confidence that events in the state of hesse would have no impact on september 's election , because the party had ruled out co-operating with the left on the federal level . dw staff -lrb- cp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

lewis hamilton has become f1 's youngest ever world champion .
the british mclaren mercedes driver clinched the title by the skin of his teeth , beating rival felipe massa .
but how many more could hamilton win ? lewis hamilton snatched victory from the jaws of defeat at sunday 's brazilian grand prix , the last on the f1 calendar .
finishing fifth on the day , hamilton secured the formula one world championship thanks to an overtaking move less than 20 seconds before the end of the race .
germany 's timo glock elected to stay on the track on dry weather tires when the rain began to fall with minutes remaining in the brazilian grand prix , whilst the rest of the front runners flocked to the pits .
this gamble won glock fourth position on the track , but sebastian vettel and lewis hamilton , both on wet weather tires , were gaining fast .
so very close " i was on dry tires at the end of the race when it was raining quite badly , and it was just impossible on the last lap , " glock told reporters .
hamilton and vettel both passed glock with moments remaining , meaning hamilton finished in fifth position , just enough to clinch the title .
" i thought , ' do i have it ?
do i have it ? " '
hamilton said after the race .
" and when they -lsb- the team -rsb- told me -lsb- on the in-car radio -rsb- , i was ecstatic . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : massa was just seconds away from overall victory .
hamilton 's win came at the expense of the local hero and ferrari hopeful felipe massa .
the brazilian , who won the race comfortably , thought he had pulled off the unthinkable in front of a raucous crowd in sao paulo .
" i had completely mixed emotions because by the time i had crossed the line , i was still the champion and then suddenly my engineer was telling me everything on the radio , " said massa .
the first of many ?
speculation abounds on just how many titles hamilton could go on to win .
he 's still just 23 years old , he 's at a competitive team -lrb- mclaren mercedes -rrb- and he 's proved himself to be an exciting talent behind the wheel .
germany 's michael schumacher holds the all-time record with seven world titles .
theoretically , hamilton could break this record , but there are many other gifted racers on the grid right now .
the competition is much tougher than it was when michael schumacher dominated f1 .
felipe massa nearly beat hamilton this year , and driving for ferrari in 2009 he will want revenge . ferrari also have the 2007 world champion kimi raikonnen in their other car , and there 's two time world champion fernando alonso - currently with the renault team - to consider as well .
a new generation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was vettel 's italy win also the first of many ?
there are also young pretenders to hamilton 's new crown , not least german driver sebastian vettel . the 21-year-old has completed his first full season with torro rosso , a low-budget team which has never really known success - at least not before it knew sebastian vettel .
in a slower car , vettel won the wet and wild italian grand prix , becoming the youngest race winner of all time in the process .
vettel moves up the ladder to the red bull team in 2009 , but his performances have been so impressive that many pundits expect " baby schumacher " - as german tabloids call him - to be sitting in a top car like ferrari , mclaren or bmw very soon .
the next big team ?
bmw is the other german factor which can not be ignored .
in just its third season in the sport , bmw has cemented itself as the third best team , just behind perennial front-runners ferrari and mclaren .
the team 's incremental improvements are part of a " four year plan " - bmw has met its targets in the first three years , and next year 's goal is to challenge for the championship .
polish driver robert kubica - who , like vettel , picked up his first ever race win this year - is likely to lead bmw 's championship charge , although his german teammate nick heidfeld will have other ideas .
the champagne may taste sweet for formula one 's youngest ever world champion lewis hamilton , but if this year 's finale was nail-biting , there could be even tougher challenges still in store . dw staff -lrb- msh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de us election -pipe- 03.11.2008 european press review : obama the better choice großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it 's time , " the economist 's cover said the economist is one of the latest influential publications to support democrat barack obama in the us presidential election .
dw-world takes a look at what it and other media have said in the campaign 's final hours . the british business weekly , the economist , has " wholeheartedly " endorsed barack obama , saying the democratic candidate has " clearly shown that he offers the better chance of restoring america 's self-confidence . "
the magazine admits it was disappointed that the john mccain on the campaign stump has been a weaker , more indecisive and more right-wing version of the john mccain who made a name for himself as a senator .
his choice of sarah palin as a running mate was the epitome of the " sloppiness " exhibited by candidate mccain , the economist says , writing : " it is not just that she is an unconvincing stand-in , nor even that she seems to have been chosen partly for her views on divisive social issues , notably abortion . "
rather , the magazine deplores the fact that mccain made his most important appointment after meeting palin only twice .
in contrast , the economist commends obama for running an exceptionally assured campaign .
" a man who started out with no money and few supporters has out-thought , out-organized and out-fought the two mightiest machines in american politics - the clintons and the conservative right , " the magazine opines , concluding that obama deserves the presidency .
the french paper dernières nouvelles d 'alsace from strasbourg conceded that for months now , europeans have only had eyes for barack obama .
" that 's because he stands for real change , but also because mccain wears the republican banner that - perhaps unfairly - puts him on equal footing with the incumbent president , " the paper wrote .
it added that what europeans are expecting is an end to the bush era , and an end to eight years of lack of understanding between the united states and the rest of the world .
the world would be better off with barack obama as the next us president , said the dutch de volkskrant newspaper in its weekend edition .
" everything points to the fact that diplomacy plays a far bigger role for him than it does for the incumbent president , and that he would handle it with far more aplomb , " the paper wrote .
it also echoed a popular european view that with obama in the white house , america would show the world a completely different face in every respect than it has with the much-vilified bush , or the respectable but somewhat rusty veteran mccain .
the luxemburger wort focused on the foreign policy tasks facing the winner of the election .
" the leader of the united states can and should give decisive impulses for peace in the middle east , for the future vitality of nato , for a new order of the world 's financial systems , and for the west 's energy security , " the paper said , adding that the president of the free world must also ensure that international terrorism is fought with the right weapons .
the german rhein zeitung commented that after eight disastrous years of the bush administration , it does n't really matter who becomes the 44th president - things can only get better .
whether the victor is obama or mccain , the " chief firefighter " will have several blazes to attend to , the paper wrote , adding : " he 'll have to repair his country 's damaged reputation worldwide , and give americans a new sense of optimism . "
finally , the swiss tages-anzeiger newspaper warned its readers not to put too much faith in national opinion polls which put obama ahead of mccain in the final hours of the campaign .
it said that the polls are treading exceptionally thin ice this year because the favored candidate is an african american .
" did white voters not want to admit to their prejudice and say they were supporting a black man , only to then choose the white candidate in the privacy of the voting booth ? " the paper asked .
and anyway , it continued , with the election likely to come down to a handful of swing states , a healthy dose of skepticism is justified . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world takes a look at what it and other media have said in the campaign 's final hours . the british business weekly , the economist , has " wholeheartedly " endorsed barack obama , saying the democratic candidate has " clearly shown that he offers the better chance of restoring america 's self-confidence . "
the magazine admits it was disappointed that the john mccain on the campaign stump has been a weaker , more indecisive and more right-wing version of the john mccain who made a name for himself as a senator .
his choice of sarah palin as a running mate was the epitome of the " sloppiness " exhibited by candidate mccain , the economist says , writing : " it is not just that she is an unconvincing stand-in , nor even that she seems to have been chosen partly for her views on divisive social issues , notably abortion . "
rather , the magazine deplores the fact that mccain made his most important appointment after meeting palin only twice .
in contrast , the economist commends obama for running an exceptionally assured campaign .
" a man who started out with no money and few supporters has out-thought , out-organized and out-fought the two mightiest machines in american politics - the clintons and the conservative right , " the magazine opines , concluding that obama deserves the presidency .
the french paper dernières nouvelles d 'alsace from strasbourg conceded that for months now , europeans have only had eyes for barack obama .
" that 's because he stands for real change , but also because mccain wears the republican banner that - perhaps unfairly - puts him on equal footing with the incumbent president , " the paper wrote .
it added that what europeans are expecting is an end to the bush era , and an end to eight years of lack of understanding between the united states and the rest of the world .
the world would be better off with barack obama as the next us president , said the dutch de volkskrant newspaper in its weekend edition .
" everything points to the fact that diplomacy plays a far bigger role for him than it does for the incumbent president , and that he would handle it with far more aplomb , " the paper wrote .
it also echoed a popular european view that with obama in the white house , america would show the world a completely different face in every respect than it has with the much-vilified bush , or the respectable but somewhat rusty veteran mccain .
the luxemburger wort focused on the foreign policy tasks facing the winner of the election .
" the leader of the united states can and should give decisive impulses for peace in the middle east , for the future vitality of nato , for a new order of the world 's financial systems , and for the west 's energy security , " the paper said , adding that the president of the free world must also ensure that international terrorism is fought with the right weapons .
the german rhein zeitung commented that after eight disastrous years of the bush administration , it does n't really matter who becomes the 44th president - things can only get better .
whether the victor is obama or mccain , the " chief firefighter " will have several blazes to attend to , the paper wrote , adding : " he 'll have to repair his country 's damaged reputation worldwide , and give americans a new sense of optimism . "
finally , the swiss tages-anzeiger newspaper warned its readers not to put too much faith in national opinion polls which put obama ahead of mccain in the final hours of the campaign .
it said that the polls are treading exceptionally thin ice this year because the favored candidate is an african american .
" did white voters not want to admit to their prejudice and say they were supporting a black man , only to then choose the white candidate in the privacy of the voting booth ? " the paper asked .

lewis hamilton has become f1 's youngest ever world champion .
the british mclaren mercedes driver clinched the title by the skin of his teeth , beating rival felipe massa .
but how many more could hamilton win ? lewis hamilton snatched victory from the jaws of defeat at sunday 's brazilian grand prix , the last on the f1 calendar .
finishing fifth on the day , hamilton secured the formula one world championship thanks to an overtaking move less than 20 seconds before the end of the race .
germany 's timo glock elected to stay on the track on dry weather tires when the rain began to fall with minutes remaining in the brazilian grand prix , whilst the rest of the front runners flocked to the pits .
this gamble won glock fourth position on the track , but sebastian vettel and lewis hamilton , both on wet weather tires , were gaining fast .
so very close " i was on dry tires at the end of the race when it was raining quite badly , and it was just impossible on the last lap , " glock told reporters .
hamilton and vettel both passed glock with moments remaining , meaning hamilton finished in fifth position , just enough to clinch the title .
" i thought , ' do i have it ?
do i have it ? " '
hamilton said after the race .
" and when they -lsb- the team -rsb- told me -lsb- on the in-car radio -rsb- , i was ecstatic . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : massa was just seconds away from overall victory .
hamilton 's win came at the expense of the local hero and ferrari hopeful felipe massa .
the brazilian , who won the race comfortably , thought he had pulled off the unthinkable in front of a raucous crowd in sao paulo .
" i had completely mixed emotions because by the time i had crossed the line , i was still the champion and then suddenly my engineer was telling me everything on the radio , " said massa .
the first of many ?
speculation abounds on just how many titles hamilton could go on to win .
he 's still just 23 years old , he 's at a competitive team -lrb- mclaren mercedes -rrb- and he 's proved himself to be an exciting talent behind the wheel .
germany 's michael schumacher holds the all-time record with seven world titles .
theoretically , hamilton could break this record , but there are many other gifted racers on the grid right now .
the competition is much tougher than it was when michael schumacher dominated f1 .
felipe massa nearly beat hamilton this year , and driving for ferrari in 2009 he will want revenge . ferrari also have the 2007 world champion kimi raikonnen in their other car , and there 's two time world champion fernando alonso - currently with the renault team - to consider as well .
a new generation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was vettel 's italy win also the first of many ?
there are also young pretenders to hamilton 's new crown , not least german driver sebastian vettel . the 21-year-old has completed his first full season with torro rosso , a low-budget team which has never really known success - at least not before it knew sebastian vettel .
in a slower car , vettel won the wet and wild italian grand prix , becoming the youngest race winner of all time in the process .
vettel moves up the ladder to the red bull team in 2009 , but his performances have been so impressive that many pundits expect " baby schumacher " - as german tabloids call him - to be sitting in a top car like ferrari , mclaren or bmw very soon .
the next big team ?
bmw is the other german factor which can not be ignored .
in just its third season in the sport , bmw has cemented itself as the third best team , just behind perennial front-runners ferrari and mclaren .
the team 's incremental improvements are part of a " four year plan " - bmw has met its targets in the first three years , and next year 's goal is to challenge for the championship .
polish driver robert kubica - who , like vettel , picked up his first ever race win this year - is likely to lead bmw 's championship charge , although his german teammate nick heidfeld will have other ideas .
the champagne may taste sweet for formula one 's youngest ever world champion lewis hamilton , but if this year 's finale was nail-biting , there could be even tougher challenges still in store . dw staff -lrb- msh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , with the financial crisis affecting auto makers and other giant producers , tens of thousands of temp workers stand to lose their jobs . they are cheaper than their salaried colleagues .
they do n't get extra bonuses for christmas and vacations .
but most importantly , car makers and other manufacturers can get rid of temporary workers in a pinch .
" there are of course good people who you are sad to see go .
but it is the quickest and least bureaucratic way to cut the payrolls , " said ottmar zwiebelhofer , the head of a auto-parts maker koenig metall in the western state of baden wuerttemberg . his company makes airbags and car mufflers , so when car companies ' profits suffer , koenig metall feels the pain .

lewis hamilton has become f1 's youngest ever world champion .
the british mclaren mercedes driver clinched the title by the skin of his teeth , beating rival felipe massa .
but how many more could hamilton win ? lewis hamilton snatched victory from the jaws of defeat at sunday 's brazilian grand prix , the last on the f1 calendar .
finishing fifth on the day , hamilton secured the formula one world championship thanks to an overtaking move less than 20 seconds before the end of the race .
germany 's timo glock elected to stay on the track on dry weather tires when the rain began to fall with minutes remaining in the brazilian grand prix , whilst the rest of the front runners flocked to the pits .
this gamble won glock fourth position on the track , but sebastian vettel and lewis hamilton , both on wet weather tires , were gaining fast .
so very close " i was on dry tires at the end of the race when it was raining quite badly , and it was just impossible on the last lap , " glock told reporters .
hamilton and vettel both passed glock with moments remaining , meaning hamilton finished in fifth position , just enough to clinch the title .
" i thought , ' do i have it ?
do i have it ? " '
hamilton said after the race .
" and when they -lsb- the team -rsb- told me -lsb- on the in-car radio -rsb- , i was ecstatic . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : massa was just seconds away from overall victory .
hamilton 's win came at the expense of the local hero and ferrari hopeful felipe massa .
the brazilian , who won the race comfortably , thought he had pulled off the unthinkable in front of a raucous crowd in sao paulo .
" i had completely mixed emotions because by the time i had crossed the line , i was still the champion and then suddenly my engineer was telling me everything on the radio , " said massa .
the first of many ?
speculation abounds on just how many titles hamilton could go on to win .
he 's still just 23 years old , he 's at a competitive team -lrb- mclaren mercedes -rrb- and he 's proved himself to be an exciting talent behind the wheel .
germany 's michael schumacher holds the all-time record with seven world titles .
theoretically , hamilton could break this record , but there are many other gifted racers on the grid right now .
the competition is much tougher than it was when michael schumacher dominated f1 .
felipe massa nearly beat hamilton this year , and driving for ferrari in 2009 he will want revenge . ferrari also have the 2007 world champion kimi raikonnen in their other car , and there 's two time world champion fernando alonso - currently with the renault team - to consider as well .
a new generation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was vettel 's italy win also the first of many ?
there are also young pretenders to hamilton 's new crown , not least german driver sebastian vettel . the 21-year-old has completed his first full season with torro rosso , a low-budget team which has never really known success - at least not before it knew sebastian vettel .
in a slower car , vettel won the wet and wild italian grand prix , becoming the youngest race winner of all time in the process .
vettel moves up the ladder to the red bull team in 2009 , but his performances have been so impressive that many pundits expect " baby schumacher " - as german tabloids call him - to be sitting in a top car like ferrari , mclaren or bmw very soon .
the next big team ?
bmw is the other german factor which can not be ignored .
in just its third season in the sport , bmw has cemented itself as the third best team , just behind perennial front-runners ferrari and mclaren .
the team 's incremental improvements are part of a " four year plan " - bmw has met its targets in the first three years , and next year 's goal is to challenge for the championship .
polish driver robert kubica - who , like vettel , picked up his first ever race win this year - is likely to lead bmw 's championship charge , although his german teammate nick heidfeld will have other ideas .
the champagne may taste sweet for formula one 's youngest ever world champion lewis hamilton , but if this year 's finale was nail-biting , there could be even tougher challenges still in store . dw staff -lrb- msh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some states are forecasting a turnout of 80 to 90 percent .
that compares with nearly 60 percent in the 2004 presidential election , which itself was the highest participation rate since 1968 .
" we will get closer to 100 percent turnout on election day this year than ever before , " said doug chapin of electiononline.org , a non-partisan web site run by the pew charitable trust .
tens of millions of people have already taken to the polls in recent weeks for early or absentee voting allowed in 31 states , including key battlegrounds florida , north carolina , colorado and nevada .
as many as 40 percent of voters are expected to have voted before the election proper on tuesday .

john mccain , at 72 , would be the oldest president to begin a first term , while barack obama , 47 , would become the first african-american president .
polls lean toward obama bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has the ascendancy , but mccain has pledged not to give up opinion polls continue to give obama a significant edge over mccain in the run-up to the general election .
the economic crisis , compounding george w. bush 's unpopularity , helped lift obama and his message of " change " from a race that was too close to call in august to a significant lead in opinion polls during the closing weeks .
an aggregate of major national polls compiled by realclearpolitics.com gave obama 50.7 percent to mccain 's 44.3 percent as of sunday night .
of those heading to polling stations early , registered democrats have outnumbered registered republicans in some states by 2 to 1 .
the closing pre-election poll of gallup-usa today published monday gave obama a lead of 11 points - 55 percent to 44 for mccain .
a new wall street journal-nbc news poll put obama ahead on 51 percent to 43 , while cnn 's latest poll on sunday had obama with a 53-46 percent edge .
mccain remains upbeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccain has warned against writing off his chances in the coming election but mccain 's campaign has vowed a comeback in the final days , pointing to polls that show as many as one in seven voters remain undecided .
" my opponent is measuring the drapes at the white house , " mccain said , as he wrapped up a frenzied day of campaigning with a midnight rally in miami .
" the mac is back .
and we 're going to win this election . "
in an election climate stacked against the incumbent republican party , both obama and mccain have promised change from what they call the failed policies of the last eight years .
" this is a defining moment in our history , " obama wrote in an article published in the wall street journal .
" tomorrow , i ask you to write our nation 's next great chapter ...
if you give me your vote , we wo n't just win this election - together , we will change this country and change the world . "
deciding factors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next president will inherit the quagmire of the war in iraq the next president will assume the mantle in january in the midst of two wars , an economy tail-spinning into recession and a global financial system on the verge of collapse .
mccain has leaned hard on his self-styled " maverick " image , unafraid to take on his own party in the us senate , while touting his 26 years in congress , military career and expertise in foreign policy as making him the safer choice .
obama has consistently sought to link mccain with the bush administration , and his campaign was given last-minute fodder when vice president dick cheney said he was " delighted " to support mccain in a weekend speech in wyoming .
both bush and cheney have been otherwise absent from the campaign trail .
the looming recession has become the dominant force in the race since september , overshadowing major foreign policy issues like the wars in iraq and afghanistan , iranian and north korean nuclear activities , and a resurgent russia .
fund-raising volunteers from both sides made millions of phone calls and knocked on millions of doors over the final weekend , while the campaigns made last-minute pleas for donations to mount massive television advertising .
obama 's campaign has been fuelled by an unprecedented fundraising prowess that comes mainly from small donors over the internet .
obama raised more than $ 600 million over the last 20 months , nearly twice as much as mccain , according to the federal election commission .
yet mccain 's campaign manager , rick davis , predicted that his side would outspend democrats by 10 million dollars in the final week . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the closing pre-election poll of gallup-usa today published monday gave obama a lead of 11 points - 55 percent to 44 for mccain .
a new wall street journal-nbc news poll put obama ahead on 51 percent to 43 , while cnn 's latest poll on sunday had obama with a 53-46 percent edge .
mccain remains upbeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccain has warned against writing off his chances in the coming election but mccain 's campaign has vowed a comeback in the final days , pointing to polls that show as many as one in seven voters remain undecided .
" my opponent is measuring the drapes at the white house , " mccain said , as he wrapped up a frenzied day of campaigning with a midnight rally in miami .
" the mac is back .
and we 're going to win this election . "
in an election climate stacked against the incumbent republican party , both obama and mccain have promised change from what they call the failed policies of the last eight years .
" this is a defining moment in our history , " obama wrote in an article published in the wall street journal .
" tomorrow , i ask you to write our nation 's next great chapter ...
if you give me your vote , we wo n't just win this election - together , we will change this country and change the world . "
deciding factors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next president will inherit the quagmire of the war in iraq the next president will assume the mantle in january in the midst of two wars , an economy tail-spinning into recession and a global financial system on the verge of collapse .
mccain has leaned hard on his self-styled " maverick " image , unafraid to take on his own party in the us senate , while touting his 26 years in congress , military career and expertise in foreign policy as making him the safer choice .
obama has consistently sought to link mccain with the bush administration , and his campaign was given last-minute fodder when vice president dick cheney said he was " delighted " to support mccain in a weekend speech in wyoming .
both bush and cheney have been otherwise absent from the campaign trail .
the looming recession has become the dominant force in the race since september , overshadowing major foreign policy issues like the wars in iraq and afghanistan , iranian and north korean nuclear activities , and a resurgent russia .
fund-raising volunteers from both sides made millions of phone calls and knocked on millions of doors over the final weekend , while the campaigns made last-minute pleas for donations to mount massive television advertising .
obama 's campaign has been fuelled by an unprecedented fundraising prowess that comes mainly from small donors over the internet .
obama raised more than $ 600 million over the last 20 months , nearly twice as much as mccain , according to the federal election commission .
yet mccain 's campaign manager , rick davis , predicted that his side would outspend democrats by 10 million dollars in the final week . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

lewis hamilton has become f1 's youngest ever world champion .
the british mclaren mercedes driver clinched the title by the skin of his teeth , beating rival felipe massa .
but how many more could hamilton win ? lewis hamilton snatched victory from the jaws of defeat at sunday 's brazilian grand prix , the last on the f1 calendar .
finishing fifth on the day , hamilton secured the formula one world championship thanks to an overtaking move less than 20 seconds before the end of the race .
germany 's timo glock elected to stay on the track on dry weather tires when the rain began to fall with minutes remaining in the brazilian grand prix , whilst the rest of the front runners flocked to the pits .
this gamble won glock fourth position on the track , but sebastian vettel and lewis hamilton , both on wet weather tires , were gaining fast .
so very close " i was on dry tires at the end of the race when it was raining quite badly , and it was just impossible on the last lap , " glock told reporters .
hamilton and vettel both passed glock with moments remaining , meaning hamilton finished in fifth position , just enough to clinch the title .
" i thought , ' do i have it ?
do i have it ? " '
hamilton said after the race .
" and when they -lsb- the team -rsb- told me -lsb- on the in-car radio -rsb- , i was ecstatic . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : massa was just seconds away from overall victory .
hamilton 's win came at the expense of the local hero and ferrari hopeful felipe massa .
the brazilian , who won the race comfortably , thought he had pulled off the unthinkable in front of a raucous crowd in sao paulo .
" i had completely mixed emotions because by the time i had crossed the line , i was still the champion and then suddenly my engineer was telling me everything on the radio , " said massa .
the first of many ?
speculation abounds on just how many titles hamilton could go on to win .
he 's still just 23 years old , he 's at a competitive team -lrb- mclaren mercedes -rrb- and he 's proved himself to be an exciting talent behind the wheel .
germany 's michael schumacher holds the all-time record with seven world titles .
theoretically , hamilton could break this record , but there are many other gifted racers on the grid right now .
the competition is much tougher than it was when michael schumacher dominated f1 .
felipe massa nearly beat hamilton this year , and driving for ferrari in 2009 he will want revenge . ferrari also have the 2007 world champion kimi raikonnen in their other car , and there 's two time world champion fernando alonso - currently with the renault team - to consider as well .
a new generation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was vettel 's italy win also the first of many ?
there are also young pretenders to hamilton 's new crown , not least german driver sebastian vettel . the 21-year-old has completed his first full season with torro rosso , a low-budget team which has never really known success - at least not before it knew sebastian vettel .
in a slower car , vettel won the wet and wild italian grand prix , becoming the youngest race winner of all time in the process .
vettel moves up the ladder to the red bull team in 2009 , but his performances have been so impressive that many pundits expect " baby schumacher " - as german tabloids call him - to be sitting in a top car like ferrari , mclaren or bmw very soon .
the next big team ?
bmw is the other german factor which can not be ignored .
in just its third season in the sport , bmw has cemented itself as the third best team , just behind perennial front-runners ferrari and mclaren .
the team 's incremental improvements are part of a " four year plan " - bmw has met its targets in the first three years , and next year 's goal is to challenge for the championship .
polish driver robert kubica - who , like vettel , picked up his first ever race win this year - is likely to lead bmw 's championship charge , although his german teammate nick heidfeld will have other ideas .
the champagne may taste sweet for formula one 's youngest ever world champion lewis hamilton , but if this year 's finale was nail-biting , there could be even tougher challenges still in store . dw staff -lrb- msh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some states are forecasting a turnout of 80 to 90 percent .
that compares with nearly 60 percent in the 2004 presidential election , which itself was the highest participation rate since 1968 .
" we will get closer to 100 percent turnout on election day this year than ever before , " said doug chapin of electiononline.org , a non-partisan web site run by the pew charitable trust .
tens of millions of people have already taken to the polls in recent weeks for early or absentee voting allowed in 31 states , including key battlegrounds florida , north carolina , colorado and nevada .
as many as 40 percent of voters are expected to have voted before the election proper on tuesday .
the election stands to make history regardless of which candidate wins tuesday .
john mccain , at 72 , would be the oldest president to begin a first term , while barack obama , 47 , would become the first african-american president .
polls lean toward obama bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has the ascendancy , but mccain has pledged not to give up opinion polls continue to give obama a significant edge over mccain in the run-up to the general election .
the economic crisis , compounding george w. bush 's unpopularity , helped lift obama and his message of " change " from a race that was too close to call in august to a significant lead in opinion polls during the closing weeks .
an aggregate of major national polls compiled by realclearpolitics.com gave obama 50.7 percent to mccain 's 44.3 percent as of sunday night .
of those heading to polling stations early , registered democrats have outnumbered registered republicans in some states by 2 to 1 .

some states are forecasting a turnout of 80 to 90 percent .
that compares with nearly 60 percent in the 2004 presidential election , which itself was the highest participation rate since 1968 .
" we will get closer to 100 percent turnout on election day this year than ever before , " said doug chapin of electiononline.org , a non-partisan web site run by the pew charitable trust .
tens of millions of people have already taken to the polls in recent weeks for early or absentee voting allowed in 31 states , including key battlegrounds florida , north carolina , colorado and nevada .
as many as 40 percent of voters are expected to have voted before the election proper on tuesday .
the election stands to make history regardless of which candidate wins tuesday .
john mccain , at 72 , would be the oldest president to begin a first term , while barack obama , 47 , would become the first african-american president .
polls lean toward obama bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has the ascendancy , but mccain has pledged not to give up opinion polls continue to give obama a significant edge over mccain in the run-up to the general election .
the economic crisis , compounding george w. bush 's unpopularity , helped lift obama and his message of " change " from a race that was too close to call in august to a significant lead in opinion polls during the closing weeks .
an aggregate of major national polls compiled by realclearpolitics.com gave obama 50.7 percent to mccain 's 44.3 percent as of sunday night .
of those heading to polling stations early , registered democrats have outnumbered registered republicans in some states by 2 to 1 .
the closing pre-election poll of gallup-usa today published monday gave obama a lead of 11 points - 55 percent to 44 for mccain .
a new wall street journal-nbc news poll put obama ahead on 51 percent to 43 , while cnn 's latest poll on sunday had obama with a 53-46 percent edge .
mccain remains upbeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccain has warned against writing off his chances in the coming election but mccain 's campaign has vowed a comeback in the final days , pointing to polls that show as many as one in seven voters remain undecided .
" my opponent is measuring the drapes at the white house , " mccain said , as he wrapped up a frenzied day of campaigning with a midnight rally in miami .
" the mac is back .
and we 're going to win this election . "
in an election climate stacked against the incumbent republican party , both obama and mccain have promised change from what they call the failed policies of the last eight years .
" this is a defining moment in our history , " obama wrote in an article published in the wall street journal .
" tomorrow , i ask you to write our nation 's next great chapter ...
if you give me your vote , we wo n't just win this election - together , we will change this country and change the world . "

" recession is a real risk , for some countries , for the euro area , and for the eu , " european economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said . the overall gross domestic product gdp of the euro zone is expected to grow by only 0.1 percent in 2009 and by 0.9 percent in 2010 . the economy of the 15 nations that use the euro shrank by 0.2 percent in the second quarter of this year and is forecast to contract by 0.1 percent in both the third and fourth quarters . this would be the first time the euro zone will have entered recession territory since the euro was introduced in 1999 . europe 's engine at a standstill " the eu economy is hit by the financial crisis that deepened during the autumn and is taking a toll on business and consumer confidence " , almunia said . as a result , " the european growth engine is at a standstill , " he said . while they make for bleak reading , the eu 's 2009 figures are better than those of the united states and japan , whose economies are expected to shrink by 0.5 per cent and 0.4 per cent respectively . jeffery lacker , richmond federal reserve bank president , said that in other parts of the world , recession had most certainly kicked in .
" i think it 's definitely a recession at this point -lrb- in the us -rrb- .
how deep , how steep , and long it 's going to be is uncertain , " he said . but with officials in brussels stressing that their predictions are surrounded by " considerable uncertainty and downside risks " , almunia urged member states to rapidly adopt a common recovery program in order to avoid a prolonged period of economic decline . " national action is needed , and national action is much more efficient when it is coordinated with a common vision and a common discussion on who , when and how should strengthen investment decisions or fiscal policies or structural reforms , " almunia said . recession for the uk as others hit zero growth bildunterschrift : the leaders of europe 's largest economies will all struggle with impending downturns of the eu 's four biggest economies , britain is almost certain of facing a full-blown recession in 2009 , with its gross domestic product shrinking by 1 per cent .
germany , france and italy are all expected to post zero growth rates next year . and with europe 's economic locomotives all grinding to a halt , gdp in the expanding euro zone is set to grow by just 0.1 per cent in 2009 and by 0.9 per cent in 2010 . among the eu member states expected to feel the full pain of the downturn are its so-called " tiger economies " - ireland , estonia and latvia - which after recording double-digit growth rates over the last five years are now facing a lasting recession . spain , the eu 's fifth-biggest economy and formerly once of its strongest economic performers , is also set to tip into recession , with its economy shrinking by 0.2 per cent in 2009 before growing by a painfully slow 0.5 per cent in 2010 . new members reacting optimistically and only among the eu states which joined the bloc in 2004 and 2007 does the economic outlook seem more promising . slovakia , which is set to become the 16th country to adopt the euro in 2009 , will likely see its economy grow by 4.9 per cent , the best in the bloc ahead of romania -lrb- 4.7 per cent -rrb- and bulgaria -lrb- 4.5 per cent -rrb- . because tax receipts tend to fall - and public spending to increase - during times of crisis , the economic slowdown is also expected to worsen the budget deficits of many eu member states . france , which has already been cautioned by almunia , is expected to see its deficit hit the 3 per cent of gdp upper limit this year and to exceed this limit in 2010 . ireland , meanwhile , is already facing disciplinary action from the eu , with forecasts showing its budget deficit surging to 5.5 per cent of gdp this year and to 7.2 per cent in 2010 . worst still , the eu 's overall budgetary position is also set to deteriorate as a result of the various financial rescue packages being put into place by member states in order to counter the effects of the credit crunch , officials warned . and with unemployment also set to rise by a full percentage point to 8.1 per cent in 2010 , the only good news is likely to come from inflation , which is expected to fall rapidly to 2.5 per cent in 2009 after peaking in 2008 . banks reveal extent of crunch the grim economic outlook comes as europe 's top banks revealed how much they were being squeezed of profits by the credit crunch . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few banks have escaped the deluge of the financial crisis germany 's second-biggest bank , commerzbank , said monday it had lost 285 million euros and would seek an 8.2 billion euro -lrb- $ 10.5 billion -rrb- " stabilization " injection from the government and another 15 billion euro to secure financing . french bank societe generale registered an 83.7 percent drop in third-quarter net profit after being hit hard by the collapse of us lender lehman brothers . britain 's biggest home lender hbos plc reported it could lose as much as 5 billion pounds from risky assets and bad loans . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" commerzbank , germany 's second-largest bank , said on monday it will help itself to a chunk of state aid , asking the government for 8.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.5 billion -rrb- in cash and 15 billion more in debt guarantees .
the move comes after commerzbank posted a third quarter loss of 285 million euros and an operating loss of 475 million euros .
the international financial crisis cost the bank 1.1 billion euros in losses from market operations , a statement from the bank said .
" in truth , we have not covered ourselves in glory here .
in future , we will have to improve , " commerzbank chairman martin blessing said in a statement .
shares in commerzbank shot up 6.8 per cent in early trading monday on news of the capital injection .
commerzbank made a deal with germany 's financial markets stabilization fund , or soffin , to accept a " silent participation " of 8.2 billion euros and the additional option of a guarantee for 15 billion euros in treasury bonds .

' we welcome the aid package ' commerzbank 's move was " to strengthen its capital base , " the frankfurt-based bank said on monday . the bank had a net loss of 285 million euros in the quarter after earning 339 million euros a year earlier .
" we welcomed the government 's aid package from the beginning , " blessing said in a statement .
" we 're using the instruments made available in the package because it is good for the bank , for its employees , and its customers . "
the capital infusion , in the form of a " silent participation , " means berlin will not become an active shareholder in commerzbank and the cash will go directly towards boosting the bank 's so-called tier1 , or core capital .
that means investors ' holdings will not be diluted in commerzbank , which can also use a capital increase as it is acquiring dresdner bank from the insurance group allianz .

now , with the financial crisis affecting auto makers and other giant producers , tens of thousands of temp workers stand to lose their jobs . they are cheaper than their salaried colleagues .
they do n't get extra bonuses for christmas and vacations .
but most importantly , car makers and other manufacturers can get rid of temporary workers in a pinch .
" there are of course good people who you are sad to see go .
but it is the quickest and least bureaucratic way to cut the payrolls , " said ottmar zwiebelhofer , the head of a auto-parts maker koenig metall in the western state of baden wuerttemberg . his company makes airbags and car mufflers , so when car companies ' profits suffer , koenig metall feels the pain .
zwiebelhofer expects volume to drop by 20 percent this year .
pink slips abound it is a given that the first to lose their jobs in hard times are temp workers - and that 's not just the case at koenig metall .
auto supplier hella is n't renewing the contracts of some 200 of its temporary workers ; its competitor honsel is giving 100 temps pink slips .
at german car giant vw , thousands of temporary jobs are hanging in the balance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many workers hold the same temp job for years it 's not only short-term hires who are affected .
some workers have had their factory jobs for years , but continue to be officially employed and paid through a temp firm .
just a few weeks ago , many of them hoped to be taken over by the companies themselves .
but while metal-industry companies have been swimming in orders in the past years , the boon has n't translated into many employment contracts .
instead , companies have chosen to benefit from the flexibility of workers from temp agencies .
that system that is now turning on itself , said hartmut seifert , labor market expert for the union-affiliated hans-böckler-stiftung foundation .
" we know that there is a two percent quota of temporary workers .
but there are companies whose work force is made up of over 20 percent temps , " said siefert .
boom started with agenda 2010 the boom in temp agency work was started by the last german administration , a coalition of social democrats and greens that devised the agenda 2010 package of social reforms .
the watchword back in 2003 was " marketplace flexibility . "
since then , temp workers have been allowed to be in a job for more than one year - a ruling that was embraced enthusiastically by companies .
the government 's goal at the time was to use temp work to create more permanent employment , but things did n't work out that way .

in the last year alone , the number of temp workers in germany has doubled to 750,000 , even while unemployment figures have fallen .
those days are over , labor-market expert seifert said .
" it is entirely possible that a third of this number will lose their job in the next months . "
it 's not just the auto industry where temp workers face hard times . many temp workers are employed by companies in machine-making , pharmaceuticals and chemicals - industries that live from exports and could run into serious problems amid the world economic crisis .
less opportunity seen for temps temp workers " have a higher risk of being laid off .
they earn less than permanent employees , and have less access to further job training , " siefert said .
this means they have less opportunity to improve their chances at getting another job , he noted .
he believes temp workers should get a " risk premium " - in the form of higher wages - for taking so much risk in their employment .

dw-world takes a look at what it and other media have said in the campaign 's final hours . the british business weekly , the economist , has " wholeheartedly " endorsed barack obama , saying the democratic candidate has " clearly shown that he offers the better chance of restoring america 's self-confidence . "
the magazine admits it was disappointed that the john mccain on the campaign stump has been a weaker , more indecisive and more right-wing version of the john mccain who made a name for himself as a senator .
his choice of sarah palin as a running mate was the epitome of the " sloppiness " exhibited by candidate mccain , the economist says , writing : " it is not just that she is an unconvincing stand-in , nor even that she seems to have been chosen partly for her views on divisive social issues , notably abortion . "
rather , the magazine deplores the fact that mccain made his most important appointment after meeting palin only twice .
in contrast , the economist commends obama for running an exceptionally assured campaign .
" a man who started out with no money and few supporters has out-thought , out-organized and out-fought the two mightiest machines in american politics - the clintons and the conservative right , " the magazine opines , concluding that obama deserves the presidency .
the french paper dernières nouvelles d 'alsace from strasbourg conceded that for months now , europeans have only had eyes for barack obama .
" that 's because he stands for real change , but also because mccain wears the republican banner that - perhaps unfairly - puts him on equal footing with the incumbent president , " the paper wrote .
it added that what europeans are expecting is an end to the bush era , and an end to eight years of lack of understanding between the united states and the rest of the world .
the world would be better off with barack obama as the next us president , said the dutch de volkskrant newspaper in its weekend edition .
" everything points to the fact that diplomacy plays a far bigger role for him than it does for the incumbent president , and that he would handle it with far more aplomb , " the paper wrote .
it also echoed a popular european view that with obama in the white house , america would show the world a completely different face in every respect than it has with the much-vilified bush , or the respectable but somewhat rusty veteran mccain .
the luxemburger wort focused on the foreign policy tasks facing the winner of the election .
" the leader of the united states can and should give decisive impulses for peace in the middle east , for the future vitality of nato , for a new order of the world 's financial systems , and for the west 's energy security , " the paper said , adding that the president of the free world must also ensure that international terrorism is fought with the right weapons .
the german rhein zeitung commented that after eight disastrous years of the bush administration , it does n't really matter who becomes the 44th president - things can only get better .
whether the victor is obama or mccain , the " chief firefighter " will have several blazes to attend to , the paper wrote , adding : " he 'll have to repair his country 's damaged reputation worldwide , and give americans a new sense of optimism . "
finally , the swiss tages-anzeiger newspaper warned its readers not to put too much faith in national opinion polls which put obama ahead of mccain in the final hours of the campaign .
it said that the polls are treading exceptionally thin ice this year because the favored candidate is an african american .
" did white voters not want to admit to their prejudice and say they were supporting a black man , only to then choose the white candidate in the privacy of the voting booth ? " the paper asked .
and anyway , it continued , with the election likely to come down to a handful of swing states , a healthy dose of skepticism is justified . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de fear of a palin presidency drives us expats to vote for obama the economy , taxes and america 's image are hot-button issues for us expats in germany .
but even republicans are now going democrat for a far more compelling reason : fear that sarah palin could become president .

dw-world takes a look at what it and other media have said in the campaign 's final hours . the british business weekly , the economist , has " wholeheartedly " endorsed barack obama , saying the democratic candidate has " clearly shown that he offers the better chance of restoring america 's self-confidence . "
the magazine admits it was disappointed that the john mccain on the campaign stump has been a weaker , more indecisive and more right-wing version of the john mccain who made a name for himself as a senator .
his choice of sarah palin as a running mate was the epitome of the " sloppiness " exhibited by candidate mccain , the economist says , writing : " it is not just that she is an unconvincing stand-in , nor even that she seems to have been chosen partly for her views on divisive social issues , notably abortion . "
rather , the magazine deplores the fact that mccain made his most important appointment after meeting palin only twice .
in contrast , the economist commends obama for running an exceptionally assured campaign .
" a man who started out with no money and few supporters has out-thought , out-organized and out-fought the two mightiest machines in american politics - the clintons and the conservative right , " the magazine opines , concluding that obama deserves the presidency .
the french paper dernières nouvelles d 'alsace from strasbourg conceded that for months now , europeans have only had eyes for barack obama .
" that 's because he stands for real change , but also because mccain wears the republican banner that - perhaps unfairly - puts him on equal footing with the incumbent president , " the paper wrote .
it added that what europeans are expecting is an end to the bush era , and an end to eight years of lack of understanding between the united states and the rest of the world .
the world would be better off with barack obama as the next us president , said the dutch de volkskrant newspaper in its weekend edition .
" everything points to the fact that diplomacy plays a far bigger role for him than it does for the incumbent president , and that he would handle it with far more aplomb , " the paper wrote .
it also echoed a popular european view that with obama in the white house , america would show the world a completely different face in every respect than it has with the much-vilified bush , or the respectable but somewhat rusty veteran mccain .
the luxemburger wort focused on the foreign policy tasks facing the winner of the election .
" the leader of the united states can and should give decisive impulses for peace in the middle east , for the future vitality of nato , for a new order of the world 's financial systems , and for the west 's energy security , " the paper said , adding that the president of the free world must also ensure that international terrorism is fought with the right weapons .
the german rhein zeitung commented that after eight disastrous years of the bush administration , it does n't really matter who becomes the 44th president - things can only get better .
whether the victor is obama or mccain , the " chief firefighter " will have several blazes to attend to , the paper wrote , adding : " he 'll have to repair his country 's damaged reputation worldwide , and give americans a new sense of optimism . "
finally , the swiss tages-anzeiger newspaper warned its readers not to put too much faith in national opinion polls which put obama ahead of mccain in the final hours of the campaign .

dw-world takes a look at what it and other media have said in the campaign 's final hours . the british business weekly , the economist , has " wholeheartedly " endorsed barack obama , saying the democratic candidate has " clearly shown that he offers the better chance of restoring america 's self-confidence . "
the magazine admits it was disappointed that the john mccain on the campaign stump has been a weaker , more indecisive and more right-wing version of the john mccain who made a name for himself as a senator .
his choice of sarah palin as a running mate was the epitome of the " sloppiness " exhibited by candidate mccain , the economist says , writing : " it is not just that she is an unconvincing stand-in , nor even that she seems to have been chosen partly for her views on divisive social issues , notably abortion . "
rather , the magazine deplores the fact that mccain made his most important appointment after meeting palin only twice .
in contrast , the economist commends obama for running an exceptionally assured campaign .
" a man who started out with no money and few supporters has out-thought , out-organized and out-fought the two mightiest machines in american politics - the clintons and the conservative right , " the magazine opines , concluding that obama deserves the presidency .
the french paper dernières nouvelles d 'alsace from strasbourg conceded that for months now , europeans have only had eyes for barack obama .
" that 's because he stands for real change , but also because mccain wears the republican banner that - perhaps unfairly - puts him on equal footing with the incumbent president , " the paper wrote .
it added that what europeans are expecting is an end to the bush era , and an end to eight years of lack of understanding between the united states and the rest of the world .
the world would be better off with barack obama as the next us president , said the dutch de volkskrant newspaper in its weekend edition .
" everything points to the fact that diplomacy plays a far bigger role for him than it does for the incumbent president , and that he would handle it with far more aplomb , " the paper wrote .
it also echoed a popular european view that with obama in the white house , america would show the world a completely different face in every respect than it has with the much-vilified bush , or the respectable but somewhat rusty veteran mccain .
the luxemburger wort focused on the foreign policy tasks facing the winner of the election .
" the leader of the united states can and should give decisive impulses for peace in the middle east , for the future vitality of nato , for a new order of the world 's financial systems , and for the west 's energy security , " the paper said , adding that the president of the free world must also ensure that international terrorism is fought with the right weapons .
the german rhein zeitung commented that after eight disastrous years of the bush administration , it does n't really matter who becomes the 44th president - things can only get better .
whether the victor is obama or mccain , the " chief firefighter " will have several blazes to attend to , the paper wrote , adding : " he 'll have to repair his country 's damaged reputation worldwide , and give americans a new sense of optimism . "
finally , the swiss tages-anzeiger newspaper warned its readers not to put too much faith in national opinion polls which put obama ahead of mccain in the final hours of the campaign .
it said that the polls are treading exceptionally thin ice this year because the favored candidate is an african american .
" did white voters not want to admit to their prejudice and say they were supporting a black man , only to then choose the white candidate in the privacy of the voting booth ? " the paper asked .
and anyway , it continued , with the election likely to come down to a handful of swing states , a healthy dose of skepticism is justified . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de fear of a palin presidency drives us expats to vote for obama the economy , taxes and america 's image are hot-button issues for us expats in germany .
but even republicans are now going democrat for a far more compelling reason : fear that sarah palin could become president .
-lrb- 02.11.2008 -rrb- opinion : obama will go down in history if barack obama is elected , the us will wake up to a dramatically different government on nov .
5 , says american council on germany president william drodziak .
despite a tough agenda , obama will show he 's turned the page .
-lrb- 30.10.2008 -rrb- us readers divided by europe 's approval of obama most europeans would likely vote for barack obama if they could , but some dw readers in the us are divided on whether they 'd really like him .

lewis hamilton has become f1 's youngest ever world champion .
the british mclaren mercedes driver clinched the title by the skin of his teeth , beating rival felipe massa .
but how many more could hamilton win ? lewis hamilton snatched victory from the jaws of defeat at sunday 's brazilian grand prix , the last on the f1 calendar .
finishing fifth on the day , hamilton secured the formula one world championship thanks to an overtaking move less than 20 seconds before the end of the race .
germany 's timo glock elected to stay on the track on dry weather tires when the rain began to fall with minutes remaining in the brazilian grand prix , whilst the rest of the front runners flocked to the pits .
this gamble won glock fourth position on the track , but sebastian vettel and lewis hamilton , both on wet weather tires , were gaining fast .
so very close " i was on dry tires at the end of the race when it was raining quite badly , and it was just impossible on the last lap , " glock told reporters .
hamilton and vettel both passed glock with moments remaining , meaning hamilton finished in fifth position , just enough to clinch the title .
" i thought , ' do i have it ?
do i have it ? " '
hamilton said after the race .
" and when they -lsb- the team -rsb- told me -lsb- on the in-car radio -rsb- , i was ecstatic . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : massa was just seconds away from overall victory .
hamilton 's win came at the expense of the local hero and ferrari hopeful felipe massa .
the brazilian , who won the race comfortably , thought he had pulled off the unthinkable in front of a raucous crowd in sao paulo .
" i had completely mixed emotions because by the time i had crossed the line , i was still the champion and then suddenly my engineer was telling me everything on the radio , " said massa .
the first of many ?
speculation abounds on just how many titles hamilton could go on to win .
he 's still just 23 years old , he 's at a competitive team -lrb- mclaren mercedes -rrb- and he 's proved himself to be an exciting talent behind the wheel .
germany 's michael schumacher holds the all-time record with seven world titles .
theoretically , hamilton could break this record , but there are many other gifted racers on the grid right now .
the competition is much tougher than it was when michael schumacher dominated f1 .
felipe massa nearly beat hamilton this year , and driving for ferrari in 2009 he will want revenge . ferrari also have the 2007 world champion kimi raikonnen in their other car , and there 's two time world champion fernando alonso - currently with the renault team - to consider as well .
a new generation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was vettel 's italy win also the first of many ?
there are also young pretenders to hamilton 's new crown , not least german driver sebastian vettel . the 21-year-old has completed his first full season with torro rosso , a low-budget team which has never really known success - at least not before it knew sebastian vettel .
in a slower car , vettel won the wet and wild italian grand prix , becoming the youngest race winner of all time in the process .
vettel moves up the ladder to the red bull team in 2009 , but his performances have been so impressive that many pundits expect " baby schumacher " - as german tabloids call him - to be sitting in a top car like ferrari , mclaren or bmw very soon .
the next big team ?
bmw is the other german factor which can not be ignored .
in just its third season in the sport , bmw has cemented itself as the third best team , just behind perennial front-runners ferrari and mclaren .
the team 's incremental improvements are part of a " four year plan " - bmw has met its targets in the first three years , and next year 's goal is to challenge for the championship .
polish driver robert kubica - who , like vettel , picked up his first ever race win this year - is likely to lead bmw 's championship charge , although his german teammate nick heidfeld will have other ideas .
the champagne may taste sweet for formula one 's youngest ever world champion lewis hamilton , but if this year 's finale was nail-biting , there could be even tougher challenges still in store . dw staff -lrb- msh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hamilton said after the race .

hamilton 's win came at the expense of the local hero and ferrari hopeful felipe massa .
the brazilian , who won the race comfortably , thought he had pulled off the unthinkable in front of a raucous crowd in sao paulo .
" i had completely mixed emotions because by the time i had crossed the line , i was still the champion and then suddenly my engineer was telling me everything on the radio , " said massa .
the first of many ?
speculation abounds on just how many titles hamilton could go on to win .
he 's still just 23 years old , he 's at a competitive team -lrb- mclaren mercedes -rrb- and he 's proved himself to be an exciting talent behind the wheel .
germany 's michael schumacher holds the all-time record with seven world titles .
theoretically , hamilton could break this record , but there are many other gifted racers on the grid right now .
the competition is much tougher than it was when michael schumacher dominated f1 .
felipe massa nearly beat hamilton this year , and driving for ferrari in 2009 he will want revenge . ferrari also have the 2007 world champion kimi raikonnen in their other car , and there 's two time world champion fernando alonso - currently with the renault team - to consider as well .
a new generation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was vettel 's italy win also the first of many ?
there are also young pretenders to hamilton 's new crown , not least german driver sebastian vettel . the 21-year-old has completed his first full season with torro rosso , a low-budget team which has never really known success - at least not before it knew sebastian vettel .
in a slower car , vettel won the wet and wild italian grand prix , becoming the youngest race winner of all time in the process .
vettel moves up the ladder to the red bull team in 2009 , but his performances have been so impressive that many pundits expect " baby schumacher " - as german tabloids call him - to be sitting in a top car like ferrari , mclaren or bmw very soon .
the next big team ?
bmw is the other german factor which can not be ignored .
in just its third season in the sport , bmw has cemented itself as the third best team , just behind perennial front-runners ferrari and mclaren .
the team 's incremental improvements are part of a " four year plan " - bmw has met its targets in the first three years , and next year 's goal is to challenge for the championship .
polish driver robert kubica - who , like vettel , picked up his first ever race win this year - is likely to lead bmw 's championship charge , although his german teammate nick heidfeld will have other ideas .

" commerzbank , germany 's second-largest bank , said on monday it will help itself to a chunk of state aid , asking the government for 8.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.5 billion -rrb- in cash and 15 billion more in debt guarantees .
the move comes after commerzbank posted a third quarter loss of 285 million euros and an operating loss of 475 million euros .
the international financial crisis cost the bank 1.1 billion euros in losses from market operations , a statement from the bank said .
" in truth , we have not covered ourselves in glory here .
in future , we will have to improve , " commerzbank chairman martin blessing said in a statement .
shares in commerzbank shot up 6.8 per cent in early trading monday on news of the capital injection .
commerzbank made a deal with germany 's financial markets stabilization fund , or soffin , to accept a " silent participation " of 8.2 billion euros and the additional option of a guarantee for 15 billion euros in treasury bonds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commerzbank 's blessing : " we welcome the package " in late october , germany 's hypo real estate holding became the first private company to tap the government 's 500 billion-euro rescue package for financial institutions , which it offered in a bid to help them through the ongoing international credit crisis .
' we welcome the aid package ' commerzbank 's move was " to strengthen its capital base , " the frankfurt-based bank said on monday . the bank had a net loss of 285 million euros in the quarter after earning 339 million euros a year earlier .
" we welcomed the government 's aid package from the beginning , " blessing said in a statement .
" we 're using the instruments made available in the package because it is good for the bank , for its employees , and its customers . "

dw-world takes a look at what it and other media have said in the campaign 's final hours . the british business weekly , the economist , has " wholeheartedly " endorsed barack obama , saying the democratic candidate has " clearly shown that he offers the better chance of restoring america 's self-confidence . "
the magazine admits it was disappointed that the john mccain on the campaign stump has been a weaker , more indecisive and more right-wing version of the john mccain who made a name for himself as a senator .
his choice of sarah palin as a running mate was the epitome of the " sloppiness " exhibited by candidate mccain , the economist says , writing : " it is not just that she is an unconvincing stand-in , nor even that she seems to have been chosen partly for her views on divisive social issues , notably abortion . "
rather , the magazine deplores the fact that mccain made his most important appointment after meeting palin only twice .
in contrast , the economist commends obama for running an exceptionally assured campaign .
" a man who started out with no money and few supporters has out-thought , out-organized and out-fought the two mightiest machines in american politics - the clintons and the conservative right , " the magazine opines , concluding that obama deserves the presidency .
the french paper dernières nouvelles d 'alsace from strasbourg conceded that for months now , europeans have only had eyes for barack obama .
" that 's because he stands for real change , but also because mccain wears the republican banner that - perhaps unfairly - puts him on equal footing with the incumbent president , " the paper wrote .
it added that what europeans are expecting is an end to the bush era , and an end to eight years of lack of understanding between the united states and the rest of the world .
the world would be better off with barack obama as the next us president , said the dutch de volkskrant newspaper in its weekend edition .
" everything points to the fact that diplomacy plays a far bigger role for him than it does for the incumbent president , and that he would handle it with far more aplomb , " the paper wrote .
it also echoed a popular european view that with obama in the white house , america would show the world a completely different face in every respect than it has with the much-vilified bush , or the respectable but somewhat rusty veteran mccain .
the luxemburger wort focused on the foreign policy tasks facing the winner of the election .
" the leader of the united states can and should give decisive impulses for peace in the middle east , for the future vitality of nato , for a new order of the world 's financial systems , and for the west 's energy security , " the paper said , adding that the president of the free world must also ensure that international terrorism is fought with the right weapons .
the german rhein zeitung commented that after eight disastrous years of the bush administration , it does n't really matter who becomes the 44th president - things can only get better .
whether the victor is obama or mccain , the " chief firefighter " will have several blazes to attend to , the paper wrote , adding : " he 'll have to repair his country 's damaged reputation worldwide , and give americans a new sense of optimism . "
finally , the swiss tages-anzeiger newspaper warned its readers not to put too much faith in national opinion polls which put obama ahead of mccain in the final hours of the campaign .
it said that the polls are treading exceptionally thin ice this year because the favored candidate is an african american .
" did white voters not want to admit to their prejudice and say they were supporting a black man , only to then choose the white candidate in the privacy of the voting booth ? " the paper asked .
and anyway , it continued , with the election likely to come down to a handful of swing states , a healthy dose of skepticism is justified . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the magazine admits it was disappointed that the john mccain on the campaign stump has been a weaker , more indecisive and more right-wing version of the john mccain who made a name for himself as a senator .
his choice of sarah palin as a running mate was the epitome of the " sloppiness " exhibited by candidate mccain , the economist says , writing : " it is not just that she is an unconvincing stand-in , nor even that she seems to have been chosen partly for her views on divisive social issues , notably abortion . "
rather , the magazine deplores the fact that mccain made his most important appointment after meeting palin only twice .
in contrast , the economist commends obama for running an exceptionally assured campaign .
" a man who started out with no money and few supporters has out-thought , out-organized and out-fought the two mightiest machines in american politics - the clintons and the conservative right , " the magazine opines , concluding that obama deserves the presidency .
the french paper dernières nouvelles d 'alsace from strasbourg conceded that for months now , europeans have only had eyes for barack obama .
" that 's because he stands for real change , but also because mccain wears the republican banner that - perhaps unfairly - puts him on equal footing with the incumbent president , " the paper wrote .
it added that what europeans are expecting is an end to the bush era , and an end to eight years of lack of understanding between the united states and the rest of the world .
the world would be better off with barack obama as the next us president , said the dutch de volkskrant newspaper in its weekend edition .
" everything points to the fact that diplomacy plays a far bigger role for him than it does for the incumbent president , and that he would handle it with far more aplomb , " the paper wrote .
it also echoed a popular european view that with obama in the white house , america would show the world a completely different face in every respect than it has with the much-vilified bush , or the respectable but somewhat rusty veteran mccain .
the luxemburger wort focused on the foreign policy tasks facing the winner of the election .
" the leader of the united states can and should give decisive impulses for peace in the middle east , for the future vitality of nato , for a new order of the world 's financial systems , and for the west 's energy security , " the paper said , adding that the president of the free world must also ensure that international terrorism is fought with the right weapons .
the german rhein zeitung commented that after eight disastrous years of the bush administration , it does n't really matter who becomes the 44th president - things can only get better .
whether the victor is obama or mccain , the " chief firefighter " will have several blazes to attend to , the paper wrote , adding : " he 'll have to repair his country 's damaged reputation worldwide , and give americans a new sense of optimism . "
finally , the swiss tages-anzeiger newspaper warned its readers not to put too much faith in national opinion polls which put obama ahead of mccain in the final hours of the campaign .
it said that the polls are treading exceptionally thin ice this year because the favored candidate is an african american .
" did white voters not want to admit to their prejudice and say they were supporting a black man , only to then choose the white candidate in the privacy of the voting booth ? " the paper asked .
and anyway , it continued , with the election likely to come down to a handful of swing states , a healthy dose of skepticism is justified . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

lewis hamilton has become f1 's youngest ever world champion .
the british mclaren mercedes driver clinched the title by the skin of his teeth , beating rival felipe massa .
but how many more could hamilton win ? lewis hamilton snatched victory from the jaws of defeat at sunday 's brazilian grand prix , the last on the f1 calendar .
finishing fifth on the day , hamilton secured the formula one world championship thanks to an overtaking move less than 20 seconds before the end of the race .
germany 's timo glock elected to stay on the track on dry weather tires when the rain began to fall with minutes remaining in the brazilian grand prix , whilst the rest of the front runners flocked to the pits .
this gamble won glock fourth position on the track , but sebastian vettel and lewis hamilton , both on wet weather tires , were gaining fast .
so very close " i was on dry tires at the end of the race when it was raining quite badly , and it was just impossible on the last lap , " glock told reporters .
hamilton and vettel both passed glock with moments remaining , meaning hamilton finished in fifth position , just enough to clinch the title .
" i thought , ' do i have it ?
do i have it ? " '
hamilton said after the race .
" and when they -lsb- the team -rsb- told me -lsb- on the in-car radio -rsb- , i was ecstatic . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : massa was just seconds away from overall victory .
hamilton 's win came at the expense of the local hero and ferrari hopeful felipe massa .
the brazilian , who won the race comfortably , thought he had pulled off the unthinkable in front of a raucous crowd in sao paulo .
" i had completely mixed emotions because by the time i had crossed the line , i was still the champion and then suddenly my engineer was telling me everything on the radio , " said massa .
the first of many ?
speculation abounds on just how many titles hamilton could go on to win .
he 's still just 23 years old , he 's at a competitive team -lrb- mclaren mercedes -rrb- and he 's proved himself to be an exciting talent behind the wheel .
germany 's michael schumacher holds the all-time record with seven world titles .
theoretically , hamilton could break this record , but there are many other gifted racers on the grid right now .
the competition is much tougher than it was when michael schumacher dominated f1 .
felipe massa nearly beat hamilton this year , and driving for ferrari in 2009 he will want revenge . ferrari also have the 2007 world champion kimi raikonnen in their other car , and there 's two time world champion fernando alonso - currently with the renault team - to consider as well .
a new generation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was vettel 's italy win also the first of many ?
there are also young pretenders to hamilton 's new crown , not least german driver sebastian vettel . the 21-year-old has completed his first full season with torro rosso , a low-budget team which has never really known success - at least not before it knew sebastian vettel .
in a slower car , vettel won the wet and wild italian grand prix , becoming the youngest race winner of all time in the process .
vettel moves up the ladder to the red bull team in 2009 , but his performances have been so impressive that many pundits expect " baby schumacher " - as german tabloids call him - to be sitting in a top car like ferrari , mclaren or bmw very soon .
the next big team ?
bmw is the other german factor which can not be ignored .
in just its third season in the sport , bmw has cemented itself as the third best team , just behind perennial front-runners ferrari and mclaren .
the team 's incremental improvements are part of a " four year plan " - bmw has met its targets in the first three years , and next year 's goal is to challenge for the championship .
polish driver robert kubica - who , like vettel , picked up his first ever race win this year - is likely to lead bmw 's championship charge , although his german teammate nick heidfeld will have other ideas .
the champagne may taste sweet for formula one 's youngest ever world champion lewis hamilton , but if this year 's finale was nail-biting , there could be even tougher challenges still in store . dw staff -lrb- msh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" recession is a real risk , for some countries , for the euro area , and for the eu , " european economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said . the overall gross domestic product gdp of the euro zone is expected to grow by only 0.1 percent in 2009 and by 0.9 percent in 2010 . the economy of the 15 nations that use the euro shrank by 0.2 percent in the second quarter of this year and is forecast to contract by 0.1 percent in both the third and fourth quarters . this would be the first time the euro zone will have entered recession territory since the euro was introduced in 1999 . europe 's engine at a standstill " the eu economy is hit by the financial crisis that deepened during the autumn and is taking a toll on business and consumer confidence " , almunia said . as a result , " the european growth engine is at a standstill , " he said . while they make for bleak reading , the eu 's 2009 figures are better than those of the united states and japan , whose economies are expected to shrink by 0.5 per cent and 0.4 per cent respectively . jeffery lacker , richmond federal reserve bank president , said that in other parts of the world , recession had most certainly kicked in .
" i think it 's definitely a recession at this point -lrb- in the us -rrb- .
how deep , how steep , and long it 's going to be is uncertain , " he said . but with officials in brussels stressing that their predictions are surrounded by " considerable uncertainty and downside risks " , almunia urged member states to rapidly adopt a common recovery program in order to avoid a prolonged period of economic decline . " national action is needed , and national action is much more efficient when it is coordinated with a common vision and a common discussion on who , when and how should strengthen investment decisions or fiscal policies or structural reforms , " almunia said . recession for the uk as others hit zero growth bildunterschrift : the leaders of europe 's largest economies will all struggle with impending downturns of the eu 's four biggest economies , britain is almost certain of facing a full-blown recession in 2009 , with its gross domestic product shrinking by 1 per cent .
germany , france and italy are all expected to post zero growth rates next year . and with europe 's economic locomotives all grinding to a halt , gdp in the expanding euro zone is set to grow by just 0.1 per cent in 2009 and by 0.9 per cent in 2010 . among the eu member states expected to feel the full pain of the downturn are its so-called " tiger economies " - ireland , estonia and latvia - which after recording double-digit growth rates over the last five years are now facing a lasting recession . spain , the eu 's fifth-biggest economy and formerly once of its strongest economic performers , is also set to tip into recession , with its economy shrinking by 0.2 per cent in 2009 before growing by a painfully slow 0.5 per cent in 2010 . new members reacting optimistically and only among the eu states which joined the bloc in 2004 and 2007 does the economic outlook seem more promising . slovakia , which is set to become the 16th country to adopt the euro in 2009 , will likely see its economy grow by 4.9 per cent , the best in the bloc ahead of romania -lrb- 4.7 per cent -rrb- and bulgaria -lrb- 4.5 per cent -rrb- . because tax receipts tend to fall - and public spending to increase - during times of crisis , the economic slowdown is also expected to worsen the budget deficits of many eu member states . france , which has already been cautioned by almunia , is expected to see its deficit hit the 3 per cent of gdp upper limit this year and to exceed this limit in 2010 . ireland , meanwhile , is already facing disciplinary action from the eu , with forecasts showing its budget deficit surging to 5.5 per cent of gdp this year and to 7.2 per cent in 2010 . worst still , the eu 's overall budgetary position is also set to deteriorate as a result of the various financial rescue packages being put into place by member states in order to counter the effects of the credit crunch , officials warned . and with unemployment also set to rise by a full percentage point to 8.1 per cent in 2010 , the only good news is likely to come from inflation , which is expected to fall rapidly to 2.5 per cent in 2009 after peaking in 2008 . banks reveal extent of crunch the grim economic outlook comes as europe 's top banks revealed how much they were being squeezed of profits by the credit crunch . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few banks have escaped the deluge of the financial crisis germany 's second-biggest bank , commerzbank , said monday it had lost 285 million euros and would seek an 8.2 billion euro -lrb- $ 10.5 billion -rrb- " stabilization " injection from the government and another 15 billion euro to secure financing . french bank societe generale registered an 83.7 percent drop in third-quarter net profit after being hit hard by the collapse of us lender lehman brothers . britain 's biggest home lender hbos plc reported it could lose as much as 5 billion pounds from risky assets and bad loans . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" recession is a real risk , for some countries , for the euro area , and for the eu , " european economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said . the overall gross domestic product gdp of the euro zone is expected to grow by only 0.1 percent in 2009 and by 0.9 percent in 2010 . the economy of the 15 nations that use the euro shrank by 0.2 percent in the second quarter of this year and is forecast to contract by 0.1 percent in both the third and fourth quarters . this would be the first time the euro zone will have entered recession territory since the euro was introduced in 1999 . europe 's engine at a standstill " the eu economy is hit by the financial crisis that deepened during the autumn and is taking a toll on business and consumer confidence " , almunia said . as a result , " the european growth engine is at a standstill , " he said . while they make for bleak reading , the eu 's 2009 figures are better than those of the united states and japan , whose economies are expected to shrink by 0.5 per cent and 0.4 per cent respectively . jeffery lacker , richmond federal reserve bank president , said that in other parts of the world , recession had most certainly kicked in .
" i think it 's definitely a recession at this point -lrb- in the us -rrb- .
how deep , how steep , and long it 's going to be is uncertain , " he said . but with officials in brussels stressing that their predictions are surrounded by " considerable uncertainty and downside risks " , almunia urged member states to rapidly adopt a common recovery program in order to avoid a prolonged period of economic decline . " national action is needed , and national action is much more efficient when it is coordinated with a common vision and a common discussion on who , when and how should strengthen investment decisions or fiscal policies or structural reforms , " almunia said . recession for the uk as others hit zero growth bildunterschrift : the leaders of europe 's largest economies will all struggle with impending downturns of the eu 's four biggest economies , britain is almost certain of facing a full-blown recession in 2009 , with its gross domestic product shrinking by 1 per cent .
germany , france and italy are all expected to post zero growth rates next year . and with europe 's economic locomotives all grinding to a halt , gdp in the expanding euro zone is set to grow by just 0.1 per cent in 2009 and by 0.9 per cent in 2010 . among the eu member states expected to feel the full pain of the downturn are its so-called " tiger economies " - ireland , estonia and latvia - which after recording double-digit growth rates over the last five years are now facing a lasting recession . spain , the eu 's fifth-biggest economy and formerly once of its strongest economic performers , is also set to tip into recession , with its economy shrinking by 0.2 per cent in 2009 before growing by a painfully slow 0.5 per cent in 2010 . new members reacting optimistically and only among the eu states which joined the bloc in 2004 and 2007 does the economic outlook seem more promising . slovakia , which is set to become the 16th country to adopt the euro in 2009 , will likely see its economy grow by 4.9 per cent , the best in the bloc ahead of romania -lrb- 4.7 per cent -rrb- and bulgaria -lrb- 4.5 per cent -rrb- . because tax receipts tend to fall - and public spending to increase - during times of crisis , the economic slowdown is also expected to worsen the budget deficits of many eu member states . france , which has already been cautioned by almunia , is expected to see its deficit hit the 3 per cent of gdp upper limit this year and to exceed this limit in 2010 . ireland , meanwhile , is already facing disciplinary action from the eu , with forecasts showing its budget deficit surging to 5.5 per cent of gdp this year and to 7.2 per cent in 2010 . worst still , the eu 's overall budgetary position is also set to deteriorate as a result of the various financial rescue packages being put into place by member states in order to counter the effects of the credit crunch , officials warned . and with unemployment also set to rise by a full percentage point to 8.1 per cent in 2010 , the only good news is likely to come from inflation , which is expected to fall rapidly to 2.5 per cent in 2009 after peaking in 2008 . banks reveal extent of crunch the grim economic outlook comes as europe 's top banks revealed how much they were being squeezed of profits by the credit crunch . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few banks have escaped the deluge of the financial crisis germany 's second-biggest bank , commerzbank , said monday it had lost 285 million euros and would seek an 8.2 billion euro -lrb- $ 10.5 billion -rrb- " stabilization " injection from the government and another 15 billion euro to secure financing . french bank societe generale registered an 83.7 percent drop in third-quarter net profit after being hit hard by the collapse of us lender lehman brothers . britain 's biggest home lender hbos plc reported it could lose as much as 5 billion pounds from risky assets and bad loans . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de us election -pipe- 03.11.2008 european press review : obama the better choice großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it 's time , " the economist 's cover said the economist is one of the latest influential publications to support democrat barack obama in the us presidential election .
dw-world takes a look at what it and other media have said in the campaign 's final hours . the british business weekly , the economist , has " wholeheartedly " endorsed barack obama , saying the democratic candidate has " clearly shown that he offers the better chance of restoring america 's self-confidence . "
the magazine admits it was disappointed that the john mccain on the campaign stump has been a weaker , more indecisive and more right-wing version of the john mccain who made a name for himself as a senator .
his choice of sarah palin as a running mate was the epitome of the " sloppiness " exhibited by candidate mccain , the economist says , writing : " it is not just that she is an unconvincing stand-in , nor even that she seems to have been chosen partly for her views on divisive social issues , notably abortion . "
rather , the magazine deplores the fact that mccain made his most important appointment after meeting palin only twice .
in contrast , the economist commends obama for running an exceptionally assured campaign .
" a man who started out with no money and few supporters has out-thought , out-organized and out-fought the two mightiest machines in american politics - the clintons and the conservative right , " the magazine opines , concluding that obama deserves the presidency .
the french paper dernières nouvelles d 'alsace from strasbourg conceded that for months now , europeans have only had eyes for barack obama .
" that 's because he stands for real change , but also because mccain wears the republican banner that - perhaps unfairly - puts him on equal footing with the incumbent president , " the paper wrote .
it added that what europeans are expecting is an end to the bush era , and an end to eight years of lack of understanding between the united states and the rest of the world .
the world would be better off with barack obama as the next us president , said the dutch de volkskrant newspaper in its weekend edition .
" everything points to the fact that diplomacy plays a far bigger role for him than it does for the incumbent president , and that he would handle it with far more aplomb , " the paper wrote .
it also echoed a popular european view that with obama in the white house , america would show the world a completely different face in every respect than it has with the much-vilified bush , or the respectable but somewhat rusty veteran mccain .
the luxemburger wort focused on the foreign policy tasks facing the winner of the election .
" the leader of the united states can and should give decisive impulses for peace in the middle east , for the future vitality of nato , for a new order of the world 's financial systems , and for the west 's energy security , " the paper said , adding that the president of the free world must also ensure that international terrorism is fought with the right weapons .
the german rhein zeitung commented that after eight disastrous years of the bush administration , it does n't really matter who becomes the 44th president - things can only get better .
whether the victor is obama or mccain , the " chief firefighter " will have several blazes to attend to , the paper wrote , adding : " he 'll have to repair his country 's damaged reputation worldwide , and give americans a new sense of optimism . "
finally , the swiss tages-anzeiger newspaper warned its readers not to put too much faith in national opinion polls which put obama ahead of mccain in the final hours of the campaign .
it said that the polls are treading exceptionally thin ice this year because the favored candidate is an african american .
" did white voters not want to admit to their prejudice and say they were supporting a black man , only to then choose the white candidate in the privacy of the voting booth ? " the paper asked .
and anyway , it continued , with the election likely to come down to a handful of swing states , a healthy dose of skepticism is justified . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de fear of a palin presidency drives us expats to vote for obama the economy , taxes and america 's image are hot-button issues for us expats in germany .
but even republicans are now going democrat for a far more compelling reason : fear that sarah palin could become president .
-lrb- 02.11.2008 -rrb- opinion : obama will go down in history if barack obama is elected , the us will wake up to a dramatically different government on nov .

-lrb- 30.10.2008 -rrb- us readers divided by europe 's approval of obama most europeans would likely vote for barack obama if they could , but some dw readers in the us are divided on whether they 'd really like him .

some states are forecasting a turnout of 80 to 90 percent .
that compares with nearly 60 percent in the 2004 presidential election , which itself was the highest participation rate since 1968 .
" we will get closer to 100 percent turnout on election day this year than ever before , " said doug chapin of electiononline.org , a non-partisan web site run by the pew charitable trust .
tens of millions of people have already taken to the polls in recent weeks for early or absentee voting allowed in 31 states , including key battlegrounds florida , north carolina , colorado and nevada .
as many as 40 percent of voters are expected to have voted before the election proper on tuesday .
the election stands to make history regardless of which candidate wins tuesday .
john mccain , at 72 , would be the oldest president to begin a first term , while barack obama , 47 , would become the first african-american president .
polls lean toward obama bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has the ascendancy , but mccain has pledged not to give up opinion polls continue to give obama a significant edge over mccain in the run-up to the general election .
the economic crisis , compounding george w. bush 's unpopularity , helped lift obama and his message of " change " from a race that was too close to call in august to a significant lead in opinion polls during the closing weeks .
an aggregate of major national polls compiled by realclearpolitics.com gave obama 50.7 percent to mccain 's 44.3 percent as of sunday night .
of those heading to polling stations early , registered democrats have outnumbered registered republicans in some states by 2 to 1 .
the closing pre-election poll of gallup-usa today published monday gave obama a lead of 11 points - 55 percent to 44 for mccain .
a new wall street journal-nbc news poll put obama ahead on 51 percent to 43 , while cnn 's latest poll on sunday had obama with a 53-46 percent edge .
mccain remains upbeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccain has warned against writing off his chances in the coming election but mccain 's campaign has vowed a comeback in the final days , pointing to polls that show as many as one in seven voters remain undecided .
" my opponent is measuring the drapes at the white house , " mccain said , as he wrapped up a frenzied day of campaigning with a midnight rally in miami .
" the mac is back .
and we 're going to win this election . "
in an election climate stacked against the incumbent republican party , both obama and mccain have promised change from what they call the failed policies of the last eight years .
" this is a defining moment in our history , " obama wrote in an article published in the wall street journal .
" tomorrow , i ask you to write our nation 's next great chapter ...
if you give me your vote , we wo n't just win this election - together , we will change this country and change the world . "
deciding factors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next president will inherit the quagmire of the war in iraq the next president will assume the mantle in january in the midst of two wars , an economy tail-spinning into recession and a global financial system on the verge of collapse .
mccain has leaned hard on his self-styled " maverick " image , unafraid to take on his own party in the us senate , while touting his 26 years in congress , military career and expertise in foreign policy as making him the safer choice .
obama has consistently sought to link mccain with the bush administration , and his campaign was given last-minute fodder when vice president dick cheney said he was " delighted " to support mccain in a weekend speech in wyoming .
both bush and cheney have been otherwise absent from the campaign trail .
the looming recession has become the dominant force in the race since september , overshadowing major foreign policy issues like the wars in iraq and afghanistan , iranian and north korean nuclear activities , and a resurgent russia .
fund-raising volunteers from both sides made millions of phone calls and knocked on millions of doors over the final weekend , while the campaigns made last-minute pleas for donations to mount massive television advertising .

but while metal-industry companies have been swimming in orders in the past years , the boon has n't translated into many employment contracts .
instead , companies have chosen to benefit from the flexibility of workers from temp agencies .
that system that is now turning on itself , said hartmut seifert , labor market expert for the union-affiliated hans-böckler-stiftung foundation .

the watchword back in 2003 was " marketplace flexibility . "

those days are over , labor-market expert seifert said .
" it is entirely possible that a third of this number will lose their job in the next months . "
it 's not just the auto industry where temp workers face hard times . many temp workers are employed by companies in machine-making , pharmaceuticals and chemicals - industries that live from exports and could run into serious problems amid the world economic crisis .

" commerzbank , germany 's second-largest bank , said on monday it will help itself to a chunk of state aid , asking the government for 8.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.5 billion -rrb- in cash and 15 billion more in debt guarantees .
the move comes after commerzbank posted a third quarter loss of 285 million euros and an operating loss of 475 million euros .
the international financial crisis cost the bank 1.1 billion euros in losses from market operations , a statement from the bank said .
" in truth , we have not covered ourselves in glory here .
in future , we will have to improve , " commerzbank chairman martin blessing said in a statement .
shares in commerzbank shot up 6.8 per cent in early trading monday on news of the capital injection .

" the world has changed because we have realized that a great country , which will remain a great country , is not the only one concerned by the world 's problems , " he told reporters in the southern french city of marseille .
" the european union has become more resolute , " kouchner said .
arriving for the talks , british foreign secretary david miliband , said that creating such a partnership would demand much from the eu member states .
" this is n't just about asking america to do things , " he told reporters .
" it 's about europe stepping up as well . "
he said europe was confident it could work with the new administration in washington - whether under republican candidate john mccain or democrat barack obama - to shape " an inclusive global agenda that responds to the changing economic and social and political times . "
eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner also echoed the view that future relations with washington should reflect europe 's growing leadership in global affairs .
" we want to have an even stronger relationship with the united states , and for that reason i think it 's important that we say what we think is important for us , " she said .
" i think it should be a more balanced relationship . "
crisis in drc also on agenda bildunterschrift : the fighting has displaced tens of thousands kouchner and miliband were also set to brief their fellow foreign ministers on their weekend trip to kinshasa and kigali to try and negotiate an end to unrest in the eastern democratic republic of congo .
the eu is considering sending a military humanitarian mission to support the un peacekeeping force in the drc , where rebel fighting has displaced an estimated 250,000 people .
" the world 's political leaders are determined to make sure there 's no repeat of the murderous activities of the 1990s , " said miliband , referring to the genocide in rwanda and civil war in eastern congo .
he said ministers were waiting for a un special envoy to the country to report back to the security council on the situation before deciding to mobilize an eu military mission . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 03.11.2008 germany 's army of temp workers may suffer amid cutbacks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german temp workers in a number of sectors face hard times the german government has advocated inexpensive temporary employment for years .
now , with the financial crisis affecting auto makers and other giant producers , tens of thousands of temp workers stand to lose their jobs . they are cheaper than their salaried colleagues .
they do n't get extra bonuses for christmas and vacations .
but most importantly , car makers and other manufacturers can get rid of temporary workers in a pinch .
" there are of course good people who you are sad to see go .
but it is the quickest and least bureaucratic way to cut the payrolls , " said ottmar zwiebelhofer , the head of a auto-parts maker koenig metall in the western state of baden wuerttemberg . his company makes airbags and car mufflers , so when car companies ' profits suffer , koenig metall feels the pain .
zwiebelhofer expects volume to drop by 20 percent this year .
pink slips abound it is a given that the first to lose their jobs in hard times are temp workers - and that 's not just the case at koenig metall .
auto supplier hella is n't renewing the contracts of some 200 of its temporary workers ; its competitor honsel is giving 100 temps pink slips .
at german car giant vw , thousands of temporary jobs are hanging in the balance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many workers hold the same temp job for years it 's not only short-term hires who are affected .
some workers have had their factory jobs for years , but continue to be officially employed and paid through a temp firm .
just a few weeks ago , many of them hoped to be taken over by the companies themselves .
but while metal-industry companies have been swimming in orders in the past years , the boon has n't translated into many employment contracts .
instead , companies have chosen to benefit from the flexibility of workers from temp agencies .
that system that is now turning on itself , said hartmut seifert , labor market expert for the union-affiliated hans-böckler-stiftung foundation .
" we know that there is a two percent quota of temporary workers .
but there are companies whose work force is made up of over 20 percent temps , " said siefert .
boom started with agenda 2010 the boom in temp agency work was started by the last german administration , a coalition of social democrats and greens that devised the agenda 2010 package of social reforms .
the watchword back in 2003 was " marketplace flexibility . "
since then , temp workers have been allowed to be in a job for more than one year - a ruling that was embraced enthusiastically by companies .
the government 's goal at the time was to use temp work to create more permanent employment , but things did n't work out that way .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those in export industries , like cars , will be hardest hit instead , well known temp agencies like randstad , adecco and permacon were booking heavy profits , and looking desperately for qualified personnel .
in the last year alone , the number of temp workers in germany has doubled to 750,000 , even while unemployment figures have fallen .
those days are over , labor-market expert seifert said .
" it is entirely possible that a third of this number will lose their job in the next months . "
it 's not just the auto industry where temp workers face hard times . many temp workers are employed by companies in machine-making , pharmaceuticals and chemicals - industries that live from exports and could run into serious problems amid the world economic crisis .
less opportunity seen for temps temp workers " have a higher risk of being laid off .
they earn less than permanent employees , and have less access to further job training , " siefert said .
this means they have less opportunity to improve their chances at getting another job , he noted .
he believes temp workers should get a " risk premium " - in the form of higher wages - for taking so much risk in their employment .
while it may be small comfort for those who could lose their jobs in the coming months , the european union is trying to make the equation fairer .
new guidelines on temporary workers signed last week by the european parliament demand that temps get equal wages for equal work . manfred götzke -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de us election -pipe- 03.11.2008 european press review : obama the better choice großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it 's time , " the economist 's cover said the economist is one of the latest influential publications to support democrat barack obama in the us presidential election .
dw-world takes a look at what it and other media have said in the campaign 's final hours . the british business weekly , the economist , has " wholeheartedly " endorsed barack obama , saying the democratic candidate has " clearly shown that he offers the better chance of restoring america 's self-confidence . "
the magazine admits it was disappointed that the john mccain on the campaign stump has been a weaker , more indecisive and more right-wing version of the john mccain who made a name for himself as a senator .
his choice of sarah palin as a running mate was the epitome of the " sloppiness " exhibited by candidate mccain , the economist says , writing : " it is not just that she is an unconvincing stand-in , nor even that she seems to have been chosen partly for her views on divisive social issues , notably abortion . "
rather , the magazine deplores the fact that mccain made his most important appointment after meeting palin only twice .
in contrast , the economist commends obama for running an exceptionally assured campaign .
" a man who started out with no money and few supporters has out-thought , out-organized and out-fought the two mightiest machines in american politics - the clintons and the conservative right , " the magazine opines , concluding that obama deserves the presidency .
the french paper dernières nouvelles d 'alsace from strasbourg conceded that for months now , europeans have only had eyes for barack obama .
" that 's because he stands for real change , but also because mccain wears the republican banner that - perhaps unfairly - puts him on equal footing with the incumbent president , " the paper wrote .
it added that what europeans are expecting is an end to the bush era , and an end to eight years of lack of understanding between the united states and the rest of the world .
the world would be better off with barack obama as the next us president , said the dutch de volkskrant newspaper in its weekend edition .
" everything points to the fact that diplomacy plays a far bigger role for him than it does for the incumbent president , and that he would handle it with far more aplomb , " the paper wrote .
it also echoed a popular european view that with obama in the white house , america would show the world a completely different face in every respect than it has with the much-vilified bush , or the respectable but somewhat rusty veteran mccain .
the luxemburger wort focused on the foreign policy tasks facing the winner of the election .
" the leader of the united states can and should give decisive impulses for peace in the middle east , for the future vitality of nato , for a new order of the world 's financial systems , and for the west 's energy security , " the paper said , adding that the president of the free world must also ensure that international terrorism is fought with the right weapons .
the german rhein zeitung commented that after eight disastrous years of the bush administration , it does n't really matter who becomes the 44th president - things can only get better .
whether the victor is obama or mccain , the " chief firefighter " will have several blazes to attend to , the paper wrote , adding : " he 'll have to repair his country 's damaged reputation worldwide , and give americans a new sense of optimism . "
finally , the swiss tages-anzeiger newspaper warned its readers not to put too much faith in national opinion polls which put obama ahead of mccain in the final hours of the campaign .
it said that the polls are treading exceptionally thin ice this year because the favored candidate is an african american .
" did white voters not want to admit to their prejudice and say they were supporting a black man , only to then choose the white candidate in the privacy of the voting booth ? " the paper asked .
and anyway , it continued , with the election likely to come down to a handful of swing states , a healthy dose of skepticism is justified . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de fear of a palin presidency drives us expats to vote for obama the economy , taxes and america 's image are hot-button issues for us expats in germany .
but even republicans are now going democrat for a far more compelling reason : fear that sarah palin could become president .

dw-world takes a look at what it and other media have said in the campaign 's final hours . the british business weekly , the economist , has " wholeheartedly " endorsed barack obama , saying the democratic candidate has " clearly shown that he offers the better chance of restoring america 's self-confidence . "
the magazine admits it was disappointed that the john mccain on the campaign stump has been a weaker , more indecisive and more right-wing version of the john mccain who made a name for himself as a senator .
his choice of sarah palin as a running mate was the epitome of the " sloppiness " exhibited by candidate mccain , the economist says , writing : " it is not just that she is an unconvincing stand-in , nor even that she seems to have been chosen partly for her views on divisive social issues , notably abortion . "
rather , the magazine deplores the fact that mccain made his most important appointment after meeting palin only twice .
in contrast , the economist commends obama for running an exceptionally assured campaign .
" a man who started out with no money and few supporters has out-thought , out-organized and out-fought the two mightiest machines in american politics - the clintons and the conservative right , " the magazine opines , concluding that obama deserves the presidency .
the french paper dernières nouvelles d 'alsace from strasbourg conceded that for months now , europeans have only had eyes for barack obama .
" that 's because he stands for real change , but also because mccain wears the republican banner that - perhaps unfairly - puts him on equal footing with the incumbent president , " the paper wrote .

" the talks will be held in the same manner as with michael ballack , " loew said .
the coach also plans further talks with ballack ahead of the forthcoming friendly international against england in berlin .
" we have agreed that we will speak on the telephone again this week , " he said , dismissing fears his authority could have suffered after it was decided to take no action against his captain following critical remarks made in a newspaper interview .
loew is still hoping the chelsea midfielder will recover in time following foot surgery to play against england on nov .
19 .
" he has had the stitches removed and now has to see from day to day how his recovery is going , " loew said .
" this was not about winners or losers .
michael ballack has assured me that he did n't intend to criticize our work . "
i was in the wrong : ballack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael ballack , right , and coach joachim loew have resolved their differences ballack will remain germany captain after apologizing in a meeting with loew , who had summoned the player for talks at the german soccer federation headquarters in frankfurt .
ballack , 32 , said in a statement after the talks : " i realize it was not okay to go public .
i regret that this led to the impression that i wanted to criticise joachim loew in his position as coach .
" i apologized to joachim loew .
he is the coach , he makes the decisions and we have to respect them . "
ballack was critical of the fact that loew had benched 31-year-old frings for two world cup qualifiers .
he also accused loew of not showing enough respect for veteran players .
germany last month enjoyed 2-1 and 1-0 wins over russia and wales respectively in the qualifiers .
loew 's side is sitting top of group 4 with 10 points from four games .
however , the germany coach has found himself having to deal with disgruntled players , with the ballack and frings incidences coming soon after kevin kuranyi 's decision to walk from the stands during the clash against russia after failing to make the 18-man squad for the game .
although kuranyi has since also apologized , loew said he would no longer consider the schalke striker for selection . dpa news agency -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world takes a look at what it and other media have said in the campaign 's final hours . the british business weekly , the economist , has " wholeheartedly " endorsed barack obama , saying the democratic candidate has " clearly shown that he offers the better chance of restoring america 's self-confidence . "
the magazine admits it was disappointed that the john mccain on the campaign stump has been a weaker , more indecisive and more right-wing version of the john mccain who made a name for himself as a senator .
his choice of sarah palin as a running mate was the epitome of the " sloppiness " exhibited by candidate mccain , the economist says , writing : " it is not just that she is an unconvincing stand-in , nor even that she seems to have been chosen partly for her views on divisive social issues , notably abortion . "
rather , the magazine deplores the fact that mccain made his most important appointment after meeting palin only twice .
in contrast , the economist commends obama for running an exceptionally assured campaign .
" a man who started out with no money and few supporters has out-thought , out-organized and out-fought the two mightiest machines in american politics - the clintons and the conservative right , " the magazine opines , concluding that obama deserves the presidency .
the french paper dernières nouvelles d 'alsace from strasbourg conceded that for months now , europeans have only had eyes for barack obama .
" that 's because he stands for real change , but also because mccain wears the republican banner that - perhaps unfairly - puts him on equal footing with the incumbent president , " the paper wrote .
it added that what europeans are expecting is an end to the bush era , and an end to eight years of lack of understanding between the united states and the rest of the world .
the world would be better off with barack obama as the next us president , said the dutch de volkskrant newspaper in its weekend edition .
" everything points to the fact that diplomacy plays a far bigger role for him than it does for the incumbent president , and that he would handle it with far more aplomb , " the paper wrote .
it also echoed a popular european view that with obama in the white house , america would show the world a completely different face in every respect than it has with the much-vilified bush , or the respectable but somewhat rusty veteran mccain .
the luxemburger wort focused on the foreign policy tasks facing the winner of the election .
" the leader of the united states can and should give decisive impulses for peace in the middle east , for the future vitality of nato , for a new order of the world 's financial systems , and for the west 's energy security , " the paper said , adding that the president of the free world must also ensure that international terrorism is fought with the right weapons .
the german rhein zeitung commented that after eight disastrous years of the bush administration , it does n't really matter who becomes the 44th president - things can only get better .
whether the victor is obama or mccain , the " chief firefighter " will have several blazes to attend to , the paper wrote , adding : " he 'll have to repair his country 's damaged reputation worldwide , and give americans a new sense of optimism . "
finally , the swiss tages-anzeiger newspaper warned its readers not to put too much faith in national opinion polls which put obama ahead of mccain in the final hours of the campaign .
it said that the polls are treading exceptionally thin ice this year because the favored candidate is an african american .
" did white voters not want to admit to their prejudice and say they were supporting a black man , only to then choose the white candidate in the privacy of the voting booth ? " the paper asked .
and anyway , it continued , with the election likely to come down to a handful of swing states , a healthy dose of skepticism is justified . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de formula one -pipe- 03.11.2008 hamilton takes first formula 1 championship in dramatic finale großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamilton triumphs in interlagos , after his shock defeat there last year .
lewis hamilton has become f1 's youngest ever world champion .
the british mclaren mercedes driver clinched the title by the skin of his teeth , beating rival felipe massa .
but how many more could hamilton win ? lewis hamilton snatched victory from the jaws of defeat at sunday 's brazilian grand prix , the last on the f1 calendar .
finishing fifth on the day , hamilton secured the formula one world championship thanks to an overtaking move less than 20 seconds before the end of the race .
germany 's timo glock elected to stay on the track on dry weather tires when the rain began to fall with minutes remaining in the brazilian grand prix , whilst the rest of the front runners flocked to the pits .
this gamble won glock fourth position on the track , but sebastian vettel and lewis hamilton , both on wet weather tires , were gaining fast .
so very close " i was on dry tires at the end of the race when it was raining quite badly , and it was just impossible on the last lap , " glock told reporters .
hamilton and vettel both passed glock with moments remaining , meaning hamilton finished in fifth position , just enough to clinch the title .
" i thought , ' do i have it ?
do i have it ? " '
hamilton said after the race .
" and when they -lsb- the team -rsb- told me -lsb- on the in-car radio -rsb- , i was ecstatic . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : massa was just seconds away from overall victory .
hamilton 's win came at the expense of the local hero and ferrari hopeful felipe massa .
the brazilian , who won the race comfortably , thought he had pulled off the unthinkable in front of a raucous crowd in sao paulo .
" i had completely mixed emotions because by the time i had crossed the line , i was still the champion and then suddenly my engineer was telling me everything on the radio , " said massa .
the first of many ?
speculation abounds on just how many titles hamilton could go on to win .
he 's still just 23 years old , he 's at a competitive team -lrb- mclaren mercedes -rrb- and he 's proved himself to be an exciting talent behind the wheel .
germany 's michael schumacher holds the all-time record with seven world titles .
theoretically , hamilton could break this record , but there are many other gifted racers on the grid right now .
the competition is much tougher than it was when michael schumacher dominated f1 .
felipe massa nearly beat hamilton this year , and driving for ferrari in 2009 he will want revenge . ferrari also have the 2007 world champion kimi raikonnen in their other car , and there 's two time world champion fernando alonso - currently with the renault team - to consider as well .
a new generation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was vettel 's italy win also the first of many ?
there are also young pretenders to hamilton 's new crown , not least german driver sebastian vettel . the 21-year-old has completed his first full season with torro rosso , a low-budget team which has never really known success - at least not before it knew sebastian vettel .
in a slower car , vettel won the wet and wild italian grand prix , becoming the youngest race winner of all time in the process .
vettel moves up the ladder to the red bull team in 2009 , but his performances have been so impressive that many pundits expect " baby schumacher " - as german tabloids call him - to be sitting in a top car like ferrari , mclaren or bmw very soon .
the next big team ?
bmw is the other german factor which can not be ignored .
in just its third season in the sport , bmw has cemented itself as the third best team , just behind perennial front-runners ferrari and mclaren .
the team 's incremental improvements are part of a " four year plan " - bmw has met its targets in the first three years , and next year 's goal is to challenge for the championship .
polish driver robert kubica - who , like vettel , picked up his first ever race win this year - is likely to lead bmw 's championship charge , although his german teammate nick heidfeld will have other ideas .
the champagne may taste sweet for formula one 's youngest ever world champion lewis hamilton , but if this year 's finale was nail-biting , there could be even tougher challenges still in store . dw staff -lrb- msh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the world has changed because we have realized that a great country , which will remain a great country , is not the only one concerned by the world 's problems , " he told reporters in the southern french city of marseille .
" the european union has become more resolute , " kouchner said .
arriving for the talks , british foreign secretary david miliband , said that creating such a partnership would demand much from the eu member states .
" this is n't just about asking america to do things , " he told reporters .
" it 's about europe stepping up as well . "
he said europe was confident it could work with the new administration in washington - whether under republican candidate john mccain or democrat barack obama - to shape " an inclusive global agenda that responds to the changing economic and social and political times . "
eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner also echoed the view that future relations with washington should reflect europe 's growing leadership in global affairs .
" we want to have an even stronger relationship with the united states , and for that reason i think it 's important that we say what we think is important for us , " she said .
" i think it should be a more balanced relationship . "
crisis in drc also on agenda bildunterschrift : the fighting has displaced tens of thousands kouchner and miliband were also set to brief their fellow foreign ministers on their weekend trip to kinshasa and kigali to try and negotiate an end to unrest in the eastern democratic republic of congo .
the eu is considering sending a military humanitarian mission to support the un peacekeeping force in the drc , where rebel fighting has displaced an estimated 250,000 people .
" the world 's political leaders are determined to make sure there 's no repeat of the murderous activities of the 1990s , " said miliband , referring to the genocide in rwanda and civil war in eastern congo .
he said ministers were waiting for a un special envoy to the country to report back to the security council on the situation before deciding to mobilize an eu military mission . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the coach also plans further talks with ballack ahead of the forthcoming friendly international against england in berlin .

even with the tacit support of the left party , this would have left ypsilanti three votes short .

but this may not be the case after ypsilanti failed in her second attempt to oust christian democratic union premier roland koch since last january 's state elections failed to produce a clear winner .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de us election -pipe- 03.11.2008 us election predicted to draw record numbers as world waits großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : head to head : obama and mccain face off in the most important us election in a generation after a frantic 20 months of rallies , debates and commercials in the most expensive presidential campaign ever , record numbers are expected to turn out for the most important us election in a generation . across the country , state officials are preparing for record turnouts and huge lines at polling stations , a testament to the massive interest that has been generated in an election widely considered the most important in recent memory .
some states are forecasting a turnout of 80 to 90 percent .
that compares with nearly 60 percent in the 2004 presidential election , which itself was the highest participation rate since 1968 .
" we will get closer to 100 percent turnout on election day this year than ever before , " said doug chapin of electiononline.org , a non-partisan web site run by the pew charitable trust .
tens of millions of people have already taken to the polls in recent weeks for early or absentee voting allowed in 31 states , including key battlegrounds florida , north carolina , colorado and nevada .
as many as 40 percent of voters are expected to have voted before the election proper on tuesday .
the election stands to make history regardless of which candidate wins tuesday .
john mccain , at 72 , would be the oldest president to begin a first term , while barack obama , 47 , would become the first african-american president .
polls lean toward obama bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has the ascendancy , but mccain has pledged not to give up opinion polls continue to give obama a significant edge over mccain in the run-up to the general election .
the economic crisis , compounding george w. bush 's unpopularity , helped lift obama and his message of " change " from a race that was too close to call in august to a significant lead in opinion polls during the closing weeks .
an aggregate of major national polls compiled by realclearpolitics.com gave obama 50.7 percent to mccain 's 44.3 percent as of sunday night .
of those heading to polling stations early , registered democrats have outnumbered registered republicans in some states by 2 to 1 .
the closing pre-election poll of gallup-usa today published monday gave obama a lead of 11 points - 55 percent to 44 for mccain .
a new wall street journal-nbc news poll put obama ahead on 51 percent to 43 , while cnn 's latest poll on sunday had obama with a 53-46 percent edge .
mccain remains upbeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccain has warned against writing off his chances in the coming election but mccain 's campaign has vowed a comeback in the final days , pointing to polls that show as many as one in seven voters remain undecided .
" my opponent is measuring the drapes at the white house , " mccain said , as he wrapped up a frenzied day of campaigning with a midnight rally in miami .
" the mac is back .
and we 're going to win this election . "
in an election climate stacked against the incumbent republican party , both obama and mccain have promised change from what they call the failed policies of the last eight years .
" this is a defining moment in our history , " obama wrote in an article published in the wall street journal .
" tomorrow , i ask you to write our nation 's next great chapter ...
if you give me your vote , we wo n't just win this election - together , we will change this country and change the world . "
deciding factors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next president will inherit the quagmire of the war in iraq the next president will assume the mantle in january in the midst of two wars , an economy tail-spinning into recession and a global financial system on the verge of collapse .
mccain has leaned hard on his self-styled " maverick " image , unafraid to take on his own party in the us senate , while touting his 26 years in congress , military career and expertise in foreign policy as making him the safer choice .
obama has consistently sought to link mccain with the bush administration , and his campaign was given last-minute fodder when vice president dick cheney said he was " delighted " to support mccain in a weekend speech in wyoming .
both bush and cheney have been otherwise absent from the campaign trail .
the looming recession has become the dominant force in the race since september , overshadowing major foreign policy issues like the wars in iraq and afghanistan , iranian and north korean nuclear activities , and a resurgent russia .
fund-raising volunteers from both sides made millions of phone calls and knocked on millions of doors over the final weekend , while the campaigns made last-minute pleas for donations to mount massive television advertising .
obama 's campaign has been fuelled by an unprecedented fundraising prowess that comes mainly from small donors over the internet .
obama raised more than $ 600 million over the last 20 months , nearly twice as much as mccain , according to the federal election commission .
yet mccain 's campaign manager , rick davis , predicted that his side would outspend democrats by 10 million dollars in the final week . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

lewis hamilton has become f1 's youngest ever world champion .
the british mclaren mercedes driver clinched the title by the skin of his teeth , beating rival felipe massa .
but how many more could hamilton win ? lewis hamilton snatched victory from the jaws of defeat at sunday 's brazilian grand prix , the last on the f1 calendar .
finishing fifth on the day , hamilton secured the formula one world championship thanks to an overtaking move less than 20 seconds before the end of the race .
germany 's timo glock elected to stay on the track on dry weather tires when the rain began to fall with minutes remaining in the brazilian grand prix , whilst the rest of the front runners flocked to the pits .
this gamble won glock fourth position on the track , but sebastian vettel and lewis hamilton , both on wet weather tires , were gaining fast .
so very close " i was on dry tires at the end of the race when it was raining quite badly , and it was just impossible on the last lap , " glock told reporters .
hamilton and vettel both passed glock with moments remaining , meaning hamilton finished in fifth position , just enough to clinch the title .
" i thought , ' do i have it ?
do i have it ? " '
hamilton said after the race .
" and when they -lsb- the team -rsb- told me -lsb- on the in-car radio -rsb- , i was ecstatic . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : massa was just seconds away from overall victory .
hamilton 's win came at the expense of the local hero and ferrari hopeful felipe massa .
the brazilian , who won the race comfortably , thought he had pulled off the unthinkable in front of a raucous crowd in sao paulo .
" i had completely mixed emotions because by the time i had crossed the line , i was still the champion and then suddenly my engineer was telling me everything on the radio , " said massa .
the first of many ?
speculation abounds on just how many titles hamilton could go on to win .
he 's still just 23 years old , he 's at a competitive team -lrb- mclaren mercedes -rrb- and he 's proved himself to be an exciting talent behind the wheel .
germany 's michael schumacher holds the all-time record with seven world titles .
theoretically , hamilton could break this record , but there are many other gifted racers on the grid right now .
the competition is much tougher than it was when michael schumacher dominated f1 .
felipe massa nearly beat hamilton this year , and driving for ferrari in 2009 he will want revenge . ferrari also have the 2007 world champion kimi raikonnen in their other car , and there 's two time world champion fernando alonso - currently with the renault team - to consider as well .
a new generation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was vettel 's italy win also the first of many ?
there are also young pretenders to hamilton 's new crown , not least german driver sebastian vettel . the 21-year-old has completed his first full season with torro rosso , a low-budget team which has never really known success - at least not before it knew sebastian vettel .
in a slower car , vettel won the wet and wild italian grand prix , becoming the youngest race winner of all time in the process .
vettel moves up the ladder to the red bull team in 2009 , but his performances have been so impressive that many pundits expect " baby schumacher " - as german tabloids call him - to be sitting in a top car like ferrari , mclaren or bmw very soon .
the next big team ?
bmw is the other german factor which can not be ignored .
in just its third season in the sport , bmw has cemented itself as the third best team , just behind perennial front-runners ferrari and mclaren .
the team 's incremental improvements are part of a " four year plan " - bmw has met its targets in the first three years , and next year 's goal is to challenge for the championship .
polish driver robert kubica - who , like vettel , picked up his first ever race win this year - is likely to lead bmw 's championship charge , although his german teammate nick heidfeld will have other ideas .
the champagne may taste sweet for formula one 's youngest ever world champion lewis hamilton , but if this year 's finale was nail-biting , there could be even tougher challenges still in store . dw staff -lrb- msh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

lewis hamilton has become f1 's youngest ever world champion .
the british mclaren mercedes driver clinched the title by the skin of his teeth , beating rival felipe massa .
but how many more could hamilton win ? lewis hamilton snatched victory from the jaws of defeat at sunday 's brazilian grand prix , the last on the f1 calendar .
finishing fifth on the day , hamilton secured the formula one world championship thanks to an overtaking move less than 20 seconds before the end of the race .
germany 's timo glock elected to stay on the track on dry weather tires when the rain began to fall with minutes remaining in the brazilian grand prix , whilst the rest of the front runners flocked to the pits .
this gamble won glock fourth position on the track , but sebastian vettel and lewis hamilton , both on wet weather tires , were gaining fast .
so very close " i was on dry tires at the end of the race when it was raining quite badly , and it was just impossible on the last lap , " glock told reporters .
hamilton and vettel both passed glock with moments remaining , meaning hamilton finished in fifth position , just enough to clinch the title .
" i thought , ' do i have it ?

vettel moves up the ladder to the red bull team in 2009 , but his performances have been so impressive that many pundits expect " baby schumacher " - as german tabloids call him - to be sitting in a top car like ferrari , mclaren or bmw very soon .
the next big team ?
bmw is the other german factor which can not be ignored .
in just its third season in the sport , bmw has cemented itself as the third best team , just behind perennial front-runners ferrari and mclaren .
the team 's incremental improvements are part of a " four year plan " - bmw has met its targets in the first three years , and next year 's goal is to challenge for the championship .
polish driver robert kubica - who , like vettel , picked up his first ever race win this year - is likely to lead bmw 's championship charge , although his german teammate nick heidfeld will have other ideas .
the champagne may taste sweet for formula one 's youngest ever world champion lewis hamilton , but if this year 's finale was nail-biting , there could be even tougher challenges still in store . dw staff -lrb- msh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" recession is a real risk , for some countries , for the euro area , and for the eu , " european economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said . the overall gross domestic product gdp of the euro zone is expected to grow by only 0.1 percent in 2009 and by 0.9 percent in 2010 . the economy of the 15 nations that use the euro shrank by 0.2 percent in the second quarter of this year and is forecast to contract by 0.1 percent in both the third and fourth quarters . this would be the first time the euro zone will have entered recession territory since the euro was introduced in 1999 . europe 's engine at a standstill " the eu economy is hit by the financial crisis that deepened during the autumn and is taking a toll on business and consumer confidence " , almunia said . as a result , " the european growth engine is at a standstill , " he said . while they make for bleak reading , the eu 's 2009 figures are better than those of the united states and japan , whose economies are expected to shrink by 0.5 per cent and 0.4 per cent respectively . jeffery lacker , richmond federal reserve bank president , said that in other parts of the world , recession had most certainly kicked in .
" i think it 's definitely a recession at this point -lrb- in the us -rrb- .
how deep , how steep , and long it 's going to be is uncertain , " he said . but with officials in brussels stressing that their predictions are surrounded by " considerable uncertainty and downside risks " , almunia urged member states to rapidly adopt a common recovery program in order to avoid a prolonged period of economic decline . " national action is needed , and national action is much more efficient when it is coordinated with a common vision and a common discussion on who , when and how should strengthen investment decisions or fiscal policies or structural reforms , " almunia said . recession for the uk as others hit zero growth bildunterschrift : the leaders of europe 's largest economies will all struggle with impending downturns of the eu 's four biggest economies , britain is almost certain of facing a full-blown recession in 2009 , with its gross domestic product shrinking by 1 per cent .
germany , france and italy are all expected to post zero growth rates next year . and with europe 's economic locomotives all grinding to a halt , gdp in the expanding euro zone is set to grow by just 0.1 per cent in 2009 and by 0.9 per cent in 2010 . among the eu member states expected to feel the full pain of the downturn are its so-called " tiger economies " - ireland , estonia and latvia - which after recording double-digit growth rates over the last five years are now facing a lasting recession . spain , the eu 's fifth-biggest economy and formerly once of its strongest economic performers , is also set to tip into recession , with its economy shrinking by 0.2 per cent in 2009 before growing by a painfully slow 0.5 per cent in 2010 . new members reacting optimistically and only among the eu states which joined the bloc in 2004 and 2007 does the economic outlook seem more promising . slovakia , which is set to become the 16th country to adopt the euro in 2009 , will likely see its economy grow by 4.9 per cent , the best in the bloc ahead of romania -lrb- 4.7 per cent -rrb- and bulgaria -lrb- 4.5 per cent -rrb- . because tax receipts tend to fall - and public spending to increase - during times of crisis , the economic slowdown is also expected to worsen the budget deficits of many eu member states . france , which has already been cautioned by almunia , is expected to see its deficit hit the 3 per cent of gdp upper limit this year and to exceed this limit in 2010 . ireland , meanwhile , is already facing disciplinary action from the eu , with forecasts showing its budget deficit surging to 5.5 per cent of gdp this year and to 7.2 per cent in 2010 . worst still , the eu 's overall budgetary position is also set to deteriorate as a result of the various financial rescue packages being put into place by member states in order to counter the effects of the credit crunch , officials warned . and with unemployment also set to rise by a full percentage point to 8.1 per cent in 2010 , the only good news is likely to come from inflation , which is expected to fall rapidly to 2.5 per cent in 2009 after peaking in 2008 . banks reveal extent of crunch the grim economic outlook comes as europe 's top banks revealed how much they were being squeezed of profits by the credit crunch . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few banks have escaped the deluge of the financial crisis germany 's second-biggest bank , commerzbank , said monday it had lost 285 million euros and would seek an 8.2 billion euro -lrb- $ 10.5 billion -rrb- " stabilization " injection from the government and another 15 billion euro to secure financing . french bank societe generale registered an 83.7 percent drop in third-quarter net profit after being hit hard by the collapse of us lender lehman brothers . britain 's biggest home lender hbos plc reported it could lose as much as 5 billion pounds from risky assets and bad loans . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some states are forecasting a turnout of 80 to 90 percent .
that compares with nearly 60 percent in the 2004 presidential election , which itself was the highest participation rate since 1968 .
" we will get closer to 100 percent turnout on election day this year than ever before , " said doug chapin of electiononline.org , a non-partisan web site run by the pew charitable trust .
tens of millions of people have already taken to the polls in recent weeks for early or absentee voting allowed in 31 states , including key battlegrounds florida , north carolina , colorado and nevada .
as many as 40 percent of voters are expected to have voted before the election proper on tuesday .
the election stands to make history regardless of which candidate wins tuesday .
john mccain , at 72 , would be the oldest president to begin a first term , while barack obama , 47 , would become the first african-american president .
polls lean toward obama bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has the ascendancy , but mccain has pledged not to give up opinion polls continue to give obama a significant edge over mccain in the run-up to the general election .
the economic crisis , compounding george w. bush 's unpopularity , helped lift obama and his message of " change " from a race that was too close to call in august to a significant lead in opinion polls during the closing weeks .
an aggregate of major national polls compiled by realclearpolitics.com gave obama 50.7 percent to mccain 's 44.3 percent as of sunday night .
of those heading to polling stations early , registered democrats have outnumbered registered republicans in some states by 2 to 1 .
the closing pre-election poll of gallup-usa today published monday gave obama a lead of 11 points - 55 percent to 44 for mccain .
a new wall street journal-nbc news poll put obama ahead on 51 percent to 43 , while cnn 's latest poll on sunday had obama with a 53-46 percent edge .
mccain remains upbeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccain has warned against writing off his chances in the coming election but mccain 's campaign has vowed a comeback in the final days , pointing to polls that show as many as one in seven voters remain undecided .
" my opponent is measuring the drapes at the white house , " mccain said , as he wrapped up a frenzied day of campaigning with a midnight rally in miami .
" the mac is back .
and we 're going to win this election . "
in an election climate stacked against the incumbent republican party , both obama and mccain have promised change from what they call the failed policies of the last eight years .
" this is a defining moment in our history , " obama wrote in an article published in the wall street journal .
" tomorrow , i ask you to write our nation 's next great chapter ...
if you give me your vote , we wo n't just win this election - together , we will change this country and change the world . "
deciding factors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next president will inherit the quagmire of the war in iraq the next president will assume the mantle in january in the midst of two wars , an economy tail-spinning into recession and a global financial system on the verge of collapse .
mccain has leaned hard on his self-styled " maverick " image , unafraid to take on his own party in the us senate , while touting his 26 years in congress , military career and expertise in foreign policy as making him the safer choice .
obama has consistently sought to link mccain with the bush administration , and his campaign was given last-minute fodder when vice president dick cheney said he was " delighted " to support mccain in a weekend speech in wyoming .
both bush and cheney have been otherwise absent from the campaign trail .
the looming recession has become the dominant force in the race since september , overshadowing major foreign policy issues like the wars in iraq and afghanistan , iranian and north korean nuclear activities , and a resurgent russia .
fund-raising volunteers from both sides made millions of phone calls and knocked on millions of doors over the final weekend , while the campaigns made last-minute pleas for donations to mount massive television advertising .
obama 's campaign has been fuelled by an unprecedented fundraising prowess that comes mainly from small donors over the internet .
obama raised more than $ 600 million over the last 20 months , nearly twice as much as mccain , according to the federal election commission .
yet mccain 's campaign manager , rick davis , predicted that his side would outspend democrats by 10 million dollars in the final week . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

3 , miliband said no decision would be taken until after the united nations security council had met on the issue .
" we 're talking about the work of the 17,000 un peacekeepers there at the moment and the role of the european union in supporting that politically , diplomatically , and no-one 's ruling out a military role , " he told reporters .
un secretary general ban-ki moon has sent his deputy in charge of peacekeeping to the drc to investigate and report on an upsurge in violence .
aiming to avoid genocide " it will be for the united nations including eu countries in the un to listen to that report , " miliband said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miliband , center , arrived with french counterpart kouchner last week , miliband 's french counterpart bernard kouchner suggested mobilizing an eu battle group of up to 1,500 troops to provide humanitarian assistance for thousands of refugees displaced by fighting around the eastern city of goma .
subsequently , both ministers travelled together to the region .
" the world 's political leaders are determined to make sure there 's no repeat of the murderous activities of the 1990s , " miliband added , referring to the genocide in rwanda and civil war in eastern congo .
miliband said europe wanted to work to support the african union in seeking a political solution to the crisis .
oxfam calls for eu troops on sunday , nov .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the eu add to the un 's 17,000 congo troops ?
a ceasefire declared last week by rebels who took over parts of goma appeared to be holding , but prodhan warned the un peacekeeping force must be reinforced .
" given the fragility of the ceasefire and fears for another outbreak of intense fighting around goma , more troops must be deployed as soon as possible , " prodhan said .
of the 17,000 un peacekeeping troops in congo , only 850 of them are in goma .
speaking to reporters in dar es salaam on sunday , where he and kouchner held talks with tanzanian president jakaya kikwete , miliband said : " we agree that the monuc troops currently in the drc are inadequate given the size of the country . "
prodhan said the european troops could help create a secure environment for humanitarian agencies to help people who were in desperate need .
oxfam has began trucking water sunday to people sheltering in the area of kanyabayonga , north of goma , and is providing water and sanitation to 65,000 people in four displaced-persons camps in goma .

many are hiding in the forests and bush without access to shelter , water , food and medicines .
we need to be able to get there so that we can help them . "
meanwhile , congolese rebel chief laurent nkunda has threatened to drive the government from power unless it holds direct talks on his demands .
rebels want direct negotiations but the government of president joseph kabila moved quickly monday to reject the demand of the renegade general whose forces have beaten the army out of several towns in the east of the central african country , extending a decade of conflict which has seen more than three million people killed .
dressed in a green beret , military fatigues and dark sunglasses , nkunda accused the international community of failing ethnic tutsis in a meeting with reporters at his jungle base on sunday .
" we want direct negotiations with the government , i am waiting for an answer , " said the 41-year-old rebel .

3 , miliband said no decision would be taken until after the united nations security council had met on the issue .
" we 're talking about the work of the 17,000 un peacekeepers there at the moment and the role of the european union in supporting that politically , diplomatically , and no-one 's ruling out a military role , " he told reporters .
un secretary general ban-ki moon has sent his deputy in charge of peacekeeping to the drc to investigate and report on an upsurge in violence .
aiming to avoid genocide " it will be for the united nations including eu countries in the un to listen to that report , " miliband said .

subsequently , both ministers travelled together to the region .
" the world 's political leaders are determined to make sure there 's no repeat of the murderous activities of the 1990s , " miliband added , referring to the genocide in rwanda and civil war in eastern congo .

a ceasefire declared last week by rebels who took over parts of goma appeared to be holding , but prodhan warned the un peacekeeping force must be reinforced .
" given the fragility of the ceasefire and fears for another outbreak of intense fighting around goma , more troops must be deployed as soon as possible , " prodhan said .
of the 17,000 un peacekeeping troops in congo , only 850 of them are in goma .
speaking to reporters in dar es salaam on sunday , where he and kouchner held talks with tanzanian president jakaya kikwete , miliband said : " we agree that the monuc troops currently in the drc are inadequate given the size of the country . "
prodhan said the european troops could help create a secure environment for humanitarian agencies to help people who were in desperate need .
oxfam has began trucking water sunday to people sheltering in the area of kanyabayonga , north of goma , and is providing water and sanitation to 65,000 people in four displaced-persons camps in goma .

dressed in a green beret , military fatigues and dark sunglasses , nkunda accused the international community of failing ethnic tutsis in a meeting with reporters at his jungle base on sunday .

" i think it should be a more balanced relationship . "

" the world 's political leaders are determined to make sure there 's no repeat of the murderous activities of the 1990s , " said miliband , referring to the genocide in rwanda and civil war in eastern congo .
he said ministers were waiting for a un special envoy to the country to report back to the security council on the situation before deciding to mobilize an eu military mission . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 03.11.2008 germany 's army of temp workers may suffer amid cutbacks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german temp workers in a number of sectors face hard times the german government has advocated inexpensive temporary employment for years .
now , with the financial crisis affecting auto makers and other giant producers , tens of thousands of temp workers stand to lose their jobs . they are cheaper than their salaried colleagues .
they do n't get extra bonuses for christmas and vacations .
but most importantly , car makers and other manufacturers can get rid of temporary workers in a pinch .
" there are of course good people who you are sad to see go .
but it is the quickest and least bureaucratic way to cut the payrolls , " said ottmar zwiebelhofer , the head of a auto-parts maker koenig metall in the western state of baden wuerttemberg . his company makes airbags and car mufflers , so when car companies ' profits suffer , koenig metall feels the pain .
zwiebelhofer expects volume to drop by 20 percent this year .
pink slips abound it is a given that the first to lose their jobs in hard times are temp workers - and that 's not just the case at koenig metall .
auto supplier hella is n't renewing the contracts of some 200 of its temporary workers ; its competitor honsel is giving 100 temps pink slips .
at german car giant vw , thousands of temporary jobs are hanging in the balance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many workers hold the same temp job for years it 's not only short-term hires who are affected .
some workers have had their factory jobs for years , but continue to be officially employed and paid through a temp firm .
just a few weeks ago , many of them hoped to be taken over by the companies themselves .
but while metal-industry companies have been swimming in orders in the past years , the boon has n't translated into many employment contracts .
instead , companies have chosen to benefit from the flexibility of workers from temp agencies .
that system that is now turning on itself , said hartmut seifert , labor market expert for the union-affiliated hans-böckler-stiftung foundation .
" we know that there is a two percent quota of temporary workers .
but there are companies whose work force is made up of over 20 percent temps , " said siefert .
boom started with agenda 2010 the boom in temp agency work was started by the last german administration , a coalition of social democrats and greens that devised the agenda 2010 package of social reforms .
the watchword back in 2003 was " marketplace flexibility . "
since then , temp workers have been allowed to be in a job for more than one year - a ruling that was embraced enthusiastically by companies .
the government 's goal at the time was to use temp work to create more permanent employment , but things did n't work out that way .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : those in export industries , like cars , will be hardest hit instead , well known temp agencies like randstad , adecco and permacon were booking heavy profits , and looking desperately for qualified personnel .
in the last year alone , the number of temp workers in germany has doubled to 750,000 , even while unemployment figures have fallen .
those days are over , labor-market expert seifert said .
" it is entirely possible that a third of this number will lose their job in the next months . "
it 's not just the auto industry where temp workers face hard times . many temp workers are employed by companies in machine-making , pharmaceuticals and chemicals - industries that live from exports and could run into serious problems amid the world economic crisis .
less opportunity seen for temps temp workers " have a higher risk of being laid off .
they earn less than permanent employees , and have less access to further job training , " siefert said .
this means they have less opportunity to improve their chances at getting another job , he noted .
he believes temp workers should get a " risk premium " - in the form of higher wages - for taking so much risk in their employment .
while it may be small comfort for those who could lose their jobs in the coming months , the european union is trying to make the equation fairer .
new guidelines on temporary workers signed last week by the european parliament demand that temps get equal wages for equal work . manfred götzke -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" commerzbank , germany 's second-largest bank , said on monday it will help itself to a chunk of state aid , asking the government for 8.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.5 billion -rrb- in cash and 15 billion more in debt guarantees .
the move comes after commerzbank posted a third quarter loss of 285 million euros and an operating loss of 475 million euros .
the international financial crisis cost the bank 1.1 billion euros in losses from market operations , a statement from the bank said .
" in truth , we have not covered ourselves in glory here .
in future , we will have to improve , " commerzbank chairman martin blessing said in a statement .
shares in commerzbank shot up 6.8 per cent in early trading monday on news of the capital injection .
commerzbank made a deal with germany 's financial markets stabilization fund , or soffin , to accept a " silent participation " of 8.2 billion euros and the additional option of a guarantee for 15 billion euros in treasury bonds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commerzbank 's blessing : " we welcome the package " in late october , germany 's hypo real estate holding became the first private company to tap the government 's 500 billion-euro rescue package for financial institutions , which it offered in a bid to help them through the ongoing international credit crisis .
' we welcome the aid package ' commerzbank 's move was " to strengthen its capital base , " the frankfurt-based bank said on monday . the bank had a net loss of 285 million euros in the quarter after earning 339 million euros a year earlier .
" we welcomed the government 's aid package from the beginning , " blessing said in a statement .
" we 're using the instruments made available in the package because it is good for the bank , for its employees , and its customers . "
the capital infusion , in the form of a " silent participation , " means berlin will not become an active shareholder in commerzbank and the cash will go directly towards boosting the bank 's so-called tier1 , or core capital .
that means investors ' holdings will not be diluted in commerzbank , which can also use a capital increase as it is acquiring dresdner bank from the insurance group allianz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commerzbank is strained by its dresdner takeover the german government welcomed the move , saying it " strengthens the bank and protects shareholders and workers , as well as the german economy 's credit supply , " a spokesman for the german finance ministry , torsten albig , told ap news service in berlin .
deutsche bank refuses help the commerzbank announcement came just a day after its rival deutsche bank - germany 's largest lender - announced once more that it would not help itself to state aid .
on sunday , nov .
2 , deutsche bank chief josef ackermann reiterated that he had no plans to take advantage of a government rescue plan .
" under the current circumstances we will not participate , because we are strong , " said ackermann , whose bank last week reported a third quarter profit in spite of the current economic turmoil .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank 's ackermann has refused aid " we need a stable financial system , " ackermann said in an interview with german public broadcaster zdf .
" and those banks that are weaker should be strengthened as quickly as possible . "
the german bailout package , approved by parliament last month , involves 480 billion euros in debt guarantees and funds for injections of capital and purchases of illiquid assets .

some states are forecasting a turnout of 80 to 90 percent .
that compares with nearly 60 percent in the 2004 presidential election , which itself was the highest participation rate since 1968 .
" we will get closer to 100 percent turnout on election day this year than ever before , " said doug chapin of electiononline.org , a non-partisan web site run by the pew charitable trust .
tens of millions of people have already taken to the polls in recent weeks for early or absentee voting allowed in 31 states , including key battlegrounds florida , north carolina , colorado and nevada .
as many as 40 percent of voters are expected to have voted before the election proper on tuesday .
the election stands to make history regardless of which candidate wins tuesday .
john mccain , at 72 , would be the oldest president to begin a first term , while barack obama , 47 , would become the first african-american president .
polls lean toward obama bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has the ascendancy , but mccain has pledged not to give up opinion polls continue to give obama a significant edge over mccain in the run-up to the general election .
the economic crisis , compounding george w. bush 's unpopularity , helped lift obama and his message of " change " from a race that was too close to call in august to a significant lead in opinion polls during the closing weeks .
an aggregate of major national polls compiled by realclearpolitics.com gave obama 50.7 percent to mccain 's 44.3 percent as of sunday night .
of those heading to polling stations early , registered democrats have outnumbered registered republicans in some states by 2 to 1 .
the closing pre-election poll of gallup-usa today published monday gave obama a lead of 11 points - 55 percent to 44 for mccain .
a new wall street journal-nbc news poll put obama ahead on 51 percent to 43 , while cnn 's latest poll on sunday had obama with a 53-46 percent edge .
mccain remains upbeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccain has warned against writing off his chances in the coming election but mccain 's campaign has vowed a comeback in the final days , pointing to polls that show as many as one in seven voters remain undecided .
" my opponent is measuring the drapes at the white house , " mccain said , as he wrapped up a frenzied day of campaigning with a midnight rally in miami .
" the mac is back .
and we 're going to win this election . "
in an election climate stacked against the incumbent republican party , both obama and mccain have promised change from what they call the failed policies of the last eight years .
" this is a defining moment in our history , " obama wrote in an article published in the wall street journal .

if you give me your vote , we wo n't just win this election - together , we will change this country and change the world . "
deciding factors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next president will inherit the quagmire of the war in iraq the next president will assume the mantle in january in the midst of two wars , an economy tail-spinning into recession and a global financial system on the verge of collapse .
mccain has leaned hard on his self-styled " maverick " image , unafraid to take on his own party in the us senate , while touting his 26 years in congress , military career and expertise in foreign policy as making him the safer choice .
obama has consistently sought to link mccain with the bush administration , and his campaign was given last-minute fodder when vice president dick cheney said he was " delighted " to support mccain in a weekend speech in wyoming .
both bush and cheney have been otherwise absent from the campaign trail .
the looming recession has become the dominant force in the race since september , overshadowing major foreign policy issues like the wars in iraq and afghanistan , iranian and north korean nuclear activities , and a resurgent russia .
fund-raising volunteers from both sides made millions of phone calls and knocked on millions of doors over the final weekend , while the campaigns made last-minute pleas for donations to mount massive television advertising .
obama 's campaign has been fuelled by an unprecedented fundraising prowess that comes mainly from small donors over the internet .
obama raised more than $ 600 million over the last 20 months , nearly twice as much as mccain , according to the federal election commission .
yet mccain 's campaign manager , rick davis , predicted that his side would outspend democrats by 10 million dollars in the final week . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de us election -pipe- 03.11.2008 us election predicted to draw record numbers as world waits großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : head to head : obama and mccain face off in the most important us election in a generation after a frantic 20 months of rallies , debates and commercials in the most expensive presidential campaign ever , record numbers are expected to turn out for the most important us election in a generation . across the country , state officials are preparing for record turnouts and huge lines at polling stations , a testament to the massive interest that has been generated in an election widely considered the most important in recent memory .
some states are forecasting a turnout of 80 to 90 percent .
that compares with nearly 60 percent in the 2004 presidential election , which itself was the highest participation rate since 1968 .
" we will get closer to 100 percent turnout on election day this year than ever before , " said doug chapin of electiononline.org , a non-partisan web site run by the pew charitable trust .
tens of millions of people have already taken to the polls in recent weeks for early or absentee voting allowed in 31 states , including key battlegrounds florida , north carolina , colorado and nevada .
as many as 40 percent of voters are expected to have voted before the election proper on tuesday .
the election stands to make history regardless of which candidate wins tuesday .
john mccain , at 72 , would be the oldest president to begin a first term , while barack obama , 47 , would become the first african-american president .
polls lean toward obama bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has the ascendancy , but mccain has pledged not to give up opinion polls continue to give obama a significant edge over mccain in the run-up to the general election .
the economic crisis , compounding george w. bush 's unpopularity , helped lift obama and his message of " change " from a race that was too close to call in august to a significant lead in opinion polls during the closing weeks .
an aggregate of major national polls compiled by realclearpolitics.com gave obama 50.7 percent to mccain 's 44.3 percent as of sunday night .
of those heading to polling stations early , registered democrats have outnumbered registered republicans in some states by 2 to 1 .
the closing pre-election poll of gallup-usa today published monday gave obama a lead of 11 points - 55 percent to 44 for mccain .
a new wall street journal-nbc news poll put obama ahead on 51 percent to 43 , while cnn 's latest poll on sunday had obama with a 53-46 percent edge .
mccain remains upbeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccain has warned against writing off his chances in the coming election but mccain 's campaign has vowed a comeback in the final days , pointing to polls that show as many as one in seven voters remain undecided .
" my opponent is measuring the drapes at the white house , " mccain said , as he wrapped up a frenzied day of campaigning with a midnight rally in miami .
" the mac is back .
and we 're going to win this election . "
in an election climate stacked against the incumbent republican party , both obama and mccain have promised change from what they call the failed policies of the last eight years .
" this is a defining moment in our history , " obama wrote in an article published in the wall street journal .
" tomorrow , i ask you to write our nation 's next great chapter ...
if you give me your vote , we wo n't just win this election - together , we will change this country and change the world . "
deciding factors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next president will inherit the quagmire of the war in iraq the next president will assume the mantle in january in the midst of two wars , an economy tail-spinning into recession and a global financial system on the verge of collapse .
mccain has leaned hard on his self-styled " maverick " image , unafraid to take on his own party in the us senate , while touting his 26 years in congress , military career and expertise in foreign policy as making him the safer choice .
obama has consistently sought to link mccain with the bush administration , and his campaign was given last-minute fodder when vice president dick cheney said he was " delighted " to support mccain in a weekend speech in wyoming .
both bush and cheney have been otherwise absent from the campaign trail .
the looming recession has become the dominant force in the race since september , overshadowing major foreign policy issues like the wars in iraq and afghanistan , iranian and north korean nuclear activities , and a resurgent russia .
fund-raising volunteers from both sides made millions of phone calls and knocked on millions of doors over the final weekend , while the campaigns made last-minute pleas for donations to mount massive television advertising .
obama 's campaign has been fuelled by an unprecedented fundraising prowess that comes mainly from small donors over the internet .
obama raised more than $ 600 million over the last 20 months , nearly twice as much as mccain , according to the federal election commission .
yet mccain 's campaign manager , rick davis , predicted that his side would outspend democrats by 10 million dollars in the final week . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de us election -pipe- 03.11.2008 european press review : obama the better choice großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it 's time , " the economist 's cover said the economist is one of the latest influential publications to support democrat barack obama in the us presidential election .
dw-world takes a look at what it and other media have said in the campaign 's final hours . the british business weekly , the economist , has " wholeheartedly " endorsed barack obama , saying the democratic candidate has " clearly shown that he offers the better chance of restoring america 's self-confidence . "
the magazine admits it was disappointed that the john mccain on the campaign stump has been a weaker , more indecisive and more right-wing version of the john mccain who made a name for himself as a senator .
his choice of sarah palin as a running mate was the epitome of the " sloppiness " exhibited by candidate mccain , the economist says , writing : " it is not just that she is an unconvincing stand-in , nor even that she seems to have been chosen partly for her views on divisive social issues , notably abortion . "
rather , the magazine deplores the fact that mccain made his most important appointment after meeting palin only twice .
in contrast , the economist commends obama for running an exceptionally assured campaign .
" a man who started out with no money and few supporters has out-thought , out-organized and out-fought the two mightiest machines in american politics - the clintons and the conservative right , " the magazine opines , concluding that obama deserves the presidency .
the french paper dernières nouvelles d 'alsace from strasbourg conceded that for months now , europeans have only had eyes for barack obama .
" that 's because he stands for real change , but also because mccain wears the republican banner that - perhaps unfairly - puts him on equal footing with the incumbent president , " the paper wrote .
it added that what europeans are expecting is an end to the bush era , and an end to eight years of lack of understanding between the united states and the rest of the world .
the world would be better off with barack obama as the next us president , said the dutch de volkskrant newspaper in its weekend edition .
" everything points to the fact that diplomacy plays a far bigger role for him than it does for the incumbent president , and that he would handle it with far more aplomb , " the paper wrote .
it also echoed a popular european view that with obama in the white house , america would show the world a completely different face in every respect than it has with the much-vilified bush , or the respectable but somewhat rusty veteran mccain .
the luxemburger wort focused on the foreign policy tasks facing the winner of the election .
" the leader of the united states can and should give decisive impulses for peace in the middle east , for the future vitality of nato , for a new order of the world 's financial systems , and for the west 's energy security , " the paper said , adding that the president of the free world must also ensure that international terrorism is fought with the right weapons .
the german rhein zeitung commented that after eight disastrous years of the bush administration , it does n't really matter who becomes the 44th president - things can only get better .
whether the victor is obama or mccain , the " chief firefighter " will have several blazes to attend to , the paper wrote , adding : " he 'll have to repair his country 's damaged reputation worldwide , and give americans a new sense of optimism . "
finally , the swiss tages-anzeiger newspaper warned its readers not to put too much faith in national opinion polls which put obama ahead of mccain in the final hours of the campaign .
it said that the polls are treading exceptionally thin ice this year because the favored candidate is an african american .
" did white voters not want to admit to their prejudice and say they were supporting a black man , only to then choose the white candidate in the privacy of the voting booth ? " the paper asked .
and anyway , it continued , with the election likely to come down to a handful of swing states , a healthy dose of skepticism is justified . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world takes a look at what it and other media have said in the campaign 's final hours . the british business weekly , the economist , has " wholeheartedly " endorsed barack obama , saying the democratic candidate has " clearly shown that he offers the better chance of restoring america 's self-confidence . "
the magazine admits it was disappointed that the john mccain on the campaign stump has been a weaker , more indecisive and more right-wing version of the john mccain who made a name for himself as a senator .
his choice of sarah palin as a running mate was the epitome of the " sloppiness " exhibited by candidate mccain , the economist says , writing : " it is not just that she is an unconvincing stand-in , nor even that she seems to have been chosen partly for her views on divisive social issues , notably abortion . "
rather , the magazine deplores the fact that mccain made his most important appointment after meeting palin only twice .
in contrast , the economist commends obama for running an exceptionally assured campaign .
" a man who started out with no money and few supporters has out-thought , out-organized and out-fought the two mightiest machines in american politics - the clintons and the conservative right , " the magazine opines , concluding that obama deserves the presidency .
the french paper dernières nouvelles d 'alsace from strasbourg conceded that for months now , europeans have only had eyes for barack obama .
" that 's because he stands for real change , but also because mccain wears the republican banner that - perhaps unfairly - puts him on equal footing with the incumbent president , " the paper wrote .
it added that what europeans are expecting is an end to the bush era , and an end to eight years of lack of understanding between the united states and the rest of the world .
the world would be better off with barack obama as the next us president , said the dutch de volkskrant newspaper in its weekend edition .
" everything points to the fact that diplomacy plays a far bigger role for him than it does for the incumbent president , and that he would handle it with far more aplomb , " the paper wrote .
it also echoed a popular european view that with obama in the white house , america would show the world a completely different face in every respect than it has with the much-vilified bush , or the respectable but somewhat rusty veteran mccain .
the luxemburger wort focused on the foreign policy tasks facing the winner of the election .
" the leader of the united states can and should give decisive impulses for peace in the middle east , for the future vitality of nato , for a new order of the world 's financial systems , and for the west 's energy security , " the paper said , adding that the president of the free world must also ensure that international terrorism is fought with the right weapons .
the german rhein zeitung commented that after eight disastrous years of the bush administration , it does n't really matter who becomes the 44th president - things can only get better .
whether the victor is obama or mccain , the " chief firefighter " will have several blazes to attend to , the paper wrote , adding : " he 'll have to repair his country 's damaged reputation worldwide , and give americans a new sense of optimism . "
finally , the swiss tages-anzeiger newspaper warned its readers not to put too much faith in national opinion polls which put obama ahead of mccain in the final hours of the campaign .
it said that the polls are treading exceptionally thin ice this year because the favored candidate is an african american .
" did white voters not want to admit to their prejudice and say they were supporting a black man , only to then choose the white candidate in the privacy of the voting booth ? " the paper asked .
and anyway , it continued , with the election likely to come down to a handful of swing states , a healthy dose of skepticism is justified . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de formula one -pipe- 03.11.2008 hamilton takes first formula 1 championship in dramatic finale großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamilton triumphs in interlagos , after his shock defeat there last year .
lewis hamilton has become f1 's youngest ever world champion .
the british mclaren mercedes driver clinched the title by the skin of his teeth , beating rival felipe massa .
but how many more could hamilton win ? lewis hamilton snatched victory from the jaws of defeat at sunday 's brazilian grand prix , the last on the f1 calendar .
finishing fifth on the day , hamilton secured the formula one world championship thanks to an overtaking move less than 20 seconds before the end of the race .
germany 's timo glock elected to stay on the track on dry weather tires when the rain began to fall with minutes remaining in the brazilian grand prix , whilst the rest of the front runners flocked to the pits .
this gamble won glock fourth position on the track , but sebastian vettel and lewis hamilton , both on wet weather tires , were gaining fast .
so very close " i was on dry tires at the end of the race when it was raining quite badly , and it was just impossible on the last lap , " glock told reporters .
hamilton and vettel both passed glock with moments remaining , meaning hamilton finished in fifth position , just enough to clinch the title .
" i thought , ' do i have it ?
do i have it ? " '
hamilton said after the race .
" and when they -lsb- the team -rsb- told me -lsb- on the in-car radio -rsb- , i was ecstatic . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : massa was just seconds away from overall victory .
hamilton 's win came at the expense of the local hero and ferrari hopeful felipe massa .
the brazilian , who won the race comfortably , thought he had pulled off the unthinkable in front of a raucous crowd in sao paulo .
" i had completely mixed emotions because by the time i had crossed the line , i was still the champion and then suddenly my engineer was telling me everything on the radio , " said massa .
the first of many ?
speculation abounds on just how many titles hamilton could go on to win .
he 's still just 23 years old , he 's at a competitive team -lrb- mclaren mercedes -rrb- and he 's proved himself to be an exciting talent behind the wheel .
germany 's michael schumacher holds the all-time record with seven world titles .

lewis hamilton has become f1 's youngest ever world champion .
the british mclaren mercedes driver clinched the title by the skin of his teeth , beating rival felipe massa .
but how many more could hamilton win ? lewis hamilton snatched victory from the jaws of defeat at sunday 's brazilian grand prix , the last on the f1 calendar .
finishing fifth on the day , hamilton secured the formula one world championship thanks to an overtaking move less than 20 seconds before the end of the race .
germany 's timo glock elected to stay on the track on dry weather tires when the rain began to fall with minutes remaining in the brazilian grand prix , whilst the rest of the front runners flocked to the pits .
this gamble won glock fourth position on the track , but sebastian vettel and lewis hamilton , both on wet weather tires , were gaining fast .
so very close " i was on dry tires at the end of the race when it was raining quite badly , and it was just impossible on the last lap , " glock told reporters .
hamilton and vettel both passed glock with moments remaining , meaning hamilton finished in fifth position , just enough to clinch the title .
" i thought , ' do i have it ?

hamilton said after the race .
" and when they -lsb- the team -rsb- told me -lsb- on the in-car radio -rsb- , i was ecstatic . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : massa was just seconds away from overall victory .
hamilton 's win came at the expense of the local hero and ferrari hopeful felipe massa .
the brazilian , who won the race comfortably , thought he had pulled off the unthinkable in front of a raucous crowd in sao paulo .
" i had completely mixed emotions because by the time i had crossed the line , i was still the champion and then suddenly my engineer was telling me everything on the radio , " said massa .

vettel moves up the ladder to the red bull team in 2009 , but his performances have been so impressive that many pundits expect " baby schumacher " - as german tabloids call him - to be sitting in a top car like ferrari , mclaren or bmw very soon .
the next big team ?
bmw is the other german factor which can not be ignored .
in just its third season in the sport , bmw has cemented itself as the third best team , just behind perennial front-runners ferrari and mclaren .
the team 's incremental improvements are part of a " four year plan " - bmw has met its targets in the first three years , and next year 's goal is to challenge for the championship .
polish driver robert kubica - who , like vettel , picked up his first ever race win this year - is likely to lead bmw 's championship charge , although his german teammate nick heidfeld will have other ideas .
the champagne may taste sweet for formula one 's youngest ever world champion lewis hamilton , but if this year 's finale was nail-biting , there could be even tougher challenges still in store . dw staff -lrb- msh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

even with the tacit support of the left party , this would have left ypsilanti three votes short .
the four dissident members told a press conference in the state capital that they could not in good conscience support the plan , under which the spd and the greens were to form a minority government .
the left party had agreed to keep the coalition in power by supporting it in key parliamentary votes .
planned election cooperation in tatters bildunterschrift : ypsilanti was hoping that her plan would be a blueprint for a new national government some observers had seen ypsilanti 's plan to cooperate with the left party , which is made up of disaffected former spd member and former members of the east german communists , as a possible model for a federal government following next september 's general election .
but this may not be the case after ypsilanti failed in her second attempt to oust christian democratic union premier roland koch since last january 's state elections failed to produce a clear winner .
since then , koch 's cdu has been governing the state on a caretaker basis .
the left party is anathema to many western german voters due to their communist roots and the whole idea of cooperating with it has been hotly debated within the social democrats .
dissenters derail spd , anger party chairman bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muentefering was less than happy with the four rebels prior to the january state election , ypsilanti and the chairman of the federal party , kurt beck , had ruled out cooperating with the left party .
but they backtracked on the issue following the inconclusive outcome of the vote in hesse .
this was in part what forced beck to resign as party leader two months ago .
the man who has since replaced him , franz muentefering , has lashed out at the four dissenters in wiesbaden .
muentefering told reporters in berlin that they had chosen the worst possible point to make their intentions clear .
the coalition agreement was reached only after weeks of consultations between the spd and the green party . he said the federal party executive had received the news with a mixture of " shock and disgust . " muentefering also expressed confidence that events in the state of hesse would have no impact on september 's election , because the party had ruled out co-operating with the left on the federal level . dw staff -lrb- cp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

even with the tacit support of the left party , this would have left ypsilanti three votes short .
the four dissident members told a press conference in the state capital that they could not in good conscience support the plan , under which the spd and the greens were to form a minority government .
the left party had agreed to keep the coalition in power by supporting it in key parliamentary votes .
planned election cooperation in tatters bildunterschrift : ypsilanti was hoping that her plan would be a blueprint for a new national government some observers had seen ypsilanti 's plan to cooperate with the left party , which is made up of disaffected former spd member and former members of the east german communists , as a possible model for a federal government following next september 's general election .
but this may not be the case after ypsilanti failed in her second attempt to oust christian democratic union premier roland koch since last january 's state elections failed to produce a clear winner .
since then , koch 's cdu has been governing the state on a caretaker basis .
the left party is anathema to many western german voters due to their communist roots and the whole idea of cooperating with it has been hotly debated within the social democrats .

this was in part what forced beck to resign as party leader two months ago .
the man who has since replaced him , franz muentefering , has lashed out at the four dissenters in wiesbaden .
muentefering told reporters in berlin that they had chosen the worst possible point to make their intentions clear .
the coalition agreement was reached only after weeks of consultations between the spd and the green party . he said the federal party executive had received the news with a mixture of " shock and disgust .

" the talks will be held in the same manner as with michael ballack , " loew said .
the coach also plans further talks with ballack ahead of the forthcoming friendly international against england in berlin .
" we have agreed that we will speak on the telephone again this week , " he said , dismissing fears his authority could have suffered after it was decided to take no action against his captain following critical remarks made in a newspaper interview .

i regret that this led to the impression that i wanted to criticise joachim loew in his position as coach .

germany last month enjoyed 2-1 and 1-0 wins over russia and wales respectively in the qualifiers .
loew 's side is sitting top of group 4 with 10 points from four games .
however , the germany coach has found himself having to deal with disgruntled players , with the ballack and frings incidences coming soon after kevin kuranyi 's decision to walk from the stands during the clash against russia after failing to make the 18-man squad for the game .

even with the tacit support of the left party , this would have left ypsilanti three votes short .
the four dissident members told a press conference in the state capital that they could not in good conscience support the plan , under which the spd and the greens were to form a minority government .
the left party had agreed to keep the coalition in power by supporting it in key parliamentary votes .
planned election cooperation in tatters bildunterschrift : ypsilanti was hoping that her plan would be a blueprint for a new national government some observers had seen ypsilanti 's plan to cooperate with the left party , which is made up of disaffected former spd member and former members of the east german communists , as a possible model for a federal government following next september 's general election .
but this may not be the case after ypsilanti failed in her second attempt to oust christian democratic union premier roland koch since last january 's state elections failed to produce a clear winner .
since then , koch 's cdu has been governing the state on a caretaker basis .
the left party is anathema to many western german voters due to their communist roots and the whole idea of cooperating with it has been hotly debated within the social democrats .
dissenters derail spd , anger party chairman bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muentefering was less than happy with the four rebels prior to the january state election , ypsilanti and the chairman of the federal party , kurt beck , had ruled out cooperating with the left party .
but they backtracked on the issue following the inconclusive outcome of the vote in hesse .
this was in part what forced beck to resign as party leader two months ago .
the man who has since replaced him , franz muentefering , has lashed out at the four dissenters in wiesbaden .
muentefering told reporters in berlin that they had chosen the worst possible point to make their intentions clear .
the coalition agreement was reached only after weeks of consultations between the spd and the green party . he said the federal party executive had received the news with a mixture of " shock and disgust .

that compares with nearly 60 percent in the 2004 presidential election , which itself was the highest participation rate since 1968 .
" we will get closer to 100 percent turnout on election day this year than ever before , " said doug chapin of electiononline.org , a non-partisan web site run by the pew charitable trust .

" my opponent is measuring the drapes at the white house , " mccain said , as he wrapped up a frenzied day of campaigning with a midnight rally in miami .
" the mac is back .

in an election climate stacked against the incumbent republican party , both obama and mccain have promised change from what they call the failed policies of the last eight years .

obama has consistently sought to link mccain with the bush administration , and his campaign was given last-minute fodder when vice president dick cheney said he was " delighted " to support mccain in a weekend speech in wyoming .

obama raised more than $ 600 million over the last 20 months , nearly twice as much as mccain , according to the federal election commission .

lewis hamilton has become f1 's youngest ever world champion .
the british mclaren mercedes driver clinched the title by the skin of his teeth , beating rival felipe massa .
but how many more could hamilton win ? lewis hamilton snatched victory from the jaws of defeat at sunday 's brazilian grand prix , the last on the f1 calendar .
finishing fifth on the day , hamilton secured the formula one world championship thanks to an overtaking move less than 20 seconds before the end of the race .
germany 's timo glock elected to stay on the track on dry weather tires when the rain began to fall with minutes remaining in the brazilian grand prix , whilst the rest of the front runners flocked to the pits .
this gamble won glock fourth position on the track , but sebastian vettel and lewis hamilton , both on wet weather tires , were gaining fast .
so very close " i was on dry tires at the end of the race when it was raining quite badly , and it was just impossible on the last lap , " glock told reporters .
hamilton and vettel both passed glock with moments remaining , meaning hamilton finished in fifth position , just enough to clinch the title .
" i thought , ' do i have it ?
do i have it ? " '
hamilton said after the race .
" and when they -lsb- the team -rsb- told me -lsb- on the in-car radio -rsb- , i was ecstatic . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : massa was just seconds away from overall victory .
hamilton 's win came at the expense of the local hero and ferrari hopeful felipe massa .
the brazilian , who won the race comfortably , thought he had pulled off the unthinkable in front of a raucous crowd in sao paulo .
" i had completely mixed emotions because by the time i had crossed the line , i was still the champion and then suddenly my engineer was telling me everything on the radio , " said massa .
the first of many ?
speculation abounds on just how many titles hamilton could go on to win .
he 's still just 23 years old , he 's at a competitive team -lrb- mclaren mercedes -rrb- and he 's proved himself to be an exciting talent behind the wheel .
germany 's michael schumacher holds the all-time record with seven world titles .
theoretically , hamilton could break this record , but there are many other gifted racers on the grid right now .
the competition is much tougher than it was when michael schumacher dominated f1 .
felipe massa nearly beat hamilton this year , and driving for ferrari in 2009 he will want revenge . ferrari also have the 2007 world champion kimi raikonnen in their other car , and there 's two time world champion fernando alonso - currently with the renault team - to consider as well .
a new generation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : was vettel 's italy win also the first of many ?
there are also young pretenders to hamilton 's new crown , not least german driver sebastian vettel . the 21-year-old has completed his first full season with torro rosso , a low-budget team which has never really known success - at least not before it knew sebastian vettel .
in a slower car , vettel won the wet and wild italian grand prix , becoming the youngest race winner of all time in the process .
vettel moves up the ladder to the red bull team in 2009 , but his performances have been so impressive that many pundits expect " baby schumacher " - as german tabloids call him - to be sitting in a top car like ferrari , mclaren or bmw very soon .
the next big team ?
bmw is the other german factor which can not be ignored .
in just its third season in the sport , bmw has cemented itself as the third best team , just behind perennial front-runners ferrari and mclaren .
the team 's incremental improvements are part of a " four year plan " - bmw has met its targets in the first three years , and next year 's goal is to challenge for the championship .
polish driver robert kubica - who , like vettel , picked up his first ever race win this year - is likely to lead bmw 's championship charge , although his german teammate nick heidfeld will have other ideas .
the champagne may taste sweet for formula one 's youngest ever world champion lewis hamilton , but if this year 's finale was nail-biting , there could be even tougher challenges still in store . dw staff -lrb- msh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some states are forecasting a turnout of 80 to 90 percent .
that compares with nearly 60 percent in the 2004 presidential election , which itself was the highest participation rate since 1968 .
" we will get closer to 100 percent turnout on election day this year than ever before , " said doug chapin of electiononline.org , a non-partisan web site run by the pew charitable trust .
tens of millions of people have already taken to the polls in recent weeks for early or absentee voting allowed in 31 states , including key battlegrounds florida , north carolina , colorado and nevada .
as many as 40 percent of voters are expected to have voted before the election proper on tuesday .
the election stands to make history regardless of which candidate wins tuesday .
john mccain , at 72 , would be the oldest president to begin a first term , while barack obama , 47 , would become the first african-american president .
polls lean toward obama bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama has the ascendancy , but mccain has pledged not to give up opinion polls continue to give obama a significant edge over mccain in the run-up to the general election .
the economic crisis , compounding george w. bush 's unpopularity , helped lift obama and his message of " change " from a race that was too close to call in august to a significant lead in opinion polls during the closing weeks .
an aggregate of major national polls compiled by realclearpolitics.com gave obama 50.7 percent to mccain 's 44.3 percent as of sunday night .
of those heading to polling stations early , registered democrats have outnumbered registered republicans in some states by 2 to 1 .
the closing pre-election poll of gallup-usa today published monday gave obama a lead of 11 points - 55 percent to 44 for mccain .
a new wall street journal-nbc news poll put obama ahead on 51 percent to 43 , while cnn 's latest poll on sunday had obama with a 53-46 percent edge .
mccain remains upbeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccain has warned against writing off his chances in the coming election but mccain 's campaign has vowed a comeback in the final days , pointing to polls that show as many as one in seven voters remain undecided .
" my opponent is measuring the drapes at the white house , " mccain said , as he wrapped up a frenzied day of campaigning with a midnight rally in miami .
" the mac is back .
and we 're going to win this election . "
in an election climate stacked against the incumbent republican party , both obama and mccain have promised change from what they call the failed policies of the last eight years .
" this is a defining moment in our history , " obama wrote in an article published in the wall street journal .
" tomorrow , i ask you to write our nation 's next great chapter ...
if you give me your vote , we wo n't just win this election - together , we will change this country and change the world . "
deciding factors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the next president will inherit the quagmire of the war in iraq the next president will assume the mantle in january in the midst of two wars , an economy tail-spinning into recession and a global financial system on the verge of collapse .
mccain has leaned hard on his self-styled " maverick " image , unafraid to take on his own party in the us senate , while touting his 26 years in congress , military career and expertise in foreign policy as making him the safer choice .
obama has consistently sought to link mccain with the bush administration , and his campaign was given last-minute fodder when vice president dick cheney said he was " delighted " to support mccain in a weekend speech in wyoming .
both bush and cheney have been otherwise absent from the campaign trail .
the looming recession has become the dominant force in the race since september , overshadowing major foreign policy issues like the wars in iraq and afghanistan , iranian and north korean nuclear activities , and a resurgent russia .
fund-raising volunteers from both sides made millions of phone calls and knocked on millions of doors over the final weekend , while the campaigns made last-minute pleas for donations to mount massive television advertising .
obama 's campaign has been fuelled by an unprecedented fundraising prowess that comes mainly from small donors over the internet .
obama raised more than $ 600 million over the last 20 months , nearly twice as much as mccain , according to the federal election commission .
yet mccain 's campaign manager , rick davis , predicted that his side would outspend democrats by 10 million dollars in the final week . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the talks will be held in the same manner as with michael ballack , " loew said .
the coach also plans further talks with ballack ahead of the forthcoming friendly international against england in berlin .
" we have agreed that we will speak on the telephone again this week , " he said , dismissing fears his authority could have suffered after it was decided to take no action against his captain following critical remarks made in a newspaper interview .
loew is still hoping the chelsea midfielder will recover in time following foot surgery to play against england on nov .

i regret that this led to the impression that i wanted to criticise joachim loew in his position as coach .

germany last month enjoyed 2-1 and 1-0 wins over russia and wales respectively in the qualifiers .

the stimulus plan , announced by the ministry of strategy and finance , is meant to help avert a recession .
eleven trillion won is aimed at public projects and three trillion won is for tax cuts to encourage spending .
recent figures indicated that south korean 's third quarter economic growth reached a three-year low , as a wider global slowdown hit exports .
in light of the global slowdown the finance ministry said : " the korean government proposes policy measures to cope with these unprecedented challenges by announcing pre-emptive , decisive and sufficient counter measures " .
the government , amid fears of a repeat of the 1997-98 asian economic crisis , has been taking steps to increase liquidity .
on thursday south korea signed a currency swap deal with the us federal reserve , valued at $ 30bn .
and the country recently reduced its interest rate to 4.25 % from 5 % during an emergency meeting as a fillip to the economy .

fernando gomez , 35 , from hackney in east london , had been in the intensive care unit of homerton university hospital for more than a week .
a hospital spokesman confirmed he died from inhalation anthrax rather than cutaneous anthrax , which is contracted through the skin .
eight other people have been given antibiotics as a precautionary measure .
the health protection agency -lrb- hpa -rrb- said it was attempting to trace where the infected skins originated .
a hospital spokesman said his condition had deteriorated overnight and that he died on sunday afternoon .
flat sealed off the hpa has sealed off his flat in hackney and will examine his workshop this week .
its chief adviser , professor nigel lightfoot , said residents who lived near the flat or workshop were not at risk .
he stressed the risk of coming into contact with anthrax came from the making of animal skin drums not playing or handling them .
he said : " we are , however , keen to reiterate to all individuals who make drums from imported animal skins that there is a risk of coming into contact with anthrax and that they should ensure they are aware of this and take precautions to protect themselves when making these drums . "
the threat to the general public is very small and it is extremely unusual for anthrax to be transmitted from person to person .
the last death of this kind in britain was in 2006 when christopher norris , 50 , a craftsman from stobs , near hawick in scotland , died after inhaling anthrax .
mr norris made artworks and also musical instruments , including drums .
a fatal accident inquiry into his death is due to take place on 18 november at edinburgh sheriff court .

fernando gomez , 35 , from hackney in east london , had been in the intensive care unit of homerton university hospital for more than a week .
a hospital spokesman confirmed he died from inhalation anthrax rather than cutaneous anthrax , which is contracted through the skin .
eight other people have been given antibiotics as a precautionary measure .
the health protection agency -lrb- hpa -rrb- said it was attempting to trace where the infected skins originated .
a hospital spokesman said his condition had deteriorated overnight and that he died on sunday afternoon .
flat sealed off the hpa has sealed off his flat in hackney and will examine his workshop this week .
its chief adviser , professor nigel lightfoot , said residents who lived near the flat or workshop were not at risk .
he stressed the risk of coming into contact with anthrax came from the making of animal skin drums not playing or handling them .
he said : " we are , however , keen to reiterate to all individuals who make drums from imported animal skins that there is a risk of coming into contact with anthrax and that they should ensure they are aware of this and take precautions to protect themselves when making these drums . "
the threat to the general public is very small and it is extremely unusual for anthrax to be transmitted from person to person .
the last death of this kind in britain was in 2006 when christopher norris , 50 , a craftsman from stobs , near hawick in scotland , died after inhaling anthrax .
mr norris made artworks and also musical instruments , including drums .
a fatal accident inquiry into his death is due to take place on 18 november at edinburgh sheriff court .

fernando gomez , 35 , from hackney in east london , had been in the intensive care unit of homerton university hospital for more than a week .
a hospital spokesman confirmed he died from inhalation anthrax rather than cutaneous anthrax , which is contracted through the skin .
eight other people have been given antibiotics as a precautionary measure .
the health protection agency -lrb- hpa -rrb- said it was attempting to trace where the infected skins originated .
a hospital spokesman said his condition had deteriorated overnight and that he died on sunday afternoon .
flat sealed off the hpa has sealed off his flat in hackney and will examine his workshop this week .
its chief adviser , professor nigel lightfoot , said residents who lived near the flat or workshop were not at risk .
he stressed the risk of coming into contact with anthrax came from the making of animal skin drums not playing or handling them .
he said : " we are , however , keen to reiterate to all individuals who make drums from imported animal skins that there is a risk of coming into contact with anthrax and that they should ensure they are aware of this and take precautions to protect themselves when making these drums . "
the threat to the general public is very small and it is extremely unusual for anthrax to be transmitted from person to person .
the last death of this kind in britain was in 2006 when christopher norris , 50 , a craftsman from stobs , near hawick in scotland , died after inhaling anthrax .
mr norris made artworks and also musical instruments , including drums .
a fatal accident inquiry into his death is due to take place on 18 november at edinburgh sheriff court .

ipswich historic churches trust -lrb- ihct -rrb- has announced that a project to lower the bells in st lawrence church in the town will now go ahead .
the bells are believed to be the oldest ring of five bells anywhere in the world but they have been out of use after the church tower weakened .
four of the bells date from about 1450 and the fifth was added in 1480 .
ihct says no other church in ipswich had bells before 1500 , and the next oldest ring of five are believed to be at st bartholomew the great in smithfield , london , which date from 1500 .
exciting project dr john blatchly , chairman of ihct , described reaching the fundraising target as " very good news indeed " .
he said : " this is the most exciting project i 've worked on in suffolk . "
the public appeal was launched after the heritage lottery fund turned down an application for funding earlier this year .
the £ 62,000 was raised through donations from the public and grants from a range of organisations , including ipswich borough council and the suffolk guild of ringers .
the money will be used to build a new belfry , eight metres below the existing one in a sturdier section of the tower .
the work is expected to begin within weeks and the bells could be ready for use early next year .
st lawrence church , in dial lane , was reopened earlier this year after being converted into a community centre .

ipswich historic churches trust -lrb- ihct -rrb- has announced that a project to lower the bells in st lawrence church in the town will now go ahead .
the bells are believed to be the oldest ring of five bells anywhere in the world but they have been out of use after the church tower weakened .
four of the bells date from about 1450 and the fifth was added in 1480 .
ihct says no other church in ipswich had bells before 1500 , and the next oldest ring of five are believed to be at st bartholomew the great in smithfield , london , which date from 1500 .
exciting project dr john blatchly , chairman of ihct , described reaching the fundraising target as " very good news indeed " .
he said : " this is the most exciting project i 've worked on in suffolk . "
the public appeal was launched after the heritage lottery fund turned down an application for funding earlier this year .
the £ 62,000 was raised through donations from the public and grants from a range of organisations , including ipswich borough council and the suffolk guild of ringers .
the money will be used to build a new belfry , eight metres below the existing one in a sturdier section of the tower .
the work is expected to begin within weeks and the bells could be ready for use early next year .
st lawrence church , in dial lane , was reopened earlier this year after being converted into a community centre .

the work is expected to begin within weeks and the bells could be ready for use early next year .

ipswich historic churches trust -lrb- ihct -rrb- has announced that a project to lower the bells in st lawrence church in the town will now go ahead .
the bells are believed to be the oldest ring of five bells anywhere in the world but they have been out of use after the church tower weakened .
four of the bells date from about 1450 and the fifth was added in 1480 .
ihct says no other church in ipswich had bells before 1500 , and the next oldest ring of five are believed to be at st bartholomew the great in smithfield , london , which date from 1500 .
exciting project dr john blatchly , chairman of ihct , described reaching the fundraising target as " very good news indeed " .
he said : " this is the most exciting project i 've worked on in suffolk . "
the public appeal was launched after the heritage lottery fund turned down an application for funding earlier this year .
the £ 62,000 was raised through donations from the public and grants from a range of organisations , including ipswich borough council and the suffolk guild of ringers .
the money will be used to build a new belfry , eight metres below the existing one in a sturdier section of the tower .

three years ago he moved from his village to the city of surat in gujarat .
there he found work as a diamond cutter .
but demand for luxury goods has slumped in the west , and now there 's no longer enough work .
" financial conditions are n't very good back home , " he says , " but because of the market slowdown , i 'm not earning enough here .
" so now i 'm going back to the village to do farming . "
thousands of others like him - from glass blowers to leather workers - have found that their skills are no longer needed .
the west is no longer buying .
exporters are at the sharp end of india 's slowdown .
some are making good money thanks to the falling rupee - which makes their prices competitive overseas .
but others are closing down their operations as orders fall .
' some setbacks ' " there will be ups and downs , especially in the export trade , " admits finance minister , palaniappa chidambaram .
" one has to take the good and the bad in one 's stride . "
i do n't think it is right to say that jobs are being destroyed in this country " palaniappa chidambaram " there may be some setback in volumes .
but surely you can make up for it by widening your basket of goods , by going to different destinations , by getting a better price for quality ?
" there are a number of ways exporters can make up for the so-called setbacks . "
the government is at the centre of the battle over how the performance of the indian economy should be seen .
is the economy undergoing a mild slowdown , to a still robust 7 or 8 % growth ?
or is it experiencing the end of the boom years , with inflation high and jobs being lost ?
the answer depends to a great extent on what happens in the west in the weeks ahead .
election pressure months of stock market declines have killed the theory that india is insulated from the problems of the global economy .
the government now has to counter headlines of broker suicides and blue chip stocks that cost less than a burger .
jobs are a particularly sensitive issue .
the next general election is just months away .
the most high-profile lay-offs , by jet airways , were retracted within two days .
the civil aviation minister claimed the credit for persuading the company to reconsider .
last week , the industry body assocham -lrb- the associated chambers of commerce and industry in india -rrb- forecast heavy job loses in the days ahead .
it withdrew the report two days later , after the finance minister publicly disputed the notion that jobs are being lost . " l do n't think it 's right to say that jobs are being destroyed in this country , " says mr chidambaram .
" it 's the pace of creation of jobs which has slowed down … an economy in recession destroys jobs - an economy growing at 7 % does not . "
in public , company heads echo his optimism .
" they are worried , they are concerned , but they are confident also , " says the head of the indian merchants ' chamber , m n chaini .
the worry stems from uncertainty .
lending problems in these unprecedented times , even the head of the reserve bank admits he has difficulty figuring out what will happen next .
india 's financial sector has had little exposure to the toxic loans that sparked the credit crisis in the west .
but even so , its banks have become reluctant to lend money .
over the weekend , the reserve bank of india was forced to take action yet again to spur lending , after companies complained that banks were n't putting up any money for their projects .
the lack of credit is forcing firms to cut back their expansion plans .
even companies building the roads and tunnels that the country needs for its future growth are having to trim their ambitions .
" right now , i do n't think banks are ready to lend to large infrastructure projects , " says rupen patel of tunnelling specialist patel engineering .
" a lot of projects we 're not even bidding for , because the financial scenario is very uncertain . "
policy makers feel the problems wo n't really end , until they end in the west as well .
" you tell me - is the worst over in the us ?
i do n't know , " says the finance minister .
" but if the worst is over there , then i suppose we can conclude that the worst is over here . "
" there is some semblance of calm returning , " says duvvuri subbarao , governor of the central bank .
" the problem moving forward is more about the recession . "
the governor has just cut his growth forecast for this year - and if things get worse in the west , he admits he may have to do so again .
but for all the talk of recession , no one is actually expecting india 's economy to shrink .
few economists think the country 's growth will be under 7 % this year .
for the troubled states of the west , that 's a level of expansion that most no longer even dream of .

" it 's the pace of creation of jobs which has slowed down … an economy in recession destroys jobs - an economy growing at 7 % does not . "
in public , company heads echo his optimism .
" they are worried , they are concerned , but they are confident also , " says the head of the indian merchants ' chamber , m n chaini .
the worry stems from uncertainty .
lending problems in these unprecedented times , even the head of the reserve bank admits he has difficulty figuring out what will happen next .
india 's financial sector has had little exposure to the toxic loans that sparked the credit crisis in the west .
but even so , its banks have become reluctant to lend money .
over the weekend , the reserve bank of india was forced to take action yet again to spur lending , after companies complained that banks were n't putting up any money for their projects .
the lack of credit is forcing firms to cut back their expansion plans .
even companies building the roads and tunnels that the country needs for its future growth are having to trim their ambitions .
" right now , i do n't think banks are ready to lend to large infrastructure projects , " says rupen patel of tunnelling specialist patel engineering .
" a lot of projects we 're not even bidding for , because the financial scenario is very uncertain . "
policy makers feel the problems wo n't really end , until they end in the west as well .
" you tell me - is the worst over in the us ?
i do n't know , " says the finance minister .
" but if the worst is over there , then i suppose we can conclude that the worst is over here . "
" there is some semblance of calm returning , " says duvvuri subbarao , governor of the central bank .
" the problem moving forward is more about the recession . "
the governor has just cut his growth forecast for this year - and if things get worse in the west , he admits he may have to do so again .
but for all the talk of recession , no one is actually expecting india 's economy to shrink .
few economists think the country 's growth will be under 7 % this year .
for the troubled states of the west , that 's a level of expansion that most no longer even dream of .

three years ago he moved from his village to the city of surat in gujarat .
there he found work as a diamond cutter .
but demand for luxury goods has slumped in the west , and now there 's no longer enough work .
" financial conditions are n't very good back home , " he says , " but because of the market slowdown , i 'm not earning enough here .
" so now i 'm going back to the village to do farming . "
thousands of others like him - from glass blowers to leather workers - have found that their skills are no longer needed .
the west is no longer buying .
exporters are at the sharp end of india 's slowdown .
some are making good money thanks to the falling rupee - which makes their prices competitive overseas .
but others are closing down their operations as orders fall .
' some setbacks ' " there will be ups and downs , especially in the export trade , " admits finance minister , palaniappa chidambaram .
" one has to take the good and the bad in one 's stride .
i do n't think it is right to say that jobs are being destroyed in this country palaniappa chidambaram " there may be some setback in volumes .
but surely you can make up for it by widening your basket of goods , by going to different destinations , by getting a better price for quality ?
" there are a number of ways exporters can make up for the so-called setbacks . "
the government is at the centre of the battle over how the performance of the indian economy should be seen .
is the economy undergoing a mild slowdown , to a still robust 7 or 8 % growth ?
or is it experiencing the end of the boom years , with inflation high and jobs being lost ?
the answer depends to a great extent on what happens in the west in the weeks ahead .
election pressure months of stock market declines have killed the theory that india is insulated from the problems of the global economy .
the central bank boss says calm has returned to india 's financial markets the government now has to counter headlines of broker suicides and blue chip stocks that cost less than a burger .
jobs are a particularly sensitive issue .
the next general election is just months away .
the most high-profile lay-offs , by jet airways , were retracted within two days .
the civil aviation minister claimed the credit for persuading the company to reconsider .
last week , the industry body assocham -lrb- the associated chambers of commerce and industry in india -rrb- forecast heavy job loses in the days ahead .
