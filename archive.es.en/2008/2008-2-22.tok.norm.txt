the bundestag passed a law friday , feb .
22 , giving men a legal framework to establish paternity . the law approved by the german parliament allows a man to request a paternity test against the will of his alleged child 's mother and without needing to resort to a legal challenge , which would automatically sever his legal ties to a child whom - in many cases - he has spent years raising . proving that he is not in fact the child 's biological father now no longer necessarily terminates their legal relationship .
thanks to the new legislation , a man can retain paternity even if tests prove he is not a child 's biological father . no more secrets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the implications of a legal challenge are no longer as dramatic until now , men convinced they were not in fact the biological father of children they were raising were left with few options other than secret dna tests . according to german justice minister brigitte zypries , some 20,000 secret tests are taken every year .
but ultimately , they carry no legal weight , because the results are not recognized by courts , and the family is left burdened by knowledge it can do little about . zypries has described the new law as an attempt to stop this secret testing , by conceding fathers the same right to establish paternity as other family members . " this is a good day for all those men who have in the past struggled to escape the burden of financial responsibility , " said the christian democratic faction 's legal expert juergen gehb . peter schaar , the federal commissioner for data protection hailed the law as a " sensible balance serving the interests of the child , mother and father . " child 's best interests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secret dna testing has been a boom business criticism of the new law came from the opposition green and left parties , however , who argued that it failed adequately to protect the interests of the child . but supporters say the new law makes the child 's interests a top priority .
a court may rule against a paternity test if it decides that a child is emotionally or psychologically unable to withstand the potential effect . although there are no official figures , experts estimate that up to 10 percent of children are raised by men who are not their biological fathers . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the demand for an investigation was made by charles davies , a member of the uk liberal democrat party and the parliament 's budget control committee .
davies , who was among a handful of meps allowed to see the report , perused its contents under supervision and was forbidden from taking notes or making photocopies .
huge sums involved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corruption cases at eu institutions are a sensitive issue the eu 's anti-fraud unit , olaf , which routinely checks internal audits made by the eu 's various institutions , will now scrutinize the secret internal study to determine whether there was an abuse of public eu funds .
complied by the eu parliament 's internal auditor , the report analyses 167 payments made in 2004 and 2005 to meps ' assistants .
each member of the european parliament is granted 16,000 euros -lrb- $ 23,500 -rrb- a month to pay assistants .
while some assistants work in brussels , other staffers work in their mep 's own country .
parliamentarians pay their staff 140 million euros a year , about 10 percent of the assembly 's overall expenditure .
news agency afp quoted an unnamed eu deputy who said , " the auditor found proof that in some cases the listed service provider did n't even exist . "
citing another unnamed parliamentary insider , the news agency said the abuses amounted to almost 100 million euros .
davies told euobserver that his first reaction was " a degree of hysteria given the scale of the abuse that is taking place and given the fact that it has been kept secret . "
" a travesty of justice " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how transparent is the european parliament ?
davies , who contacted olaf about the report , called the decision to keep the report secret " absurd " and a " travesty of justice . "
" a parliament committed to openness and transparency has no right to try and keep secret details about how public money is used and misused .
and … we are talking about very large sums of money , " davies said .
though the eu parliament has not commented on the details of the report , spokeswoman marjory van den broeke said the audit confirmed that the remuneration system was " too complicated " and had become " very difficult to manage , both for the deputies and for the parliament 's administration . "
the european parliament 's secretary-general is now to propose a simpler system for hiring and administering staff , doing away with the current system which involves at least three different methods for meps to put together their team of assistants .
corruption a sensitive issue corruption cases at eu institutions are a sensitive issue after a scandal in the late 1990s brought down the entire european commission .
the commission and an assistant to an mep were charged with forgery . edith cresson , a former french prime minister who served as research and education commissioner in brussels from 1995 to 1999 , was accused of hiring a dentist from her home town as an advisor , despite being warned it was against eu rules .
the scandal eventually led to the collective resignation of the commission and its president at the time , jacques santer , in march 1999 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corruption -pipe- 22.02.2008 eu anti-fraud unit to probe parliamentary staff payments großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an internal report suggests that some eu parliamentarians have misused public funds the eu 's anti-fraud unit is to investigate an internal report compiled by the european parliament to see whether public funds were abused amid allegations of embezzlement and fraud within the organization . in what could become a major corruption scandal in the european union , a confidential report by the european parliament 's internal auditors says that some of the 784 members of parliament -lrb- meps -rrb- were employing family members while others had registered payments to firms which did not exist .
the demand for an investigation was made by charles davies , a member of the uk liberal democrat party and the parliament 's budget control committee .
davies , who was among a handful of meps allowed to see the report , perused its contents under supervision and was forbidden from taking notes or making photocopies .
huge sums involved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corruption cases at eu institutions are a sensitive issue the eu 's anti-fraud unit , olaf , which routinely checks internal audits made by the eu 's various institutions , will now scrutinize the secret internal study to determine whether there was an abuse of public eu funds .
complied by the eu parliament 's internal auditor , the report analyses 167 payments made in 2004 and 2005 to meps ' assistants .
each member of the european parliament is granted 16,000 euros -lrb- $ 23,500 -rrb- a month to pay assistants .
while some assistants work in brussels , other staffers work in their mep 's own country .
parliamentarians pay their staff 140 million euros a year , about 10 percent of the assembly 's overall expenditure .
news agency afp quoted an unnamed eu deputy who said , " the auditor found proof that in some cases the listed service provider did n't even exist . "
citing another unnamed parliamentary insider , the news agency said the abuses amounted to almost 100 million euros .
davies told euobserver that his first reaction was " a degree of hysteria given the scale of the abuse that is taking place and given the fact that it has been kept secret . "
" a travesty of justice " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how transparent is the european parliament ?
davies , who contacted olaf about the report , called the decision to keep the report secret " absurd " and a " travesty of justice . "
" a parliament committed to openness and transparency has no right to try and keep secret details about how public money is used and misused .
and … we are talking about very large sums of money , " davies said .
though the eu parliament has not commented on the details of the report , spokeswoman marjory van den broeke said the audit confirmed that the remuneration system was " too complicated " and had become " very difficult to manage , both for the deputies and for the parliament 's administration . "
the european parliament 's secretary-general is now to propose a simpler system for hiring and administering staff , doing away with the current system which involves at least three different methods for meps to put together their team of assistants .
corruption a sensitive issue corruption cases at eu institutions are a sensitive issue after a scandal in the late 1990s brought down the entire european commission .
the commission and an assistant to an mep were charged with forgery . edith cresson , a former french prime minister who served as research and education commissioner in brussels from 1995 to 1999 , was accused of hiring a dentist from her home town as an advisor , despite being warned it was against eu rules .
the scandal eventually led to the collective resignation of the commission and its president at the time , jacques santer , in march 1999 .
last year , three italian nationals , including a civil servant working for the european commission were charged with forgery , corruption fraud and forming a criminal organization . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bundestag passed a law friday , feb .
22 , giving men a legal framework to establish paternity . the law approved by the german parliament allows a man to request a paternity test against the will of his alleged child 's mother and without needing to resort to a legal challenge , which would automatically sever his legal ties to a child whom - in many cases - he has spent years raising . proving that he is not in fact the child 's biological father now no longer necessarily terminates their legal relationship .
thanks to the new legislation , a man can retain paternity even if tests prove he is not a child 's biological father . no more secrets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the implications of a legal challenge are no longer as dramatic until now , men convinced they were not in fact the biological father of children they were raising were left with few options other than secret dna tests . according to german justice minister brigitte zypries , some 20,000 secret tests are taken every year .
but ultimately , they carry no legal weight , because the results are not recognized by courts , and the family is left burdened by knowledge it can do little about . zypries has described the new law as an attempt to stop this secret testing , by conceding fathers the same right to establish paternity as other family members . " this is a good day for all those men who have in the past struggled to escape the burden of financial responsibility , " said the christian democratic faction 's legal expert juergen gehb . peter schaar , the federal commissioner for data protection hailed the law as a " sensible balance serving the interests of the child , mother and father . " child 's best interests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secret dna testing has been a boom business criticism of the new law came from the opposition green and left parties , however , who argued that it failed adequately to protect the interests of the child . but supporters say the new law makes the child 's interests a top priority .
a court may rule against a paternity test if it decides that a child is emotionally or psychologically unable to withstand the potential effect . although there are no official figures , experts estimate that up to 10 percent of children are raised by men who are not their biological fathers . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move has been prompted by concerns about motorists with cars that are not biofuel compatible . the german automobile association adac has warned that up to 1.5 million drivers will be unable to use the ethanol-richer gasoline , forcing them to switch to more expensive premium fuels when it is introduced . the government had based its plans on statistics from the german car industry which estimated that around 375,000 car owners would be adversely affected . environment minister sigmar gabriel has said on friday , feb .

" this is not just a question of whether the planned introduction of e10 gasoline blended with 10 percent ethanol will be compatible with millions of cars , " said peter meyer , the head of the adac .

the proposals to raise rate biofuel blending rates from 5 percent to 10 percent by 2010 had originally been welcomed . the christian democrats , currently in grand coalition with the social democrats , announced their opposition to the higher biofuel target on wednesday , saying that it would cost motorists with older vehicles an additional 150 million euros -lrb- $ 223 million -rrb- . the adac has also underlined that there could be other negative implications if germany takes this step alone , such as an increase of motorists tanking up in neighboring countries and the corresponding loss of tax revenue to the german government . potential problem for foreign visitors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hay fever sufferers and opponents of monocultural farming oppose biofuels foreign drivers may also not be sufficiently informed about any new blend and could inadvertently suffer motor damage , the organization warned . " this is not just a question of whether the planned introduction of e10 gasoline blended with 10 percent ethanol will be compatible with millions of cars , " said peter meyer , the head of the adac .

the bundestag passed a law friday , feb .
22 , giving men a legal framework to establish paternity . the law approved by the german parliament allows a man to request a paternity test against the will of his alleged child 's mother and without needing to resort to a legal challenge , which would automatically sever his legal ties to a child whom - in many cases - he has spent years raising . proving that he is not in fact the child 's biological father now no longer necessarily terminates their legal relationship .
thanks to the new legislation , a man can retain paternity even if tests prove he is not a child 's biological father . no more secrets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the implications of a legal challenge are no longer as dramatic until now , men convinced they were not in fact the biological father of children they were raising were left with few options other than secret dna tests . according to german justice minister brigitte zypries , some 20,000 secret tests are taken every year .
but ultimately , they carry no legal weight , because the results are not recognized by courts , and the family is left burdened by knowledge it can do little about . zypries has described the new law as an attempt to stop this secret testing , by conceding fathers the same right to establish paternity as other family members . " this is a good day for all those men who have in the past struggled to escape the burden of financial responsibility , " said the christian democratic faction 's legal expert juergen gehb . peter schaar , the federal commissioner for data protection hailed the law as a " sensible balance serving the interests of the child , mother and father . " child 's best interests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secret dna testing has been a boom business criticism of the new law came from the opposition green and left parties , however , who argued that it failed adequately to protect the interests of the child . but supporters say the new law makes the child 's interests a top priority .
a court may rule against a paternity test if it decides that a child is emotionally or psychologically unable to withstand the potential effect . although there are no official figures , experts estimate that up to 10 percent of children are raised by men who are not their biological fathers . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bundestag passed a law friday , feb .
22 , giving men a legal framework to establish paternity . the law approved by the german parliament allows a man to request a paternity test against the will of his alleged child 's mother and without needing to resort to a legal challenge , which would automatically sever his legal ties to a child whom - in many cases - he has spent years raising . proving that he is not in fact the child 's biological father now no longer necessarily terminates their legal relationship .
thanks to the new legislation , a man can retain paternity even if tests prove he is not a child 's biological father . no more secrets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the implications of a legal challenge are no longer as dramatic until now , men convinced they were not in fact the biological father of children they were raising were left with few options other than secret dna tests . according to german justice minister brigitte zypries , some 20,000 secret tests are taken every year .
but ultimately , they carry no legal weight , because the results are not recognized by courts , and the family is left burdened by knowledge it can do little about . zypries has described the new law as an attempt to stop this secret testing , by conceding fathers the same right to establish paternity as other family members . " this is a good day for all those men who have in the past struggled to escape the burden of financial responsibility , " said the christian democratic faction 's legal expert juergen gehb . peter schaar , the federal commissioner for data protection hailed the law as a " sensible balance serving the interests of the child , mother and father . " child 's best interests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secret dna testing has been a boom business criticism of the new law came from the opposition green and left parties , however , who argued that it failed adequately to protect the interests of the child . but supporters say the new law makes the child 's interests a top priority .
a court may rule against a paternity test if it decides that a child is emotionally or psychologically unable to withstand the potential effect . although there are no official figures , experts estimate that up to 10 percent of children are raised by men who are not their biological fathers . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the demand for an investigation was made by charles davies , a member of the uk liberal democrat party and the parliament 's budget control committee .
davies , who was among a handful of meps allowed to see the report , perused its contents under supervision and was forbidden from taking notes or making photocopies .
huge sums involved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corruption cases at eu institutions are a sensitive issue the eu 's anti-fraud unit , olaf , which routinely checks internal audits made by the eu 's various institutions , will now scrutinize the secret internal study to determine whether there was an abuse of public eu funds .
complied by the eu parliament 's internal auditor , the report analyses 167 payments made in 2004 and 2005 to meps ' assistants .
each member of the european parliament is granted 16,000 euros -lrb- $ 23,500 -rrb- a month to pay assistants .
while some assistants work in brussels , other staffers work in their mep 's own country .
parliamentarians pay their staff 140 million euros a year , about 10 percent of the assembly 's overall expenditure .
news agency afp quoted an unnamed eu deputy who said , " the auditor found proof that in some cases the listed service provider did n't even exist . "
citing another unnamed parliamentary insider , the news agency said the abuses amounted to almost 100 million euros .
davies told euobserver that his first reaction was " a degree of hysteria given the scale of the abuse that is taking place and given the fact that it has been kept secret . "
" a travesty of justice " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how transparent is the european parliament ?
davies , who contacted olaf about the report , called the decision to keep the report secret " absurd " and a " travesty of justice . "
" a parliament committed to openness and transparency has no right to try and keep secret details about how public money is used and misused .
and … we are talking about very large sums of money , " davies said .
though the eu parliament has not commented on the details of the report , spokeswoman marjory van den broeke said the audit confirmed that the remuneration system was " too complicated " and had become " very difficult to manage , both for the deputies and for the parliament 's administration . "
the european parliament 's secretary-general is now to propose a simpler system for hiring and administering staff , doing away with the current system which involves at least three different methods for meps to put together their team of assistants .
corruption a sensitive issue corruption cases at eu institutions are a sensitive issue after a scandal in the late 1990s brought down the entire european commission .
the commission and an assistant to an mep were charged with forgery . edith cresson , a former french prime minister who served as research and education commissioner in brussels from 1995 to 1999 , was accused of hiring a dentist from her home town as an advisor , despite being warned it was against eu rules .
the scandal eventually led to the collective resignation of the commission and its president at the time , jacques santer , in march 1999 .

complied by the eu parliament 's internal auditor , the report analyses 167 payments made in 2004 and 2005 to meps ' assistants .
each member of the european parliament is granted 16,000 euros -lrb- $ 23,500 -rrb- a month to pay assistants .
while some assistants work in brussels , other staffers work in their mep 's own country .
parliamentarians pay their staff 140 million euros a year , about 10 percent of the assembly 's overall expenditure .
news agency afp quoted an unnamed eu deputy who said , " the auditor found proof that in some cases the listed service provider did n't even exist . "
citing another unnamed parliamentary insider , the news agency said the abuses amounted to almost 100 million euros .
davies told euobserver that his first reaction was " a degree of hysteria given the scale of the abuse that is taking place and given the fact that it has been kept secret . "
" a travesty of justice " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how transparent is the european parliament ?
davies , who contacted olaf about the report , called the decision to keep the report secret " absurd " and a " travesty of justice . "
" a parliament committed to openness and transparency has no right to try and keep secret details about how public money is used and misused .
and … we are talking about very large sums of money , " davies said .
though the eu parliament has not commented on the details of the report , spokeswoman marjory van den broeke said the audit confirmed that the remuneration system was " too complicated " and had become " very difficult to manage , both for the deputies and for the parliament 's administration . "
the european parliament 's secretary-general is now to propose a simpler system for hiring and administering staff , doing away with the current system which involves at least three different methods for meps to put together their team of assistants .
corruption a sensitive issue corruption cases at eu institutions are a sensitive issue after a scandal in the late 1990s brought down the entire european commission .
the commission and an assistant to an mep were charged with forgery . edith cresson , a former french prime minister who served as research and education commissioner in brussels from 1995 to 1999 , was accused of hiring a dentist from her home town as an advisor , despite being warned it was against eu rules .
the scandal eventually led to the collective resignation of the commission and its president at the time , jacques santer , in march 1999 .
last year , three italian nationals , including a civil servant working for the european commission were charged with forgery , corruption fraud and forming a criminal organization . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bundestag passed a law friday , feb .

but ultimately , they carry no legal weight , because the results are not recognized by courts , and the family is left burdened by knowledge it can do little about . zypries has described the new law as an attempt to stop this secret testing , by conceding fathers the same right to establish paternity as other family members .

a second vw manager received a suspended sentence . two former vw executives were convicted friday , feb .
22 , in a bribery scandal that began some three years ago . klaus volkert , one-time leader of the volkswagen works council , was convicted of incitement to breach of trust and aiding and abetting it , as well as breaches of german labor law such as accepting improper bonuses and benefits . former volkswagen personnel chief , hans-joachim gebauer , was handed a suspended prison sentence on corruption charges . the trial was told that he sanctioned nearly 2 million euros -lrb- $ 3 million -rrb- in illegal payments to volkert after his boss had told him to " be generous " to the powerful labor figure . both volkert and gebauer say they plan to appeal the verdicts . dubious contracts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the company has been rocked by scandal the trial was one part of a broader investigation into claims that vw managers bribed labor leaders in exchange for support on policy . volkswagen says it did not discover until june 2005 that its funds were being spent on prostitutes and bribes for the head of the council , which is a legally-mandated body representing workers and salaried staff . volkert was accused of setting up a dubious contract between volkswagen and his brazilian mistress adriana barros , under which she received 400,000 euros without providing anything to volkswagen , europe 's largest carmaker , in return . allegedly , the couple received a further 290,000 euros for travel , hotel costs , shopping purchases and other " non-business-related activities . " ongoing trials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter hartz on trial this was the third trial related to the scandal , but the first time a jail sentence has been handed down . in january 2007 , former vw chief personnel officer peter hartz received a suspended two-year sentence and a 576,000 euro fine . he had admitted being the initiator of the abuse that saw nearly 2 million euros paid to volkert between 1995 and 2004 in an attempt to win union support for company decisions .
executives above hartz deny they knew about the practices . hartz testified at a court hearing that his seniors had no knowledge of the payments . under german law , works council leaders need to be consulted on major company decisions . another one-time vw works council member , ex-parliamentary deputy hans-juergen uhl , was fined 39,200 euros in june last year after admitting taking part in sex parties at company expense . the scandal originally centered on bribes from potential suppliers and the creation of dummy companies to secure lucrative contracts in india , angola and other nations , but it widened to include claims of prostitution , sex parties and illegally financed perks . the case has shone a revealing light on the cozy relationship between the company 's management and labor representatives . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move has been prompted by concerns about motorists with cars that are not biofuel compatible . the german automobile association adac has warned that up to 1.5 million drivers will be unable to use the ethanol-richer gasoline , forcing them to switch to more expensive premium fuels when it is introduced . the government had based its plans on statistics from the german car industry which estimated that around 375,000 car owners would be adversely affected . environment minister sigmar gabriel has said on friday , feb .
22 , that the measure to introduce a 10 percent blending rate would be torpedoed if the adac 's statistics proved to be correct . this is just the latest setback to the biofuel lobby .
critics have recently attacked the social and environmental cost of producing fuel from plants . ministry rechecking its facts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions of cars already run on the alternative fuel gabriel , a member of the social democratic party , told german broadcaster ard that his ministry had put the plans on hold a few weeks ago , so it could recheck the data .
the proposals to raise rate biofuel blending rates from 5 percent to 10 percent by 2010 had originally been welcomed . the christian democrats , currently in grand coalition with the social democrats , announced their opposition to the higher biofuel target on wednesday , saying that it would cost motorists with older vehicles an additional 150 million euros -lrb- $ 223 million -rrb- . the adac has also underlined that there could be other negative implications if germany takes this step alone , such as an increase of motorists tanking up in neighboring countries and the corresponding loss of tax revenue to the german government . potential problem for foreign visitors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hay fever sufferers and opponents of monocultural farming oppose biofuels foreign drivers may also not be sufficiently informed about any new blend and could inadvertently suffer motor damage , the organization warned . " this is not just a question of whether the planned introduction of e10 gasoline blended with 10 percent ethanol will be compatible with millions of cars , " said peter meyer , the head of the adac .
" the adac is also pleading for an honest assessment of all aspects of blending , including the overall ecological and social costs . " green groups have predicted that expanding the production of agricultural products such as corn , soybeans and rapeseed to make biofuels can lead to the destruction of ecosystems , increases in food prices and the dislocation of the rural poor . the world 's biggest carmaker , general motors , has , however , recently unveiled a system to create the biofuel from garbage - which would get around the environmental objections .

the bundestag passed a law friday , feb .
22 , giving men a legal framework to establish paternity . the law approved by the german parliament allows a man to request a paternity test against the will of his alleged child 's mother and without needing to resort to a legal challenge , which would automatically sever his legal ties to a child whom - in many cases - he has spent years raising . proving that he is not in fact the child 's biological father now no longer necessarily terminates their legal relationship .
thanks to the new legislation , a man can retain paternity even if tests prove he is not a child 's biological father . no more secrets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the implications of a legal challenge are no longer as dramatic until now , men convinced they were not in fact the biological father of children they were raising were left with few options other than secret dna tests . according to german justice minister brigitte zypries , some 20,000 secret tests are taken every year .
but ultimately , they carry no legal weight , because the results are not recognized by courts , and the family is left burdened by knowledge it can do little about . zypries has described the new law as an attempt to stop this secret testing , by conceding fathers the same right to establish paternity as other family members . " this is a good day for all those men who have in the past struggled to escape the burden of financial responsibility , " said the christian democratic faction 's legal expert juergen gehb . peter schaar , the federal commissioner for data protection hailed the law as a " sensible balance serving the interests of the child , mother and father . " child 's best interests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secret dna testing has been a boom business criticism of the new law came from the opposition green and left parties , however , who argued that it failed adequately to protect the interests of the child . but supporters say the new law makes the child 's interests a top priority .
a court may rule against a paternity test if it decides that a child is emotionally or psychologically unable to withstand the potential effect . although there are no official figures , experts estimate that up to 10 percent of children are raised by men who are not their biological fathers . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the amendments do not conflict with the basic principles of the republic , " gul 's office said in a statement .
earlier this month , turkey 's parliament , where prime minister tayyip erdogan center-right ak party has a big majority , voted to end the headscarf ban by 411 votes to 103 .
" the proposal to change the constitution has been approved .
i hope this will be the best for turkey and hope it is done in a spirit of tolerance and reconciliation , " parliamentary speaker koksal toptan said after the vote .
passions running high the headscarf has triggered strong emotions in turkey with the country 's old secular elite sharply at odds with erdogan 's ak party , which has islamist roots , over the issue .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erdogan 's wife emine , seen here with a security official , wears the headscarf erdogan 's party says the headscarf ban is an unfair denial of individual rights and religious liberty and discriminates against women .
almost two thirds of women in turkey cover their heads .
erdogan 's wife and daughters wear the headscarf as do those of president abdullah gul and many other members of the ak party .
turkey 's old secular elite , who see themselves as upholders of modern turkey 's founding father , mustafa kemal ataturk 's secular legacy , strongly oppose the lifting of the ban on the headscarf .
they see it as a slow slide towards an islamist state .
the issue has sparked huge demonstrations by secularists on the streets of the capital ankara in recent weeks .
" turkey is secular and will remain secular , " shouted some demonstrators earlier in the month during protests .
a majority of the demonstrators , who were waving the red and white star and crescent flag of turkey and bearing portraits of mustafa kemal ataturk , were women , including some who wore headscarves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secularist groups protested in large numbers in ankara some were wearing headbands that read " we are following your oath " along with pictures of ataturk , who set up the republic in 1923 on the strict separation of state and religion .
the headscarf ban in turkey dates back to the 1980s .
it was tightened in 1997 when the country 's powerful army , with public support , ousted a government they considered too islamist .
opinion polls however show that a majority of turks are in favor of easing the ban .

after a reported 10,000 turkish troops crossed into iraq thursday evening in an effort to destroy kurdish rebel bases in the mountainous region , the eu urged turkey to exercise restraint and respect iraq 's border . " we understand the concerns of turkey , " said eu foreign policy chief javier solana at the conclusion of a meeting of eu defense ministers in brdo , slovenia . both the eu and the us list the kurdish workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- as a terrorist group .
the eu , however , also does not want to see any action that might further destabilize iraq . " we think that this action in iraq is not the best response , " said solana .
" the territorial integrity of iraq is for us very , very important . meanwhile , back at eu headquarters in brussels , spokeswomen krisztina nagy warned turkey against " disproportionate military action " but said ankara had a right to protect its people from terror . un also concerned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary general ban ki-moon appealed for restraint un secretary general ban ki-moon also called for restraint and respect of iraq 's borders . " while conscious of turkey 's concerns , -lsb- ban -rsb- reiterates his appeal for utmost restraint , and for respect of the international borders between iraq and turkey , " ban 's spokesman farhan haq said . " he also repeats his previous calls for an immediate end to continued incursions by pkk elements carrying out terrorist attacks from northern iraq , " haq said . the turkish troops ' ground incursion into iraq is the first confirmed operation of that kind since the us-led strike that toppled saddam hussein in 2003 . a " limited " operation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turkish-iraqi border has long been a cause for concern turkish soldiers crossed the border on thursday evening after a day of air and artillery attacks on suspected pkk targets in iraq , the general staff announced in a statement posted on its official website . the statement said the operation would be limited and that the troops would return to turkey in the " shortest time possible . " the ntv private television station reported that 10,000 had crossed the border . " this operation 's target is the pkk terrorist organization , " the statement said .
" it is a continuity of the air operations that have been carried out .
civilians and local elements who do not show hostility to turkish forces will not be negatively affected by this operation . " the military statement said the aim of the operation was to stop the pkk from using mountainous northern iraq as a base from which to launch attacks on turkey .
the general staff has previously estimated that there are around 4,000 to 5,000 pkk guerrillas based in northern iraq . respecting international law bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the moment , the border region is still covered with heavy snow more than 32,000 people have been killed since 1984 when the pkk launched its fight for independence or autonomy for the mainly kurdish-populated south-east part of turkey . germany is watching the turkish incursion into northern iraq with concern and is worried about possible escalation , a spokesman for the foreign ministry said in berlin on friday . the presence of turkish troops in northern iraq represented a " not inconsiderable risk of destabilization , " martin jaeger said . " we call on the turkish government in its fight against terrorism to reduce its steps to the minimum to protect its own people , " jaeger said . he warned against the possibility of escalation and said that international law had to be respected . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

22 , in a bribery scandal that began some three years ago . klaus volkert , one-time leader of the volkswagen works council , was convicted of incitement to breach of trust and aiding and abetting it , as well as breaches of german labor law such as accepting improper bonuses and benefits . former volkswagen personnel chief , hans-joachim gebauer , was handed a suspended prison sentence on corruption charges . the trial was told that he sanctioned nearly 2 million euros -lrb- $ 3 million -rrb- in illegal payments to volkert after his boss had told him to " be generous " to the powerful labor figure . both volkert and gebauer say they plan to appeal the verdicts . dubious contracts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the company has been rocked by scandal the trial was one part of a broader investigation into claims that vw managers bribed labor leaders in exchange for support on policy . volkswagen says it did not discover until june 2005 that its funds were being spent on prostitutes and bribes for the head of the council , which is a legally-mandated body representing workers and salaried staff . volkert was accused of setting up a dubious contract between volkswagen and his brazilian mistress adriana barros , under which she received 400,000 euros without providing anything to volkswagen , europe 's largest carmaker , in return . allegedly , the couple received a further 290,000 euros for travel , hotel costs , shopping purchases and other " non-business-related activities . " ongoing trials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter hartz on trial this was the third trial related to the scandal , but the first time a jail sentence has been handed down . in january 2007 , former vw chief personnel officer peter hartz received a suspended two-year sentence and a 576,000 euro fine . he had admitted being the initiator of the abuse that saw nearly 2 million euros paid to volkert between 1995 and 2004 in an attempt to win union support for company decisions .
executives above hartz deny they knew about the practices . hartz testified at a court hearing that his seniors had no knowledge of the payments . under german law , works council leaders need to be consulted on major company decisions . another one-time vw works council member , ex-parliamentary deputy hans-juergen uhl , was fined 39,200 euros in june last year after admitting taking part in sex parties at company expense . the scandal originally centered on bribes from potential suppliers and the creation of dummy companies to secure lucrative contracts in india , angola and other nations , but it widened to include claims of prostitution , sex parties and illegally financed perks . the case has shone a revealing light on the cozy relationship between the company 's management and labor representatives . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bundestag passed a law friday , feb .
22 , giving men a legal framework to establish paternity . the law approved by the german parliament allows a man to request a paternity test against the will of his alleged child 's mother and without needing to resort to a legal challenge , which would automatically sever his legal ties to a child whom - in many cases - he has spent years raising . proving that he is not in fact the child 's biological father now no longer necessarily terminates their legal relationship .
thanks to the new legislation , a man can retain paternity even if tests prove he is not a child 's biological father . no more secrets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the implications of a legal challenge are no longer as dramatic until now , men convinced they were not in fact the biological father of children they were raising were left with few options other than secret dna tests . according to german justice minister brigitte zypries , some 20,000 secret tests are taken every year .
but ultimately , they carry no legal weight , because the results are not recognized by courts , and the family is left burdened by knowledge it can do little about . zypries has described the new law as an attempt to stop this secret testing , by conceding fathers the same right to establish paternity as other family members . " this is a good day for all those men who have in the past struggled to escape the burden of financial responsibility , " said the christian democratic faction 's legal expert juergen gehb . peter schaar , the federal commissioner for data protection hailed the law as a " sensible balance serving the interests of the child , mother and father . " child 's best interests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secret dna testing has been a boom business criticism of the new law came from the opposition green and left parties , however , who argued that it failed adequately to protect the interests of the child . but supporters say the new law makes the child 's interests a top priority .
a court may rule against a paternity test if it decides that a child is emotionally or psychologically unable to withstand the potential effect . although there are no official figures , experts estimate that up to 10 percent of children are raised by men who are not their biological fathers . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bundestag passed a law friday , feb .
22 , giving men a legal framework to establish paternity . the law approved by the german parliament allows a man to request a paternity test against the will of his alleged child 's mother and without needing to resort to a legal challenge , which would automatically sever his legal ties to a child whom - in many cases - he has spent years raising . proving that he is not in fact the child 's biological father now no longer necessarily terminates their legal relationship .

but ultimately , they carry no legal weight , because the results are not recognized by courts , and the family is left burdened by knowledge it can do little about . zypries has described the new law as an attempt to stop this secret testing , by conceding fathers the same right to establish paternity as other family members . " this is a good day for all those men who have in the past struggled to escape the burden of financial responsibility , " said the christian democratic faction 's legal expert juergen gehb . peter schaar , the federal commissioner for data protection hailed the law as a " sensible balance serving the interests of the child , mother and father .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corruption -pipe- 22.02.2008 eu anti-fraud unit to probe parliamentary staff payments großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an internal report suggests that some eu parliamentarians have misused public funds the eu 's anti-fraud unit is to investigate an internal report compiled by the european parliament to see whether public funds were abused amid allegations of embezzlement and fraud within the organization . in what could become a major corruption scandal in the european union , a confidential report by the european parliament 's internal auditors says that some of the 784 members of parliament -lrb- meps -rrb- were employing family members while others had registered payments to firms which did not exist .
the demand for an investigation was made by charles davies , a member of the uk liberal democrat party and the parliament 's budget control committee .
davies , who was among a handful of meps allowed to see the report , perused its contents under supervision and was forbidden from taking notes or making photocopies .
huge sums involved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corruption cases at eu institutions are a sensitive issue the eu 's anti-fraud unit , olaf , which routinely checks internal audits made by the eu 's various institutions , will now scrutinize the secret internal study to determine whether there was an abuse of public eu funds .
complied by the eu parliament 's internal auditor , the report analyses 167 payments made in 2004 and 2005 to meps ' assistants .
each member of the european parliament is granted 16,000 euros -lrb- $ 23,500 -rrb- a month to pay assistants .
while some assistants work in brussels , other staffers work in their mep 's own country .
parliamentarians pay their staff 140 million euros a year , about 10 percent of the assembly 's overall expenditure .
news agency afp quoted an unnamed eu deputy who said , " the auditor found proof that in some cases the listed service provider did n't even exist . "
citing another unnamed parliamentary insider , the news agency said the abuses amounted to almost 100 million euros .
davies told euobserver that his first reaction was " a degree of hysteria given the scale of the abuse that is taking place and given the fact that it has been kept secret . "
" a travesty of justice " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how transparent is the european parliament ?
davies , who contacted olaf about the report , called the decision to keep the report secret " absurd " and a " travesty of justice . "
" a parliament committed to openness and transparency has no right to try and keep secret details about how public money is used and misused .
and … we are talking about very large sums of money , " davies said .
though the eu parliament has not commented on the details of the report , spokeswoman marjory van den broeke said the audit confirmed that the remuneration system was " too complicated " and had become " very difficult to manage , both for the deputies and for the parliament 's administration . "
the european parliament 's secretary-general is now to propose a simpler system for hiring and administering staff , doing away with the current system which involves at least three different methods for meps to put together their team of assistants .
corruption a sensitive issue corruption cases at eu institutions are a sensitive issue after a scandal in the late 1990s brought down the entire european commission .
the commission and an assistant to an mep were charged with forgery . edith cresson , a former french prime minister who served as research and education commissioner in brussels from 1995 to 1999 , was accused of hiring a dentist from her home town as an advisor , despite being warned it was against eu rules .
the scandal eventually led to the collective resignation of the commission and its president at the time , jacques santer , in march 1999 .
last year , three italian nationals , including a civil servant working for the european commission were charged with forgery , corruption fraud and forming a criminal organization . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move has been prompted by concerns about motorists with cars that are not biofuel compatible . the german automobile association adac has warned that up to 1.5 million drivers will be unable to use the ethanol-richer gasoline , forcing them to switch to more expensive premium fuels when it is introduced . the government had based its plans on statistics from the german car industry which estimated that around 375,000 car owners would be adversely affected . environment minister sigmar gabriel has said on friday , feb .
22 , that the measure to introduce a 10 percent blending rate would be torpedoed if the adac 's statistics proved to be correct . this is just the latest setback to the biofuel lobby .
critics have recently attacked the social and environmental cost of producing fuel from plants . ministry rechecking its facts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions of cars already run on the alternative fuel gabriel , a member of the social democratic party , told german broadcaster ard that his ministry had put the plans on hold a few weeks ago , so it could recheck the data .
the proposals to raise rate biofuel blending rates from 5 percent to 10 percent by 2010 had originally been welcomed . the christian democrats , currently in grand coalition with the social democrats , announced their opposition to the higher biofuel target on wednesday , saying that it would cost motorists with older vehicles an additional 150 million euros -lrb- $ 223 million -rrb- . the adac has also underlined that there could be other negative implications if germany takes this step alone , such as an increase of motorists tanking up in neighboring countries and the corresponding loss of tax revenue to the german government . potential problem for foreign visitors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hay fever sufferers and opponents of monocultural farming oppose biofuels foreign drivers may also not be sufficiently informed about any new blend and could inadvertently suffer motor damage , the organization warned . " this is not just a question of whether the planned introduction of e10 gasoline blended with 10 percent ethanol will be compatible with millions of cars , " said peter meyer , the head of the adac .
" the adac is also pleading for an honest assessment of all aspects of blending , including the overall ecological and social costs . " green groups have predicted that expanding the production of agricultural products such as corn , soybeans and rapeseed to make biofuels can lead to the destruction of ecosystems , increases in food prices and the dislocation of the rural poor . the world 's biggest carmaker , general motors , has , however , recently unveiled a system to create the biofuel from garbage - which would get around the environmental objections .

22 , in a bribery scandal that began some three years ago . klaus volkert , one-time leader of the volkswagen works council , was convicted of incitement to breach of trust and aiding and abetting it , as well as breaches of german labor law such as accepting improper bonuses and benefits . former volkswagen personnel chief , hans-joachim gebauer , was handed a suspended prison sentence on corruption charges . the trial was told that he sanctioned nearly 2 million euros -lrb- $ 3 million -rrb- in illegal payments to volkert after his boss had told him to " be generous " to the powerful labor figure . both volkert and gebauer say they plan to appeal the verdicts . dubious contracts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the company has been rocked by scandal the trial was one part of a broader investigation into claims that vw managers bribed labor leaders in exchange for support on policy . volkswagen says it did not discover until june 2005 that its funds were being spent on prostitutes and bribes for the head of the council , which is a legally-mandated body representing workers and salaried staff . volkert was accused of setting up a dubious contract between volkswagen and his brazilian mistress adriana barros , under which she received 400,000 euros without providing anything to volkswagen , europe 's largest carmaker , in return . allegedly , the couple received a further 290,000 euros for travel , hotel costs , shopping purchases and other " non-business-related activities . " ongoing trials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter hartz on trial this was the third trial related to the scandal , but the first time a jail sentence has been handed down . in january 2007 , former vw chief personnel officer peter hartz received a suspended two-year sentence and a 576,000 euro fine . he had admitted being the initiator of the abuse that saw nearly 2 million euros paid to volkert between 1995 and 2004 in an attempt to win union support for company decisions .
executives above hartz deny they knew about the practices . hartz testified at a court hearing that his seniors had no knowledge of the payments . under german law , works council leaders need to be consulted on major company decisions . another one-time vw works council member , ex-parliamentary deputy hans-juergen uhl , was fined 39,200 euros in june last year after admitting taking part in sex parties at company expense . the scandal originally centered on bribes from potential suppliers and the creation of dummy companies to secure lucrative contracts in india , angola and other nations , but it widened to include claims of prostitution , sex parties and illegally financed perks . the case has shone a revealing light on the cozy relationship between the company 's management and labor representatives . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the demand for an investigation was made by charles davies , a member of the uk liberal democrat party and the parliament 's budget control committee .
davies , who was among a handful of meps allowed to see the report , perused its contents under supervision and was forbidden from taking notes or making photocopies .

complied by the eu parliament 's internal auditor , the report analyses 167 payments made in 2004 and 2005 to meps ' assistants .
each member of the european parliament is granted 16,000 euros -lrb- $ 23,500 -rrb- a month to pay assistants .
while some assistants work in brussels , other staffers work in their mep 's own country .

and … we are talking about very large sums of money , " davies said .
though the eu parliament has not commented on the details of the report , spokeswoman marjory van den broeke said the audit confirmed that the remuneration system was " too complicated " and had become " very difficult to manage , both for the deputies and for the parliament 's administration . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 22.02.2008 german government could jettison higher biofuel target großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are worries about the cost of blended gas for german motorists the german government has said it might scrap plans for a 5 percent rise in the amount of biofuel added to gasoline .
the move has been prompted by concerns about motorists with cars that are not biofuel compatible . the german automobile association adac has warned that up to 1.5 million drivers will be unable to use the ethanol-richer gasoline , forcing them to switch to more expensive premium fuels when it is introduced . the government had based its plans on statistics from the german car industry which estimated that around 375,000 car owners would be adversely affected . environment minister sigmar gabriel has said on friday , feb .
22 , that the measure to introduce a 10 percent blending rate would be torpedoed if the adac 's statistics proved to be correct . this is just the latest setback to the biofuel lobby .
critics have recently attacked the social and environmental cost of producing fuel from plants . ministry rechecking its facts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions of cars already run on the alternative fuel gabriel , a member of the social democratic party , told german broadcaster ard that his ministry had put the plans on hold a few weeks ago , so it could recheck the data .
the proposals to raise rate biofuel blending rates from 5 percent to 10 percent by 2010 had originally been welcomed . the christian democrats , currently in grand coalition with the social democrats , announced their opposition to the higher biofuel target on wednesday , saying that it would cost motorists with older vehicles an additional 150 million euros -lrb- $ 223 million -rrb- . the adac has also underlined that there could be other negative implications if germany takes this step alone , such as an increase of motorists tanking up in neighboring countries and the corresponding loss of tax revenue to the german government . potential problem for foreign visitors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hay fever sufferers and opponents of monocultural farming oppose biofuels foreign drivers may also not be sufficiently informed about any new blend and could inadvertently suffer motor damage , the organization warned . " this is not just a question of whether the planned introduction of e10 gasoline blended with 10 percent ethanol will be compatible with millions of cars , " said peter meyer , the head of the adac .
" the adac is also pleading for an honest assessment of all aspects of blending , including the overall ecological and social costs . " green groups have predicted that expanding the production of agricultural products such as corn , soybeans and rapeseed to make biofuels can lead to the destruction of ecosystems , increases in food prices and the dislocation of the rural poor . the world 's biggest carmaker , general motors , has , however , recently unveiled a system to create the biofuel from garbage - which would get around the environmental objections .
the initiative is being introduced in britain . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

22 , deplored an outbreak of violence in belgrade that saw groups of demonstrators attacking foreign embassies .
more than 200,000 people turned out on the streets of the serbian capital for largely peaceful protests against kosovo 's unilateral declaration of independence . " i strongly condemn the attacks perpetrated yesterday against foreign embassies and economic assets in belgrade which caused important material damage and put human life in danger , " said olli rehn , the eu 's enlargement commissioner . " we respect the democratic right of the serbian people to voice their opinion on developments in kosovo , but the use of violence for expressing one 's opinion is unacceptable , " rehn added . " violence hurts serbia 's image abroad " over 300 rioters broke into the us embassy and set part of it ablaze on thursday .
the violence killed one person and injured 90 .

the police had been overwhelmed by the scale of the march , he said , which had begun as a state-backed rally . " the acts that were committed are absolutely unacceptable , absolutely regrettable , " jeremic said .
" they hurt serbia 's image abroad . " eu warns violence may hurt ties eu foreign policy chief javier solana said the violence could impact progress on a preliminary deal between serbia and the european union . " things will have to calm down before we can recuperate a climate that would allow for any contact to move " on the stabilization and association agreement , an accord seen as the first symbolic step towards serbia joining the 27-nation bloc , solana told journalists in slovenia , where he was attending an informal meeting of eu defense ministers . " embassies have to be protected and that is -lrb- serbia 's -rrb- obligation , " solana said .
" these acts -lrb- of violence -rrb- wo n't lead anywhere . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana has warned that the violence could harm eu-serbia ties solana 's spokeswoman , cristina gallach , in a brief statement overnight , slammed the violence in belgrade as " totally unacceptable " and appealed for " calm , restraint and responsibility . " solana welcomed the fact that serb president boris tadic had called for calm on thursday , but said he was less satisfied with the attitude of other members of the serb government . germany registers protest germany , whose embassy was also targeted in the violence , called on the serbian government to provide adequate security for foreign diplomatic missions . " if these events are repeated , this would have consequences for the future relationship between serbian and the european union , " german government spokesman thomas steg said . steg urged serbian politicians to " show responsibility " in their public statements on kosovo 's declaration of independence . before being called back to belgrade , the serbian ambassador in berlin told deutsche welle this week that serbia would never give up kosovo . foreign ministry spokesman martin jaeger said the serbian charge d 'affaires had been called in to be handed a formal protest at the violence . " pandora 's box " of separatism jaeger rejected reported remarks from moscow that the west had to bear part of the responsibility for the violence . on thursday , russian president vladimir putin 's representative to the european union warned recognition of kosovo 's independence would open " pandora 's box " of separatism in europe . " i warn you that you ca n't open pandora 's box , " sergei yastrzhembsky said . the eu is in the process of deploying a 1,900-strong policing and justice mission tasked with improving kosovo 's fledgling justice system and advising its authorities on how to run their newly independent state . eu policemen , judges and prosecutors are to be bolstered by 1,100 local staff . serbia and its powerful ally russia say the eu mission violates international law , a claim denied by officials in brussels . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corruption -pipe- 22.02.2008 eu anti-fraud unit to probe parliamentary staff payments großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an internal report suggests that some eu parliamentarians have misused public funds the eu 's anti-fraud unit is to investigate an internal report compiled by the european parliament to see whether public funds were abused amid allegations of embezzlement and fraud within the organization . in what could become a major corruption scandal in the european union , a confidential report by the european parliament 's internal auditors says that some of the 784 members of parliament -lrb- meps -rrb- were employing family members while others had registered payments to firms which did not exist .
the demand for an investigation was made by charles davies , a member of the uk liberal democrat party and the parliament 's budget control committee .
davies , who was among a handful of meps allowed to see the report , perused its contents under supervision and was forbidden from taking notes or making photocopies .
huge sums involved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corruption cases at eu institutions are a sensitive issue the eu 's anti-fraud unit , olaf , which routinely checks internal audits made by the eu 's various institutions , will now scrutinize the secret internal study to determine whether there was an abuse of public eu funds .
complied by the eu parliament 's internal auditor , the report analyses 167 payments made in 2004 and 2005 to meps ' assistants .
each member of the european parliament is granted 16,000 euros -lrb- $ 23,500 -rrb- a month to pay assistants .
while some assistants work in brussels , other staffers work in their mep 's own country .
parliamentarians pay their staff 140 million euros a year , about 10 percent of the assembly 's overall expenditure .
news agency afp quoted an unnamed eu deputy who said , " the auditor found proof that in some cases the listed service provider did n't even exist . "
citing another unnamed parliamentary insider , the news agency said the abuses amounted to almost 100 million euros .
davies told euobserver that his first reaction was " a degree of hysteria given the scale of the abuse that is taking place and given the fact that it has been kept secret . "
" a travesty of justice " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how transparent is the european parliament ?
davies , who contacted olaf about the report , called the decision to keep the report secret " absurd " and a " travesty of justice . "
" a parliament committed to openness and transparency has no right to try and keep secret details about how public money is used and misused .
and … we are talking about very large sums of money , " davies said .
though the eu parliament has not commented on the details of the report , spokeswoman marjory van den broeke said the audit confirmed that the remuneration system was " too complicated " and had become " very difficult to manage , both for the deputies and for the parliament 's administration . "
the european parliament 's secretary-general is now to propose a simpler system for hiring and administering staff , doing away with the current system which involves at least three different methods for meps to put together their team of assistants .
corruption a sensitive issue corruption cases at eu institutions are a sensitive issue after a scandal in the late 1990s brought down the entire european commission .
the commission and an assistant to an mep were charged with forgery . edith cresson , a former french prime minister who served as research and education commissioner in brussels from 1995 to 1999 , was accused of hiring a dentist from her home town as an advisor , despite being warned it was against eu rules .
the scandal eventually led to the collective resignation of the commission and its president at the time , jacques santer , in march 1999 .
last year , three italian nationals , including a civil servant working for the european commission were charged with forgery , corruption fraud and forming a criminal organization . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the demand for an investigation was made by charles davies , a member of the uk liberal democrat party and the parliament 's budget control committee .
davies , who was among a handful of meps allowed to see the report , perused its contents under supervision and was forbidden from taking notes or making photocopies .
huge sums involved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corruption cases at eu institutions are a sensitive issue the eu 's anti-fraud unit , olaf , which routinely checks internal audits made by the eu 's various institutions , will now scrutinize the secret internal study to determine whether there was an abuse of public eu funds .
complied by the eu parliament 's internal auditor , the report analyses 167 payments made in 2004 and 2005 to meps ' assistants .
each member of the european parliament is granted 16,000 euros -lrb- $ 23,500 -rrb- a month to pay assistants .
while some assistants work in brussels , other staffers work in their mep 's own country .
parliamentarians pay their staff 140 million euros a year , about 10 percent of the assembly 's overall expenditure .
news agency afp quoted an unnamed eu deputy who said , " the auditor found proof that in some cases the listed service provider did n't even exist . "
citing another unnamed parliamentary insider , the news agency said the abuses amounted to almost 100 million euros .
davies told euobserver that his first reaction was " a degree of hysteria given the scale of the abuse that is taking place and given the fact that it has been kept secret . "
" a travesty of justice " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how transparent is the european parliament ?
davies , who contacted olaf about the report , called the decision to keep the report secret " absurd " and a " travesty of justice . "
" a parliament committed to openness and transparency has no right to try and keep secret details about how public money is used and misused .
and … we are talking about very large sums of money , " davies said .
though the eu parliament has not commented on the details of the report , spokeswoman marjory van den broeke said the audit confirmed that the remuneration system was " too complicated " and had become " very difficult to manage , both for the deputies and for the parliament 's administration . "
the european parliament 's secretary-general is now to propose a simpler system for hiring and administering staff , doing away with the current system which involves at least three different methods for meps to put together their team of assistants .
corruption a sensitive issue corruption cases at eu institutions are a sensitive issue after a scandal in the late 1990s brought down the entire european commission .
the commission and an assistant to an mep were charged with forgery . edith cresson , a former french prime minister who served as research and education commissioner in brussels from 1995 to 1999 , was accused of hiring a dentist from her home town as an advisor , despite being warned it was against eu rules .
the scandal eventually led to the collective resignation of the commission and its president at the time , jacques santer , in march 1999 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 22.02.2008 german government could jettison higher biofuel target großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are worries about the cost of blended gas for german motorists the german government has said it might scrap plans for a 5 percent rise in the amount of biofuel added to gasoline .
the move has been prompted by concerns about motorists with cars that are not biofuel compatible . the german automobile association adac has warned that up to 1.5 million drivers will be unable to use the ethanol-richer gasoline , forcing them to switch to more expensive premium fuels when it is introduced . the government had based its plans on statistics from the german car industry which estimated that around 375,000 car owners would be adversely affected . environment minister sigmar gabriel has said on friday , feb .
22 , that the measure to introduce a 10 percent blending rate would be torpedoed if the adac 's statistics proved to be correct . this is just the latest setback to the biofuel lobby .
critics have recently attacked the social and environmental cost of producing fuel from plants . ministry rechecking its facts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions of cars already run on the alternative fuel gabriel , a member of the social democratic party , told german broadcaster ard that his ministry had put the plans on hold a few weeks ago , so it could recheck the data .
the proposals to raise rate biofuel blending rates from 5 percent to 10 percent by 2010 had originally been welcomed . the christian democrats , currently in grand coalition with the social democrats , announced their opposition to the higher biofuel target on wednesday , saying that it would cost motorists with older vehicles an additional 150 million euros -lrb- $ 223 million -rrb- . the adac has also underlined that there could be other negative implications if germany takes this step alone , such as an increase of motorists tanking up in neighboring countries and the corresponding loss of tax revenue to the german government . potential problem for foreign visitors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hay fever sufferers and opponents of monocultural farming oppose biofuels foreign drivers may also not be sufficiently informed about any new blend and could inadvertently suffer motor damage , the organization warned . " this is not just a question of whether the planned introduction of e10 gasoline blended with 10 percent ethanol will be compatible with millions of cars , " said peter meyer , the head of the adac .
" the adac is also pleading for an honest assessment of all aspects of blending , including the overall ecological and social costs . " green groups have predicted that expanding the production of agricultural products such as corn , soybeans and rapeseed to make biofuels can lead to the destruction of ecosystems , increases in food prices and the dislocation of the rural poor . the world 's biggest carmaker , general motors , has , however , recently unveiled a system to create the biofuel from garbage - which would get around the environmental objections .

" it is a continuity of the air operations that have been carried out .
civilians and local elements who do not show hostility to turkish forces will not be negatively affected by this operation . " the military statement said the aim of the operation was to stop the pkk from using mountainous northern iraq as a base from which to launch attacks on turkey .
the general staff has previously estimated that there are around 4,000 to 5,000 pkk guerrillas based in northern iraq . respecting international law bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the moment , the border region is still covered with heavy snow more than 32,000 people have been killed since 1984 when the pkk launched its fight for independence or autonomy for the mainly kurdish-populated south-east part of turkey . germany is watching the turkish incursion into northern iraq with concern and is worried about possible escalation , a spokesman for the foreign ministry said in berlin on friday . the presence of turkish troops in northern iraq represented a " not inconsiderable risk of destabilization , " martin jaeger said . " we call on the turkish government in its fight against terrorism to reduce its steps to the minimum to protect its own people , " jaeger said . he warned against the possibility of escalation and said that international law had to be respected . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bundestag passed a law friday , feb .
22 , giving men a legal framework to establish paternity . the law approved by the german parliament allows a man to request a paternity test against the will of his alleged child 's mother and without needing to resort to a legal challenge , which would automatically sever his legal ties to a child whom - in many cases - he has spent years raising . proving that he is not in fact the child 's biological father now no longer necessarily terminates their legal relationship .
thanks to the new legislation , a man can retain paternity even if tests prove he is not a child 's biological father . no more secrets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the implications of a legal challenge are no longer as dramatic until now , men convinced they were not in fact the biological father of children they were raising were left with few options other than secret dna tests . according to german justice minister brigitte zypries , some 20,000 secret tests are taken every year .
but ultimately , they carry no legal weight , because the results are not recognized by courts , and the family is left burdened by knowledge it can do little about . zypries has described the new law as an attempt to stop this secret testing , by conceding fathers the same right to establish paternity as other family members . " this is a good day for all those men who have in the past struggled to escape the burden of financial responsibility , " said the christian democratic faction 's legal expert juergen gehb . peter schaar , the federal commissioner for data protection hailed the law as a " sensible balance serving the interests of the child , mother and father .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corruption -pipe- 22.02.2008 eu anti-fraud unit to probe parliamentary staff payments großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an internal report suggests that some eu parliamentarians have misused public funds the eu 's anti-fraud unit is to investigate an internal report compiled by the european parliament to see whether public funds were abused amid allegations of embezzlement and fraud within the organization . in what could become a major corruption scandal in the european union , a confidential report by the european parliament 's internal auditors says that some of the 784 members of parliament -lrb- meps -rrb- were employing family members while others had registered payments to firms which did not exist .
the demand for an investigation was made by charles davies , a member of the uk liberal democrat party and the parliament 's budget control committee .
davies , who was among a handful of meps allowed to see the report , perused its contents under supervision and was forbidden from taking notes or making photocopies .
huge sums involved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corruption cases at eu institutions are a sensitive issue the eu 's anti-fraud unit , olaf , which routinely checks internal audits made by the eu 's various institutions , will now scrutinize the secret internal study to determine whether there was an abuse of public eu funds .
complied by the eu parliament 's internal auditor , the report analyses 167 payments made in 2004 and 2005 to meps ' assistants .
each member of the european parliament is granted 16,000 euros -lrb- $ 23,500 -rrb- a month to pay assistants .
while some assistants work in brussels , other staffers work in their mep 's own country .
parliamentarians pay their staff 140 million euros a year , about 10 percent of the assembly 's overall expenditure .
news agency afp quoted an unnamed eu deputy who said , " the auditor found proof that in some cases the listed service provider did n't even exist . "
citing another unnamed parliamentary insider , the news agency said the abuses amounted to almost 100 million euros .
davies told euobserver that his first reaction was " a degree of hysteria given the scale of the abuse that is taking place and given the fact that it has been kept secret . "
" a travesty of justice " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how transparent is the european parliament ?
davies , who contacted olaf about the report , called the decision to keep the report secret " absurd " and a " travesty of justice . "
" a parliament committed to openness and transparency has no right to try and keep secret details about how public money is used and misused .
and … we are talking about very large sums of money , " davies said .
though the eu parliament has not commented on the details of the report , spokeswoman marjory van den broeke said the audit confirmed that the remuneration system was " too complicated " and had become " very difficult to manage , both for the deputies and for the parliament 's administration . "
the european parliament 's secretary-general is now to propose a simpler system for hiring and administering staff , doing away with the current system which involves at least three different methods for meps to put together their team of assistants .
corruption a sensitive issue corruption cases at eu institutions are a sensitive issue after a scandal in the late 1990s brought down the entire european commission .
the commission and an assistant to an mep were charged with forgery . edith cresson , a former french prime minister who served as research and education commissioner in brussels from 1995 to 1999 , was accused of hiring a dentist from her home town as an advisor , despite being warned it was against eu rules .
the scandal eventually led to the collective resignation of the commission and its president at the time , jacques santer , in march 1999 .
last year , three italian nationals , including a civil servant working for the european commission were charged with forgery , corruption fraud and forming a criminal organization . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 22.02.2008 german government could jettison higher biofuel target großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are worries about the cost of blended gas for german motorists the german government has said it might scrap plans for a 5 percent rise in the amount of biofuel added to gasoline .
the move has been prompted by concerns about motorists with cars that are not biofuel compatible . the german automobile association adac has warned that up to 1.5 million drivers will be unable to use the ethanol-richer gasoline , forcing them to switch to more expensive premium fuels when it is introduced . the government had based its plans on statistics from the german car industry which estimated that around 375,000 car owners would be adversely affected . environment minister sigmar gabriel has said on friday , feb .
22 , that the measure to introduce a 10 percent blending rate would be torpedoed if the adac 's statistics proved to be correct . this is just the latest setback to the biofuel lobby .
critics have recently attacked the social and environmental cost of producing fuel from plants . ministry rechecking its facts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions of cars already run on the alternative fuel gabriel , a member of the social democratic party , told german broadcaster ard that his ministry had put the plans on hold a few weeks ago , so it could recheck the data .
the proposals to raise rate biofuel blending rates from 5 percent to 10 percent by 2010 had originally been welcomed . the christian democrats , currently in grand coalition with the social democrats , announced their opposition to the higher biofuel target on wednesday , saying that it would cost motorists with older vehicles an additional 150 million euros -lrb- $ 223 million -rrb- . the adac has also underlined that there could be other negative implications if germany takes this step alone , such as an increase of motorists tanking up in neighboring countries and the corresponding loss of tax revenue to the german government . potential problem for foreign visitors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hay fever sufferers and opponents of monocultural farming oppose biofuels foreign drivers may also not be sufficiently informed about any new blend and could inadvertently suffer motor damage , the organization warned . " this is not just a question of whether the planned introduction of e10 gasoline blended with 10 percent ethanol will be compatible with millions of cars , " said peter meyer , the head of the adac .
" the adac is also pleading for an honest assessment of all aspects of blending , including the overall ecological and social costs . " green groups have predicted that expanding the production of agricultural products such as corn , soybeans and rapeseed to make biofuels can lead to the destruction of ecosystems , increases in food prices and the dislocation of the rural poor . the world 's biggest carmaker , general motors , has , however , recently unveiled a system to create the biofuel from garbage - which would get around the environmental objections .

the bundestag passed a law friday , feb .
22 , giving men a legal framework to establish paternity . the law approved by the german parliament allows a man to request a paternity test against the will of his alleged child 's mother and without needing to resort to a legal challenge , which would automatically sever his legal ties to a child whom - in many cases - he has spent years raising . proving that he is not in fact the child 's biological father now no longer necessarily terminates their legal relationship .
thanks to the new legislation , a man can retain paternity even if tests prove he is not a child 's biological father . no more secrets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the implications of a legal challenge are no longer as dramatic until now , men convinced they were not in fact the biological father of children they were raising were left with few options other than secret dna tests . according to german justice minister brigitte zypries , some 20,000 secret tests are taken every year .
but ultimately , they carry no legal weight , because the results are not recognized by courts , and the family is left burdened by knowledge it can do little about . zypries has described the new law as an attempt to stop this secret testing , by conceding fathers the same right to establish paternity as other family members . " this is a good day for all those men who have in the past struggled to escape the burden of financial responsibility , " said the christian democratic faction 's legal expert juergen gehb . peter schaar , the federal commissioner for data protection hailed the law as a " sensible balance serving the interests of the child , mother and father . " child 's best interests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secret dna testing has been a boom business criticism of the new law came from the opposition green and left parties , however , who argued that it failed adequately to protect the interests of the child . but supporters say the new law makes the child 's interests a top priority .
a court may rule against a paternity test if it decides that a child is emotionally or psychologically unable to withstand the potential effect . although there are no official figures , experts estimate that up to 10 percent of children are raised by men who are not their biological fathers . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after a reported 10,000 turkish troops crossed into iraq thursday evening in an effort to destroy kurdish rebel bases in the mountainous region , the eu urged turkey to exercise restraint and respect iraq 's border . " we understand the concerns of turkey , " said eu foreign policy chief javier solana at the conclusion of a meeting of eu defense ministers in brdo , slovenia . both the eu and the us list the kurdish workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- as a terrorist group .
the eu , however , also does not want to see any action that might further destabilize iraq . " we think that this action in iraq is not the best response , " said solana .
" the territorial integrity of iraq is for us very , very important . meanwhile , back at eu headquarters in brussels , spokeswomen krisztina nagy warned turkey against " disproportionate military action " but said ankara had a right to protect its people from terror . un also concerned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary general ban ki-moon appealed for restraint un secretary general ban ki-moon also called for restraint and respect of iraq 's borders . " while conscious of turkey 's concerns , -lsb- ban -rsb- reiterates his appeal for utmost restraint , and for respect of the international borders between iraq and turkey , " ban 's spokesman farhan haq said . " he also repeats his previous calls for an immediate end to continued incursions by pkk elements carrying out terrorist attacks from northern iraq , " haq said . the turkish troops ' ground incursion into iraq is the first confirmed operation of that kind since the us-led strike that toppled saddam hussein in 2003 . a " limited " operation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turkish-iraqi border has long been a cause for concern turkish soldiers crossed the border on thursday evening after a day of air and artillery attacks on suspected pkk targets in iraq , the general staff announced in a statement posted on its official website . the statement said the operation would be limited and that the troops would return to turkey in the " shortest time possible . " the ntv private television station reported that 10,000 had crossed the border . " this operation 's target is the pkk terrorist organization , " the statement said .
" it is a continuity of the air operations that have been carried out .
civilians and local elements who do not show hostility to turkish forces will not be negatively affected by this operation . " the military statement said the aim of the operation was to stop the pkk from using mountainous northern iraq as a base from which to launch attacks on turkey .

after a reported 10,000 turkish troops crossed into iraq thursday evening in an effort to destroy kurdish rebel bases in the mountainous region , the eu urged turkey to exercise restraint and respect iraq 's border . " we understand the concerns of turkey , " said eu foreign policy chief javier solana at the conclusion of a meeting of eu defense ministers in brdo , slovenia . both the eu and the us list the kurdish workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- as a terrorist group .
the eu , however , also does not want to see any action that might further destabilize iraq . " we think that this action in iraq is not the best response , " said solana .
" the territorial integrity of iraq is for us very , very important . meanwhile , back at eu headquarters in brussels , spokeswomen krisztina nagy warned turkey against " disproportionate military action " but said ankara had a right to protect its people from terror . un also concerned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary general ban ki-moon appealed for restraint un secretary general ban ki-moon also called for restraint and respect of iraq 's borders . " while conscious of turkey 's concerns , -lsb- ban -rsb- reiterates his appeal for utmost restraint , and for respect of the international borders between iraq and turkey , " ban 's spokesman farhan haq said . " he also repeats his previous calls for an immediate end to continued incursions by pkk elements carrying out terrorist attacks from northern iraq , " haq said . the turkish troops ' ground incursion into iraq is the first confirmed operation of that kind since the us-led strike that toppled saddam hussein in 2003 . a " limited " operation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turkish-iraqi border has long been a cause for concern turkish soldiers crossed the border on thursday evening after a day of air and artillery attacks on suspected pkk targets in iraq , the general staff announced in a statement posted on its official website . the statement said the operation would be limited and that the troops would return to turkey in the " shortest time possible . " the ntv private television station reported that 10,000 had crossed the border . " this operation 's target is the pkk terrorist organization , " the statement said .
" it is a continuity of the air operations that have been carried out .
civilians and local elements who do not show hostility to turkish forces will not be negatively affected by this operation . " the military statement said the aim of the operation was to stop the pkk from using mountainous northern iraq as a base from which to launch attacks on turkey .
the general staff has previously estimated that there are around 4,000 to 5,000 pkk guerrillas based in northern iraq . respecting international law bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the moment , the border region is still covered with heavy snow more than 32,000 people have been killed since 1984 when the pkk launched its fight for independence or autonomy for the mainly kurdish-populated south-east part of turkey . germany is watching the turkish incursion into northern iraq with concern and is worried about possible escalation , a spokesman for the foreign ministry said in berlin on friday . the presence of turkish troops in northern iraq represented a " not inconsiderable risk of destabilization , " martin jaeger said .

the bundestag passed a law friday , feb .
22 , giving men a legal framework to establish paternity . the law approved by the german parliament allows a man to request a paternity test against the will of his alleged child 's mother and without needing to resort to a legal challenge , which would automatically sever his legal ties to a child whom - in many cases - he has spent years raising . proving that he is not in fact the child 's biological father now no longer necessarily terminates their legal relationship .
thanks to the new legislation , a man can retain paternity even if tests prove he is not a child 's biological father . no more secrets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the implications of a legal challenge are no longer as dramatic until now , men convinced they were not in fact the biological father of children they were raising were left with few options other than secret dna tests . according to german justice minister brigitte zypries , some 20,000 secret tests are taken every year .
but ultimately , they carry no legal weight , because the results are not recognized by courts , and the family is left burdened by knowledge it can do little about . zypries has described the new law as an attempt to stop this secret testing , by conceding fathers the same right to establish paternity as other family members . " this is a good day for all those men who have in the past struggled to escape the burden of financial responsibility , " said the christian democratic faction 's legal expert juergen gehb . peter schaar , the federal commissioner for data protection hailed the law as a " sensible balance serving the interests of the child , mother and father . " child 's best interests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secret dna testing has been a boom business criticism of the new law came from the opposition green and left parties , however , who argued that it failed adequately to protect the interests of the child . but supporters say the new law makes the child 's interests a top priority .
a court may rule against a paternity test if it decides that a child is emotionally or psychologically unable to withstand the potential effect . although there are no official figures , experts estimate that up to 10 percent of children are raised by men who are not their biological fathers . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the demand for an investigation was made by charles davies , a member of the uk liberal democrat party and the parliament 's budget control committee .
davies , who was among a handful of meps allowed to see the report , perused its contents under supervision and was forbidden from taking notes or making photocopies .
huge sums involved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corruption cases at eu institutions are a sensitive issue the eu 's anti-fraud unit , olaf , which routinely checks internal audits made by the eu 's various institutions , will now scrutinize the secret internal study to determine whether there was an abuse of public eu funds .
complied by the eu parliament 's internal auditor , the report analyses 167 payments made in 2004 and 2005 to meps ' assistants .
each member of the european parliament is granted 16,000 euros -lrb- $ 23,500 -rrb- a month to pay assistants .
while some assistants work in brussels , other staffers work in their mep 's own country .
parliamentarians pay their staff 140 million euros a year , about 10 percent of the assembly 's overall expenditure .
news agency afp quoted an unnamed eu deputy who said , " the auditor found proof that in some cases the listed service provider did n't even exist . "
citing another unnamed parliamentary insider , the news agency said the abuses amounted to almost 100 million euros .
davies told euobserver that his first reaction was " a degree of hysteria given the scale of the abuse that is taking place and given the fact that it has been kept secret . "
" a travesty of justice " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how transparent is the european parliament ?
davies , who contacted olaf about the report , called the decision to keep the report secret " absurd " and a " travesty of justice . "
" a parliament committed to openness and transparency has no right to try and keep secret details about how public money is used and misused .
and … we are talking about very large sums of money , " davies said .
though the eu parliament has not commented on the details of the report , spokeswoman marjory van den broeke said the audit confirmed that the remuneration system was " too complicated " and had become " very difficult to manage , both for the deputies and for the parliament 's administration . "
the european parliament 's secretary-general is now to propose a simpler system for hiring and administering staff , doing away with the current system which involves at least three different methods for meps to put together their team of assistants .
corruption a sensitive issue corruption cases at eu institutions are a sensitive issue after a scandal in the late 1990s brought down the entire european commission .
the commission and an assistant to an mep were charged with forgery . edith cresson , a former french prime minister who served as research and education commissioner in brussels from 1995 to 1999 , was accused of hiring a dentist from her home town as an advisor , despite being warned it was against eu rules .
the scandal eventually led to the collective resignation of the commission and its president at the time , jacques santer , in march 1999 .

after a reported 10,000 turkish troops crossed into iraq thursday evening in an effort to destroy kurdish rebel bases in the mountainous region , the eu urged turkey to exercise restraint and respect iraq 's border . " we understand the concerns of turkey , " said eu foreign policy chief javier solana at the conclusion of a meeting of eu defense ministers in brdo , slovenia . both the eu and the us list the kurdish workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- as a terrorist group .
the eu , however , also does not want to see any action that might further destabilize iraq . " we think that this action in iraq is not the best response , " said solana .
" the territorial integrity of iraq is for us very , very important . meanwhile , back at eu headquarters in brussels , spokeswomen krisztina nagy warned turkey against " disproportionate military action " but said ankara had a right to protect its people from terror . un also concerned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary general ban ki-moon appealed for restraint un secretary general ban ki-moon also called for restraint and respect of iraq 's borders . " while conscious of turkey 's concerns , -lsb- ban -rsb- reiterates his appeal for utmost restraint , and for respect of the international borders between iraq and turkey , " ban 's spokesman farhan haq said . " he also repeats his previous calls for an immediate end to continued incursions by pkk elements carrying out terrorist attacks from northern iraq , " haq said . the turkish troops ' ground incursion into iraq is the first confirmed operation of that kind since the us-led strike that toppled saddam hussein in 2003 . a " limited " operation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turkish-iraqi border has long been a cause for concern turkish soldiers crossed the border on thursday evening after a day of air and artillery attacks on suspected pkk targets in iraq , the general staff announced in a statement posted on its official website . the statement said the operation would be limited and that the troops would return to turkey in the " shortest time possible . " the ntv private television station reported that 10,000 had crossed the border . " this operation 's target is the pkk terrorist organization , " the statement said .
" it is a continuity of the air operations that have been carried out .
civilians and local elements who do not show hostility to turkish forces will not be negatively affected by this operation . " the military statement said the aim of the operation was to stop the pkk from using mountainous northern iraq as a base from which to launch attacks on turkey .
the general staff has previously estimated that there are around 4,000 to 5,000 pkk guerrillas based in northern iraq . respecting international law bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the moment , the border region is still covered with heavy snow more than 32,000 people have been killed since 1984 when the pkk launched its fight for independence or autonomy for the mainly kurdish-populated south-east part of turkey . germany is watching the turkish incursion into northern iraq with concern and is worried about possible escalation , a spokesman for the foreign ministry said in berlin on friday . the presence of turkish troops in northern iraq represented a " not inconsiderable risk of destabilization , " martin jaeger said . " we call on the turkish government in its fight against terrorism to reduce its steps to the minimum to protect its own people , " jaeger said . he warned against the possibility of escalation and said that international law had to be respected . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the commission and an assistant to an mep were charged with forgery . edith cresson , a former french prime minister who served as research and education commissioner in brussels from 1995 to 1999 , was accused of hiring a dentist from her home town as an advisor , despite being warned it was against eu rules .
the scandal eventually led to the collective resignation of the commission and its president at the time , jacques santer , in march 1999 .

the demand for an investigation was made by charles davies , a member of the uk liberal democrat party and the parliament 's budget control committee .
davies , who was among a handful of meps allowed to see the report , perused its contents under supervision and was forbidden from taking notes or making photocopies .
huge sums involved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corruption cases at eu institutions are a sensitive issue the eu 's anti-fraud unit , olaf , which routinely checks internal audits made by the eu 's various institutions , will now scrutinize the secret internal study to determine whether there was an abuse of public eu funds .
complied by the eu parliament 's internal auditor , the report analyses 167 payments made in 2004 and 2005 to meps ' assistants .
each member of the european parliament is granted 16,000 euros -lrb- $ 23,500 -rrb- a month to pay assistants .
while some assistants work in brussels , other staffers work in their mep 's own country .
parliamentarians pay their staff 140 million euros a year , about 10 percent of the assembly 's overall expenditure .
news agency afp quoted an unnamed eu deputy who said , " the auditor found proof that in some cases the listed service provider did n't even exist . "
citing another unnamed parliamentary insider , the news agency said the abuses amounted to almost 100 million euros .
davies told euobserver that his first reaction was " a degree of hysteria given the scale of the abuse that is taking place and given the fact that it has been kept secret . "
" a travesty of justice " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how transparent is the european parliament ?
davies , who contacted olaf about the report , called the decision to keep the report secret " absurd " and a " travesty of justice . "
" a parliament committed to openness and transparency has no right to try and keep secret details about how public money is used and misused .
and … we are talking about very large sums of money , " davies said .
though the eu parliament has not commented on the details of the report , spokeswoman marjory van den broeke said the audit confirmed that the remuneration system was " too complicated " and had become " very difficult to manage , both for the deputies and for the parliament 's administration . "

the proposals to raise rate biofuel blending rates from 5 percent to 10 percent by 2010 had originally been welcomed . the christian democrats , currently in grand coalition with the social democrats , announced their opposition to the higher biofuel target on wednesday , saying that it would cost motorists with older vehicles an additional 150 million euros -lrb- $ 223 million -rrb- . the adac has also underlined that there could be other negative implications if germany takes this step alone , such as an increase of motorists tanking up in neighboring countries and the corresponding loss of tax revenue to the german government . potential problem for foreign visitors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hay fever sufferers and opponents of monocultural farming oppose biofuels foreign drivers may also not be sufficiently informed about any new blend and could inadvertently suffer motor damage , the organization warned . " this is not just a question of whether the planned introduction of e10 gasoline blended with 10 percent ethanol will be compatible with millions of cars , " said peter meyer , the head of the adac .
" the adac is also pleading for an honest assessment of all aspects of blending , including the overall ecological and social costs .

erdogan 's wife and daughters wear the headscarf as do those of president abdullah gul and many other members of the ak party .
turkey 's old secular elite , who see themselves as upholders of modern turkey 's founding father , mustafa kemal ataturk 's secular legacy , strongly oppose the lifting of the ban on the headscarf .
they see it as a slow slide towards an islamist state .
the issue has sparked huge demonstrations by secularists on the streets of the capital ankara in recent weeks .
" turkey is secular and will remain secular , " shouted some demonstrators earlier in the month during protests .
a majority of the demonstrators , who were waving the red and white star and crescent flag of turkey and bearing portraits of mustafa kemal ataturk , were women , including some who wore headscarves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secularist groups protested in large numbers in ankara some were wearing headbands that read " we are following your oath " along with pictures of ataturk , who set up the republic in 1923 on the strict separation of state and religion .
the headscarf ban in turkey dates back to the 1980s .
it was tightened in 1997 when the country 's powerful army , with public support , ousted a government they considered too islamist .
opinion polls however show that a majority of turks are in favor of easing the ban .
the rerform does n't include female professors or civil servants who will still be subject to the headscarf ban . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

more than 200,000 people turned out on the streets of the serbian capital for largely peaceful protests against kosovo 's unilateral declaration of independence . " i strongly condemn the attacks perpetrated yesterday against foreign embassies and economic assets in belgrade which caused important material damage and put human life in danger , " said olli rehn , the eu 's enlargement commissioner . " we respect the democratic right of the serbian people to voice their opinion on developments in kosovo , but the use of violence for expressing one 's opinion is unacceptable , " rehn added . " violence hurts serbia 's image abroad " over 300 rioters broke into the us embassy and set part of it ablaze on thursday .
the violence killed one person and injured 90 .
one protestor ripped the american flag from the facade of the building , cheered on by around a thousand demonstrators , some wearing masks to conceal their faces . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters set an american flag on fire washington has already lodged a high-level complaint with the third highest us diplomat , nicholas burns , calling serbia 's prime minister vojislav kostunica and foreign minister vuk jeremic to formally protest the storming of the embassy in belgrade . the serb government was quick to distance itself from the mob attacks , and stressed that they were acts of isolated vandals who in no way represented the nation .

" embassies have to be protected and that is -lrb- serbia 's -rrb- obligation , " solana said .
" these acts -lrb- of violence -rrb- wo n't lead anywhere . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana has warned that the violence could harm eu-serbia ties solana 's spokeswoman , cristina gallach , in a brief statement overnight , slammed the violence in belgrade as " totally unacceptable " and appealed for " calm , restraint and responsibility . " solana welcomed the fact that serb president boris tadic had called for calm on thursday , but said he was less satisfied with the attitude of other members of the serb government . germany registers protest germany , whose embassy was also targeted in the violence , called on the serbian government to provide adequate security for foreign diplomatic missions .

the demand for an investigation was made by charles davies , a member of the uk liberal democrat party and the parliament 's budget control committee .
davies , who was among a handful of meps allowed to see the report , perused its contents under supervision and was forbidden from taking notes or making photocopies .
huge sums involved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corruption cases at eu institutions are a sensitive issue the eu 's anti-fraud unit , olaf , which routinely checks internal audits made by the eu 's various institutions , will now scrutinize the secret internal study to determine whether there was an abuse of public eu funds .
complied by the eu parliament 's internal auditor , the report analyses 167 payments made in 2004 and 2005 to meps ' assistants .
each member of the european parliament is granted 16,000 euros -lrb- $ 23,500 -rrb- a month to pay assistants .
while some assistants work in brussels , other staffers work in their mep 's own country .
parliamentarians pay their staff 140 million euros a year , about 10 percent of the assembly 's overall expenditure .
news agency afp quoted an unnamed eu deputy who said , " the auditor found proof that in some cases the listed service provider did n't even exist . "
citing another unnamed parliamentary insider , the news agency said the abuses amounted to almost 100 million euros .
davies told euobserver that his first reaction was " a degree of hysteria given the scale of the abuse that is taking place and given the fact that it has been kept secret . "
" a travesty of justice " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how transparent is the european parliament ?
davies , who contacted olaf about the report , called the decision to keep the report secret " absurd " and a " travesty of justice . "
" a parliament committed to openness and transparency has no right to try and keep secret details about how public money is used and misused .
and … we are talking about very large sums of money , " davies said .
though the eu parliament has not commented on the details of the report , spokeswoman marjory van den broeke said the audit confirmed that the remuneration system was " too complicated " and had become " very difficult to manage , both for the deputies and for the parliament 's administration . "
the european parliament 's secretary-general is now to propose a simpler system for hiring and administering staff , doing away with the current system which involves at least three different methods for meps to put together their team of assistants .
corruption a sensitive issue corruption cases at eu institutions are a sensitive issue after a scandal in the late 1990s brought down the entire european commission .
the commission and an assistant to an mep were charged with forgery . edith cresson , a former french prime minister who served as research and education commissioner in brussels from 1995 to 1999 , was accused of hiring a dentist from her home town as an advisor , despite being warned it was against eu rules .
the scandal eventually led to the collective resignation of the commission and its president at the time , jacques santer , in march 1999 .

the demand for an investigation was made by charles davies , a member of the uk liberal democrat party and the parliament 's budget control committee .
davies , who was among a handful of meps allowed to see the report , perused its contents under supervision and was forbidden from taking notes or making photocopies .
huge sums involved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corruption cases at eu institutions are a sensitive issue the eu 's anti-fraud unit , olaf , which routinely checks internal audits made by the eu 's various institutions , will now scrutinize the secret internal study to determine whether there was an abuse of public eu funds .
complied by the eu parliament 's internal auditor , the report analyses 167 payments made in 2004 and 2005 to meps ' assistants .
each member of the european parliament is granted 16,000 euros -lrb- $ 23,500 -rrb- a month to pay assistants .
while some assistants work in brussels , other staffers work in their mep 's own country .
parliamentarians pay their staff 140 million euros a year , about 10 percent of the assembly 's overall expenditure .
news agency afp quoted an unnamed eu deputy who said , " the auditor found proof that in some cases the listed service provider did n't even exist . "
citing another unnamed parliamentary insider , the news agency said the abuses amounted to almost 100 million euros .
davies told euobserver that his first reaction was " a degree of hysteria given the scale of the abuse that is taking place and given the fact that it has been kept secret . "
" a travesty of justice " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how transparent is the european parliament ?
davies , who contacted olaf about the report , called the decision to keep the report secret " absurd " and a " travesty of justice . "
" a parliament committed to openness and transparency has no right to try and keep secret details about how public money is used and misused .
and … we are talking about very large sums of money , " davies said .
though the eu parliament has not commented on the details of the report , spokeswoman marjory van den broeke said the audit confirmed that the remuneration system was " too complicated " and had become " very difficult to manage , both for the deputies and for the parliament 's administration . "
the european parliament 's secretary-general is now to propose a simpler system for hiring and administering staff , doing away with the current system which involves at least three different methods for meps to put together their team of assistants .
corruption a sensitive issue corruption cases at eu institutions are a sensitive issue after a scandal in the late 1990s brought down the entire european commission .
the commission and an assistant to an mep were charged with forgery . edith cresson , a former french prime minister who served as research and education commissioner in brussels from 1995 to 1999 , was accused of hiring a dentist from her home town as an advisor , despite being warned it was against eu rules .
the scandal eventually led to the collective resignation of the commission and its president at the time , jacques santer , in march 1999 .
last year , three italian nationals , including a civil servant working for the european commission were charged with forgery , corruption fraud and forming a criminal organization . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move has been prompted by concerns about motorists with cars that are not biofuel compatible . the german automobile association adac has warned that up to 1.5 million drivers will be unable to use the ethanol-richer gasoline , forcing them to switch to more expensive premium fuels when it is introduced . the government had based its plans on statistics from the german car industry which estimated that around 375,000 car owners would be adversely affected . environment minister sigmar gabriel has said on friday , feb .

the proposals to raise rate biofuel blending rates from 5 percent to 10 percent by 2010 had originally been welcomed . the christian democrats , currently in grand coalition with the social democrats , announced their opposition to the higher biofuel target on wednesday , saying that it would cost motorists with older vehicles an additional 150 million euros -lrb- $ 223 million -rrb- . the adac has also underlined that there could be other negative implications if germany takes this step alone , such as an increase of motorists tanking up in neighboring countries and the corresponding loss of tax revenue to the german government . potential problem for foreign visitors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hay fever sufferers and opponents of monocultural farming oppose biofuels foreign drivers may also not be sufficiently informed about any new blend and could inadvertently suffer motor damage , the organization warned . " this is not just a question of whether the planned introduction of e10 gasoline blended with 10 percent ethanol will be compatible with millions of cars , " said peter meyer , the head of the adac .
" the adac is also pleading for an honest assessment of all aspects of blending , including the overall ecological and social costs .

executives above hartz deny they knew about the practices . hartz testified at a court hearing that his seniors had no knowledge of the payments . under german law , works council leaders need to be consulted on major company decisions . another one-time vw works council member , ex-parliamentary deputy hans-juergen uhl , was fined 39,200 euros in june last year after admitting taking part in sex parties at company expense . the scandal originally centered on bribes from potential suppliers and the creation of dummy companies to secure lucrative contracts in india , angola and other nations , but it widened to include claims of prostitution , sex parties and illegally financed perks . the case has shone a revealing light on the cozy relationship between the company 's management and labor representatives . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

executives above hartz deny they knew about the practices . hartz testified at a court hearing that his seniors had no knowledge of the payments . under german law , works council leaders need to be consulted on major company decisions . another one-time vw works council member , ex-parliamentary deputy hans-juergen uhl , was fined 39,200 euros in june last year after admitting taking part in sex parties at company expense . the scandal originally centered on bribes from potential suppliers and the creation of dummy companies to secure lucrative contracts in india , angola and other nations , but it widened to include claims of prostitution , sex parties and illegally financed perks . the case has shone a revealing light on the cozy relationship between the company 's management and labor representatives . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bundestag passed a law friday , feb .
22 , giving men a legal framework to establish paternity . the law approved by the german parliament allows a man to request a paternity test against the will of his alleged child 's mother and without needing to resort to a legal challenge , which would automatically sever his legal ties to a child whom - in many cases - he has spent years raising . proving that he is not in fact the child 's biological father now no longer necessarily terminates their legal relationship .
thanks to the new legislation , a man can retain paternity even if tests prove he is not a child 's biological father . no more secrets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the implications of a legal challenge are no longer as dramatic until now , men convinced they were not in fact the biological father of children they were raising were left with few options other than secret dna tests . according to german justice minister brigitte zypries , some 20,000 secret tests are taken every year .
but ultimately , they carry no legal weight , because the results are not recognized by courts , and the family is left burdened by knowledge it can do little about . zypries has described the new law as an attempt to stop this secret testing , by conceding fathers the same right to establish paternity as other family members . " this is a good day for all those men who have in the past struggled to escape the burden of financial responsibility , " said the christian democratic faction 's legal expert juergen gehb . peter schaar , the federal commissioner for data protection hailed the law as a " sensible balance serving the interests of the child , mother and father . " child 's best interests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secret dna testing has been a boom business criticism of the new law came from the opposition green and left parties , however , who argued that it failed adequately to protect the interests of the child . but supporters say the new law makes the child 's interests a top priority .
a court may rule against a paternity test if it decides that a child is emotionally or psychologically unable to withstand the potential effect . although there are no official figures , experts estimate that up to 10 percent of children are raised by men who are not their biological fathers . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corruption -pipe- 22.02.2008 eu anti-fraud unit to probe parliamentary staff payments großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an internal report suggests that some eu parliamentarians have misused public funds the eu 's anti-fraud unit is to investigate an internal report compiled by the european parliament to see whether public funds were abused amid allegations of embezzlement and fraud within the organization . in what could become a major corruption scandal in the european union , a confidential report by the european parliament 's internal auditors says that some of the 784 members of parliament -lrb- meps -rrb- were employing family members while others had registered payments to firms which did not exist .
the demand for an investigation was made by charles davies , a member of the uk liberal democrat party and the parliament 's budget control committee .
davies , who was among a handful of meps allowed to see the report , perused its contents under supervision and was forbidden from taking notes or making photocopies .
huge sums involved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corruption cases at eu institutions are a sensitive issue the eu 's anti-fraud unit , olaf , which routinely checks internal audits made by the eu 's various institutions , will now scrutinize the secret internal study to determine whether there was an abuse of public eu funds .
complied by the eu parliament 's internal auditor , the report analyses 167 payments made in 2004 and 2005 to meps ' assistants .
each member of the european parliament is granted 16,000 euros -lrb- $ 23,500 -rrb- a month to pay assistants .
while some assistants work in brussels , other staffers work in their mep 's own country .
parliamentarians pay their staff 140 million euros a year , about 10 percent of the assembly 's overall expenditure .
news agency afp quoted an unnamed eu deputy who said , " the auditor found proof that in some cases the listed service provider did n't even exist . "
citing another unnamed parliamentary insider , the news agency said the abuses amounted to almost 100 million euros .
davies told euobserver that his first reaction was " a degree of hysteria given the scale of the abuse that is taking place and given the fact that it has been kept secret . "
" a travesty of justice " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how transparent is the european parliament ?
davies , who contacted olaf about the report , called the decision to keep the report secret " absurd " and a " travesty of justice . "
" a parliament committed to openness and transparency has no right to try and keep secret details about how public money is used and misused .

the move has been prompted by concerns about motorists with cars that are not biofuel compatible . the german automobile association adac has warned that up to 1.5 million drivers will be unable to use the ethanol-richer gasoline , forcing them to switch to more expensive premium fuels when it is introduced . the government had based its plans on statistics from the german car industry which estimated that around 375,000 car owners would be adversely affected . environment minister sigmar gabriel has said on friday , feb .
22 , that the measure to introduce a 10 percent blending rate would be torpedoed if the adac 's statistics proved to be correct . this is just the latest setback to the biofuel lobby .
critics have recently attacked the social and environmental cost of producing fuel from plants . ministry rechecking its facts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions of cars already run on the alternative fuel gabriel , a member of the social democratic party , told german broadcaster ard that his ministry had put the plans on hold a few weeks ago , so it could recheck the data .
the proposals to raise rate biofuel blending rates from 5 percent to 10 percent by 2010 had originally been welcomed . the christian democrats , currently in grand coalition with the social democrats , announced their opposition to the higher biofuel target on wednesday , saying that it would cost motorists with older vehicles an additional 150 million euros -lrb- $ 223 million -rrb- . the adac has also underlined that there could be other negative implications if germany takes this step alone , such as an increase of motorists tanking up in neighboring countries and the corresponding loss of tax revenue to the german government . potential problem for foreign visitors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hay fever sufferers and opponents of monocultural farming oppose biofuels foreign drivers may also not be sufficiently informed about any new blend and could inadvertently suffer motor damage , the organization warned . " this is not just a question of whether the planned introduction of e10 gasoline blended with 10 percent ethanol will be compatible with millions of cars , " said peter meyer , the head of the adac .
" the adac is also pleading for an honest assessment of all aspects of blending , including the overall ecological and social costs . " green groups have predicted that expanding the production of agricultural products such as corn , soybeans and rapeseed to make biofuels can lead to the destruction of ecosystems , increases in food prices and the dislocation of the rural poor . the world 's biggest carmaker , general motors , has , however , recently unveiled a system to create the biofuel from garbage - which would get around the environmental objections .

a second vw manager received a suspended sentence . two former vw executives were convicted friday , feb .
22 , in a bribery scandal that began some three years ago . klaus volkert , one-time leader of the volkswagen works council , was convicted of incitement to breach of trust and aiding and abetting it , as well as breaches of german labor law such as accepting improper bonuses and benefits . former volkswagen personnel chief , hans-joachim gebauer , was handed a suspended prison sentence on corruption charges . the trial was told that he sanctioned nearly 2 million euros -lrb- $ 3 million -rrb- in illegal payments to volkert after his boss had told him to " be generous " to the powerful labor figure . both volkert and gebauer say they plan to appeal the verdicts . dubious contracts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the company has been rocked by scandal the trial was one part of a broader investigation into claims that vw managers bribed labor leaders in exchange for support on policy . volkswagen says it did not discover until june 2005 that its funds were being spent on prostitutes and bribes for the head of the council , which is a legally-mandated body representing workers and salaried staff . volkert was accused of setting up a dubious contract between volkswagen and his brazilian mistress adriana barros , under which she received 400,000 euros without providing anything to volkswagen , europe 's largest carmaker , in return . allegedly , the couple received a further 290,000 euros for travel , hotel costs , shopping purchases and other " non-business-related activities .

executives above hartz deny they knew about the practices . hartz testified at a court hearing that his seniors had no knowledge of the payments . under german law , works council leaders need to be consulted on major company decisions . another one-time vw works council member , ex-parliamentary deputy hans-juergen uhl , was fined 39,200 euros in june last year after admitting taking part in sex parties at company expense . the scandal originally centered on bribes from potential suppliers and the creation of dummy companies to secure lucrative contracts in india , angola and other nations , but it widened to include claims of prostitution , sex parties and illegally financed perks . the case has shone a revealing light on the cozy relationship between the company 's management and labor representatives . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the demand for an investigation was made by charles davies , a member of the uk liberal democrat party and the parliament 's budget control committee .
davies , who was among a handful of meps allowed to see the report , perused its contents under supervision and was forbidden from taking notes or making photocopies .
huge sums involved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corruption cases at eu institutions are a sensitive issue the eu 's anti-fraud unit , olaf , which routinely checks internal audits made by the eu 's various institutions , will now scrutinize the secret internal study to determine whether there was an abuse of public eu funds .
complied by the eu parliament 's internal auditor , the report analyses 167 payments made in 2004 and 2005 to meps ' assistants .
each member of the european parliament is granted 16,000 euros -lrb- $ 23,500 -rrb- a month to pay assistants .
while some assistants work in brussels , other staffers work in their mep 's own country .
parliamentarians pay their staff 140 million euros a year , about 10 percent of the assembly 's overall expenditure .
news agency afp quoted an unnamed eu deputy who said , " the auditor found proof that in some cases the listed service provider did n't even exist . "
citing another unnamed parliamentary insider , the news agency said the abuses amounted to almost 100 million euros .
davies told euobserver that his first reaction was " a degree of hysteria given the scale of the abuse that is taking place and given the fact that it has been kept secret . "
" a travesty of justice " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how transparent is the european parliament ?
davies , who contacted olaf about the report , called the decision to keep the report secret " absurd " and a " travesty of justice . "
" a parliament committed to openness and transparency has no right to try and keep secret details about how public money is used and misused .
and … we are talking about very large sums of money , " davies said .
though the eu parliament has not commented on the details of the report , spokeswoman marjory van den broeke said the audit confirmed that the remuneration system was " too complicated " and had become " very difficult to manage , both for the deputies and for the parliament 's administration . "
the european parliament 's secretary-general is now to propose a simpler system for hiring and administering staff , doing away with the current system which involves at least three different methods for meps to put together their team of assistants .
corruption a sensitive issue corruption cases at eu institutions are a sensitive issue after a scandal in the late 1990s brought down the entire european commission .

the scandal eventually led to the collective resignation of the commission and its president at the time , jacques santer , in march 1999 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de corruption -pipe- 22.02.2008 eu anti-fraud unit to probe parliamentary staff payments großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an internal report suggests that some eu parliamentarians have misused public funds the eu 's anti-fraud unit is to investigate an internal report compiled by the european parliament to see whether public funds were abused amid allegations of embezzlement and fraud within the organization . in what could become a major corruption scandal in the european union , a confidential report by the european parliament 's internal auditors says that some of the 784 members of parliament -lrb- meps -rrb- were employing family members while others had registered payments to firms which did not exist .
the demand for an investigation was made by charles davies , a member of the uk liberal democrat party and the parliament 's budget control committee .
davies , who was among a handful of meps allowed to see the report , perused its contents under supervision and was forbidden from taking notes or making photocopies .
huge sums involved bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : corruption cases at eu institutions are a sensitive issue the eu 's anti-fraud unit , olaf , which routinely checks internal audits made by the eu 's various institutions , will now scrutinize the secret internal study to determine whether there was an abuse of public eu funds .
complied by the eu parliament 's internal auditor , the report analyses 167 payments made in 2004 and 2005 to meps ' assistants .
each member of the european parliament is granted 16,000 euros -lrb- $ 23,500 -rrb- a month to pay assistants .
while some assistants work in brussels , other staffers work in their mep 's own country .
parliamentarians pay their staff 140 million euros a year , about 10 percent of the assembly 's overall expenditure .
news agency afp quoted an unnamed eu deputy who said , " the auditor found proof that in some cases the listed service provider did n't even exist . "
citing another unnamed parliamentary insider , the news agency said the abuses amounted to almost 100 million euros .
davies told euobserver that his first reaction was " a degree of hysteria given the scale of the abuse that is taking place and given the fact that it has been kept secret . "
" a travesty of justice " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how transparent is the european parliament ?
davies , who contacted olaf about the report , called the decision to keep the report secret " absurd " and a " travesty of justice . "
" a parliament committed to openness and transparency has no right to try and keep secret details about how public money is used and misused .
and … we are talking about very large sums of money , " davies said .
though the eu parliament has not commented on the details of the report , spokeswoman marjory van den broeke said the audit confirmed that the remuneration system was " too complicated " and had become " very difficult to manage , both for the deputies and for the parliament 's administration . "
the european parliament 's secretary-general is now to propose a simpler system for hiring and administering staff , doing away with the current system which involves at least three different methods for meps to put together their team of assistants .
corruption a sensitive issue corruption cases at eu institutions are a sensitive issue after a scandal in the late 1990s brought down the entire european commission .
the commission and an assistant to an mep were charged with forgery . edith cresson , a former french prime minister who served as research and education commissioner in brussels from 1995 to 1999 , was accused of hiring a dentist from her home town as an advisor , despite being warned it was against eu rules .
the scandal eventually led to the collective resignation of the commission and its president at the time , jacques santer , in march 1999 .
last year , three italian nationals , including a civil servant working for the european commission were charged with forgery , corruption fraud and forming a criminal organization . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 22.02.2008 german government could jettison higher biofuel target großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are worries about the cost of blended gas for german motorists the german government has said it might scrap plans for a 5 percent rise in the amount of biofuel added to gasoline .
the move has been prompted by concerns about motorists with cars that are not biofuel compatible . the german automobile association adac has warned that up to 1.5 million drivers will be unable to use the ethanol-richer gasoline , forcing them to switch to more expensive premium fuels when it is introduced . the government had based its plans on statistics from the german car industry which estimated that around 375,000 car owners would be adversely affected . environment minister sigmar gabriel has said on friday , feb .
22 , that the measure to introduce a 10 percent blending rate would be torpedoed if the adac 's statistics proved to be correct . this is just the latest setback to the biofuel lobby .
critics have recently attacked the social and environmental cost of producing fuel from plants . ministry rechecking its facts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions of cars already run on the alternative fuel gabriel , a member of the social democratic party , told german broadcaster ard that his ministry had put the plans on hold a few weeks ago , so it could recheck the data .
the proposals to raise rate biofuel blending rates from 5 percent to 10 percent by 2010 had originally been welcomed . the christian democrats , currently in grand coalition with the social democrats , announced their opposition to the higher biofuel target on wednesday , saying that it would cost motorists with older vehicles an additional 150 million euros -lrb- $ 223 million -rrb- . the adac has also underlined that there could be other negative implications if germany takes this step alone , such as an increase of motorists tanking up in neighboring countries and the corresponding loss of tax revenue to the german government . potential problem for foreign visitors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hay fever sufferers and opponents of monocultural farming oppose biofuels foreign drivers may also not be sufficiently informed about any new blend and could inadvertently suffer motor damage , the organization warned . " this is not just a question of whether the planned introduction of e10 gasoline blended with 10 percent ethanol will be compatible with millions of cars , " said peter meyer , the head of the adac .
" the adac is also pleading for an honest assessment of all aspects of blending , including the overall ecological and social costs . " green groups have predicted that expanding the production of agricultural products such as corn , soybeans and rapeseed to make biofuels can lead to the destruction of ecosystems , increases in food prices and the dislocation of the rural poor . the world 's biggest carmaker , general motors , has , however , recently unveiled a system to create the biofuel from garbage - which would get around the environmental objections .

after a reported 10,000 turkish troops crossed into iraq thursday evening in an effort to destroy kurdish rebel bases in the mountainous region , the eu urged turkey to exercise restraint and respect iraq 's border . " we understand the concerns of turkey , " said eu foreign policy chief javier solana at the conclusion of a meeting of eu defense ministers in brdo , slovenia . both the eu and the us list the kurdish workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- as a terrorist group .
the eu , however , also does not want to see any action that might further destabilize iraq . " we think that this action in iraq is not the best response , " said solana .

" he also repeats his previous calls for an immediate end to continued incursions by pkk elements carrying out terrorist attacks from northern iraq , " haq said . the turkish troops ' ground incursion into iraq is the first confirmed operation of that kind since the us-led strike that toppled saddam hussein in 2003 . a " limited " operation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turkish-iraqi border has long been a cause for concern turkish soldiers crossed the border on thursday evening after a day of air and artillery attacks on suspected pkk targets in iraq , the general staff announced in a statement posted on its official website . the statement said the operation would be limited and that the troops would return to turkey in the " shortest time possible . " the ntv private television station reported that 10,000 had crossed the border . " this operation 's target is the pkk terrorist organization , " the statement said .
" it is a continuity of the air operations that have been carried out .
civilians and local elements who do not show hostility to turkish forces will not be negatively affected by this operation . " the military statement said the aim of the operation was to stop the pkk from using mountainous northern iraq as a base from which to launch attacks on turkey .
the general staff has previously estimated that there are around 4,000 to 5,000 pkk guerrillas based in northern iraq . respecting international law bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the moment , the border region is still covered with heavy snow more than 32,000 people have been killed since 1984 when the pkk launched its fight for independence or autonomy for the mainly kurdish-populated south-east part of turkey . germany is watching the turkish incursion into northern iraq with concern and is worried about possible escalation , a spokesman for the foreign ministry said in berlin on friday . the presence of turkish troops in northern iraq represented a " not inconsiderable risk of destabilization , " martin jaeger said . " we call on the turkish government in its fight against terrorism to reduce its steps to the minimum to protect its own people , " jaeger said . he warned against the possibility of escalation and said that international law had to be respected . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the police had been overwhelmed by the scale of the march , he said , which had begun as a state-backed rally . " the acts that were committed are absolutely unacceptable , absolutely regrettable , " jeremic said .
" they hurt serbia 's image abroad .

" solana welcomed the fact that serb president boris tadic had called for calm on thursday , but said he was less satisfied with the attitude of other members of the serb government . germany registers protest germany , whose embassy was also targeted in the violence , called on the serbian government to provide adequate security for foreign diplomatic missions . " if these events are repeated , this would have consequences for the future relationship between serbian and the european union , " german government spokesman thomas steg said . steg urged serbian politicians to " show responsibility " in their public statements on kosovo 's declaration of independence . before being called back to belgrade , the serbian ambassador in berlin told deutsche welle this week that serbia would never give up kosovo . foreign ministry spokesman martin jaeger said the serbian charge d 'affaires had been called in to be handed a formal protest at the violence . " pandora 's box " of separatism jaeger rejected reported remarks from moscow that the west had to bear part of the responsibility for the violence . on thursday , russian president vladimir putin 's representative to the european union warned recognition of kosovo 's independence would open " pandora 's box " of separatism in europe . " i warn you that you ca n't open pandora 's box , " sergei yastrzhembsky said . the eu is in the process of deploying a 1,900-strong policing and justice mission tasked with improving kosovo 's fledgling justice system and advising its authorities on how to run their newly independent state . eu policemen , judges and prosecutors are to be bolstered by 1,100 local staff . serbia and its powerful ally russia say the eu mission violates international law , a claim denied by officials in brussels . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move has been prompted by concerns about motorists with cars that are not biofuel compatible . the german automobile association adac has warned that up to 1.5 million drivers will be unable to use the ethanol-richer gasoline , forcing them to switch to more expensive premium fuels when it is introduced . the government had based its plans on statistics from the german car industry which estimated that around 375,000 car owners would be adversely affected . environment minister sigmar gabriel has said on friday , feb .
22 , that the measure to introduce a 10 percent blending rate would be torpedoed if the adac 's statistics proved to be correct . this is just the latest setback to the biofuel lobby .
critics have recently attacked the social and environmental cost of producing fuel from plants . ministry rechecking its facts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : millions of cars already run on the alternative fuel gabriel , a member of the social democratic party , told german broadcaster ard that his ministry had put the plans on hold a few weeks ago , so it could recheck the data .
the proposals to raise rate biofuel blending rates from 5 percent to 10 percent by 2010 had originally been welcomed . the christian democrats , currently in grand coalition with the social democrats , announced their opposition to the higher biofuel target on wednesday , saying that it would cost motorists with older vehicles an additional 150 million euros -lrb- $ 223 million -rrb- . the adac has also underlined that there could be other negative implications if germany takes this step alone , such as an increase of motorists tanking up in neighboring countries and the corresponding loss of tax revenue to the german government . potential problem for foreign visitors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hay fever sufferers and opponents of monocultural farming oppose biofuels foreign drivers may also not be sufficiently informed about any new blend and could inadvertently suffer motor damage , the organization warned . " this is not just a question of whether the planned introduction of e10 gasoline blended with 10 percent ethanol will be compatible with millions of cars , " said peter meyer , the head of the adac .
" the adac is also pleading for an honest assessment of all aspects of blending , including the overall ecological and social costs . " green groups have predicted that expanding the production of agricultural products such as corn , soybeans and rapeseed to make biofuels can lead to the destruction of ecosystems , increases in food prices and the dislocation of the rural poor . the world 's biggest carmaker , general motors , has , however , recently unveiled a system to create the biofuel from garbage - which would get around the environmental objections .

the bundestag passed a law friday , feb .
22 , giving men a legal framework to establish paternity . the law approved by the german parliament allows a man to request a paternity test against the will of his alleged child 's mother and without needing to resort to a legal challenge , which would automatically sever his legal ties to a child whom - in many cases - he has spent years raising . proving that he is not in fact the child 's biological father now no longer necessarily terminates their legal relationship .
thanks to the new legislation , a man can retain paternity even if tests prove he is not a child 's biological father . no more secrets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the implications of a legal challenge are no longer as dramatic until now , men convinced they were not in fact the biological father of children they were raising were left with few options other than secret dna tests . according to german justice minister brigitte zypries , some 20,000 secret tests are taken every year .
but ultimately , they carry no legal weight , because the results are not recognized by courts , and the family is left burdened by knowledge it can do little about . zypries has described the new law as an attempt to stop this secret testing , by conceding fathers the same right to establish paternity as other family members . " this is a good day for all those men who have in the past struggled to escape the burden of financial responsibility , " said the christian democratic faction 's legal expert juergen gehb . peter schaar , the federal commissioner for data protection hailed the law as a " sensible balance serving the interests of the child , mother and father . " child 's best interests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secret dna testing has been a boom business criticism of the new law came from the opposition green and left parties , however , who argued that it failed adequately to protect the interests of the child . but supporters say the new law makes the child 's interests a top priority .
a court may rule against a paternity test if it decides that a child is emotionally or psychologically unable to withstand the potential effect . although there are no official figures , experts estimate that up to 10 percent of children are raised by men who are not their biological fathers . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

turkey 's old secular elite , who see themselves as upholders of modern turkey 's founding father , mustafa kemal ataturk 's secular legacy , strongly oppose the lifting of the ban on the headscarf .
they see it as a slow slide towards an islamist state .
the issue has sparked huge demonstrations by secularists on the streets of the capital ankara in recent weeks .
" turkey is secular and will remain secular , " shouted some demonstrators earlier in the month during protests .
a majority of the demonstrators , who were waving the red and white star and crescent flag of turkey and bearing portraits of mustafa kemal ataturk , were women , including some who wore headscarves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secularist groups protested in large numbers in ankara some were wearing headbands that read " we are following your oath " along with pictures of ataturk , who set up the republic in 1923 on the strict separation of state and religion .
the headscarf ban in turkey dates back to the 1980s .
it was tightened in 1997 when the country 's powerful army , with public support , ousted a government they considered too islamist .
opinion polls however show that a majority of turks are in favor of easing the ban .
the rerform does n't include female professors or civil servants who will still be subject to the headscarf ban . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

even those who have been unhappy with mr german 's performance are concentrating on the party 's achievements in local government .
those are the themes the lib dems want to promote in llandudno this weekend .
the emphasis on unity comes as nick clegg prepares to speak on saturday , his first conference speech as uk party leader .
another way of looking at it might be , as one senior lib dem figure put it , of turning llandudno into the most boring conference ever for the media . "
building safer and greener communities and providing better value for money ... that 's the record we will be talking about " mike german , leader , welsh liberal democrats mr german has already announced he will stand down as leader at some unspecified point .
officially , he has said that will happen " as soon as seems sensible and practicable " but he would not be drawn on whether this would be his last conference as leader .
but for those within the party such as peter black , the south wales west am , and a potential leadership contender , the message is clear .
new faces " my understanding is that mike has said he will stand down before the summer recess , " he said .
and as for the conference - expect no fireworks on that score .
" everybody is concentrating on the council elections and that is what we are focusing on , " he added .
the conference needs to galvanise its members , but also to reach out to voters beyond urban areas in wales where the party has seen success at local level .
in cardiff there is a minority liberal democrat administration - and in swansea , wrexham and bridgend they are in coalition with other political parties .
turning their traditional concentration on local issues into votes in may 's council elections will be a central issue .
mr clegg , who became uk leader in december , will bash labour 's record in wales and emphasise his party 's plans to tackle inequality , he is also likely to underscore his call for more lib dem representation .
he has set a target of doubling the number of lib dem mps from the present 63 .
credentials a big ask , and wales will be expected to play its part .
doubling the number of welsh liberal democrat mps from the present four will be no easier .
the party has set up a number of policy reviews since the may assembly election - when they saw no advance on their six seats - including reports on health , education and how to emphasise the party 's " welshness " .
but it is the party 's local council performance that they will be emphasising .
in the last council elections in 2004 they increased the number of councillors by 50 % .
" people can see our record , " said mike german , who will speak to the conference on saturday afternoon .
" building safer and greener communities and providing better value for money .
that 's the record we will be talking about . "
sunday could see the nearest brush with controversy when there is a motion on changing the constitution over the leadership of the party .
if passed , that would make the leader of the parliamentary group , currently roger williams mp , deputy leader of the welsh lib dems .
the party will be emphasising local credentials and " unity " of purpose ahead of the council elections , so do n't expect any moves to unseat mike german .
we could have to wait until after may for that .

governing body , the chief pleas , has approved new reform laws which will lead to the introduction of a 28-member elected chamber .
elections under the new constitution will be held in december .
sark , 80 miles off the south coast , had been governed by a mix of landowners and elected people 's deputies .
' great relief ' there was pressure on sark to reform its feudal constitution to comply with the european human rights laws and other international obligations .
owners of the island 's 40 tenements -lrb- divisions of land -rrb- currently have an automatic seat in the chief pleas , and islanders chose 12 people 's deputies .
the first new assembly of chief pleas will take place in january next year .
deputy paul armorgie said : " it 's a great relief .
" we have been trying to achieve this for 10 years and now a line has been drawn .
" sark is finally moving from feudalism to democracy . "
in its day , sark had a very democratic system .
the settlers ran the island seneshal lt col reg guille sark , which is only 3 miles -lrb- 4.8km -rrb- long and 1.5 miles -lrb- 2.4k -rrb- wide , has a resident population of about 600 .
its government can directly trace its roots back to queen elizabeth i , who once granted the ruling " seigner " a fief on the tiny channel island .
the unelected descendents of 40 families brought in to colonise sark , after the french abandoned it in 1553 , have governed life on the island ever since .
but its feudal system of government started coming under pressure in 2000 in the light of human rights laws .
two proposals for reform were rejected in 2005 and 2007 until thursday night 's historic agreement .
mr armogie said : " ten years ago the mood on the island was that no change was wanted .
" but sark had to face up to its international obligations and it became clear that sark had to move on . "
" it is the passing of an era . "
' very successful ' seneshal lt col reg guille , who acts as a presiding officer of the chief pleas , said the original settlers of the island would be " horrified " at the change .
he said : " the system of government has proven for our small community to be a very successful way to manage our own affairs .
" they -lrb- the original settlers -rrb- would not understand our modern democracy .
" in its day , sark had a very democratic system .
the settlers ran the island . "
a spokesman for the ministry of justice said : " sark is seeking to reform its feudal constitution in order to make it comply with the european convention on human rights and other international obligations .
" the uk is responsible for ensuring that sark 's constitution meets those requirements and the uk is vulnerable to challenge if it does not . "

officially they are supposed to represent six ethnic groups here .
but some suspect that they actually represent six areas where ethnic albanians live and out of which extreme nationalists would like to fashion a greater albania .
those six regions are : kosovo , albania , western parts of -lrb- fyr -rrb- macedonia , parts of montenegro , the presevo valley in southern serbia and parts of northern greece .
the truth is probably that when officials of the european union saw the original version of the flag - with 12 stars , like the european flag - they demanded a change and so the kosovans just randomly chopped the number in half .
see a map of kosovo 's ethnic areas having said that , the question does arise : is kosovo 's independence the end of the disintegration of the old yugoslavia or might it continue ?
ethnic mix several regions spring to mind .
first and foremost are serb areas of kosovo , especially the north , which is already de facto part of serbia and home to more than 40,000 people .
kosovo profile population about two million majority ethnic albanian ; 10 % serb under un control since nato drove out serb forces in 1999 2,000-strong eu staff to take over from un after independence nato to stay to provide security independence proclaimed in pictures : celebrations east-west split over kosovo some kosovo albanians would not actually mind if northern kosovo was ceded to serbia , but only so long as serbia exchanged it for areas of south serbia , including the presevo valley where some 60,000 ethnic albanians live .
serbia has always rejected this idea though , partly because its main north-south road and railway link run through there .
a far more significant and adjacent ethnic albanian-inhabited territory is that of western -lrb- fyr -rrb- macedonia , an arc of land which borders albania , kosovo and serbia .
a quarter of -lrb- fyr -rrb- macedonia 's population of two million are ethnic albanians and they have close links with kosovo .
the former yugoslav republic , which calls itself simply " macedonia " , is engaged in a long-running name dispute with greece , which has a northern region called " macedonia " .
to kosovo 's north-east is the sandzak , an area divided between serbia and montenegro and which has a significant slav muslim population with traditional close ties to neighbouring bosnia .
in the serbian part of sandzak , muslims are in a slight majority but they are in a minority in the montenegrin part .
disintegration halted ?
anger mounts in serb corner of kosovo bosnia itself is made up of two entities : a serb one called the republika srpska -lrb- rs -rrb- and a bosniak -lrb- bosnian muslim -rrb- -croat federation .
bosnian serb leaders have often said that they would call for the right to secede if kosovo became independent .
in serbia itself the only other significant minority - apart from roma , who are widely dispersed - are ethnic hungarians , who live in vojvodina in the north and sometimes raise the issue of autonomy for their areas .
there are estimated to be some 290,000 of them but as a whole vojvodina , which has some limited autonomy of its own , is a majority serb area and so is extremely unlikely , as some have predicted , to ever demand its own independence .
in fact , despite the worst fears of many , it may well be that , at least for the foreseeable future , the disintegration process has stopped .
serbia itself could well now be heading for a period of isolation as its european integration bid has , for now , stalled .
thus , the leadership of the rs - who are always keen to use the kosovo issue in their battles against attempts to make bosnia more of a centralised state - may well , rhetoric aside , do nothing .
many serbs believe that kosovo 's independence means balkan borders have already been redrawn they may calculate that the prosperity of their voters - and thus their support - is better served being inside bosnia than attached to an isolated serbia , in which they , as leaders , would no longer count for anything .
likewise in -lrb- fyr -rrb- macedonia , ethnic albanian leaders have committed themselves to the state , believing the interests of their people are better served in moving as quickly as possible towards the eu , and also not to risk new balkan conflicts simply to be attached to kosovo .
besides this , large numbers of ethnic albanians live in and around the capital skopje and the very idea of dividing the city inevitably conjures up the appalling memory of the siege of sarajevo , the bosnian capital , between 1992 and 1995 .
never say never meanwhile in the presevo valley , which ethnic albanians call " eastern kosovo " , it appears that for now people are resigned to living in serbia whether they like it or not .
however , many there also believe that if the de facto partition of kosovo between serb and albanian areas , particularly in the north , were ever somehow legalised then it would be inconceivable for them to remain in serbia .
as for other regions - sandzak and hungarian parts of vojvodina - there is no chance of their status changing unless , of course , all balkan borders were somehow up to be redrawn , something -lrb- almost -rrb- no-one wants to do .
many serbs believe that kosovo 's independence means balkan borders have already been redrawn , because kosovo was technically part of serbia .
however , kosovo is being recognised within the borders it had not just as a serbian province , but also as an entity in its own right within the old yugoslavia .
kosovo albanians argue that they were not a republic with the right to secede , like croatia or slovenia , only because when the last yugoslav constitution was drawn up in 1974 they were the only part of that state which anyone could ever imagine seceding .
and that is a reason why one should never say never in politics .
just because something is now unimaginable and undesirable , does not mean it might not happen .

by tim judah balkans analyst critics fear that kosovo 's secession could spark further breakaways an interesting debate is taking place in the cafes of kosovo .
the question concerns the six stars of the country 's new flag .
officially they are supposed to represent six ethnic groups here .
but some suspect that they actually represent six areas where ethnic albanians live and out of which extreme nationalists would like to fashion a greater albania .
those six regions are : kosovo , albania , western parts of -lrb- fyr -rrb- macedonia , parts of montenegro , the presevo valley in southern serbia and parts of northern greece .
the truth is probably that when officials of the european union saw the original version of the flag - with 12 stars , like the european flag - they demanded a change and so the kosovans just randomly chopped the number in half .
see a map of kosovo 's ethnic areas having said that , the question does arise : is kosovo 's independence the end of the disintegration of the old yugoslavia or might it continue ?
ethnic mix several regions spring to mind .
first and foremost are serb areas of kosovo , especially the north , which is already de facto part of serbia and home to more than 40,000 people .
kosovo profile population about two million majority ethnic albanian ; 10 % serb under un control since nato drove out serb forces in 1999 2,000-strong eu staff to take over from un after independence nato to stay to provide security independence proclaimed in pictures : celebrations east-west split over kosovo some kosovo albanians would not actually mind if northern kosovo was ceded to serbia , but only so long as serbia exchanged it for areas of south serbia , including the presevo valley where some 60,000 ethnic albanians live .
serbia has always rejected this idea though , partly because its main north-south road and railway link run through there .
a far more significant and adjacent ethnic albanian-inhabited territory is that of western -lrb- fyr -rrb- macedonia , an arc of land which borders albania , kosovo and serbia .
a quarter of -lrb- fyr -rrb- macedonia 's population of two million are ethnic albanians and they have close links with kosovo .
the former yugoslav republic , which calls itself simply " macedonia " , is engaged in a long-running name dispute with greece , which has a northern region called " macedonia " .
to kosovo 's north-east is the sandzak , an area divided between serbia and montenegro and which has a significant slav muslim population with traditional close ties to neighbouring bosnia .
in the serbian part of sandzak , muslims are in a slight majority but they are in a minority in the montenegrin part .
disintegration halted ?
anger mounts in serb corner of kosovo bosnia itself is made up of two entities : a serb one called the republika srpska -lrb- rs -rrb- and a bosniak -lrb- bosnian muslim -rrb- -croat federation .
bosnian serb leaders have often said that they would call for the right to secede if kosovo became independent .
in serbia itself the only other significant minority - apart from roma , who are widely dispersed - are ethnic hungarians , who live in vojvodina in the north and sometimes raise the issue of autonomy for their areas .
there are estimated to be some 290,000 of them but as a whole vojvodina , which has some limited autonomy of its own , is a majority serb area and so is extremely unlikely , as some have predicted , to ever demand its own independence .
in fact , despite the worst fears of many , it may well be that , at least for the foreseeable future , the disintegration process has stopped .
serbia itself could well now be heading for a period of isolation as its european integration bid has , for now , stalled .
thus , the leadership of the rs - who are always keen to use the kosovo issue in their battles against attempts to make bosnia more of a centralised state - may well , rhetoric aside , do nothing .
many serbs believe that kosovo 's independence means balkan borders have already been redrawn they may calculate that the prosperity of their voters - and thus their support - is better served being inside bosnia than attached to an isolated serbia , in which they , as leaders , would no longer count for anything .

the club contacted european football 's governing body uefa after the 0-0 draw at atletico madrid in the uefa cup .
club chairman phil gartside said he would take the issue to the " highest level " to get an explanation .
bolton said there were " a number of assaults and unprovoked baton charges " and about 17 fans were injured .
british police also criticised spanish officers ' " heavy-handed " tactics .
james kirk , one of an estimated 3,500 bolton fans in madrid , said : " we came out of the stadium and just as we came down loads of police with shields and batons rushed back just where we 'd come from . " ... unfortunately the madrid police have a reputation for not taking dissent very well " ch supt dave lea , greater manchester police " they were battering people to the ground - it was absolutely brutal and appalling .
i 've been to spain many , many times but i tell you i do n't want to go again . "
another fan said : " i 've been all over the country watching bolton and the police in spain behaved like animals .
i have never seen anything like it . "
mr gartside said : " i have great sympathy for any of our supporters who have been injured by what is clearly an overreaction by the spanish police .
" bolton wanderers football club will be pursuing the matter at the highest level and seeking an explanation from the spanish authorities . "
the football club is liaising with greater manchester police -lrb- gmp -rrb- and the british embassy to try to establish what happened .
junior officers ch supt dave lea , of gmp , said the problems started when police baton charged hundreds of madrid fans out of the stadium .
" that incident has probably set the tone for the policing of the whole match and unfortunately the madrid police have a reputation for not taking dissent very well , " he said .
the police chief said a number of sporadic incidents followed which resulted in police being " very heavy-handed " with the bolton fans , and he blamed senior officers for the problems .
" they did n't have enough control over their junior officers who were far too quick to use their batons rather than talking to the fans who would comply with their instructions .
" lessons need to be learned and i will make sure that my observations will be captured in a full report for the uefa security investigation that i know is going to be forthcoming , " he added .
next stage the result of the match at the vicente calderon stadium meant bolton won the tie 1-0 on aggregate to reach the last-16 stage of the competition .
before their uefa cup match against red star belgrade in december , bolton fans were detained at a hotel in the serbian capital .
local police acted amid security fears after trouble involving red star supporters the previous weekend .
last april , a number of tottenham fans were injured at their uefa cup tie in seville in violent clashes with spanish riot police .

james kirk , one of an estimated 3,500 bolton fans in madrid , said : " we came out of the stadium and just as we came down loads of police with shields and batons rushed back just where we 'd come from . ... unfortunately the madrid police have a reputation for not taking dissent very well ch supt dave lea , greater manchester police " they were battering people to the ground - it was absolutely brutal and appalling .
i 've been to spain many , many times but i tell you i do n't want to go again . "
another fan said : " i 've been all over the country watching bolton and the police in spain behaved like animals .
i have never seen anything like it . "
mr gartside said : " i have great sympathy for any of our supporters who have been injured by what is clearly an overreaction by the spanish police .
" bolton wanderers football club will be pursuing the matter at the highest level and seeking an explanation from the spanish authorities . "
the football club is liaising with greater manchester police -lrb- gmp -rrb- and the british embassy to try to establish what happened .
junior officers ch supt dave lea , of gmp , said the problems started when police baton charged hundreds of madrid fans out of the stadium .
" that incident has probably set the tone for the policing of the whole match and unfortunately the madrid police have a reputation for not taking dissent very well , " he said .
the police chief said a number of sporadic incidents followed which resulted in police being " very heavy-handed " with the bolton fans , and he blamed senior officers for the problems .
" they did n't have enough control over their junior officers who were far too quick to use their batons rather than talking to the fans who would comply with their instructions .
" lessons need to be learned and i will make sure that my observations will be captured in a full report for the uefa security investigation that i know is going to be forthcoming , " he added .
next stage the result of the match at the vicente calderon stadium meant bolton won the tie 1-0 on aggregate to reach the last-16 stage of the competition .
before their uefa cup match against red star belgrade in december , bolton fans were detained at a hotel in the serbian capital .
local police acted amid security fears after trouble involving red star supporters the previous weekend .
last april , a number of tottenham fans were injured at their uefa cup tie in seville in violent clashes with spanish riot police .

the club contacted european football 's governing body uefa after the 0-0 draw at atletico madrid in the uefa cup .
club chairman phil gartside said he would take the issue to the " highest level " to get an explanation .
bolton said there were " a number of assaults and unprovoked baton charges " and about 17 fans were injured .
british police also criticised spanish officers ' " heavy-handed " tactics .
james kirk , one of an estimated 3,500 bolton fans in madrid , said : " we came out of the stadium and just as we came down loads of police with shields and batons rushed back just where we 'd come from . ... unfortunately the madrid police have a reputation for not taking dissent very well ch supt dave lea , greater manchester police " they were battering people to the ground - it was absolutely brutal and appalling .
i 've been to spain many , many times but i tell you i do n't want to go again . "
another fan said : " i 've been all over the country watching bolton and the police in spain behaved like animals .
i have never seen anything like it . "
mr gartside said : " i have great sympathy for any of our supporters who have been injured by what is clearly an overreaction by the spanish police .
" bolton wanderers football club will be pursuing the matter at the highest level and seeking an explanation from the spanish authorities . "
the football club is liaising with greater manchester police -lrb- gmp -rrb- and the british embassy to try to establish what happened .
junior officers ch supt dave lea , of gmp , said the problems started when police baton charged hundreds of madrid fans out of the stadium .
" that incident has probably set the tone for the policing of the whole match and unfortunately the madrid police have a reputation for not taking dissent very well , " he said .
the police chief said a number of sporadic incidents followed which resulted in police being " very heavy-handed " with the bolton fans , and he blamed senior officers for the problems .
" they did n't have enough control over their junior officers who were far too quick to use their batons rather than talking to the fans who would comply with their instructions .
" lessons need to be learned and i will make sure that my observations will be captured in a full report for the uefa security investigation that i know is going to be forthcoming , " he added .
next stage the result of the match at the vicente calderon stadium meant bolton won the tie 1-0 on aggregate to reach the last-16 stage of the competition .
before their uefa cup match against red star belgrade in december , bolton fans were detained at a hotel in the serbian capital .
local police acted amid security fears after trouble involving red star supporters the previous weekend .
last april , a number of tottenham fans were injured at their uefa cup tie in seville in violent clashes with spanish riot police .

the club contacted european football 's governing body uefa after the 0-0 draw at atletico madrid in the uefa cup .
club chairman phil gartside said he would take the issue to the " highest level " to get an explanation .
bolton said there were " a number of assaults and unprovoked baton charges " and about 17 fans were injured .
british police also criticised spanish officers ' " heavy-handed " tactics .
james kirk , one of an estimated 3,500 bolton fans in madrid , said : " we came out of the stadium and just as we came down loads of police with shields and batons rushed back just where we 'd come from . ... unfortunately the madrid police have a reputation for not taking dissent very well ch supt dave lea , greater manchester police " they were battering people to the ground - it was absolutely brutal and appalling .
i 've been to spain many , many times but i tell you i do n't want to go again . "
another fan said : " i 've been all over the country watching bolton and the police in spain behaved like animals .
i have never seen anything like it . "
mr gartside said : " i have great sympathy for any of our supporters who have been injured by what is clearly an overreaction by the spanish police .
" bolton wanderers football club will be pursuing the matter at the highest level and seeking an explanation from the spanish authorities . "
the football club is liaising with greater manchester police -lrb- gmp -rrb- and the british embassy to try to establish what happened .
junior officers ch supt dave lea , of gmp , said the problems started when police baton charged hundreds of madrid fans out of the stadium .
" that incident has probably set the tone for the policing of the whole match and unfortunately the madrid police have a reputation for not taking dissent very well , " he said .
the police chief said a number of sporadic incidents followed which resulted in police being " very heavy-handed " with the bolton fans , and he blamed senior officers for the problems .
" they did n't have enough control over their junior officers who were far too quick to use their batons rather than talking to the fans who would comply with their instructions .
" lessons need to be learned and i will make sure that my observations will be captured in a full report for the uefa security investigation that i know is going to be forthcoming , " he added .
next stage the result of the match at the vicente calderon stadium meant bolton won the tie 1-0 on aggregate to reach the last-16 stage of the competition .
before their uefa cup match against red star belgrade in december , bolton fans were detained at a hotel in the serbian capital .
local police acted amid security fears after trouble involving red star supporters the previous weekend .
last april , a number of tottenham fans were injured at their uefa cup tie in seville in violent clashes with spanish riot police .

the club contacted european football 's governing body uefa after the 0-0 draw at atletico madrid in the uefa cup .
club chairman phil gartside said he would take the issue to the " highest level " to get an explanation .
bolton said there were " a number of assaults and unprovoked baton charges " and about 17 fans were injured .
british police also criticised spanish officers ' " heavy-handed " tactics .
james kirk , one of an estimated 3,500 bolton fans in madrid , said : " we came out of the stadium and just as we came down loads of police with shields and batons rushed back just where we 'd come from . ... unfortunately the madrid police have a reputation for not taking dissent very well ch supt dave lea , greater manchester police " they were battering people to the ground - it was absolutely brutal and appalling .
i 've been to spain many , many times but i tell you i do n't want to go again . "
another fan said : " i 've been all over the country watching bolton and the police in spain behaved like animals .
i have never seen anything like it . "
mr gartside said : " i have great sympathy for any of our supporters who have been injured by what is clearly an overreaction by the spanish police .
" bolton wanderers football club will be pursuing the matter at the highest level and seeking an explanation from the spanish authorities . "
the football club is liaising with greater manchester police -lrb- gmp -rrb- and the british embassy to try to establish what happened .
junior officers ch supt dave lea , of gmp , said the problems started when police baton charged hundreds of madrid fans out of the stadium .
" that incident has probably set the tone for the policing of the whole match and unfortunately the madrid police have a reputation for not taking dissent very well , " he said .
the police chief said a number of sporadic incidents followed which resulted in police being " very heavy-handed " with the bolton fans , and he blamed senior officers for the problems .
" they did n't have enough control over their junior officers who were far too quick to use their batons rather than talking to the fans who would comply with their instructions .
" lessons need to be learned and i will make sure that my observations will be captured in a full report for the uefa security investigation that i know is going to be forthcoming , " he added .

pixar animation ratatouille , nominated for five academy awards , has charmed both the critics and the film-going public .
but for mark walsh , a supervising animator on the film , landing so many oscars nods was just the cherry on the cake .
" i had so much fun working on this film , " he says .
" it was one of the best experiences i 've ever had . "
he says the most remarkable nomination is director and writer brad bird 's nod for best original screenplay .
bird joined the project years after it started , when , walsh admits , it was a " mess " .
he had to rewrite the film from scratch , weaving in the script as the animators worked their magic .
" he wrote the movie while we were making it and then it gets nominated for an academy award !
the man is outstanding , " says walsh , who previously worked on oscar winner finding nemo .
ratatouille 's oscar hopes best original screenplay best animated feature film best music -lrb- original score -rrb- best sound mixing best sound editing " i do n't know how it came together , but it did .
" it was amazing to see .
he could n't even write it in order , he could only write pieces of it based on what models we had ready to animate .
" for months and months he only wrote scenes with the human characters in it , and when the rats were ready we started animating rat stuff . "
rat poison ratatouille tells the tale of sewer rat remy , who has passion for cooking and food .
he is a misfit among his tribe of rats , using his finely-honed sense of smell to sniff out rat poison .
mark walsh previously worked on finding nemo when the opportunity of working in the restaurant named after his culinary idol arises , remy grabs it with both paws .
one of the main challenges for the film-makers was to overcome the " ick " factor of having a rat in a posh parisian restaurant , by making him as appealing as possible .
" the artists came at ratatouille with an eye for appeal - he just looks cute , and it would be very easy to make a rat not so , " explains walsh .
" by keeping his hands up by his face , like a baby or a puppy , it makes him cuter .
" we also had rats in the studio so we could observe them , and watch them move . "
there was also the challenge of bringing the kitchen to life .
some of the animation team worked in a paris restaurant to learn the art of cooking .
while film fans raved over ratatouille - it took $ 616m -lrb- £ 313m -rrb- at the global box office and has just gone to number one in the uk dvd chart - it was never in the running for best picture at the oscars .
i look forward to the future when animation can be alongside a live action film for best picture mark walsh despite its multiple nominations - often an indicator of best picture success - it competes against persepolis and surf 's up in the less prestigious category of best animated feature .
the absence of animation in the best feature category is something walsh feels is necessary - for now .
" i look forward to the future when animation can be alongside a live action film for best picture , " he says .
" if it is a good picture and everyone loves it then why not ? "
" animation has been treated as a genre , rather than a technique .
we need more experimentation for that to change .
3d challenge next for pixar is wall-e -lrb- short for waste allocation load lifter earth-class -rrb- about the last little robot on earth , due to hit cinemas in july .
and the first two toy story movies are also to be remade in 3d , ahead of the release of toy story 3 in june 2010 .
the cast of toy story are returning in 3d format so what new challenges will pixar face with a 3d film ?
" we do n't know yet , " laughs walsh .
" we 're just starting out .
presumably it should be easy - we have our little virtual characters , we just set up another virtual camera , but we 'll see .
" but resurrecting buzz and woody for toy story 3 almost did n't happen .
" somebody had kept one of the old computers as a coffee table in their office , and thank goodness they did because that was the only machine in the building that could load buzz and we were able to salvage those characters .
" 3d is exciting because it 's new and it 's cutting edge .
it may last , it may not , but at least we are trying it and that keeps it interesting . "

pixar animation ratatouille , nominated for five academy awards , has charmed both the critics and the film-going public .
but for mark walsh , a supervising animator on the film , landing so many oscars nods was just the cherry on the cake .
" i had so much fun working on this film , " he says .
" it was one of the best experiences i 've ever had . "
he says the most remarkable nomination is director and writer brad bird 's nod for best original screenplay .
bird joined the project years after it started , when , walsh admits , it was a " mess " .
he had to rewrite the film from scratch , weaving in the script as the animators worked their magic .
" he wrote the movie while we were making it and then it gets nominated for an academy award !
the man is outstanding , " says walsh , who previously worked on oscar winner finding nemo .
ratatouille 's oscar hopes best original screenplay best animated feature film best music -lrb- original score -rrb- best sound mixing best sound editing " i do n't know how it came together , but it did .
" it was amazing to see .
he could n't even write it in order , he could only write pieces of it based on what models we had ready to animate .
" for months and months he only wrote scenes with the human characters in it , and when the rats were ready we started animating rat stuff . "
rat poison ratatouille tells the tale of sewer rat remy , who has passion for cooking and food .
he is a misfit among his tribe of rats , using his finely-honed sense of smell to sniff out rat poison .
mark walsh previously worked on finding nemo when the opportunity of working in the restaurant named after his culinary idol arises , remy grabs it with both paws .
one of the main challenges for the film-makers was to overcome the " ick " factor of having a rat in a posh parisian restaurant , by making him as appealing as possible .
" the artists came at ratatouille with an eye for appeal - he just looks cute , and it would be very easy to make a rat not so , " explains walsh .
" by keeping his hands up by his face , like a baby or a puppy , it makes him cuter .
" we also had rats in the studio so we could observe them , and watch them move . "
there was also the challenge of bringing the kitchen to life .
some of the animation team worked in a paris restaurant to learn the art of cooking .
while film fans raved over ratatouille - it took $ 616m -lrb- £ 313m -rrb- at the global box office and has just gone to number one in the uk dvd chart - it was never in the running for best picture at the oscars .

sir christopher meyer told bbc wales ' dragon 's eye programme the complaint related to an inaccuracy in a report .
but he said journalists had " every right to report " on the deaths .
vincent and sharon pritchard , whose son nathaniel , 15 , died , have said reports " glamorised " ways of taking one 's life to young people .
addressing a press conference at south wales police headquarters on tuesday , mr and mrs pritchard said : " we have lost our son and the media reporting of this has made it more unbearable .
" we feel the media coverage could trigger other people who are already feeling low to take their own lives . "
' newsworthy ' bridgend mp madeleine moon has also said the media were " now part of the problem " .
sir christopher said he would be speaking to ms moon next week and he expected her to make a complaint .
he said schools and other organisations in the affected area had been told of their rights regarding the press .
however , sir christopher said : " this is something which the press have every right to report on .
" it is something which is newsworthy in an entirely justifiable way .
" my concern at the pcc is that journalists do not behave in a way that breaches our code of practice , which covers intrusion into grief particularly , and harassment of the friends and relatives of those who have tragically died . "
responding to anecdotal evidence of elements of harassment and money being offered to families for interviews sir christopher said the commission had heard the evidence but needed " hard facts " .
but he said the commission had tightened its regulations on reporting suicides and sir christopher stressed reporting too much detail was unacceptable .
porthcawl counselling service has asked health minister edwina hart for help to cope with the demands it faces .

sam lutfi must not come within 250 yards -lrb- 228 metres -rrb- of the singer until 17 march , us district court judge philip gutierrez said .
in papers requesting the order three weeks ago , ms spears ' mother lynne claimed mr lutfi had drugged the star , cut her home phone and yelled at her .
earlier this week , ms spears was denied access to her two young sons .
the singer has not seen her children since 3 january , when she became agitated and was taken to hospital at the end of a court-monitored visit with them .
ms spears , who recently spent six days in a psychiatric unit , has repeatedly asked the court to reinstate her visitation rights , but her requests were rejected .
her father , james spears , has been granted " temporary conservatorship " over his 26-year-old daughter 's life and her estate , thought to be worth $ 100m -lrb- £ 50.8m -rrb- .
conservatorships are generally granted for people deemed to be unable to care for themselves or their affairs .
a lawyer for mr spears wrote in court papers that it had taken three weeks to serve the restraining order on mr lutfi , who was " apparently evading service " .
the order means mr lutfi must not contact ms spears in any way and must stay away from the homes of her parents and her siblings .
mr spears has also been granted permission to sack his daughter 's business manager , howard grossman .

sam lutfi must not come within 250 yards -lrb- 228 metres -rrb- of the singer until 17 march , us district court judge philip gutierrez said .
in papers requesting the order three weeks ago , ms spears ' mother lynne claimed mr lutfi had drugged the star , cut her home phone and yelled at her .
earlier this week , ms spears was denied access to her two young sons .
the singer has not seen her children since 3 january , when she became agitated and was taken to hospital at the end of a court-monitored visit with them .
ms spears , who recently spent six days in a psychiatric unit , has repeatedly asked the court to reinstate her visitation rights , but her requests were rejected .
her father , james spears , has been granted " temporary conservatorship " over his 26-year-old daughter 's life and her estate , thought to be worth $ 100m -lrb- £ 50.8m -rrb- .
conservatorships are generally granted for people deemed to be unable to care for themselves or their affairs .
a lawyer for mr spears wrote in court papers that it had taken three weeks to serve the restraining order on mr lutfi , who was " apparently evading service " .
the order means mr lutfi must not contact ms spears in any way and must stay away from the homes of her parents and her siblings .
mr spears has also been granted permission to sack his daughter 's business manager , howard grossman .

he turned to revolutionary politics as a young man .
after two years in jail for mounting a failed coup , he went into exile in mexico .
-lrb- castro is standing on right of woman in white . -rrb-
castro finally assumed power in cuba on new year 's day , 1959 , after ousting fulgencio batista .
in 1961 , castro led his troops against 1,500 cuban exiles .
the exiles were supported by the cia , who landed in the bay of pigs with the purpose of ousting his government .
perhaps castro 's biggest test came in 1962 , when us president kennedy warned him to remove soviet missiles from cuba .
in the end , soviet leader nikita khrushchev and castro removed the missiles , and the threat of nuclear war was averted .
he enjoyed sports , even the us game of baseball , playing here at a teachers ' college in the sierra maestra in 1962 .
many liberal cubans considered him an oppressive dictator .
thousands fled their homeland for the us , often on dangerous makeshift rafts .
but fidel castro retained enough public support to become one of the world 's longest-serving leaders .
after intestinal surgery in 2006 , he handed day-to-day power to his brother raul .
then he made only rare recorded appearances , before stepping down in february 2008 .
