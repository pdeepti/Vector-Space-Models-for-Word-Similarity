israel is in both uefa and the eurovision song contest - competing in the latter rather more successfully in recent years than , say , france or britain .

of course , critics would say that it takes a lot more than just joining a european organization to count as properly " european . "

but while nato invited turkey into the club as long ago as 1952 , the eu is still arguing whether it is sufficiently european to join - with french president nicolas sarkozy , for one , saying it is not .
a similar row broke out in july 2003 after italy 's famously unpredictable prime minister silvio berlusconi started his six-month eu presidency by saying that israel , among others , should join .
israel does not " fulfill the geographical criteria " for membership , one brussels official retorted icily .

some authorities say that , as in the case of israel , " european " should be interpreted in a strictly geographical sense to mean " somewhere between the atlantic and the ural mountains . "
but that argument falls apart as soon as you consider that turkey , with a small but significant part of its territory in europe , is still not accepted as european , but that french guyana is .
others say that " european " is more of a cultural term , a combination of greek , latin , christian and humanist traditions .
that does justify the exclusion of turkey , with its culture based on ottoman islam .

a final argument is that " european " means " based on european values " such as democracy , the rule of law and human rights .
they are certainly values which european leaders talk about a lot .
but any map of europe based on those criteria would look pretty moth-eaten , as it would feature gaps over countries such as belarus , russia and even , arguably , eu members bulgaria and italy .
in fact , given the lack of expert agreement on what such a popular word really means , the main definition of " european " in diplomatic circles these days seems to be , " someone we want on our side .

his plan was that the nazis would get europe and britain would take the world . james lonsdale-bryans , a well-educated fascist sympathizer and novice politician , traveled to italy in the first months of world war ii to negotiate a deal with the german ambassador in rome , ulrich von hassell , revealed the archives from britain 's foreign office . previously classified files concerning londsdale-bryans ' actions were released on sunday , aug .
31 , as part of the freedom of information act . " bryans ' idea is that the world ought to be divided into two parts , that germany should be given a free hand in europe and that the british empire should run the rest of the world , " read a file from the archive . the newly released documents indicate that , following his visit to italy , londsdale-bryans took his plan to then foreign secretary lord edward halifax .
he apparently also attempted to contact top us officials , including dwight d. eisenhower , who was supreme commander of the allied forces in europe during the war , and even high-ranking nazi leaders . " there is no doubt that bryans with or without the authority of lord halifax endeavored to go to germany to contact -lrb- german foreign minister -rrb- ribbentrop and if possible hitler himself , " showed one file . keeping it under wraps he soon became an embarrassment to the british foreign office , which feared he would take his story to the press . one letter from the foreign office suggests bryans was only spared jail in order to avoid publicizing his unpopular plan : " although there seems to be a good deal to be said for locking him up to prevent him airing his views to all and sundry , i understand that if this is done it will inevitably involve his bringing up the question of his contacts with the foreign office and the facilities that afforded him to go to italy , " it read . the political climate drastically changed in 1940 , however , when germany invaded france and a policy of appeasement became less popular .
winston churchill replaced neville chamberlain as prime minister and halifax was sent to washington as britain 's ambassador to the us . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 31.08.2008 georgia crisis threatens eu bid for more energy sources großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in energy , the eu is more likely to cooperate with russia than bypass it , said one expert europe 's declared goal to shift away from russian oil and gas has always beem a challenge .
but it 's become even more difficult after moscow 's assault on georgia , analysts say . georgia 's strategic role as a pipeline transit country , run by a us-backed leadership that moscow detests , formed the backdrop to the conflict that erupted in early august .
after russian troops handed georgian president mikheil saakashvili a humiliating battlefield defeat , the region 's fragility and moscow 's clout are more obvious than ever .
monday 's emergency eu summit on georgia will not change that in the short term .
the european union will now be less likely to use " volatile transit routes " that bypass russia and tend toward " solid and stable " energy ties with moscow , said ivailo vesselinov , an economist at investment bank dresdner kleinwort in london .
" the signs point to the eu trying to cooperate more with russia , rather than less , " he said .
diversion effort may be postponed eu and us efforts to get around russia are focused on nabucco , a 7.9-billion-euro -lrb- $ 11.6-billion -rrb- pipeline slated to run caspian gas to central and western europe from georgia via turkey and bulgaria to austria .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former soviet states are often wary of russia 's motives nabucco 's vienna-based head office says the 3,300-kilometer -lrb- 2,050-mile -rrb- project remains on track , with construction to begin in 2010 and gas to start flowing in 2013 .
analysts are not so sure .
" i do n't think it 's dead , but it will be postponed ... because of the political uncertainties and the military intervention , " said claudia kemfert , an energy expert at the diw economic think tank in berlin .
" that 's a major difficulty for the project . "
a pipeline deal signed last year by georgia , poland , ukraine , azerbaijan and lithuania to pump caspian sea oil to western europe also seems more uncertain , vesselinov said .
russia is the eu 's single largest energy source , supplying 28 percent of the bloc 's oil and gas , according to the european commission .
some ex-communist countries , like the baltics or slovakia , depend on russia for all of their gas .
key nations in the old eu , notably germany , have long worked to expand energy ties with russia , seeking cooperation rather than confrontation .
looking for alternatives in parallel , the search for alternatives was on .
the baku-tbilisi-ceyhan oil pipeline , involving british petroleum , azerbaijan , georgia and turkey , was launched in the late 1990s with eu and us backing , a response to the perceived need to lessen dependence on russia .
us president george w bush even appointed a family friend as special envoy for eurasian energy , brussels-based diplomat c boyden gray .
but while analysts in washington have tended to see the russian invasion of georgia as a strategic defeat for us interests , europeans have taken a more muted view .
former german chancellor gerhard schroeder , who heads the shareholder committee of a russian-german pipeline consortium , firmly took russia 's side .
" only dreamers can run after the notion of a western europe independent of russian oil and gas , " he told der spiegel magazine .
" creating mutual dependence also creates mutual security . "
russian energy splits europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltic sea pipeline will increase russia 's share of germany 's gas supply nord stream , the company schroeder is involved with , is building a pipeline under the baltic sea to move russian gas to germany .
the project will raise russia 's share of germany 's gas supply from about 40 percent to 50 percent , kemfert said .
moscow also is countering nabucco with the south stream project , designed to route russian gas under the black sea to bulgaria and serbia , with one leg ending at the same austrian terminal as nabucco and the other in italy .
nord stream has created fissures in the eu similar to the east-west split over the iraq war : poland and the baltics , generally suspicious of russian intentions , have raised environmental concerns about the undersea pipeline .
fighting in georgia appears to have trumped those worries . " our german partners must stop viewing the baltic sea pipeline as a purely economic project .
they should understand that russia can use the gas conduit to keep europe in check , " poland 's rzeczpospolita daily said in an editorial .
russia 's muscle-flexing may yet spur europe 's push for other energy sources , including wind and solar energy - already a european strength - and liquefied natural gas transported in tankers .
" for sure , the energy debate will start now , " kemfert said . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his plan was that the nazis would get europe and britain would take the world . james lonsdale-bryans , a well-educated fascist sympathizer and novice politician , traveled to italy in the first months of world war ii to negotiate a deal with the german ambassador in rome , ulrich von hassell , revealed the archives from britain 's foreign office . previously classified files concerning londsdale-bryans ' actions were released on sunday , aug .
31 , as part of the freedom of information act . " bryans ' idea is that the world ought to be divided into two parts , that germany should be given a free hand in europe and that the british empire should run the rest of the world , " read a file from the archive . the newly released documents indicate that , following his visit to italy , londsdale-bryans took his plan to then foreign secretary lord edward halifax .
he apparently also attempted to contact top us officials , including dwight d. eisenhower , who was supreme commander of the allied forces in europe during the war , and even high-ranking nazi leaders . " there is no doubt that bryans with or without the authority of lord halifax endeavored to go to germany to contact -lrb- german foreign minister -rrb- ribbentrop and if possible hitler himself , " showed one file . keeping it under wraps he soon became an embarrassment to the british foreign office , which feared he would take his story to the press . one letter from the foreign office suggests bryans was only spared jail in order to avoid publicizing his unpopular plan : " although there seems to be a good deal to be said for locking him up to prevent him airing his views to all and sundry , i understand that if this is done it will inevitably involve his bringing up the question of his contacts with the foreign office and the facilities that afforded him to go to italy , " it read . the political climate drastically changed in 1940 , however , when germany invaded france and a policy of appeasement became less popular .
winston churchill replaced neville chamberlain as prime minister and halifax was sent to washington as britain 's ambassador to the us . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" bryans ' idea is that the world ought to be divided into two parts , that germany should be given a free hand in europe and that the british empire should run the rest of the world , " read a file from the archive . the newly released documents indicate that , following his visit to italy , londsdale-bryans took his plan to then foreign secretary lord edward halifax .
he apparently also attempted to contact top us officials , including dwight d. eisenhower , who was supreme commander of the allied forces in europe during the war , and even high-ranking nazi leaders . " there is no doubt that bryans with or without the authority of lord halifax endeavored to go to germany to contact -lrb- german foreign minister -rrb- ribbentrop and if possible hitler himself , " showed one file . keeping it under wraps he soon became an embarrassment to the british foreign office , which feared he would take his story to the press . one letter from the foreign office suggests bryans was only spared jail in order to avoid publicizing his unpopular plan : " although there seems to be a good deal to be said for locking him up to prevent him airing his views to all and sundry , i understand that if this is done it will inevitably involve his bringing up the question of his contacts with the foreign office and the facilities that afforded him to go to italy , " it read . the political climate drastically changed in 1940 , however , when germany invaded france and a policy of appeasement became less popular .
winston churchill replaced neville chamberlain as prime minister and halifax was sent to washington as britain 's ambassador to the us . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the deal marks a major shift in germany 's fragmented banking business . commerzbank will pay 9.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 14.35 billion -rrb- to buy dresdner from insurer allianz , the banks announced on sunday , aug .
31 . commerzbank and allianz announced the agreement after their supervisory boards signed off on merging germany 's second and third biggest banks at separate meetings sunday . with total assets of about 1.09 trillion euros and 12.3 million german customers , forging a new commerzbank-dresdner bank will result in the emergence of new banking force in europe 's biggest economy . the banks told hesse state premier roland koch on sunday they would be merging , according to the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . despite the fusion , deutsche bank , which failed in a bid to merge with dresdner eight years ago , would remain the largest bank in the country with assets totaling about 2 trillion euros . the state-owned china development bank -lrb- cdb -rrb- had also been considered a front runner , and is reported to have offered more money for dresdner , along with the prospect of fewer job cuts . political considerations may have ruined cdb 's chances as germany is currently wary of foreign investors - especially when it comes to what berlin considers strategic intrests . 9,000 jobs to be cut bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exactly where the jobs will be cut remains to be seen but the talk of the merger had already set the alarm bells ringing among unions amid concerns that a corporate marriage between the two banks could lead to job cuts from the financial houses ' combined workforce of about 72,000 employees . many of the around 1,900 german branches offices of a combined dresdner-commerzbank bank are located close to each other . commerzbank said it would eliminate 9,000 full-time jobs " in a socially responsible way " as part of the takeover . dresdner 's investment banking activities in london and frankfurt were expected to be a main target of the cuts , according to press reports . commerzbank chairman martin blessing was quoted as saying that " the deal will secure many attractive jobs for the long term , even though unfortunately we can not keep all current positions . " the head of dresdner 's works committee , hans-georg binder , told the mass market bild am sonntag newspaper earlier that he estimated 4,000 jobs would be cut , and that some of them would come from commerzbank . a name change would be in store for more than 900 dresdner sites , binder added . under the deal , frankfurt-based commerzbank will buy the 136-year-old dresdner in two steps , starting by acquiring 60.5per cent of its cross-town rival this year and the rest in 2009 . sunday 's announcement will be the climax of months of speculation about a tie-up between dresdner and germany 's second-biggest listed bank which was triggered by allianz 's announcement in march that it planned to sell off its banking operation . the commerzbank-dresdner agreement is also likely result in a shakeout at dresdner 's struggling investment house dresdner kleinwort , which has been badly hit by the global financial market crisis and the credit crunch . indeed , the negotiations over the possible sale of dresdner to commerzbank have also been held against the backdrop of worries about the impact on both banks of the fallout from the us subprime mortgage market crisis . while dresdner this month posted its fourth consecutive quarterly loss in the three months to the end of june , commerzbank 's mortgage group eurohypo has been forced to beef up its loss provisions . allianz paid about 23 billion euros for dresdner in 2001 as part of an ambitious plan to sell its pension and insurance schemes through dresdner 's branch network . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 31.08.2008 georgia crisis threatens eu bid for more energy sources großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in energy , the eu is more likely to cooperate with russia than bypass it , said one expert europe 's declared goal to shift away from russian oil and gas has always beem a challenge .
but it 's become even more difficult after moscow 's assault on georgia , analysts say . georgia 's strategic role as a pipeline transit country , run by a us-backed leadership that moscow detests , formed the backdrop to the conflict that erupted in early august .
after russian troops handed georgian president mikheil saakashvili a humiliating battlefield defeat , the region 's fragility and moscow 's clout are more obvious than ever .
monday 's emergency eu summit on georgia will not change that in the short term .
the european union will now be less likely to use " volatile transit routes " that bypass russia and tend toward " solid and stable " energy ties with moscow , said ivailo vesselinov , an economist at investment bank dresdner kleinwort in london .
" the signs point to the eu trying to cooperate more with russia , rather than less , " he said .
diversion effort may be postponed eu and us efforts to get around russia are focused on nabucco , a 7.9-billion-euro -lrb- $ 11.6-billion -rrb- pipeline slated to run caspian gas to central and western europe from georgia via turkey and bulgaria to austria .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former soviet states are often wary of russia 's motives nabucco 's vienna-based head office says the 3,300-kilometer -lrb- 2,050-mile -rrb- project remains on track , with construction to begin in 2010 and gas to start flowing in 2013 .
analysts are not so sure .
" i do n't think it 's dead , but it will be postponed ... because of the political uncertainties and the military intervention , " said claudia kemfert , an energy expert at the diw economic think tank in berlin .
" that 's a major difficulty for the project . "
a pipeline deal signed last year by georgia , poland , ukraine , azerbaijan and lithuania to pump caspian sea oil to western europe also seems more uncertain , vesselinov said .
russia is the eu 's single largest energy source , supplying 28 percent of the bloc 's oil and gas , according to the european commission .
some ex-communist countries , like the baltics or slovakia , depend on russia for all of their gas .
key nations in the old eu , notably germany , have long worked to expand energy ties with russia , seeking cooperation rather than confrontation .
looking for alternatives in parallel , the search for alternatives was on .
the baku-tbilisi-ceyhan oil pipeline , involving british petroleum , azerbaijan , georgia and turkey , was launched in the late 1990s with eu and us backing , a response to the perceived need to lessen dependence on russia .
us president george w bush even appointed a family friend as special envoy for eurasian energy , brussels-based diplomat c boyden gray .
but while analysts in washington have tended to see the russian invasion of georgia as a strategic defeat for us interests , europeans have taken a more muted view .
former german chancellor gerhard schroeder , who heads the shareholder committee of a russian-german pipeline consortium , firmly took russia 's side .
" only dreamers can run after the notion of a western europe independent of russian oil and gas , " he told der spiegel magazine .
" creating mutual dependence also creates mutual security . "
russian energy splits europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltic sea pipeline will increase russia 's share of germany 's gas supply nord stream , the company schroeder is involved with , is building a pipeline under the baltic sea to move russian gas to germany .
the project will raise russia 's share of germany 's gas supply from about 40 percent to 50 percent , kemfert said .
moscow also is countering nabucco with the south stream project , designed to route russian gas under the black sea to bulgaria and serbia , with one leg ending at the same austrian terminal as nabucco and the other in italy .
nord stream has created fissures in the eu similar to the east-west split over the iraq war : poland and the baltics , generally suspicious of russian intentions , have raised environmental concerns about the undersea pipeline .
fighting in georgia appears to have trumped those worries . " our german partners must stop viewing the baltic sea pipeline as a purely economic project .
they should understand that russia can use the gas conduit to keep europe in check , " poland 's rzeczpospolita daily said in an editorial .
russia 's muscle-flexing may yet spur europe 's push for other energy sources , including wind and solar energy - already a european strength - and liquefied natural gas transported in tankers .
" for sure , the energy debate will start now , " kemfert said . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de germany calls rumored russian oil cut unlikely the german government sees no signs that russia might cut oil deliveries to europe as part of its response to the crisis over georgia , a spokesman has said .
a newspaper report initially suggested this possibility .
-lrb- 29.08.2008 -rrb- analysis : europe and russia head for hot peace seventeen years after the cold war , europe and russia are again on a collision course .
experts say moscow 's decision to recognize georgia 's rebel provinces was a watershed moment in relations with the west .
-lrb- 28.08.2008 -rrb- german industry leaders warn against isolating russia some german industry leaders have said a harsh political response to russia during the current crisis could hurt business ties .
europe - and germany in particular - is russia 's most important trading partner .
-lrb- 28.08.2008 -rrb- background : europe 's reliance on russian energy europe is increasingly reliant on russia to supply its oil and natural gas , giving moscow immense leverage over those european capitals that use its power most .

" the fehmarn strait bridge is coming , " proclaimed german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee , referring to a 19-kilometer -lrb- 12-mile -rrb- baltic sea link between germany and denmark .
to make sure it does , tiefensee is scheduled to travel to copenhagen on wednesday to ink the final agreement together with his danish counterpart , carina christensen .
the signing will cap years of talks that at times seemed headed nowhere .
if all goes well , in 10 years cars and trains will be rolling between puttgarden , on the german island of fehmarn , and rodby , on the danish island of lolland .
tiefensee reached agreement on building the giant bridge with christensen 's predecessor , flemming hansen , a little over a year ago . denmark has more at stake denmark , a kingdom whose population is almost 20 times smaller than germany 's , will shoulder 4.8 billion of the estimated 5.6-billion-euro -lrb- $ 8.2-billion -rrb- price tag .
germany 's costs are practically limited to highway and railway links to the bridge on fehmarn and south toward hamburg .
" it 's clear that our interest in this project is greater than that of the germans , " remarked hansen in explaining his country 's disproportionately large financial stake .
the bridge will cut an hour from the drive between copenhagen and hamburg , now about four-and-a-half hours .
because of chronically empty state coffers and strong resistance from eastern germany , the german government was long lukewarm toward the project , whose appeal is greatest in the northwestern state of schleswig-holstein , of which fehmarn is part .
as for denmark , its tax revenues are so plentiful in the wake of a nearly 15-year economic boom that no one there seems fazed by the huge investment and high risk to taxpayers .
environmentalists reject project danes ' optimism is driven in part by the massive flow of traffic across the great belt bridge between the main danish islands of zealand and fyn and , since 2000 , across the oresund bridge between copenhagen and the swedish city of malmo .
christensen said the costs of the fehmarn strait bridge , to be borne by private investors and guaranteed by the danish government , would definitely be recouped within a few decades .
construction of the bridge , whose design is still largely undecided , is expected to start in 2011 and be completed in 2018 .

" the fehmarn strait bridge is coming , " proclaimed german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee , referring to a 19-kilometer -lrb- 12-mile -rrb- baltic sea link between germany and denmark .
to make sure it does , tiefensee is scheduled to travel to copenhagen on wednesday to ink the final agreement together with his danish counterpart , carina christensen .
the signing will cap years of talks that at times seemed headed nowhere .
if all goes well , in 10 years cars and trains will be rolling between puttgarden , on the german island of fehmarn , and rodby , on the danish island of lolland .
tiefensee reached agreement on building the giant bridge with christensen 's predecessor , flemming hansen , a little over a year ago . denmark has more at stake denmark , a kingdom whose population is almost 20 times smaller than germany 's , will shoulder 4.8 billion of the estimated 5.6-billion-euro -lrb- $ 8.2-billion -rrb- price tag .
germany 's costs are practically limited to highway and railway links to the bridge on fehmarn and south toward hamburg .
" it 's clear that our interest in this project is greater than that of the germans , " remarked hansen in explaining his country 's disproportionately large financial stake .
the bridge will cut an hour from the drive between copenhagen and hamburg , now about four-and-a-half hours .
because of chronically empty state coffers and strong resistance from eastern germany , the german government was long lukewarm toward the project , whose appeal is greatest in the northwestern state of schleswig-holstein , of which fehmarn is part .
as for denmark , its tax revenues are so plentiful in the wake of a nearly 15-year economic boom that no one there seems fazed by the huge investment and high risk to taxpayers .
environmentalists reject project danes ' optimism is driven in part by the massive flow of traffic across the great belt bridge between the main danish islands of zealand and fyn and , since 2000 , across the oresund bridge between copenhagen and the swedish city of malmo .
christensen said the costs of the fehmarn strait bridge , to be borne by private investors and guaranteed by the danish government , would definitely be recouped within a few decades .
construction of the bridge , whose design is still largely undecided , is expected to start in 2011 and be completed in 2018 .
but a number of hurdles will remain even after tiefensee and christensen sign the agreement .
the biggest is opposition by german environmental protectionists , who say the bridge will adversely affect birds and marine mammals such as porpoises and seals in the fehmarn strait .
" we 'll take every opportunity to block the project , " leif miller , managing director of the berlin-based environmental protection organisation nabu , told germany 's sueddeutsche zeitung . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the imposing structure that includes a grand hall and a hotel is set to become the newest landmark on the port city 's skyline . at the western tip of hamburg 's harbor , the dramatic design of the new elbe philharmonic hall emerges slowly from the mists .
expected to be completed in two years , it will bring to the northern german port not only a new concert hall , but also an 110-meter landmark visible to approaching ships from way down river .
the designers are swiss architects herzog & de meuron , whose portfolio includes the tate modern in london , the allianz arena in munich and the de young museum in san francisco .
a ship-friendly landmark located at the tip of the sandtorhafen , the first industrial harbor basin in hamburg and at a site once occupied by the city 's kaiserspeicher warehouse complex , the elbe philharmonic hall is destined to become a navigational point for ships entering the harbor . a huge brick 1960s warehouse built to replace the kaiserspeicher , which was destroyed in world war ii , has had its interior gutted to make room for 500 parking spaces , an education section , back-stage facilities , rehearsal rooms , catering facilities and a spa area .
soon , construction of the main concert hall will begin - a spectacular , shimmering series of glass facades soaring to a height of 110 meters -lrb- 360 feet -rrb- on top of the warehouse .
the eiffel tower of hamburg ?
the centerpiece is an auditorium seating 2,150 .
is it possible to plan a landmark ?
hamburg mayor ole von beust says time will tell .
" but that 's only half the truth .
if we think of the eiffel tower , the statue of liberty , cologne cathedral or the sydney opera house three things came together to create a landmark - good visibility due to the size or location of the building , direct symbolism and a stimulating architectural idea , " beust said .
besides the grand hall there will also be two additional auditoriums , one of them with a 550-seat capacity , the other for experimental music and rehearsals .
on the eastern side there will be a five-star hotel with some 250 rooms , complete with spa and conference areas .
on the west , there will be 45 owner-occupied apartments with splendid views eastward down the elbe a plaza at a height of 37 meters , where visitors will be able to sip coffee while enjoying a view of the harbor , is also planned .
hamburg already has the laeiszhalle , an internationally renowned " old-style " concert hall .
time crunch christoph lieben-seutter , 44 , is the elbe philharmonic 's general director .
" it should be two or three years from now .
but you never know , " he says , noting that its foundation stone was only laid in april 2007 .
" past experience has shown that there can be considerable delays . "
" one has only to think of the sydney opera house , which took 30 years longer than intended , and the danish radio concert project in copenhagen now several years overdue , " lieben-seutter says .
completion date has been set back to 2011 from the planned 2010 .
" planning-wise , it will be tight although l think it can be done , " he says with regard to the 2010-11 concert program .
difficulties in design a challenge for the architects is ensuring audiences are located closer to the stage .
" the most important hall designed in this way is architect hans sharoun 's berlin philharmonie , built in the early 1960s , which was a landmark design at that time and a very successful one , " says lieben-seutter .
" many concert halls these days get designed in the so-called vineyard style on several levels .
in hamburg the aim is to develop that concept further , with ideas coming from several sources , including la scala in milan , " he says .
the acoustics are in the hands of yasuhisa toyota , chief acoustician of a whole range of concert hall projects in japan and the us .
the elbe philharmonic hall will not be the tallest building in hamburg .
the city bans new structures taller than its main churches , of which the highest is st michael 's , rising to 132 meters .
nevertheless , given its position in the hafencity development , it will be the most visible . dpa news agency -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the deal marks a major shift in germany 's fragmented banking business . commerzbank will pay 9.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 14.35 billion -rrb- to buy dresdner from insurer allianz , the banks announced on sunday , aug .
31 . commerzbank and allianz announced the agreement after their supervisory boards signed off on merging germany 's second and third biggest banks at separate meetings sunday . with total assets of about 1.09 trillion euros and 12.3 million german customers , forging a new commerzbank-dresdner bank will result in the emergence of new banking force in europe 's biggest economy . the banks told hesse state premier roland koch on sunday they would be merging , according to the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . despite the fusion , deutsche bank , which failed in a bid to merge with dresdner eight years ago , would remain the largest bank in the country with assets totaling about 2 trillion euros . the state-owned china development bank -lrb- cdb -rrb- had also been considered a front runner , and is reported to have offered more money for dresdner , along with the prospect of fewer job cuts . political considerations may have ruined cdb 's chances as germany is currently wary of foreign investors - especially when it comes to what berlin considers strategic intrests . 9,000 jobs to be cut bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exactly where the jobs will be cut remains to be seen but the talk of the merger had already set the alarm bells ringing among unions amid concerns that a corporate marriage between the two banks could lead to job cuts from the financial houses ' combined workforce of about 72,000 employees . many of the around 1,900 german branches offices of a combined dresdner-commerzbank bank are located close to each other . commerzbank said it would eliminate 9,000 full-time jobs " in a socially responsible way " as part of the takeover . dresdner 's investment banking activities in london and frankfurt were expected to be a main target of the cuts , according to press reports . commerzbank chairman martin blessing was quoted as saying that " the deal will secure many attractive jobs for the long term , even though unfortunately we can not keep all current positions .

" the fehmarn strait bridge is coming , " proclaimed german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee , referring to a 19-kilometer -lrb- 12-mile -rrb- baltic sea link between germany and denmark .
to make sure it does , tiefensee is scheduled to travel to copenhagen on wednesday to ink the final agreement together with his danish counterpart , carina christensen .
the signing will cap years of talks that at times seemed headed nowhere .
if all goes well , in 10 years cars and trains will be rolling between puttgarden , on the german island of fehmarn , and rodby , on the danish island of lolland .
tiefensee reached agreement on building the giant bridge with christensen 's predecessor , flemming hansen , a little over a year ago . denmark has more at stake denmark , a kingdom whose population is almost 20 times smaller than germany 's , will shoulder 4.8 billion of the estimated 5.6-billion-euro -lrb- $ 8.2-billion -rrb- price tag .
germany 's costs are practically limited to highway and railway links to the bridge on fehmarn and south toward hamburg .
" it 's clear that our interest in this project is greater than that of the germans , " remarked hansen in explaining his country 's disproportionately large financial stake .
the bridge will cut an hour from the drive between copenhagen and hamburg , now about four-and-a-half hours .
because of chronically empty state coffers and strong resistance from eastern germany , the german government was long lukewarm toward the project , whose appeal is greatest in the northwestern state of schleswig-holstein , of which fehmarn is part .
as for denmark , its tax revenues are so plentiful in the wake of a nearly 15-year economic boom that no one there seems fazed by the huge investment and high risk to taxpayers .
environmentalists reject project danes ' optimism is driven in part by the massive flow of traffic across the great belt bridge between the main danish islands of zealand and fyn and , since 2000 , across the oresund bridge between copenhagen and the swedish city of malmo .
christensen said the costs of the fehmarn strait bridge , to be borne by private investors and guaranteed by the danish government , would definitely be recouped within a few decades .
construction of the bridge , whose design is still largely undecided , is expected to start in 2011 and be completed in 2018 .
but a number of hurdles will remain even after tiefensee and christensen sign the agreement .
the biggest is opposition by german environmental protectionists , who say the bridge will adversely affect birds and marine mammals such as porpoises and seals in the fehmarn strait .

" the fehmarn strait bridge is coming , " proclaimed german transport minister wolfgang tiefensee , referring to a 19-kilometer -lrb- 12-mile -rrb- baltic sea link between germany and denmark .
to make sure it does , tiefensee is scheduled to travel to copenhagen on wednesday to ink the final agreement together with his danish counterpart , carina christensen .
the signing will cap years of talks that at times seemed headed nowhere .
if all goes well , in 10 years cars and trains will be rolling between puttgarden , on the german island of fehmarn , and rodby , on the danish island of lolland .
tiefensee reached agreement on building the giant bridge with christensen 's predecessor , flemming hansen , a little over a year ago . denmark has more at stake denmark , a kingdom whose population is almost 20 times smaller than germany 's , will shoulder 4.8 billion of the estimated 5.6-billion-euro -lrb- $ 8.2-billion -rrb- price tag .
germany 's costs are practically limited to highway and railway links to the bridge on fehmarn and south toward hamburg .
" it 's clear that our interest in this project is greater than that of the germans , " remarked hansen in explaining his country 's disproportionately large financial stake .
the bridge will cut an hour from the drive between copenhagen and hamburg , now about four-and-a-half hours .
because of chronically empty state coffers and strong resistance from eastern germany , the german government was long lukewarm toward the project , whose appeal is greatest in the northwestern state of schleswig-holstein , of which fehmarn is part .
as for denmark , its tax revenues are so plentiful in the wake of a nearly 15-year economic boom that no one there seems fazed by the huge investment and high risk to taxpayers .
environmentalists reject project danes ' optimism is driven in part by the massive flow of traffic across the great belt bridge between the main danish islands of zealand and fyn and , since 2000 , across the oresund bridge between copenhagen and the swedish city of malmo .
christensen said the costs of the fehmarn strait bridge , to be borne by private investors and guaranteed by the danish government , would definitely be recouped within a few decades .
construction of the bridge , whose design is still largely undecided , is expected to start in 2011 and be completed in 2018 .
but a number of hurdles will remain even after tiefensee and christensen sign the agreement .
the biggest is opposition by german environmental protectionists , who say the bridge will adversely affect birds and marine mammals such as porpoises and seals in the fehmarn strait .
" we 'll take every opportunity to block the project , " leif miller , managing director of the berlin-based environmental protection organisation nabu , told germany 's sueddeutsche zeitung . dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the imposing structure that includes a grand hall and a hotel is set to become the newest landmark on the port city 's skyline . at the western tip of hamburg 's harbor , the dramatic design of the new elbe philharmonic hall emerges slowly from the mists .
expected to be completed in two years , it will bring to the northern german port not only a new concert hall , but also an 110-meter landmark visible to approaching ships from way down river .
the designers are swiss architects herzog & de meuron , whose portfolio includes the tate modern in london , the allianz arena in munich and the de young museum in san francisco .
a ship-friendly landmark located at the tip of the sandtorhafen , the first industrial harbor basin in hamburg and at a site once occupied by the city 's kaiserspeicher warehouse complex , the elbe philharmonic hall is destined to become a navigational point for ships entering the harbor . a huge brick 1960s warehouse built to replace the kaiserspeicher , which was destroyed in world war ii , has had its interior gutted to make room for 500 parking spaces , an education section , back-stage facilities , rehearsal rooms , catering facilities and a spa area .
soon , construction of the main concert hall will begin - a spectacular , shimmering series of glass facades soaring to a height of 110 meters -lrb- 360 feet -rrb- on top of the warehouse .
the eiffel tower of hamburg ?
the centerpiece is an auditorium seating 2,150 .
is it possible to plan a landmark ?
hamburg mayor ole von beust says time will tell .
" but that 's only half the truth .
if we think of the eiffel tower , the statue of liberty , cologne cathedral or the sydney opera house three things came together to create a landmark - good visibility due to the size or location of the building , direct symbolism and a stimulating architectural idea , " beust said .
besides the grand hall there will also be two additional auditoriums , one of them with a 550-seat capacity , the other for experimental music and rehearsals .
on the eastern side there will be a five-star hotel with some 250 rooms , complete with spa and conference areas .
on the west , there will be 45 owner-occupied apartments with splendid views eastward down the elbe a plaza at a height of 37 meters , where visitors will be able to sip coffee while enjoying a view of the harbor , is also planned .
hamburg already has the laeiszhalle , an internationally renowned " old-style " concert hall .
time crunch christoph lieben-seutter , 44 , is the elbe philharmonic 's general director .
" it should be two or three years from now .
but you never know , " he says , noting that its foundation stone was only laid in april 2007 .
" past experience has shown that there can be considerable delays . "
" one has only to think of the sydney opera house , which took 30 years longer than intended , and the danish radio concert project in copenhagen now several years overdue , " lieben-seutter says .
completion date has been set back to 2011 from the planned 2010 .
" planning-wise , it will be tight although l think it can be done , " he says with regard to the 2010-11 concert program .
difficulties in design a challenge for the architects is ensuring audiences are located closer to the stage .
" the most important hall designed in this way is architect hans sharoun 's berlin philharmonie , built in the early 1960s , which was a landmark design at that time and a very successful one , " says lieben-seutter .
" many concert halls these days get designed in the so-called vineyard style on several levels .
in hamburg the aim is to develop that concept further , with ideas coming from several sources , including la scala in milan , " he says .
the acoustics are in the hands of yasuhisa toyota , chief acoustician of a whole range of concert hall projects in japan and the us .
the elbe philharmonic hall will not be the tallest building in hamburg .
the city bans new structures taller than its main churches , of which the highest is st michael 's , rising to 132 meters .
nevertheless , given its position in the hafencity development , it will be the most visible . dpa news agency -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the imposing structure that includes a grand hall and a hotel is set to become the newest landmark on the port city 's skyline . at the western tip of hamburg 's harbor , the dramatic design of the new elbe philharmonic hall emerges slowly from the mists .
expected to be completed in two years , it will bring to the northern german port not only a new concert hall , but also an 110-meter landmark visible to approaching ships from way down river .
the designers are swiss architects herzog & de meuron , whose portfolio includes the tate modern in london , the allianz arena in munich and the de young museum in san francisco .
a ship-friendly landmark located at the tip of the sandtorhafen , the first industrial harbor basin in hamburg and at a site once occupied by the city 's kaiserspeicher warehouse complex , the elbe philharmonic hall is destined to become a navigational point for ships entering the harbor . a huge brick 1960s warehouse built to replace the kaiserspeicher , which was destroyed in world war ii , has had its interior gutted to make room for 500 parking spaces , an education section , back-stage facilities , rehearsal rooms , catering facilities and a spa area .
soon , construction of the main concert hall will begin - a spectacular , shimmering series of glass facades soaring to a height of 110 meters -lrb- 360 feet -rrb- on top of the warehouse .
the eiffel tower of hamburg ?
the centerpiece is an auditorium seating 2,150 .
is it possible to plan a landmark ?
hamburg mayor ole von beust says time will tell .
" but that 's only half the truth .
if we think of the eiffel tower , the statue of liberty , cologne cathedral or the sydney opera house three things came together to create a landmark - good visibility due to the size or location of the building , direct symbolism and a stimulating architectural idea , " beust said .
besides the grand hall there will also be two additional auditoriums , one of them with a 550-seat capacity , the other for experimental music and rehearsals .
on the eastern side there will be a five-star hotel with some 250 rooms , complete with spa and conference areas .
on the west , there will be 45 owner-occupied apartments with splendid views eastward down the elbe a plaza at a height of 37 meters , where visitors will be able to sip coffee while enjoying a view of the harbor , is also planned .
hamburg already has the laeiszhalle , an internationally renowned " old-style " concert hall .
time crunch christoph lieben-seutter , 44 , is the elbe philharmonic 's general director .
" it should be two or three years from now .
but you never know , " he says , noting that its foundation stone was only laid in april 2007 .
" past experience has shown that there can be considerable delays . "
" one has only to think of the sydney opera house , which took 30 years longer than intended , and the danish radio concert project in copenhagen now several years overdue , " lieben-seutter says .
completion date has been set back to 2011 from the planned 2010 .
" planning-wise , it will be tight although l think it can be done , " he says with regard to the 2010-11 concert program .
difficulties in design a challenge for the architects is ensuring audiences are located closer to the stage .
" the most important hall designed in this way is architect hans sharoun 's berlin philharmonie , built in the early 1960s , which was a landmark design at that time and a very successful one , " says lieben-seutter .
" many concert halls these days get designed in the so-called vineyard style on several levels .
in hamburg the aim is to develop that concept further , with ideas coming from several sources , including la scala in milan , " he says .
the acoustics are in the hands of yasuhisa toyota , chief acoustician of a whole range of concert hall projects in japan and the us .
the elbe philharmonic hall will not be the tallest building in hamburg .
the city bans new structures taller than its main churches , of which the highest is st michael 's , rising to 132 meters .

the imposing structure that includes a grand hall and a hotel is set to become the newest landmark on the port city 's skyline . at the western tip of hamburg 's harbor , the dramatic design of the new elbe philharmonic hall emerges slowly from the mists .
expected to be completed in two years , it will bring to the northern german port not only a new concert hall , but also an 110-meter landmark visible to approaching ships from way down river .
the designers are swiss architects herzog & de meuron , whose portfolio includes the tate modern in london , the allianz arena in munich and the de young museum in san francisco .
a ship-friendly landmark located at the tip of the sandtorhafen , the first industrial harbor basin in hamburg and at a site once occupied by the city 's kaiserspeicher warehouse complex , the elbe philharmonic hall is destined to become a navigational point for ships entering the harbor . a huge brick 1960s warehouse built to replace the kaiserspeicher , which was destroyed in world war ii , has had its interior gutted to make room for 500 parking spaces , an education section , back-stage facilities , rehearsal rooms , catering facilities and a spa area .
soon , construction of the main concert hall will begin - a spectacular , shimmering series of glass facades soaring to a height of 110 meters -lrb- 360 feet -rrb- on top of the warehouse .

besides the grand hall there will also be two additional auditoriums , one of them with a 550-seat capacity , the other for experimental music and rehearsals .
on the eastern side there will be a five-star hotel with some 250 rooms , complete with spa and conference areas .
on the west , there will be 45 owner-occupied apartments with splendid views eastward down the elbe a plaza at a height of 37 meters , where visitors will be able to sip coffee while enjoying a view of the harbor , is also planned .

" one has only to think of the sydney opera house , which took 30 years longer than intended , and the danish radio concert project in copenhagen now several years overdue , " lieben-seutter says .

the imposing structure that includes a grand hall and a hotel is set to become the newest landmark on the port city 's skyline . at the western tip of hamburg 's harbor , the dramatic design of the new elbe philharmonic hall emerges slowly from the mists .
expected to be completed in two years , it will bring to the northern german port not only a new concert hall , but also an 110-meter landmark visible to approaching ships from way down river .
the designers are swiss architects herzog & de meuron , whose portfolio includes the tate modern in london , the allianz arena in munich and the de young museum in san francisco .
a ship-friendly landmark located at the tip of the sandtorhafen , the first industrial harbor basin in hamburg and at a site once occupied by the city 's kaiserspeicher warehouse complex , the elbe philharmonic hall is destined to become a navigational point for ships entering the harbor . a huge brick 1960s warehouse built to replace the kaiserspeicher , which was destroyed in world war ii , has had its interior gutted to make room for 500 parking spaces , an education section , back-stage facilities , rehearsal rooms , catering facilities and a spa area .
soon , construction of the main concert hall will begin - a spectacular , shimmering series of glass facades soaring to a height of 110 meters -lrb- 360 feet -rrb- on top of the warehouse .
the eiffel tower of hamburg ?
the centerpiece is an auditorium seating 2,150 .
is it possible to plan a landmark ?
hamburg mayor ole von beust says time will tell .
" but that 's only half the truth .
if we think of the eiffel tower , the statue of liberty , cologne cathedral or the sydney opera house three things came together to create a landmark - good visibility due to the size or location of the building , direct symbolism and a stimulating architectural idea , " beust said .
besides the grand hall there will also be two additional auditoriums , one of them with a 550-seat capacity , the other for experimental music and rehearsals .
on the eastern side there will be a five-star hotel with some 250 rooms , complete with spa and conference areas .
on the west , there will be 45 owner-occupied apartments with splendid views eastward down the elbe a plaza at a height of 37 meters , where visitors will be able to sip coffee while enjoying a view of the harbor , is also planned .
hamburg already has the laeiszhalle , an internationally renowned " old-style " concert hall .
time crunch christoph lieben-seutter , 44 , is the elbe philharmonic 's general director .
" it should be two or three years from now .
but you never know , " he says , noting that its foundation stone was only laid in april 2007 .
" past experience has shown that there can be considerable delays . "
" one has only to think of the sydney opera house , which took 30 years longer than intended , and the danish radio concert project in copenhagen now several years overdue , " lieben-seutter says .
completion date has been set back to 2011 from the planned 2010 .
" planning-wise , it will be tight although l think it can be done , " he says with regard to the 2010-11 concert program .
difficulties in design a challenge for the architects is ensuring audiences are located closer to the stage .
" the most important hall designed in this way is architect hans sharoun 's berlin philharmonie , built in the early 1960s , which was a landmark design at that time and a very successful one , " says lieben-seutter .
" many concert halls these days get designed in the so-called vineyard style on several levels .
in hamburg the aim is to develop that concept further , with ideas coming from several sources , including la scala in milan , " he says .
the acoustics are in the hands of yasuhisa toyota , chief acoustician of a whole range of concert hall projects in japan and the us .
the elbe philharmonic hall will not be the tallest building in hamburg .
the city bans new structures taller than its main churches , of which the highest is st michael 's , rising to 132 meters .
nevertheless , given its position in the hafencity development , it will be the most visible . dpa news agency -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his plan was that the nazis would get europe and britain would take the world . james lonsdale-bryans , a well-educated fascist sympathizer and novice politician , traveled to italy in the first months of world war ii to negotiate a deal with the german ambassador in rome , ulrich von hassell , revealed the archives from britain 's foreign office . previously classified files concerning londsdale-bryans ' actions were released on sunday , aug .
31 , as part of the freedom of information act . " bryans ' idea is that the world ought to be divided into two parts , that germany should be given a free hand in europe and that the british empire should run the rest of the world , " read a file from the archive . the newly released documents indicate that , following his visit to italy , londsdale-bryans took his plan to then foreign secretary lord edward halifax .
he apparently also attempted to contact top us officials , including dwight d. eisenhower , who was supreme commander of the allied forces in europe during the war , and even high-ranking nazi leaders . " there is no doubt that bryans with or without the authority of lord halifax endeavored to go to germany to contact -lrb- german foreign minister -rrb- ribbentrop and if possible hitler himself , " showed one file . keeping it under wraps he soon became an embarrassment to the british foreign office , which feared he would take his story to the press . one letter from the foreign office suggests bryans was only spared jail in order to avoid publicizing his unpopular plan : " although there seems to be a good deal to be said for locking him up to prevent him airing his views to all and sundry , i understand that if this is done it will inevitably involve his bringing up the question of his contacts with the foreign office and the facilities that afforded him to go to italy , " it read . the political climate drastically changed in 1940 , however , when germany invaded france and a policy of appeasement became less popular .
winston churchill replaced neville chamberlain as prime minister and halifax was sent to washington as britain 's ambassador to the us . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

no one was injured . a german convoy in afghanistan was attacked sunday , aug .
31 , the german military command in the eastern city of potsdam said . the patrol , which included several vehicles , came under attack on sunday morning about 45 kilometers -lrb- 30 miles -rrb- west of the northern city of kunduz , in a region known to harbor taliban militants . no one was injured and the vehicles incurred only minor damage when the bomb went off , a spokesman for the command said . on wednesday , an eight-vehicle convoy patrolling the outskirts of kunduz , where the german military has its base , was hit by an improvised explosive device , killing a german staff sergeant and injuring three other troops . the german death took to 187 the number of international soldiers killed in afghanistan this year .
forty-three have died this month alone , according to an afp news agency count based on official figures . the majority of the attacks have been concentrated in southern and eastern afghanistan , but there has also been scattered violence in the country 's north and west .
germany has some 3,500 troops stationed in northern afghanistan . sunday 's incident also came on the heels of afghan and german troops on friday killing two children and a woman by opening fire on cars that failed to stop at a checkpoint . the civilians ' death could " bring the perception that the bundeswehr is an occupying force back into the foreground , " social democratic defense spokesman walter kolbow told the weekly welt am sonntag ahead of sunday 's attack . while the german soldiers had largely been seen as a stabilizing force , " now the role of perpetrator has reached us . " the mounting violence has fueled debate about the afghanistan mission in germany , where polls show the deployment is unpopular .
a number of opposition politicians have also recently called the deployment of german troops to afghanistan into question . the left party 's gergor gysi told news agencies that the deaths of afghan civilians were the shared responsibility of german and afghan forces and would " bring the situation to a head . "
he added that germany " risked falling into a quagmire of a dirty war that does not fight terrorism but leads to a new inclination towards violence that impairs civil reconstruction efforts . " the deputy head of the christian conservatives ' parliamentary group , eckart von klaeden , said the bundeswehr 's mission served the security of afghans as well as germans . " i think the way civilian victims are now being exploited by -lsb- opposition parties -rsb- to turn people against the deployment is tasteless , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the deal marks a major shift in germany 's fragmented banking business . commerzbank will pay 9.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 14.35 billion -rrb- to buy dresdner from insurer allianz , the banks announced on sunday , aug .
31 . commerzbank and allianz announced the agreement after their supervisory boards signed off on merging germany 's second and third biggest banks at separate meetings sunday . with total assets of about 1.09 trillion euros and 12.3 million german customers , forging a new commerzbank-dresdner bank will result in the emergence of new banking force in europe 's biggest economy . the banks told hesse state premier roland koch on sunday they would be merging , according to the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . despite the fusion , deutsche bank , which failed in a bid to merge with dresdner eight years ago , would remain the largest bank in the country with assets totaling about 2 trillion euros . the state-owned china development bank -lrb- cdb -rrb- had also been considered a front runner , and is reported to have offered more money for dresdner , along with the prospect of fewer job cuts . political considerations may have ruined cdb 's chances as germany is currently wary of foreign investors - especially when it comes to what berlin considers strategic intrests . 9,000 jobs to be cut bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exactly where the jobs will be cut remains to be seen but the talk of the merger had already set the alarm bells ringing among unions amid concerns that a corporate marriage between the two banks could lead to job cuts from the financial houses ' combined workforce of about 72,000 employees . many of the around 1,900 german branches offices of a combined dresdner-commerzbank bank are located close to each other . commerzbank said it would eliminate 9,000 full-time jobs " in a socially responsible way " as part of the takeover . dresdner 's investment banking activities in london and frankfurt were expected to be a main target of the cuts , according to press reports . commerzbank chairman martin blessing was quoted as saying that " the deal will secure many attractive jobs for the long term , even though unfortunately we can not keep all current positions . " the head of dresdner 's works committee , hans-georg binder , told the mass market bild am sonntag newspaper earlier that he estimated 4,000 jobs would be cut , and that some of them would come from commerzbank . a name change would be in store for more than 900 dresdner sites , binder added . under the deal , frankfurt-based commerzbank will buy the 136-year-old dresdner in two steps , starting by acquiring 60.5per cent of its cross-town rival this year and the rest in 2009 . sunday 's announcement will be the climax of months of speculation about a tie-up between dresdner and germany 's second-biggest listed bank which was triggered by allianz 's announcement in march that it planned to sell off its banking operation . the commerzbank-dresdner agreement is also likely result in a shakeout at dresdner 's struggling investment house dresdner kleinwort , which has been badly hit by the global financial market crisis and the credit crunch . indeed , the negotiations over the possible sale of dresdner to commerzbank have also been held against the backdrop of worries about the impact on both banks of the fallout from the us subprime mortgage market crisis . while dresdner this month posted its fourth consecutive quarterly loss in the three months to the end of june , commerzbank 's mortgage group eurohypo has been forced to beef up its loss provisions . allianz paid about 23 billion euros for dresdner in 2001 as part of an ambitious plan to sell its pension and insurance schemes through dresdner 's branch network . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his plan was that the nazis would get europe and britain would take the world . james lonsdale-bryans , a well-educated fascist sympathizer and novice politician , traveled to italy in the first months of world war ii to negotiate a deal with the german ambassador in rome , ulrich von hassell , revealed the archives from britain 's foreign office . previously classified files concerning londsdale-bryans ' actions were released on sunday , aug .
31 , as part of the freedom of information act . " bryans ' idea is that the world ought to be divided into two parts , that germany should be given a free hand in europe and that the british empire should run the rest of the world , " read a file from the archive . the newly released documents indicate that , following his visit to italy , londsdale-bryans took his plan to then foreign secretary lord edward halifax .
he apparently also attempted to contact top us officials , including dwight d. eisenhower , who was supreme commander of the allied forces in europe during the war , and even high-ranking nazi leaders . " there is no doubt that bryans with or without the authority of lord halifax endeavored to go to germany to contact -lrb- german foreign minister -rrb- ribbentrop and if possible hitler himself , " showed one file . keeping it under wraps he soon became an embarrassment to the british foreign office , which feared he would take his story to the press . one letter from the foreign office suggests bryans was only spared jail in order to avoid publicizing his unpopular plan : " although there seems to be a good deal to be said for locking him up to prevent him airing his views to all and sundry , i understand that if this is done it will inevitably involve his bringing up the question of his contacts with the foreign office and the facilities that afforded him to go to italy , " it read . the political climate drastically changed in 1940 , however , when germany invaded france and a policy of appeasement became less popular .
winston churchill replaced neville chamberlain as prime minister and halifax was sent to washington as britain 's ambassador to the us . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the deal marks a major shift in germany 's fragmented banking business . commerzbank will pay 9.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 14.35 billion -rrb- to buy dresdner from insurer allianz , the banks announced on sunday , aug .
31 . commerzbank and allianz announced the agreement after their supervisory boards signed off on merging germany 's second and third biggest banks at separate meetings sunday . with total assets of about 1.09 trillion euros and 12.3 million german customers , forging a new commerzbank-dresdner bank will result in the emergence of new banking force in europe 's biggest economy . the banks told hesse state premier roland koch on sunday they would be merging , according to the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . despite the fusion , deutsche bank , which failed in a bid to merge with dresdner eight years ago , would remain the largest bank in the country with assets totaling about 2 trillion euros . the state-owned china development bank -lrb- cdb -rrb- had also been considered a front runner , and is reported to have offered more money for dresdner , along with the prospect of fewer job cuts . political considerations may have ruined cdb 's chances as germany is currently wary of foreign investors - especially when it comes to what berlin considers strategic intrests . 9,000 jobs to be cut bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exactly where the jobs will be cut remains to be seen but the talk of the merger had already set the alarm bells ringing among unions amid concerns that a corporate marriage between the two banks could lead to job cuts from the financial houses ' combined workforce of about 72,000 employees . many of the around 1,900 german branches offices of a combined dresdner-commerzbank bank are located close to each other . commerzbank said it would eliminate 9,000 full-time jobs " in a socially responsible way " as part of the takeover . dresdner 's investment banking activities in london and frankfurt were expected to be a main target of the cuts , according to press reports . commerzbank chairman martin blessing was quoted as saying that " the deal will secure many attractive jobs for the long term , even though unfortunately we can not keep all current positions . " the head of dresdner 's works committee , hans-georg binder , told the mass market bild am sonntag newspaper earlier that he estimated 4,000 jobs would be cut , and that some of them would come from commerzbank . a name change would be in store for more than 900 dresdner sites , binder added . under the deal , frankfurt-based commerzbank will buy the 136-year-old dresdner in two steps , starting by acquiring 60.5per cent of its cross-town rival this year and the rest in 2009 . sunday 's announcement will be the climax of months of speculation about a tie-up between dresdner and germany 's second-biggest listed bank which was triggered by allianz 's announcement in march that it planned to sell off its banking operation . the commerzbank-dresdner agreement is also likely result in a shakeout at dresdner 's struggling investment house dresdner kleinwort , which has been badly hit by the global financial market crisis and the credit crunch . indeed , the negotiations over the possible sale of dresdner to commerzbank have also been held against the backdrop of worries about the impact on both banks of the fallout from the us subprime mortgage market crisis . while dresdner this month posted its fourth consecutive quarterly loss in the three months to the end of june , commerzbank 's mortgage group eurohypo has been forced to beef up its loss provisions . allianz paid about 23 billion euros for dresdner in 2001 as part of an ambitious plan to sell its pension and insurance schemes through dresdner 's branch network . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

former soviet states and countries that fell under the ussr 's direct influence have tended to favor a tougher stance than western european nations . in a sign that the situation may have calmed , moscow and berlin agreed on saturday to seek to calm tensions in europe over the conflict in georgia , the russian foreign ministry said . russian foreign minister sergei lavrov and german counterpart frank-walter steinmeier " agreed on the need to put an end to attempts to use the situation surrounding georgia ... to raise tensions in europe by speculating on non-existent threats concerning other post-soviet countries , " it said . the statement appeared to allude to french foreign minister bernard kouchner 's earlier comments in which he said that moscow could have designs on the crimea , ukraine and moldova . russian prime minister vladimir putin earlier rejected the comments in an interview with the german network ard . " we recognized the borders of modern-day ukraine long ago , " he said . relations between russia and ukraine have been strained over kyiv 's demands that moscow prepare the withdrawal of russia 's black sea fleet from the crimean port of sevastopol , where the russian fleet has been based for 200 years . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

31 , the german military command in the eastern city of potsdam said . the patrol , which included several vehicles , came under attack on sunday morning about 45 kilometers -lrb- 30 miles -rrb- west of the northern city of kunduz , in a region known to harbor taliban militants . no one was injured and the vehicles incurred only minor damage when the bomb went off , a spokesman for the command said . on wednesday , an eight-vehicle convoy patrolling the outskirts of kunduz , where the german military has its base , was hit by an improvised explosive device , killing a german staff sergeant and injuring three other troops . the german death took to 187 the number of international soldiers killed in afghanistan this year .
forty-three have died this month alone , according to an afp news agency count based on official figures . the majority of the attacks have been concentrated in southern and eastern afghanistan , but there has also been scattered violence in the country 's north and west .
germany has some 3,500 troops stationed in northern afghanistan . sunday 's incident also came on the heels of afghan and german troops on friday killing two children and a woman by opening fire on cars that failed to stop at a checkpoint . the civilians ' death could " bring the perception that the bundeswehr is an occupying force back into the foreground , " social democratic defense spokesman walter kolbow told the weekly welt am sonntag ahead of sunday 's attack . while the german soldiers had largely been seen as a stabilizing force , " now the role of perpetrator has reached us .

"
he added that germany " risked falling into a quagmire of a dirty war that does not fight terrorism but leads to a new inclination towards violence that impairs civil reconstruction efforts . " the deputy head of the christian conservatives ' parliamentary group , eckart von klaeden , said the bundeswehr 's mission served the security of afghans as well as germans .

but it 's become even more difficult after moscow 's assault on georgia , analysts say . georgia 's strategic role as a pipeline transit country , run by a us-backed leadership that moscow detests , formed the backdrop to the conflict that erupted in early august .
after russian troops handed georgian president mikheil saakashvili a humiliating battlefield defeat , the region 's fragility and moscow 's clout are more obvious than ever .
monday 's emergency eu summit on georgia will not change that in the short term .
the european union will now be less likely to use " volatile transit routes " that bypass russia and tend toward " solid and stable " energy ties with moscow , said ivailo vesselinov , an economist at investment bank dresdner kleinwort in london .
" the signs point to the eu trying to cooperate more with russia , rather than less , " he said .
diversion effort may be postponed eu and us efforts to get around russia are focused on nabucco , a 7.9-billion-euro -lrb- $ 11.6-billion -rrb- pipeline slated to run caspian gas to central and western europe from georgia via turkey and bulgaria to austria .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former soviet states are often wary of russia 's motives nabucco 's vienna-based head office says the 3,300-kilometer -lrb- 2,050-mile -rrb- project remains on track , with construction to begin in 2010 and gas to start flowing in 2013 .
analysts are not so sure .
" i do n't think it 's dead , but it will be postponed ... because of the political uncertainties and the military intervention , " said claudia kemfert , an energy expert at the diw economic think tank in berlin .
" that 's a major difficulty for the project . "
a pipeline deal signed last year by georgia , poland , ukraine , azerbaijan and lithuania to pump caspian sea oil to western europe also seems more uncertain , vesselinov said .
russia is the eu 's single largest energy source , supplying 28 percent of the bloc 's oil and gas , according to the european commission .
some ex-communist countries , like the baltics or slovakia , depend on russia for all of their gas .
key nations in the old eu , notably germany , have long worked to expand energy ties with russia , seeking cooperation rather than confrontation .

us president george w bush even appointed a family friend as special envoy for eurasian energy , brussels-based diplomat c boyden gray .
but while analysts in washington have tended to see the russian invasion of georgia as a strategic defeat for us interests , europeans have taken a more muted view .
former german chancellor gerhard schroeder , who heads the shareholder committee of a russian-german pipeline consortium , firmly took russia 's side .

" creating mutual dependence also creates mutual security . "

the project will raise russia 's share of germany 's gas supply from about 40 percent to 50 percent , kemfert said .
moscow also is countering nabucco with the south stream project , designed to route russian gas under the black sea to bulgaria and serbia , with one leg ending at the same austrian terminal as nabucco and the other in italy .
nord stream has created fissures in the eu similar to the east-west split over the iraq war : poland and the baltics , generally suspicious of russian intentions , have raised environmental concerns about the undersea pipeline .
fighting in georgia appears to have trumped those worries . " our german partners must stop viewing the baltic sea pipeline as a purely economic project .
they should understand that russia can use the gas conduit to keep europe in check , " poland 's rzeczpospolita daily said in an editorial .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 31.08.2008 georgia crisis threatens eu bid for more energy sources großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in energy , the eu is more likely to cooperate with russia than bypass it , said one expert europe 's declared goal to shift away from russian oil and gas has always beem a challenge .
but it 's become even more difficult after moscow 's assault on georgia , analysts say . georgia 's strategic role as a pipeline transit country , run by a us-backed leadership that moscow detests , formed the backdrop to the conflict that erupted in early august .
after russian troops handed georgian president mikheil saakashvili a humiliating battlefield defeat , the region 's fragility and moscow 's clout are more obvious than ever .
monday 's emergency eu summit on georgia will not change that in the short term .
the european union will now be less likely to use " volatile transit routes " that bypass russia and tend toward " solid and stable " energy ties with moscow , said ivailo vesselinov , an economist at investment bank dresdner kleinwort in london .
" the signs point to the eu trying to cooperate more with russia , rather than less , " he said .
diversion effort may be postponed eu and us efforts to get around russia are focused on nabucco , a 7.9-billion-euro -lrb- $ 11.6-billion -rrb- pipeline slated to run caspian gas to central and western europe from georgia via turkey and bulgaria to austria .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the former soviet states are often wary of russia 's motives nabucco 's vienna-based head office says the 3,300-kilometer -lrb- 2,050-mile -rrb- project remains on track , with construction to begin in 2010 and gas to start flowing in 2013 .
analysts are not so sure .
" i do n't think it 's dead , but it will be postponed ... because of the political uncertainties and the military intervention , " said claudia kemfert , an energy expert at the diw economic think tank in berlin .
" that 's a major difficulty for the project . "
a pipeline deal signed last year by georgia , poland , ukraine , azerbaijan and lithuania to pump caspian sea oil to western europe also seems more uncertain , vesselinov said .
russia is the eu 's single largest energy source , supplying 28 percent of the bloc 's oil and gas , according to the european commission .
some ex-communist countries , like the baltics or slovakia , depend on russia for all of their gas .
key nations in the old eu , notably germany , have long worked to expand energy ties with russia , seeking cooperation rather than confrontation .
looking for alternatives in parallel , the search for alternatives was on .
the baku-tbilisi-ceyhan oil pipeline , involving british petroleum , azerbaijan , georgia and turkey , was launched in the late 1990s with eu and us backing , a response to the perceived need to lessen dependence on russia .
us president george w bush even appointed a family friend as special envoy for eurasian energy , brussels-based diplomat c boyden gray .
but while analysts in washington have tended to see the russian invasion of georgia as a strategic defeat for us interests , europeans have taken a more muted view .
former german chancellor gerhard schroeder , who heads the shareholder committee of a russian-german pipeline consortium , firmly took russia 's side .
" only dreamers can run after the notion of a western europe independent of russian oil and gas , " he told der spiegel magazine .
" creating mutual dependence also creates mutual security . "
russian energy splits europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltic sea pipeline will increase russia 's share of germany 's gas supply nord stream , the company schroeder is involved with , is building a pipeline under the baltic sea to move russian gas to germany .
the project will raise russia 's share of germany 's gas supply from about 40 percent to 50 percent , kemfert said .
moscow also is countering nabucco with the south stream project , designed to route russian gas under the black sea to bulgaria and serbia , with one leg ending at the same austrian terminal as nabucco and the other in italy .
nord stream has created fissures in the eu similar to the east-west split over the iraq war : poland and the baltics , generally suspicious of russian intentions , have raised environmental concerns about the undersea pipeline .
fighting in georgia appears to have trumped those worries . " our german partners must stop viewing the baltic sea pipeline as a purely economic project .
they should understand that russia can use the gas conduit to keep europe in check , " poland 's rzeczpospolita daily said in an editorial .
russia 's muscle-flexing may yet spur europe 's push for other energy sources , including wind and solar energy - already a european strength - and liquefied natural gas transported in tankers .

no one was injured . a german convoy in afghanistan was attacked sunday , aug .
31 , the german military command in the eastern city of potsdam said . the patrol , which included several vehicles , came under attack on sunday morning about 45 kilometers -lrb- 30 miles -rrb- west of the northern city of kunduz , in a region known to harbor taliban militants . no one was injured and the vehicles incurred only minor damage when the bomb went off , a spokesman for the command said . on wednesday , an eight-vehicle convoy patrolling the outskirts of kunduz , where the german military has its base , was hit by an improvised explosive device , killing a german staff sergeant and injuring three other troops . the german death took to 187 the number of international soldiers killed in afghanistan this year .

the imposing structure that includes a grand hall and a hotel is set to become the newest landmark on the port city 's skyline . at the western tip of hamburg 's harbor , the dramatic design of the new elbe philharmonic hall emerges slowly from the mists .
expected to be completed in two years , it will bring to the northern german port not only a new concert hall , but also an 110-meter landmark visible to approaching ships from way down river .
the designers are swiss architects herzog & de meuron , whose portfolio includes the tate modern in london , the allianz arena in munich and the de young museum in san francisco .
a ship-friendly landmark located at the tip of the sandtorhafen , the first industrial harbor basin in hamburg and at a site once occupied by the city 's kaiserspeicher warehouse complex , the elbe philharmonic hall is destined to become a navigational point for ships entering the harbor . a huge brick 1960s warehouse built to replace the kaiserspeicher , which was destroyed in world war ii , has had its interior gutted to make room for 500 parking spaces , an education section , back-stage facilities , rehearsal rooms , catering facilities and a spa area .
soon , construction of the main concert hall will begin - a spectacular , shimmering series of glass facades soaring to a height of 110 meters -lrb- 360 feet -rrb- on top of the warehouse .
the eiffel tower of hamburg ?
the centerpiece is an auditorium seating 2,150 .
is it possible to plan a landmark ?
hamburg mayor ole von beust says time will tell .
" but that 's only half the truth .
if we think of the eiffel tower , the statue of liberty , cologne cathedral or the sydney opera house three things came together to create a landmark - good visibility due to the size or location of the building , direct symbolism and a stimulating architectural idea , " beust said .
besides the grand hall there will also be two additional auditoriums , one of them with a 550-seat capacity , the other for experimental music and rehearsals .
on the eastern side there will be a five-star hotel with some 250 rooms , complete with spa and conference areas .
on the west , there will be 45 owner-occupied apartments with splendid views eastward down the elbe a plaza at a height of 37 meters , where visitors will be able to sip coffee while enjoying a view of the harbor , is also planned .
hamburg already has the laeiszhalle , an internationally renowned " old-style " concert hall .
time crunch christoph lieben-seutter , 44 , is the elbe philharmonic 's general director .
" it should be two or three years from now .
but you never know , " he says , noting that its foundation stone was only laid in april 2007 .
" past experience has shown that there can be considerable delays . "
" one has only to think of the sydney opera house , which took 30 years longer than intended , and the danish radio concert project in copenhagen now several years overdue , " lieben-seutter says .
completion date has been set back to 2011 from the planned 2010 .
" planning-wise , it will be tight although l think it can be done , " he says with regard to the 2010-11 concert program .
difficulties in design a challenge for the architects is ensuring audiences are located closer to the stage .
" the most important hall designed in this way is architect hans sharoun 's berlin philharmonie , built in the early 1960s , which was a landmark design at that time and a very successful one , " says lieben-seutter .
" many concert halls these days get designed in the so-called vineyard style on several levels .
in hamburg the aim is to develop that concept further , with ideas coming from several sources , including la scala in milan , " he says .
the acoustics are in the hands of yasuhisa toyota , chief acoustician of a whole range of concert hall projects in japan and the us .
the elbe philharmonic hall will not be the tallest building in hamburg .

the imposing structure that includes a grand hall and a hotel is set to become the newest landmark on the port city 's skyline . at the western tip of hamburg 's harbor , the dramatic design of the new elbe philharmonic hall emerges slowly from the mists .
expected to be completed in two years , it will bring to the northern german port not only a new concert hall , but also an 110-meter landmark visible to approaching ships from way down river .
the designers are swiss architects herzog & de meuron , whose portfolio includes the tate modern in london , the allianz arena in munich and the de young museum in san francisco .
a ship-friendly landmark located at the tip of the sandtorhafen , the first industrial harbor basin in hamburg and at a site once occupied by the city 's kaiserspeicher warehouse complex , the elbe philharmonic hall is destined to become a navigational point for ships entering the harbor . a huge brick 1960s warehouse built to replace the kaiserspeicher , which was destroyed in world war ii , has had its interior gutted to make room for 500 parking spaces , an education section , back-stage facilities , rehearsal rooms , catering facilities and a spa area .
soon , construction of the main concert hall will begin - a spectacular , shimmering series of glass facades soaring to a height of 110 meters -lrb- 360 feet -rrb- on top of the warehouse .
the eiffel tower of hamburg ?
the centerpiece is an auditorium seating 2,150 .
is it possible to plan a landmark ?
hamburg mayor ole von beust says time will tell .
" but that 's only half the truth .
if we think of the eiffel tower , the statue of liberty , cologne cathedral or the sydney opera house three things came together to create a landmark - good visibility due to the size or location of the building , direct symbolism and a stimulating architectural idea , " beust said .
besides the grand hall there will also be two additional auditoriums , one of them with a 550-seat capacity , the other for experimental music and rehearsals .
on the eastern side there will be a five-star hotel with some 250 rooms , complete with spa and conference areas .
on the west , there will be 45 owner-occupied apartments with splendid views eastward down the elbe a plaza at a height of 37 meters , where visitors will be able to sip coffee while enjoying a view of the harbor , is also planned .
hamburg already has the laeiszhalle , an internationally renowned " old-style " concert hall .
time crunch christoph lieben-seutter , 44 , is the elbe philharmonic 's general director .
" it should be two or three years from now .
but you never know , " he says , noting that its foundation stone was only laid in april 2007 .
" past experience has shown that there can be considerable delays . "
" one has only to think of the sydney opera house , which took 30 years longer than intended , and the danish radio concert project in copenhagen now several years overdue , " lieben-seutter says .
completion date has been set back to 2011 from the planned 2010 .
" planning-wise , it will be tight although l think it can be done , " he says with regard to the 2010-11 concert program .
difficulties in design a challenge for the architects is ensuring audiences are located closer to the stage .
" the most important hall designed in this way is architect hans sharoun 's berlin philharmonie , built in the early 1960s , which was a landmark design at that time and a very successful one , " says lieben-seutter .
" many concert halls these days get designed in the so-called vineyard style on several levels .
in hamburg the aim is to develop that concept further , with ideas coming from several sources , including la scala in milan , " he says .
the acoustics are in the hands of yasuhisa toyota , chief acoustician of a whole range of concert hall projects in japan and the us .
the elbe philharmonic hall will not be the tallest building in hamburg .

the storm hit cuba 's western pinar del rio province on saturday with winds of up to 240km / h -lrb- 150mph -rrb- , causing damage to property but no reported fatalities .
more than 300,000 people had been evacuated from coastal areas in cuba , to escape extensive flooding .
the storm had earlier killed more than 80 people when it swept through the caribbean .
four people were killed in jamaica , where the storm also shattered roads and bridges such as this one in kingston .
the caymans felt its force on friday night , with storm surges and heavy rain flooding .
people took refuge in government shelters and there were no reports of injuries .
the storm is predicted to reach america 's north gulf coast on monday and local people have been securing their property as best they can .
the mayor of new orleans has issued a mandatory evacuation order and warned that anyone deciding to stay behind would be making " the biggest mistake of their lives " .
the order covers every person in the city , including the emergency services - only a handful of city workers will remain behind .
thousands of new orleans residents have been leaving the city by car , fearing a repeat of the hurricane katrina disaster of 2005 .

they said the popularity of dance events contributed greatly to a rise of 7 % on 2007 ticket sales - up to more than £ 2.6m.
organisers said one in three shows sold out and that matthew bourne 's dorian gray was the best-selling dance show in the festival 's history .
in contrast edinburgh fringe ticket sales were down by almost 10 % on 2007 .
the festival director , jonathan mills , hailed this year 's festival as " a tremendous three weeks of performances " .
he said : " so many people have drawn together to put on a fantastic festival . "
' thrilled audiences ' the organisers of the festival said world events taking shape during the festival period " lent powerful resonance " to the festival 's european theme - artists without borders .
" some artists not only thrilled audiences with their festival performances , but brought with them an extra significance to their appearances as events unravelled at home , " they said .
the organisers pointed in particular to the presence of the state ballet of georgia , who performed at the same time as a brief war in their country .
meanwhile , the edinburgh festival fringe sold more than 1.5m tickets for the third year running but that was down from 1.7m in 2007 .
shortly after the downturn was reported , the director of the edinburgh festival fringe , jon morgan , announced his resignation .
bad weather , the poor global economy , competition from the olympics and problems at the fringe box office were all cited as factors for the drop .

they said the popularity of dance events contributed greatly to a rise of 7 % on 2007 ticket sales - up to more than £ 2.6m.
organisers said one in three shows sold out and that matthew bourne 's dorian gray was the best-selling dance show in the festival 's history .
in contrast edinburgh fringe ticket sales were down by almost 10 % on 2007 .
the festival director , jonathan mills , hailed this year 's festival as " a tremendous three weeks of performances " .
he said : " so many people have drawn together to put on a fantastic festival . "
' thrilled audiences ' the organisers of the festival said world events taking shape during the festival period " lent powerful resonance " to the festival 's european theme - artists without borders .
" some artists not only thrilled audiences with their festival performances , but brought with them an extra significance to their appearances as events unravelled at home , " they said .
the organisers pointed in particular to the presence of the state ballet of georgia , who performed at the same time as a brief war in their country .
meanwhile , the edinburgh festival fringe sold more than 1.5m tickets for the third year running but that was down from 1.7m in 2007 .
shortly after the downturn was reported , the director of the edinburgh festival fringe , jon morgan , announced his resignation .
bad weather , the poor global economy , competition from the olympics and problems at the fringe box office were all cited as factors for the drop .

those staying in new orleans are preparing for the worst the 25-year-old warwick university chemistry student , who lives in coventry , says he only just managed to get on a plane - at two hours ' notice - ahead of new orleans mayor ray nagin 's mandatory evacuation order .
he had been in the city with two friends after attending a conference in philadelphia , and says new orleans seemed strangely relaxed , despite the impending danger .
i flew into new orleans on 27 august .
when my friends and i checked into our accommodation we were told that the hotel would probably be closing on the 30th due to hurricane gustav .
we were booked to stay until the 31st .
if this had not disrupted our plan , we would probably still be in new orleans right now rather than safely back home in the uk .
after watching the weather channel we decided we would hit bourbon street and decide what our plans would be in the morning when we knew more about the hurricane .
before we left for the evening the hotel janitor advised us to phone the airport to find out what was going on .
that man was a lifesaver .
' inspired decision ' the next morning we booked a ' swamp tour ' for the afternoon - which shows how relaxed the city was despite the impending storm .
however , before we left to tour the french quarter we decided to ring the airline on a whim .
it was an inspired decision .
apparently every flight from new orleans had been booked up overnight .
even our own flights home for 31 august had been taken - our seats had n't been guaranteed - and we could n't catch them .
the city that nearly died with hurricane katrina could well be buried by hurricane gustav apparently the first plane from louisiana to the uk would be 2 september .
however , as we had also been advised that airlines would ground their flights and move planes away to avoid losing them , we knew that there was no way that we could realistically get these .
our only way out would have been by bus , train or hitchhike - options that the population of the city would also have to rely upon .
we hastily rearranged our travel plans and were forced to take the next flight out of new orleans , which was leaving in about two hours ' time , and was the only one available to us before 2 september .
on the way out to the airport we saw many tourists preparing to abandon the city .
however , there was still not the sense of urgency i might have expected and i knew that things would only get more chaotic as the storm prepared to land .
i was glad i was leaving when i was and had n't chosen to wait until things got really competitive .
impending catastrophe i saw the so-called ' calm before the storm ' .
i used to think it referred to the weather but now i understand it is about the behaviour of people in the face of an impending catastrophe .
on the way out i saw no cars loaded with belongings , no queues of traffic .
although the roads were busy , it seemed like the citizens were going to work .
i think the people of new orleans were desperately trying to convince themselves that their city was not in the firing line and feigning normality was their way of doing so .
the route into new orleans was as busy as the road out .
it was most eerie .
residents of new orleans are now fleeing the city by road , rail and air had we not acted on the janitor 's advice , we could easily have been stranded in new orleans .
why did the airline fly us into the city when they must have suspected that there would be an evacuation some time soon ?
according to the person who rearranged our journey back , flights went from being available to being sold out almost overnight .
we had a close call - had a few things not been said to us we could be in a lot of danger right now .
we were three stand-by passengers on our flight out of the city - that means at least three people did not use their ticket out .
the people i spoke to said that if gustav hits they will leave the city and not go back .
it will be a ghost town , a city that exists for mardi gras and nothing more .
even then it would be for tourists only .
the city that nearly died with hurricane katrina could well be buried by hurricane gustav .

those staying in new orleans are preparing for the worst the 25-year-old warwick university chemistry student , who lives in coventry , says he only just managed to get on a plane - at two hours ' notice - ahead of new orleans mayor ray nagin 's mandatory evacuation order .
he had been in the city with two friends after attending a conference in philadelphia , and says new orleans seemed strangely relaxed , despite the impending danger .
i flew into new orleans on 27 august .
when my friends and i checked into our accommodation we were told that the hotel would probably be closing on the 30th due to hurricane gustav .
we were booked to stay until the 31st .
if this had not disrupted our plan , we would probably still be in new orleans right now rather than safely back home in the uk .
after watching the weather channel we decided we would hit bourbon street and decide what our plans would be in the morning when we knew more about the hurricane .
before we left for the evening the hotel janitor advised us to phone the airport to find out what was going on .
that man was a lifesaver .
' inspired decision ' the next morning we booked a ' swamp tour ' for the afternoon - which shows how relaxed the city was despite the impending storm .
however , before we left to tour the french quarter we decided to ring the airline on a whim .
it was an inspired decision .
apparently every flight from new orleans had been booked up overnight .
even our own flights home for 31 august had been taken - our seats had n't been guaranteed - and we could n't catch them .
the city that nearly died with hurricane katrina could well be buried by hurricane gustav apparently the first plane from louisiana to the uk would be 2 september .
however , as we had also been advised that airlines would ground their flights and move planes away to avoid losing them , we knew that there was no way that we could realistically get these .
our only way out would have been by bus , train or hitchhike - options that the population of the city would also have to rely upon .
we hastily rearranged our travel plans and were forced to take the next flight out of new orleans , which was leaving in about two hours ' time , and was the only one available to us before 2 september .
on the way out to the airport we saw many tourists preparing to abandon the city .
however , there was still not the sense of urgency i might have expected and i knew that things would only get more chaotic as the storm prepared to land .
i was glad i was leaving when i was and had n't chosen to wait until things got really competitive .
impending catastrophe i saw the so-called ' calm before the storm ' .
i used to think it referred to the weather but now i understand it is about the behaviour of people in the face of an impending catastrophe .
on the way out i saw no cars loaded with belongings , no queues of traffic .
although the roads were busy , it seemed like the citizens were going to work .
i think the people of new orleans were desperately trying to convince themselves that their city was not in the firing line and feigning normality was their way of doing so .
the route into new orleans was as busy as the road out .
it was most eerie .
residents of new orleans are now fleeing the city by road , rail and air had we not acted on the janitor 's advice , we could easily have been stranded in new orleans .
why did the airline fly us into the city when they must have suspected that there would be an evacuation some time soon ?
according to the person who rearranged our journey back , flights went from being available to being sold out almost overnight .
we had a close call - had a few things not been said to us we could be in a lot of danger right now .
we were three stand-by passengers on our flight out of the city - that means at least three people did not use their ticket out .
the people i spoke to said that if gustav hits they will leave the city and not go back .
it will be a ghost town , a city that exists for mardi gras and nothing more .
even then it would be for tourists only .
the city that nearly died with hurricane katrina could well be buried by hurricane gustav .

on the way out to the airport we saw many tourists preparing to abandon the city .
however , there was still not the sense of urgency i might have expected and i knew that things would only get more chaotic as the storm prepared to land .
i was glad i was leaving when i was and had n't chosen to wait until things got really competitive .
impending catastrophe i saw the so-called ' calm before the storm ' .
i used to think it referred to the weather but now i understand it is about the behaviour of people in the face of an impending catastrophe .
on the way out i saw no cars loaded with belongings , no queues of traffic .
although the roads were busy , it seemed like the citizens were going to work .
i think the people of new orleans were desperately trying to convince themselves that their city was not in the firing line and feigning normality was their way of doing so .
the route into new orleans was as busy as the road out .
it was most eerie .
residents of new orleans are now fleeing the city by road , rail and air had we not acted on the janitor 's advice , we could easily have been stranded in new orleans .
why did the airline fly us into the city when they must have suspected that there would be an evacuation some time soon ?
according to the person who rearranged our journey back , flights went from being available to being sold out almost overnight .
we had a close call - had a few things not been said to us we could be in a lot of danger right now .
we were three stand-by passengers on our flight out of the city - that means at least three people did not use their ticket out .
the people i spoke to said that if gustav hits they will leave the city and not go back .
it will be a ghost town , a city that exists for mardi gras and nothing more .
even then it would be for tourists only .
the city that nearly died with hurricane katrina could well be buried by hurricane gustav .

those staying in new orleans are preparing for the worst the 25-year-old warwick university chemistry student , who lives in coventry , says he only just managed to get on a plane - at two hours ' notice - ahead of new orleans mayor ray nagin 's mandatory evacuation order .
he had been in the city with two friends after attending a conference in philadelphia , and says new orleans seemed strangely relaxed , despite the impending danger .
i flew into new orleans on 27 august .
when my friends and i checked into our accommodation we were told that the hotel would probably be closing on the 30th due to hurricane gustav .
we were booked to stay until the 31st .
if this had not disrupted our plan , we would probably still be in new orleans right now rather than safely back home in the uk .
after watching the weather channel we decided we would hit bourbon street and decide what our plans would be in the morning when we knew more about the hurricane .
before we left for the evening the hotel janitor advised us to phone the airport to find out what was going on .
that man was a lifesaver .
' inspired decision ' the next morning we booked a ' swamp tour ' for the afternoon - which shows how relaxed the city was despite the impending storm .
however , before we left to tour the french quarter we decided to ring the airline on a whim .
it was an inspired decision .
apparently every flight from new orleans had been booked up overnight .
even our own flights home for 31 august had been taken - our seats had n't been guaranteed - and we could n't catch them .
the city that nearly died with hurricane katrina could well be buried by hurricane gustav apparently the first plane from louisiana to the uk would be 2 september .
however , as we had also been advised that airlines would ground their flights and move planes away to avoid losing them , we knew that there was no way that we could realistically get these .

advertisement mexico march against killings hundreds of thousands of people have marched throughout mexico to protest against a continuing wave of killings and kidnappings in the country .
the rallies were held in all of mexico 's 32 states , with more than 150,000 people gathering at zocalo square in the capital , mexico city .
they were mainly dressed in white , and marched in silence , holding candles .
at least 2,700 people have been killed and 300 kidnapped so far this year , mostly in drugs-related violence .
earlier this week , a dozen headless bodies were found in the yucatan peninsula .
the marches also come a week after president felipe calderon announced new measures to deal with the violence .
' no more impunity ' dressed in white , tens of thousands of mexicans walked in silence along the capital 's main boulevard , holding candles and lanterns , to show that they had had enough of the murders and kidnappings plaguing their country .
many mexicans say the government is unable to curb the violence in pictures many carried national flags - a sign that they want a unified country in the fight against crime .
others carried banners bearing slogans such as " no more impunity " and " no more revoking sentences " .
others carried pictures of their children who had been kidnapped .
" the most frustrating thing has been the indolence of many of the authorities , their insensitivity , " said the father of monica alejandrina ramirez , who was kidnapped in 2004 and has not been heard of since .
" i have often asked myself , why ?
why me ?
why my daughter ? "
once everyone had arrived at zocalo square and the sun had set , they sang the national anthem , and put out their candles together .
there were similar co-ordinated scenes in dozens of towns and cities across mexico as thousands of others staged " iluminemos mexico " , or " let 's illuminate mexico " , silent marches .
the organisers hoped to emulate a similar march in 2004 , when almost half a million people protested against violence , forcing the government to target police corruption and introduce reforms .
emergency programme the bbc 's duncan kennedy in mexico city says the marches are a visible sign of how anxious people continue to be about the violence , and their frustration at the government 's inability to reduce it .
many protesters blame the government for the high crime rate " the message is : get to work or we 'll hold you accountable , " said eduardo gallo , whose 25-year-old daughter was kidnapped and murdered in 2000 .
" we are angry . "
last week the country 's political and security leaders drew up an emergency , 74-point plan to try to combat the wave of violence .
measures include sacking corrupt police officers , equipping security forces with more powerful weapons , new prisons for kidnappers and strategies to combat money-laundering and drug-trafficking .
president calderon has already deployed more than 25,000 troops across the country to combat the powerful drug cartels .
washington is also pumping in hundreds of millions of dollars to help .
but the cartels and kidnappers are well organised and often have the acquiescence of corrupt police officers , our correspondent says .
the organisers of this march know restoring a sense of calm and order will need wholesale changes in mexican society , something one march on one day can not achieve , he adds .

amanda cottrell , from challock in kent , was promoting attempts to raise £ 50m to restore canterbury cathedral and a scheme backing local food production .
mrs cottrell was joined by tv historian dr david starkey and family members including grandson jack regan , four .
the right of freemen to drive sheep on the bridge dates from the 11th century .
mrs cottrell , 67 , a former high sheriff of kent , drove six new romney rams from the city side to the south side of the river on sunday morning .
" it was absolutely brilliant , " she said .
" the sheep were impeccably behaved , it was really was an unusual , but i think , effective way of raising publicity about the two causes . "
deteriorating stonework mrs cottrell was also accompanied by viscount de l 'isle , whose family seat , penshurst place , is in the weald of kent .
she said it was the first time for about 10 years that the right to drive sheep across the bridge had been exercised .
the fundraising campaign to restore canterbury cathedral , started in 2006 , has raised £ 7.5m so far .
fundraisers have said deteriorating stonework and a leaking roof mean parts of the kent cathedral might have to be closed unless the cash is raised .

amanda cottrell , from challock in kent , was promoting attempts to raise £ 50m to restore canterbury cathedral and a scheme backing local food production .
mrs cottrell was joined by tv historian dr david starkey and family members including grandson jack regan , four .
the right of freemen to drive sheep on the bridge dates from the 11th century .
mrs cottrell , 67 , a former high sheriff of kent , drove six new romney rams from the city side to the south side of the river on sunday morning .
" it was absolutely brilliant , " she said .
" the sheep were impeccably behaved , it was really was an unusual , but i think , effective way of raising publicity about the two causes . "
deteriorating stonework mrs cottrell was also accompanied by viscount de l 'isle , whose family seat , penshurst place , is in the weald of kent .
she said it was the first time for about 10 years that the right to drive sheep across the bridge had been exercised .
the fundraising campaign to restore canterbury cathedral , started in 2006 , has raised £ 7.5m so far .
fundraisers have said deteriorating stonework and a leaking roof mean parts of the kent cathedral might have to be closed unless the cash is raised .
the cathedral , which was founded by st augustine in 597 and is visited by about a million people each year , has been damaged by age , pollution and world war ii bombs .
