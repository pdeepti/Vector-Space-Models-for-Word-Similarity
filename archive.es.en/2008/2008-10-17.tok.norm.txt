the board of directors of the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- decided that the rule , which states that germans have to own the majority of shares in bundesliga clubs and have to have the majority of votes in clubs , should remain in place , the dfl announced thursday .
the proposal to keep the rule in place is to be put to the general dfl body .
to have it changed a two / thirds majority of the dfl membership , as well as of the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- would have to pass it .
at a press conference , dfl president reinhard rauball said that the decision was taken after a thorough discussion and consideration of the arguments put forward by hanover 96 .
" the bundesliga lives from its stability and continuity .
this has to be maintained to ensure that the competition remains fair , ” he added hanover 96 officials had earlier called on the dfl to change the ruling to allow them to attract foreign investors for their club .
martin kind , president of hanover 96 , said that more and more clubs are siding with the north german club .
" we do n't yet have 75 percent , so the recommendations of the league 's board of directors will pass , " he added .
additionally it was decided that the league cup would not be held in 2009 .
the cup , which is a pre-season playoff between the top five teams in the league , was not held this year .
the teams will have to forgo any extra proceeds that would have been earned through ticket sales to the cup ticket . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

seeing more bench time than field play these days , the german midfielder expresses his frustration as well as his need to evaluate his future in the sport .
joachim loew insists his player is still a factor . midfielder torsten frings is the latest germany player toying with retirement as coach joachim loew now no longer guarantees anyone a place in the starting 11 .
" i am really thinking about it , retiring is more and more on my mind , " frings told friday 's edition of the bild daily .
the 31-year-old from werder bremen was a key player in germany 's run to third place at the 2006 world cup and also played at euro 2008 where germany lost the final against spain .
tired of being a benchwarmer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : also tired of being benched , kuranyi made headlines when he walked out during germany 's match against wales however , he was fielded only for seven minutes in saturday 's 2-1 win against russia and not at all on wednesday when germany beat wales 1-0 in another world cup qualifier .
frings insisted he was not sulking but named the fact that he was n't even told to warm up against wales " a humiliation . "
the statements of the 78-times capped frings come less than a week after schalke 04 forward kevin kuranyi left the team during the russia game .
kuranyi later apologized but loew said he would n't pick him again as long as he was coach .
frings told bild he missed " support , trust and respect " from loew , which led to the retirement considerations .

seeing more bench time than field play these days , the german midfielder expresses his frustration as well as his need to evaluate his future in the sport .
joachim loew insists his player is still a factor . midfielder torsten frings is the latest germany player toying with retirement as coach joachim loew now no longer guarantees anyone a place in the starting 11 .
" i am really thinking about it , retiring is more and more on my mind , " frings told friday 's edition of the bild daily .
the 31-year-old from werder bremen was a key player in germany 's run to third place at the 2006 world cup and also played at euro 2008 where germany lost the final against spain .
tired of being a benchwarmer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : also tired of being benched , kuranyi made headlines when he walked out during germany 's match against wales however , he was fielded only for seven minutes in saturday 's 2-1 win against russia and not at all on wednesday when germany beat wales 1-0 in another world cup qualifier .
frings insisted he was not sulking but named the fact that he was n't even told to warm up against wales " a humiliation . "
the statements of the 78-times capped frings come less than a week after schalke 04 forward kevin kuranyi left the team during the russia game .
kuranyi later apologized but loew said he would n't pick him again as long as he was coach .
frings told bild he missed " support , trust and respect " from loew , which led to the retirement considerations .
" i ca n't rule it out .
of course i am thinking about retirement .
not because i am sulking but because the last days were an eye-opener ...
at almost 32 you have a feeling for it .
i ca n't see a future for myself under him -lrb- loew -rrb- right now , " frings said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lowe stays close to ballack as the coach 's popularity with his players wanes frings has been through several injury setbacks over the past two years but insisted that he was still as good as thomas hitzlsperger or simon rolfes who have recently played in his place in midfield .
“ i hold nothing against simon rofes or thomas hitzlsperger .
but i also know that they are not better ! " he said .
coach still wants frings loew , for his part , said earlier this week that he picks his players based on present form and not on past merits .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 17.10.2008 loss of natural capital costs more than bank crisis , says expert großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the financial crisis has left us unable to see the wood for the trees as the eu discusses the affordability of its carbon-reduction targets , economist pavan sukhdev told dw-world.de that the best things in life are free , but not for much longer .
the nature crunch could prove costly . once described as an " economist by profession and an ecologist at heart , " pavan sukhdev holds the chair of deutsche bank 's global market center and is director of the green accounting for indian states project , a study on the economic significance of biodiversity in india .
he also heads an ongoing global report funded by the german ministry for the environment and the european commission on " the economics of ecosystems & biodiversity " -lrb- teeb -rrb- , and is among the architects of the green new deal , spearheaded by the united nations environment program , which will be unveiled in london on oct .
22 .
dw-world.de : you said at the world conservation congress in barcelona last week that the economic burden of environmentally hostile practices like deforestation outweighs that of the bank crisis .
pavan sukhdev : the capital loss to financial firms in the city and wall street has been estimated as $ 1 trillion to $ 1.5 trillion .
in teeb 's first phase report which we presented in may , we looked at the extent of losses taking place as a result of deforestation and degradation .
we estimated the loss in human welfare as a capital item , and worked out that this was $ 2 to $ 4.5 trillion per year , every year , for the last several years .
and it will continue , if we carry on with business as usual .
why is it that a one-off loss of $ 1.5 trillion in financial capital to a group of wall street firms attracts so much attention , whereas the ongoing loss per annum of twice this amount of natural capital is barely reported ?
we 've seen governments bail out the economy - what would a " bailout " for the environment look like ?
it would be comparatively modest .
let me give you a few indicating benchmarks .
today we have something like 100,000 conservation areas , covering some 10-11 percent of the earth 's land surface .
the teeb team believes that we are spending some $ 40-50 billion too little on making that conservation effective .
according to various estimates , these conservation areas produce some $ 4-5 trillion of utility per year .
today , spending on protected areas globally is less than $ 20 billion , and all we 're suggesting is an increase of another $ 50 billion a year to ensure the continuation of the benefits of these protected areas .
we 're not talking about a massive amount of money - single institutions have lost more than that in the current financial chaos .
but for various reasons it doesn ’ t get allocated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pavan sukhdev what are these reasons ?
for one , the loss of natural capital is a loss of public wealth .
eco-system services are public benefits that are pretty much free .
it is not individuals ' or shareholders ' wealth at stake , although it is , if you like , global shareholders ' wealth .
but it 's not private ownership , it 's public ownership .
these are things that are there for all to enjoy : we would dearly miss their absence and we would pay the earth to get them back , but right now , they 're free .
so the public nature of these goods and services is one reason .
to understand the second reason why loss of natural capital does n't grab headlines , we need to think of the frog analogy used by al gore in his book " an inconvenient truth " : if you put a frog in a beaker of water and gradually raise the temperature , it wo n't notice any change .
similarly , what is happening to us is happening continuously .
every year we lose forest , the climate gets worse , poor people 's water supplies and field nutrients decline .
but we see these losses so gradually that we do n't realize that things are getting worse .
whereas in the case of the financial markets it 's one short , sharp shock .
nonetheless , a lot of smart money has started to flow into environmental investment .
in north america , the percentage of venture capital spent on clean technology used to be around 2 percent in 2002 , but had risen to 17 percent by 2007 .
is there a risk that environmental concerns will be abandoned given the current slowdown in the global economy ? i do n't think so , because people are beginning to get the message . i never have to explain myself twice any more .
even two years ago , people 's eyes would glaze over .
now people want to know what needs to be done .
of course , the cost of the financial crisis means there will now be increased distributional pressure on how much can be allocated to solving environmental problems .
but my point is that this money is not much , considering how much is spent on other sectors .
there 's no need to think about it too much .
the time is now .
how viable is a rescue plan like this during a recession , which is what we 're facing right now ?
a $ 45 billion gap per annum is not the end of the world .
look at how much has been lost and how much is being allocated individually by governments in the us and europe - up to $ 700 billion .
to put things in context , the investment per annum of the eu in conservation areas is about 6 billion euros .
these are modest sums .
so economic disaster does n't necessarily have to mean ecological disaster too ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the financial crisis is reported extensively - the environmental one is n't no .
venture capitalists have understood something that the world , generally , has not .
as other businesses begin using the technology into which venture capital has been invested , they will find amazing and sizeable opportunities .
i predict a tectonic shift in the way things are done .
renewable energy is an extraordinary opportunity if you use it not just to fix the supply that comes to you and me in berlin and london , but to fix the supply needed by the world 's 2 billion who do n't have an energy supply - the poorest people in the world who do not actually have energy coming to their homes in the form of oil , coal or electricity .
there are vast opportunities here , in countries like india and china , africa and latin america , to apply well-researched technologies which provide , for example , modular solutions to bring light into the poor home .
just imagine what kind of change you could see - education coming down to a village level , children staying up in order to read . think of the tectonic shift than can be achieved just by shifting focus and providing micro-finance to villagers to implement renewable energy solutions .
and look at the number of people who can benefit from that .
these are the sort of things that smart business is looking at .
there is money in making more efficient equipment and implementing more efficient processes .
does the credit crunch make people more aware that being careful with natural capital is important too ?
yes .
as the saying goes , a crisis is a terrible thing to waste . interview : jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the nature crunch could prove costly . once described as an " economist by profession and an ecologist at heart , " pavan sukhdev holds the chair of deutsche bank 's global market center and is director of the green accounting for indian states project , a study on the economic significance of biodiversity in india .
he also heads an ongoing global report funded by the german ministry for the environment and the european commission on " the economics of ecosystems & biodiversity " -lrb- teeb -rrb- , and is among the architects of the green new deal , spearheaded by the united nations environment program , which will be unveiled in london on oct .
22 .
dw-world.de : you said at the world conservation congress in barcelona last week that the economic burden of environmentally hostile practices like deforestation outweighs that of the bank crisis .
pavan sukhdev : the capital loss to financial firms in the city and wall street has been estimated as $ 1 trillion to $ 1.5 trillion .
in teeb 's first phase report which we presented in may , we looked at the extent of losses taking place as a result of deforestation and degradation .
we estimated the loss in human welfare as a capital item , and worked out that this was $ 2 to $ 4.5 trillion per year , every year , for the last several years .
and it will continue , if we carry on with business as usual .
why is it that a one-off loss of $ 1.5 trillion in financial capital to a group of wall street firms attracts so much attention , whereas the ongoing loss per annum of twice this amount of natural capital is barely reported ?
we 've seen governments bail out the economy - what would a " bailout " for the environment look like ?
it would be comparatively modest .
let me give you a few indicating benchmarks .
today we have something like 100,000 conservation areas , covering some 10-11 percent of the earth 's land surface .
the teeb team believes that we are spending some $ 40-50 billion too little on making that conservation effective .
according to various estimates , these conservation areas produce some $ 4-5 trillion of utility per year .
today , spending on protected areas globally is less than $ 20 billion , and all we 're suggesting is an increase of another $ 50 billion a year to ensure the continuation of the benefits of these protected areas .
we 're not talking about a massive amount of money - single institutions have lost more than that in the current financial chaos .
but for various reasons it doesn ’ t get allocated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pavan sukhdev what are these reasons ?
for one , the loss of natural capital is a loss of public wealth .
eco-system services are public benefits that are pretty much free .
it is not individuals ' or shareholders ' wealth at stake , although it is , if you like , global shareholders ' wealth .
but it 's not private ownership , it 's public ownership .
these are things that are there for all to enjoy : we would dearly miss their absence and we would pay the earth to get them back , but right now , they 're free .
so the public nature of these goods and services is one reason .
to understand the second reason why loss of natural capital does n't grab headlines , we need to think of the frog analogy used by al gore in his book " an inconvenient truth " : if you put a frog in a beaker of water and gradually raise the temperature , it wo n't notice any change .
similarly , what is happening to us is happening continuously .
every year we lose forest , the climate gets worse , poor people 's water supplies and field nutrients decline .
but we see these losses so gradually that we do n't realize that things are getting worse .
whereas in the case of the financial markets it 's one short , sharp shock .
nonetheless , a lot of smart money has started to flow into environmental investment .
in north america , the percentage of venture capital spent on clean technology used to be around 2 percent in 2002 , but had risen to 17 percent by 2007 .
is there a risk that environmental concerns will be abandoned given the current slowdown in the global economy ? i do n't think so , because people are beginning to get the message . i never have to explain myself twice any more .
even two years ago , people 's eyes would glaze over .
now people want to know what needs to be done .
of course , the cost of the financial crisis means there will now be increased distributional pressure on how much can be allocated to solving environmental problems .
but my point is that this money is not much , considering how much is spent on other sectors .
there 's no need to think about it too much .
the time is now .
how viable is a rescue plan like this during a recession , which is what we 're facing right now ?
a $ 45 billion gap per annum is not the end of the world .
look at how much has been lost and how much is being allocated individually by governments in the us and europe - up to $ 700 billion .
to put things in context , the investment per annum of the eu in conservation areas is about 6 billion euros .
these are modest sums .
so economic disaster does n't necessarily have to mean ecological disaster too ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the financial crisis is reported extensively - the environmental one is n't no .
venture capitalists have understood something that the world , generally , has not .
as other businesses begin using the technology into which venture capital has been invested , they will find amazing and sizeable opportunities .
i predict a tectonic shift in the way things are done .
renewable energy is an extraordinary opportunity if you use it not just to fix the supply that comes to you and me in berlin and london , but to fix the supply needed by the world 's 2 billion who do n't have an energy supply - the poorest people in the world who do not actually have energy coming to their homes in the form of oil , coal or electricity .
there are vast opportunities here , in countries like india and china , africa and latin america , to apply well-researched technologies which provide , for example , modular solutions to bring light into the poor home .
just imagine what kind of change you could see - education coming down to a village level , children staying up in order to read . think of the tectonic shift than can be achieved just by shifting focus and providing micro-finance to villagers to implement renewable energy solutions .
and look at the number of people who can benefit from that .
these are the sort of things that smart business is looking at .

the nature crunch could prove costly . once described as an " economist by profession and an ecologist at heart , " pavan sukhdev holds the chair of deutsche bank 's global market center and is director of the green accounting for indian states project , a study on the economic significance of biodiversity in india .
he also heads an ongoing global report funded by the german ministry for the environment and the european commission on " the economics of ecosystems & biodiversity " -lrb- teeb -rrb- , and is among the architects of the green new deal , spearheaded by the united nations environment program , which will be unveiled in london on oct .
22 .
dw-world.de : you said at the world conservation congress in barcelona last week that the economic burden of environmentally hostile practices like deforestation outweighs that of the bank crisis .
pavan sukhdev : the capital loss to financial firms in the city and wall street has been estimated as $ 1 trillion to $ 1.5 trillion .
in teeb 's first phase report which we presented in may , we looked at the extent of losses taking place as a result of deforestation and degradation .
we estimated the loss in human welfare as a capital item , and worked out that this was $ 2 to $ 4.5 trillion per year , every year , for the last several years .
and it will continue , if we carry on with business as usual .
why is it that a one-off loss of $ 1.5 trillion in financial capital to a group of wall street firms attracts so much attention , whereas the ongoing loss per annum of twice this amount of natural capital is barely reported ?
we 've seen governments bail out the economy - what would a " bailout " for the environment look like ?
it would be comparatively modest .
let me give you a few indicating benchmarks .
today we have something like 100,000 conservation areas , covering some 10-11 percent of the earth 's land surface .
the teeb team believes that we are spending some $ 40-50 billion too little on making that conservation effective .
according to various estimates , these conservation areas produce some $ 4-5 trillion of utility per year .
today , spending on protected areas globally is less than $ 20 billion , and all we 're suggesting is an increase of another $ 50 billion a year to ensure the continuation of the benefits of these protected areas .
we 're not talking about a massive amount of money - single institutions have lost more than that in the current financial chaos .
but for various reasons it doesn ’ t get allocated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pavan sukhdev what are these reasons ?
for one , the loss of natural capital is a loss of public wealth .
eco-system services are public benefits that are pretty much free .
it is not individuals ' or shareholders ' wealth at stake , although it is , if you like , global shareholders ' wealth .
but it 's not private ownership , it 's public ownership .
these are things that are there for all to enjoy : we would dearly miss their absence and we would pay the earth to get them back , but right now , they 're free .
so the public nature of these goods and services is one reason .
to understand the second reason why loss of natural capital does n't grab headlines , we need to think of the frog analogy used by al gore in his book " an inconvenient truth " : if you put a frog in a beaker of water and gradually raise the temperature , it wo n't notice any change .
similarly , what is happening to us is happening continuously .
every year we lose forest , the climate gets worse , poor people 's water supplies and field nutrients decline .
but we see these losses so gradually that we do n't realize that things are getting worse .
whereas in the case of the financial markets it 's one short , sharp shock .
nonetheless , a lot of smart money has started to flow into environmental investment .
in north america , the percentage of venture capital spent on clean technology used to be around 2 percent in 2002 , but had risen to 17 percent by 2007 .
is there a risk that environmental concerns will be abandoned given the current slowdown in the global economy ? i do n't think so , because people are beginning to get the message . i never have to explain myself twice any more .
even two years ago , people 's eyes would glaze over .
now people want to know what needs to be done .
of course , the cost of the financial crisis means there will now be increased distributional pressure on how much can be allocated to solving environmental problems .
but my point is that this money is not much , considering how much is spent on other sectors .
there 's no need to think about it too much .
the time is now .
how viable is a rescue plan like this during a recession , which is what we 're facing right now ?
a $ 45 billion gap per annum is not the end of the world .
look at how much has been lost and how much is being allocated individually by governments in the us and europe - up to $ 700 billion .
to put things in context , the investment per annum of the eu in conservation areas is about 6 billion euros .
these are modest sums .
so economic disaster does n't necessarily have to mean ecological disaster too ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the financial crisis is reported extensively - the environmental one is n't no .
venture capitalists have understood something that the world , generally , has not .
as other businesses begin using the technology into which venture capital has been invested , they will find amazing and sizeable opportunities .
i predict a tectonic shift in the way things are done .
renewable energy is an extraordinary opportunity if you use it not just to fix the supply that comes to you and me in berlin and london , but to fix the supply needed by the world 's 2 billion who do n't have an energy supply - the poorest people in the world who do not actually have energy coming to their homes in the form of oil , coal or electricity .
there are vast opportunities here , in countries like india and china , africa and latin america , to apply well-researched technologies which provide , for example , modular solutions to bring light into the poor home .
just imagine what kind of change you could see - education coming down to a village level , children staying up in order to read . think of the tectonic shift than can be achieved just by shifting focus and providing micro-finance to villagers to implement renewable energy solutions .
and look at the number of people who can benefit from that .
these are the sort of things that smart business is looking at .
there is money in making more efficient equipment and implementing more efficient processes .
does the credit crunch make people more aware that being careful with natural capital is important too ?
yes .
as the saying goes , a crisis is a terrible thing to waste . interview : jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

will books as we know them soon be a thing of the past ?
a new generation of digital " e-readers " has the german publishing industry gearing up for a fast-moving digital future . electronic books were announced as the " next big thing " a decade ago .
but the technology that came out at the time failed to impress consumers , and made few inroads into the market .
now some new e-readers , predicted to be put on the market in europe in the near future , have publishing industry insiders preparing for major changes .
lightweight devices like amazon 's kindle and the sony reader have been the focus of intense interest since they celebrated their german coming-out party at the frankfurt book fair , which runs through oct .
19 .
e-books - stars of the frankfurt fair the press toasted the new readers as the " true stars " of this year 's fair .
but considering the changes they could represent for the staid publishing industry , players are eyeing them with a mixture of fascination and fear .
" overall , i think german publishers are very enthusiastic about e-books , " said thomas wilking , editor in chief of the german publishing trade magazine buchreport .
" they are just waiting for a device they think is attractive enough for a wide public . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sony is hoping its reader will impress europeans book fair organizers took an unscientific survey of 1,000 industry players on the future of the new technology , and published it just before the fair opened .
unfortunately , the data failed to paint any clear road map for the future .
more than 70 percent of respondents said they were ready for the digital challenge - but 60 percent of them had neither used e-readers nor downloaded e-books themselves .
meanwhile , a full 40 percent said they expect e-content to dominate the market by 2018 - compared with one-third of respondents who said e-books will never take over .
12 percent thought the new e-readers would be a short-lived flash in the pan .
' you could take 50 books to the beach ' jak boumans , a dutch media-content consultant who runs his own firm , electronic media reporting , is convinced e-books are here to stay .
but he estimates it will be at least 2030 before they are in wide usage , considering how many details still need to be ironed out , and how ingrained peoples ' attitudes are towards reading .
" this has been a topic for the last 30 years , but the mentality is still trying to catch up with the technology , " boumans said .
" e-readers mean people could go on holiday without packing a stack of heavy books - they can take 50 books with them in one device and still read it on the beach . "
observers praise the kindle and reader as being significantly improved from the last devices that tried to storm the market but failed .
the new devices have extended their battery life and traded the backlit computer screen for a paper-simulating " e-paper " that is less hard on the eyes .
the ritual of turning pages some book lovers wonder if an electronic device will ever really replace paper books , however .
johann schumandl , owner of a small independent book store in cologne , said he thinks people might accept e-readers for reading work documents .
but printed books will never disappear completely : " when you read a book you have the sense of touch , the haptic value , " he said .
" there is something ritualistic about reading a book , turning the pages . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : which e-reader will capture the market ?
boumans agrees that casual readers - who he refers to as " ink sniffers " - will be the last group to make the switch .
but he believes a new generation of people who grew up using ipods will see things differently .
" the only question they are going to have is , ' how many functions will this device combine for me ? " ' he said .
people have been predicting the demise of the bookstore for a long time now , and many now think e-books and e-readers could deliver the coup de grace .
twenty-five percent of respondents to the book fair study thought bookstores would largely disappear within half a century , with online distribution of paper books by firms such as amazon taking over .
copyright quandary some european bookstores seem to be trying to get ahead of the curve by being the first to promote e-books .
top german chain bookstore thalia struck a deal with sony to sell content for its reader devices in thalia stores and online .
assuming e-books do take hold , there are still many questions to be answered .
which reader - amazon 's , sony 's , or perhaps one from a european competitor , like the netherlands ' iliad - will capture the public 's fancy ?
each one has slightly different technical specifications , and is based on different technical platforms .
another big question is how the industry will deal with copyright protection .
some employ digital rights management -lrb- drm , -rrb- a kind of software lock on downloadable books , with the aim of avoiding the music industry 's fate .
since the advent of digital music , record companies have famously seen profits decimated by piracy and illegal downloading .
boumans opposes technological protection on content .
he supports the concept of a " social drm , " which would operate under a " name and shame " system : when a person buys electronic data , his or her name is attached to the file so anyone can see how it is passed around after that .
social pressure would correct the market .
' the ipod principle ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazon 's kindle is a big seller in the us ultimately , boumans says four things need to be in place before e-books really take off : a device , a portfolio of downloadable material , the download service - and the right price for content .
" that 's when you get what i call the ipod principle , " he said .
" people start downloading things and they are willing to pay for it . "
clearly it is difficult to imagine exactly what shape the digital-literature future will take .
according to buchreport editor wilking , the future may be even more unrecognizable than we can imagine .
for one thing , books may cease to be a collection of words on paper - or even e-paper .
" there are a lot of possibilities when it comes to e-publishing , " wilking said .
" people will be able to build in films and interactive elements .
things we ca n't even imagine yet . "
once these technical possibilities are there , he says , then the authors might start taking them into consideration , and writing for multimedia instead of just the page . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a new generation of digital " e-readers " has the german publishing industry gearing up for a fast-moving digital future . electronic books were announced as the " next big thing " a decade ago .
but the technology that came out at the time failed to impress consumers , and made few inroads into the market .
now some new e-readers , predicted to be put on the market in europe in the near future , have publishing industry insiders preparing for major changes .
lightweight devices like amazon 's kindle and the sony reader have been the focus of intense interest since they celebrated their german coming-out party at the frankfurt book fair , which runs through oct .
19 .
e-books - stars of the frankfurt fair the press toasted the new readers as the " true stars " of this year 's fair .
but considering the changes they could represent for the staid publishing industry , players are eyeing them with a mixture of fascination and fear .
" overall , i think german publishers are very enthusiastic about e-books , " said thomas wilking , editor in chief of the german publishing trade magazine buchreport .
" they are just waiting for a device they think is attractive enough for a wide public . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sony is hoping its reader will impress europeans book fair organizers took an unscientific survey of 1,000 industry players on the future of the new technology , and published it just before the fair opened .
unfortunately , the data failed to paint any clear road map for the future .
more than 70 percent of respondents said they were ready for the digital challenge - but 60 percent of them had neither used e-readers nor downloaded e-books themselves .
meanwhile , a full 40 percent said they expect e-content to dominate the market by 2018 - compared with one-third of respondents who said e-books will never take over .
12 percent thought the new e-readers would be a short-lived flash in the pan .
' you could take 50 books to the beach ' jak boumans , a dutch media-content consultant who runs his own firm , electronic media reporting , is convinced e-books are here to stay .
but he estimates it will be at least 2030 before they are in wide usage , considering how many details still need to be ironed out , and how ingrained peoples ' attitudes are towards reading .
" this has been a topic for the last 30 years , but the mentality is still trying to catch up with the technology , " boumans said .
" e-readers mean people could go on holiday without packing a stack of heavy books - they can take 50 books with them in one device and still read it on the beach . "
observers praise the kindle and reader as being significantly improved from the last devices that tried to storm the market but failed .
the new devices have extended their battery life and traded the backlit computer screen for a paper-simulating " e-paper " that is less hard on the eyes .
the ritual of turning pages some book lovers wonder if an electronic device will ever really replace paper books , however .
johann schumandl , owner of a small independent book store in cologne , said he thinks people might accept e-readers for reading work documents .
but printed books will never disappear completely : " when you read a book you have the sense of touch , the haptic value , " he said .
" there is something ritualistic about reading a book , turning the pages . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : which e-reader will capture the market ?
boumans agrees that casual readers - who he refers to as " ink sniffers " - will be the last group to make the switch .
but he believes a new generation of people who grew up using ipods will see things differently .
" the only question they are going to have is , ' how many functions will this device combine for me ? " ' he said .
people have been predicting the demise of the bookstore for a long time now , and many now think e-books and e-readers could deliver the coup de grace .
twenty-five percent of respondents to the book fair study thought bookstores would largely disappear within half a century , with online distribution of paper books by firms such as amazon taking over .
copyright quandary some european bookstores seem to be trying to get ahead of the curve by being the first to promote e-books .
top german chain bookstore thalia struck a deal with sony to sell content for its reader devices in thalia stores and online .
assuming e-books do take hold , there are still many questions to be answered .
which reader - amazon 's , sony 's , or perhaps one from a european competitor , like the netherlands ' iliad - will capture the public 's fancy ?
each one has slightly different technical specifications , and is based on different technical platforms .
another big question is how the industry will deal with copyright protection .
some employ digital rights management -lrb- drm , -rrb- a kind of software lock on downloadable books , with the aim of avoiding the music industry 's fate .
since the advent of digital music , record companies have famously seen profits decimated by piracy and illegal downloading .
boumans opposes technological protection on content .
he supports the concept of a " social drm , " which would operate under a " name and shame " system : when a person buys electronic data , his or her name is attached to the file so anyone can see how it is passed around after that .
social pressure would correct the market .
' the ipod principle ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazon 's kindle is a big seller in the us ultimately , boumans says four things need to be in place before e-books really take off : a device , a portfolio of downloadable material , the download service - and the right price for content .
" that 's when you get what i call the ipod principle , " he said .
" people start downloading things and they are willing to pay for it . "
clearly it is difficult to imagine exactly what shape the digital-literature future will take .
according to buchreport editor wilking , the future may be even more unrecognizable than we can imagine .
for one thing , books may cease to be a collection of words on paper - or even e-paper .
" there are a lot of possibilities when it comes to e-publishing , " wilking said .
" people will be able to build in films and interactive elements .
things we ca n't even imagine yet . "
once these technical possibilities are there , he says , then the authors might start taking them into consideration , and writing for multimedia instead of just the page . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : which e-reader will capture the market ?
boumans agrees that casual readers - who he refers to as " ink sniffers " - will be the last group to make the switch .
but he believes a new generation of people who grew up using ipods will see things differently .
" the only question they are going to have is , ' how many functions will this device combine for me ? " ' he said .
people have been predicting the demise of the bookstore for a long time now , and many now think e-books and e-readers could deliver the coup de grace .
twenty-five percent of respondents to the book fair study thought bookstores would largely disappear within half a century , with online distribution of paper books by firms such as amazon taking over .
copyright quandary some european bookstores seem to be trying to get ahead of the curve by being the first to promote e-books .
top german chain bookstore thalia struck a deal with sony to sell content for its reader devices in thalia stores and online .
assuming e-books do take hold , there are still many questions to be answered .
which reader - amazon 's , sony 's , or perhaps one from a european competitor , like the netherlands ' iliad - will capture the public 's fancy ?
each one has slightly different technical specifications , and is based on different technical platforms .
another big question is how the industry will deal with copyright protection .
some employ digital rights management -lrb- drm , -rrb- a kind of software lock on downloadable books , with the aim of avoiding the music industry 's fate .
since the advent of digital music , record companies have famously seen profits decimated by piracy and illegal downloading .
boumans opposes technological protection on content .
he supports the concept of a " social drm , " which would operate under a " name and shame " system : when a person buys electronic data , his or her name is attached to the file so anyone can see how it is passed around after that .
social pressure would correct the market .
' the ipod principle ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazon 's kindle is a big seller in the us ultimately , boumans says four things need to be in place before e-books really take off : a device , a portfolio of downloadable material , the download service - and the right price for content .
" that 's when you get what i call the ipod principle , " he said .
" people start downloading things and they are willing to pay for it . "
clearly it is difficult to imagine exactly what shape the digital-literature future will take .
according to buchreport editor wilking , the future may be even more unrecognizable than we can imagine .
for one thing , books may cease to be a collection of words on paper - or even e-paper .
" there are a lot of possibilities when it comes to e-publishing , " wilking said .
" people will be able to build in films and interactive elements .
things we ca n't even imagine yet . "
once these technical possibilities are there , he says , then the authors might start taking them into consideration , and writing for multimedia instead of just the page . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

will books as we know them soon be a thing of the past ?
a new generation of digital " e-readers " has the german publishing industry gearing up for a fast-moving digital future . electronic books were announced as the " next big thing " a decade ago .
but the technology that came out at the time failed to impress consumers , and made few inroads into the market .
now some new e-readers , predicted to be put on the market in europe in the near future , have publishing industry insiders preparing for major changes .
lightweight devices like amazon 's kindle and the sony reader have been the focus of intense interest since they celebrated their german coming-out party at the frankfurt book fair , which runs through oct .
19 .
e-books - stars of the frankfurt fair the press toasted the new readers as the " true stars " of this year 's fair .
but considering the changes they could represent for the staid publishing industry , players are eyeing them with a mixture of fascination and fear .
" overall , i think german publishers are very enthusiastic about e-books , " said thomas wilking , editor in chief of the german publishing trade magazine buchreport .
" they are just waiting for a device they think is attractive enough for a wide public . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sony is hoping its reader will impress europeans book fair organizers took an unscientific survey of 1,000 industry players on the future of the new technology , and published it just before the fair opened .
unfortunately , the data failed to paint any clear road map for the future .
more than 70 percent of respondents said they were ready for the digital challenge - but 60 percent of them had neither used e-readers nor downloaded e-books themselves .
meanwhile , a full 40 percent said they expect e-content to dominate the market by 2018 - compared with one-third of respondents who said e-books will never take over .
12 percent thought the new e-readers would be a short-lived flash in the pan .
' you could take 50 books to the beach ' jak boumans , a dutch media-content consultant who runs his own firm , electronic media reporting , is convinced e-books are here to stay .
but he estimates it will be at least 2030 before they are in wide usage , considering how many details still need to be ironed out , and how ingrained peoples ' attitudes are towards reading .
" this has been a topic for the last 30 years , but the mentality is still trying to catch up with the technology , " boumans said .
" e-readers mean people could go on holiday without packing a stack of heavy books - they can take 50 books with them in one device and still read it on the beach . "
observers praise the kindle and reader as being significantly improved from the last devices that tried to storm the market but failed .
the new devices have extended their battery life and traded the backlit computer screen for a paper-simulating " e-paper " that is less hard on the eyes .
the ritual of turning pages some book lovers wonder if an electronic device will ever really replace paper books , however .
johann schumandl , owner of a small independent book store in cologne , said he thinks people might accept e-readers for reading work documents .
but printed books will never disappear completely : " when you read a book you have the sense of touch , the haptic value , " he said .
" there is something ritualistic about reading a book , turning the pages . "

as world poverty day draws attention to the issue , dw 's dennis stute speaks with activist vandana shiva about india 's huge hunger levels . dr. vandana shiva is a physicist , ecologist , activist and author .
in india she has established navdanya , a movement for biodiversity conservation and farmers ' rights .
she also directs the research foundation for science , technology and natural resource policy .
the un has declared oct .
17 as the international day for the eradication of poverty . dw-world.de : how has the food crisis affected india ?
vandana shiva : very severely .
prices of staples have literally doubled in the last year and that has meant that the poor who were already only eating half of what they should be eating are now eating a quarter of what they should be .
unfortunately , it is the poor who must make a living by working physically and what we 're basically doing is robbing them of their ability to earn a living .
in addition , when children do n't get enough food to eat or when a mother is malnourished and she gives birth to a low birth-weight child , we are creating generations of people deprived of full mental health and full physical health .
according to a new report , there are " alarming " levels of hunger in 12 indian states and " serious " levels in the remaining five .
what , in your view , is the reason for the widespread malnutrition ?
there are two very big reasons why india has emerged as the capital of hunger .
the first is the “ green revolution ” model of agriculture , which was actually a hunger-creating model proposed as a hunger solution .
but when you destroy food sources in pulses , in vegetables , in grains , in oil seeds and create monocultures of rice and wheat , you destroy the millets - the nutritious grains that have 40 times higher level of nutrition - and call them inferior grains and push them to extinction .
on the ground , you have less food per unit acre and you have less nutrition access per capita .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gmo crops require more water and provide less nutritional value , says shiva the second is related to the new thrust of the 1991 policies of trade liberalization which instead of focusing on food for people focused on exports of luxury cash crops to rich countries , destroying india 's food security base .
this was trade-driven and really put food on the back burner then , treated as something you do n't need policy for .
the food situation is particularly bad in the state of madhya pradesh .
why is this state doing even worse than the others ?
the two reasons madhya pradesh is more severely affected than others is that it 's a large forest state and it 's largely a tribal state .
the food security of the tribals came from abundant forest products including edible products from the forest 's produce .
mining and industrialization is so rampant that tribals are losing their food resources .
it 's also the state where the drought impact because of climate change has been felt very severely .
bundelkhan has had a drought and rainfall failure for four years - there has been no cultivation at all .
and that 's partly because the agricultural model is based on new seeds like hybrid seeds which need chemicals .
but that 's the stupidest thing you could do because climate change requires adaption to drought which means planting crops that are resilient to drought - the millets that use only 250 millimeters of rain .
but unfortunately the government , driven by international agencies like the world bank , has walked on the wrong road for a period of market volatility and climate uncertainty .
the combination is a recipe for hunger and famine .
we need to shift our focus from global markets and global trades to local food security and away from export crops to growing food and nutrition for our people .
in the past ten years , more than 140,000 farmers in india have committed suicide according to official figures .
why is their situation so desperate ?
the first suicide came in 1997 .
when the impact of the new policies of liberalizing the seed sector started to get felt and corporations like monsanto , who wanted to sell genetically modified seed , entered the market .
they started to sell non renewable hybrid seeds which meant the farmers had to spent huge amounts of money buying seed every year .
these seeds also needed irrigation and were vulnerable to pests to the farmers had to spend more money putting in irrigation systems and buying pesticides .
that meant a higher debt burden on farmers .
falling prices of the products and rising costs of production squeezed the farmers even further into debt .
and that is what has led to the spate of suicides .
how can you tackle the problem of hunger ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting food into the hands of the poor is difficult due to heavy subsidies i think the most urgent steps to be taken to tackle the problem are to actually develop the farming systems to produce more food per unit acre .
every assumption of industrial agriculture is wrong because it does not produce more food but uses more chemicals and more water per unit acre .
it produces more commodities for international trade per unit acre but it does not produce more food or more nutrition per unit acre .
models of farming that can increase food-production fivefold , ten fold , depending on your climatic conditions have evolved through the organic movement .
those models of biodiverse , ecological systems can solve the problem of hunger .
the second thing that needs to be done is to bring back food-first policies .
in india after independence we have not had hunger on the scale we are now witnessing .
we had a famine in 1942 which killed two million people .
we had enough food in the country but the british were extracting every bit of rice from bengal and exporting it for profit - exporting it to finance the war .
we drove that famine away through public policy that put food first through a universal public distribution system that meant everyone has a right to affordable food .
that was dismantled by the world bank and it has to be resurrected .
the poor must have food at affordable price instead of subsidizing global corporations .
what the government has to do is to buy , preferably organics , from the indian farmers and then subsidize the prices for the poor .
we would save our financial budgets , we would save our taxes and we would have more food at lower prices .
india this year is spending one trillion rupees in subsidies for global corporations to buy chemical fertilizers .
that 's the wrong way to go .
we can lower costs of production , increase output per acre , increase equity and distribution .
that is food sovereignty .
that is food security .
that is food first . dennis stute -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as world poverty day draws attention to the issue , dw 's dennis stute speaks with activist vandana shiva about india 's huge hunger levels . dr. vandana shiva is a physicist , ecologist , activist and author .
in india she has established navdanya , a movement for biodiversity conservation and farmers ' rights .
she also directs the research foundation for science , technology and natural resource policy .
the un has declared oct .
17 as the international day for the eradication of poverty . dw-world.de : how has the food crisis affected india ?
vandana shiva : very severely .
prices of staples have literally doubled in the last year and that has meant that the poor who were already only eating half of what they should be eating are now eating a quarter of what they should be .
unfortunately , it is the poor who must make a living by working physically and what we 're basically doing is robbing them of their ability to earn a living .
in addition , when children do n't get enough food to eat or when a mother is malnourished and she gives birth to a low birth-weight child , we are creating generations of people deprived of full mental health and full physical health .
according to a new report , there are " alarming " levels of hunger in 12 indian states and " serious " levels in the remaining five .
what , in your view , is the reason for the widespread malnutrition ?
there are two very big reasons why india has emerged as the capital of hunger .
the first is the “ green revolution ” model of agriculture , which was actually a hunger-creating model proposed as a hunger solution .
but when you destroy food sources in pulses , in vegetables , in grains , in oil seeds and create monocultures of rice and wheat , you destroy the millets - the nutritious grains that have 40 times higher level of nutrition - and call them inferior grains and push them to extinction .
on the ground , you have less food per unit acre and you have less nutrition access per capita .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gmo crops require more water and provide less nutritional value , says shiva the second is related to the new thrust of the 1991 policies of trade liberalization which instead of focusing on food for people focused on exports of luxury cash crops to rich countries , destroying india 's food security base .
this was trade-driven and really put food on the back burner then , treated as something you do n't need policy for .
the food situation is particularly bad in the state of madhya pradesh .
why is this state doing even worse than the others ?
the two reasons madhya pradesh is more severely affected than others is that it 's a large forest state and it 's largely a tribal state .
the food security of the tribals came from abundant forest products including edible products from the forest 's produce .
mining and industrialization is so rampant that tribals are losing their food resources .
it 's also the state where the drought impact because of climate change has been felt very severely .
bundelkhan has had a drought and rainfall failure for four years - there has been no cultivation at all .
and that 's partly because the agricultural model is based on new seeds like hybrid seeds which need chemicals .
but that 's the stupidest thing you could do because climate change requires adaption to drought which means planting crops that are resilient to drought - the millets that use only 250 millimeters of rain .
but unfortunately the government , driven by international agencies like the world bank , has walked on the wrong road for a period of market volatility and climate uncertainty .
the combination is a recipe for hunger and famine .
we need to shift our focus from global markets and global trades to local food security and away from export crops to growing food and nutrition for our people .
in the past ten years , more than 140,000 farmers in india have committed suicide according to official figures .
why is their situation so desperate ?
the first suicide came in 1997 .
when the impact of the new policies of liberalizing the seed sector started to get felt and corporations like monsanto , who wanted to sell genetically modified seed , entered the market .
they started to sell non renewable hybrid seeds which meant the farmers had to spent huge amounts of money buying seed every year .
these seeds also needed irrigation and were vulnerable to pests to the farmers had to spend more money putting in irrigation systems and buying pesticides .
that meant a higher debt burden on farmers .
falling prices of the products and rising costs of production squeezed the farmers even further into debt .
and that is what has led to the spate of suicides .
how can you tackle the problem of hunger ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting food into the hands of the poor is difficult due to heavy subsidies i think the most urgent steps to be taken to tackle the problem are to actually develop the farming systems to produce more food per unit acre .
every assumption of industrial agriculture is wrong because it does not produce more food but uses more chemicals and more water per unit acre .
it produces more commodities for international trade per unit acre but it does not produce more food or more nutrition per unit acre .
models of farming that can increase food-production fivefold , ten fold , depending on your climatic conditions have evolved through the organic movement .
those models of biodiverse , ecological systems can solve the problem of hunger .
the second thing that needs to be done is to bring back food-first policies .
in india after independence we have not had hunger on the scale we are now witnessing .
we had a famine in 1942 which killed two million people .
we had enough food in the country but the british were extracting every bit of rice from bengal and exporting it for profit - exporting it to finance the war .
we drove that famine away through public policy that put food first through a universal public distribution system that meant everyone has a right to affordable food .
that was dismantled by the world bank and it has to be resurrected .
the poor must have food at affordable price instead of subsidizing global corporations .
what the government has to do is to buy , preferably organics , from the indian farmers and then subsidize the prices for the poor .
we would save our financial budgets , we would save our taxes and we would have more food at lower prices .
india this year is spending one trillion rupees in subsidies for global corporations to buy chemical fertilizers .
that 's the wrong way to go .
we can lower costs of production , increase output per acre , increase equity and distribution .
that is food sovereignty .
that is food security .
that is food first . dennis stute -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as world poverty day draws attention to the issue , dw 's dennis stute speaks with activist vandana shiva about india 's huge hunger levels . dr. vandana shiva is a physicist , ecologist , activist and author .
in india she has established navdanya , a movement for biodiversity conservation and farmers ' rights .
she also directs the research foundation for science , technology and natural resource policy .
the un has declared oct .
17 as the international day for the eradication of poverty . dw-world.de : how has the food crisis affected india ?
vandana shiva : very severely .
prices of staples have literally doubled in the last year and that has meant that the poor who were already only eating half of what they should be eating are now eating a quarter of what they should be .
unfortunately , it is the poor who must make a living by working physically and what we 're basically doing is robbing them of their ability to earn a living .
in addition , when children do n't get enough food to eat or when a mother is malnourished and she gives birth to a low birth-weight child , we are creating generations of people deprived of full mental health and full physical health .
according to a new report , there are " alarming " levels of hunger in 12 indian states and " serious " levels in the remaining five .
what , in your view , is the reason for the widespread malnutrition ?
there are two very big reasons why india has emerged as the capital of hunger .
the first is the “ green revolution ” model of agriculture , which was actually a hunger-creating model proposed as a hunger solution .
but when you destroy food sources in pulses , in vegetables , in grains , in oil seeds and create monocultures of rice and wheat , you destroy the millets - the nutritious grains that have 40 times higher level of nutrition - and call them inferior grains and push them to extinction .
on the ground , you have less food per unit acre and you have less nutrition access per capita .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gmo crops require more water and provide less nutritional value , says shiva the second is related to the new thrust of the 1991 policies of trade liberalization which instead of focusing on food for people focused on exports of luxury cash crops to rich countries , destroying india 's food security base .
this was trade-driven and really put food on the back burner then , treated as something you do n't need policy for .
the food situation is particularly bad in the state of madhya pradesh .
why is this state doing even worse than the others ?
the two reasons madhya pradesh is more severely affected than others is that it 's a large forest state and it 's largely a tribal state .
the food security of the tribals came from abundant forest products including edible products from the forest 's produce .
mining and industrialization is so rampant that tribals are losing their food resources .
it 's also the state where the drought impact because of climate change has been felt very severely .
bundelkhan has had a drought and rainfall failure for four years - there has been no cultivation at all .
and that 's partly because the agricultural model is based on new seeds like hybrid seeds which need chemicals .
but that 's the stupidest thing you could do because climate change requires adaption to drought which means planting crops that are resilient to drought - the millets that use only 250 millimeters of rain .
but unfortunately the government , driven by international agencies like the world bank , has walked on the wrong road for a period of market volatility and climate uncertainty .
the combination is a recipe for hunger and famine .
we need to shift our focus from global markets and global trades to local food security and away from export crops to growing food and nutrition for our people .
in the past ten years , more than 140,000 farmers in india have committed suicide according to official figures .
why is their situation so desperate ?
the first suicide came in 1997 .
when the impact of the new policies of liberalizing the seed sector started to get felt and corporations like monsanto , who wanted to sell genetically modified seed , entered the market .
they started to sell non renewable hybrid seeds which meant the farmers had to spent huge amounts of money buying seed every year .
these seeds also needed irrigation and were vulnerable to pests to the farmers had to spend more money putting in irrigation systems and buying pesticides .
that meant a higher debt burden on farmers .
falling prices of the products and rising costs of production squeezed the farmers even further into debt .
and that is what has led to the spate of suicides .
how can you tackle the problem of hunger ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting food into the hands of the poor is difficult due to heavy subsidies i think the most urgent steps to be taken to tackle the problem are to actually develop the farming systems to produce more food per unit acre .
every assumption of industrial agriculture is wrong because it does not produce more food but uses more chemicals and more water per unit acre .
it produces more commodities for international trade per unit acre but it does not produce more food or more nutrition per unit acre .
models of farming that can increase food-production fivefold , ten fold , depending on your climatic conditions have evolved through the organic movement .
those models of biodiverse , ecological systems can solve the problem of hunger .
the second thing that needs to be done is to bring back food-first policies .
in india after independence we have not had hunger on the scale we are now witnessing .
we had a famine in 1942 which killed two million people .
we had enough food in the country but the british were extracting every bit of rice from bengal and exporting it for profit - exporting it to finance the war .
we drove that famine away through public policy that put food first through a universal public distribution system that meant everyone has a right to affordable food .
that was dismantled by the world bank and it has to be resurrected .
the poor must have food at affordable price instead of subsidizing global corporations .
what the government has to do is to buy , preferably organics , from the indian farmers and then subsidize the prices for the poor .
we would save our financial budgets , we would save our taxes and we would have more food at lower prices .
india this year is spending one trillion rupees in subsidies for global corporations to buy chemical fertilizers .
that 's the wrong way to go .
we can lower costs of production , increase output per acre , increase equity and distribution .
that is food sovereignty .
that is food security .
that is food first . dennis stute -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the vote , 476 members supported chancellor angela merkel 's government and 99 were against . bolstering tottering banks the package aims to shore up confidence in banks following weeks of market turmoil .
it foresees up to 400 billion euros in lending guarantees for banks .
on top of that , up to 80 billion euros are to be made available to recapitalize banks and buy up risky assets if necessary while another 20 billion euros is to back up the guarantees . the sums are considered a maximum , and might not all be spent if the financial crisis eases . chancellor merkel unveiled the plan on monday this week as part of a concerted effort by governments around the world to stabilize markets and help troubled financial institutions limp through the crisis . the current efforts differ from the $ 700-billion takeover of bad assets by washington last month , since they aim to breathe life back into world banks paralyzed by the crisis that began as a crash in the us subprime mortgage market . a plan for citizens , not for bankers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos heard the concerns towards the plan and reacted german economics minister michael glos insisted that the government 's plan was aimed at protecting the nation 's citizens rather than the bankers .
there was no reason for pessimism about the outlook for the economy . " the opposite , " he said .
" we can solve the problems . " chancellor angela merkel has insisted the bailout would help avert further harm to europe 's biggest economy , which is expected to grind to a near-halt next year . in an unusual move to save time , the bill was then emailed back to german government offices , a few hundred meters away , for its final formalities , including a signature by the finance minister , the chancellor and president horst koehler . most of the euro zone nations and some allies have agreed to identical aid packages , each comprising a huge guarantee for interbank lending and semi-nationalizations of banks by state equity funds . germany has not identified which banks need rescuing , but the nine landesbank companies owned by the states are seen as the weakest units .
two of them , westlb and bayernlb , were hurt by investing in low-grade derivatives . news agency afp quoted a financial source saying germany 's biggest bank , deutsche bank , would not seek state aid .
" deutsche bank 's capital structure is very strong , as a result there is no need to seek state aid , " afp quoted the unnamed source as saying .
the bundestag agreed to the plan amid signs of an element of calm returning to european share markets friday after days of turbulence .
however , the german parliament 's backing for the plan is unlikely to save europe 's biggest economy from a sharp downturn as the financial crisis hits growth around the world . in the run-up to the plan 's passage through parliament , the german government slashed its 2009 economic growth forecast to a feeble 0.2 percent .
party meetings lead to unease and discontent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan is seen by some as a quick fix not long-term solution despite being approved by merkel 's cabinet on monday and by the country 's 16 states on thursday , the plan was still being fiercely debated on thursday evening during a round of party meetings .
the social democrats , who initially signaled their full support for the plan , called for a revision of the proposed bill before friday 's bundestag debate .
the spd insisted that a caveat must be added that makes it clear that responsibility for any losses to the state through the package must be taken by those german banks accepting aid .
the free market liberal opposition free democrats party -lrb- fdp -rrb- also decided after its previously unanimous support for the package that the handling of the current financial crisis needed stricter controls , calling for a more future-orientated plan which would bolster the german economy against further demands .
guido westerwelle , leader of the fdp , also warned the government not to give up its target to curb spending and balance the budget over the crisis .
both the green party and the left party emerged from their meetings with a more critical stance , saying that the level of parliamentary control over the package was insufficient .
both made it clear that the parliamentary " cooperation committee , " which would oversee the implementation of the package , had to guarantee " effective and thorough control of the federation for the banks " while government control of the plan had to be strengthened .
" it 's a 500-billion-euro blank cheque , " said green parliamentary chief renate kuenast . left party unanimously rejects plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oskar lafontaine : show me the money the opposition left party unanimously rejected the rescue package at its meeting .
the left party 's parliamentary group accused the government of not recognizing the full extent of the recession threat facing germany and that , instead of a financial sticking plaster , the country needed a full reform of its economic program .
left party leader oskar lafontaine called for measures to boost domestic demand , adding that many germans found the cabinet 's multi-billion bank rescue package hard to fathom as they suffered the effects of a weakening economy .
" when we asked for more money for hartz iv -lrb- unemployment benefits -rrb- , the answer was ' there 's no money . '
when we asked for more money for pensioners , the answer was ' there 's no money , " ' lafontaine said .
" people are surprised that , all of a sudden , 500 billion euros are readily available to manage the crisis ... the people do n't understand that any more , " he said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the vote , 476 members supported chancellor angela merkel 's government and 99 were against . bolstering tottering banks the package aims to shore up confidence in banks following weeks of market turmoil .
it foresees up to 400 billion euros in lending guarantees for banks .
on top of that , up to 80 billion euros are to be made available to recapitalize banks and buy up risky assets if necessary while another 20 billion euros is to back up the guarantees . the sums are considered a maximum , and might not all be spent if the financial crisis eases . chancellor merkel unveiled the plan on monday this week as part of a concerted effort by governments around the world to stabilize markets and help troubled financial institutions limp through the crisis . the current efforts differ from the $ 700-billion takeover of bad assets by washington last month , since they aim to breathe life back into world banks paralyzed by the crisis that began as a crash in the us subprime mortgage market . a plan for citizens , not for bankers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos heard the concerns towards the plan and reacted german economics minister michael glos insisted that the government 's plan was aimed at protecting the nation 's citizens rather than the bankers .
there was no reason for pessimism about the outlook for the economy . " the opposite , " he said .
" we can solve the problems . " chancellor angela merkel has insisted the bailout would help avert further harm to europe 's biggest economy , which is expected to grind to a near-halt next year . in an unusual move to save time , the bill was then emailed back to german government offices , a few hundred meters away , for its final formalities , including a signature by the finance minister , the chancellor and president horst koehler . most of the euro zone nations and some allies have agreed to identical aid packages , each comprising a huge guarantee for interbank lending and semi-nationalizations of banks by state equity funds . germany has not identified which banks need rescuing , but the nine landesbank companies owned by the states are seen as the weakest units .
two of them , westlb and bayernlb , were hurt by investing in low-grade derivatives . news agency afp quoted a financial source saying germany 's biggest bank , deutsche bank , would not seek state aid .
" deutsche bank 's capital structure is very strong , as a result there is no need to seek state aid , " afp quoted the unnamed source as saying .
the bundestag agreed to the plan amid signs of an element of calm returning to european share markets friday after days of turbulence .
however , the german parliament 's backing for the plan is unlikely to save europe 's biggest economy from a sharp downturn as the financial crisis hits growth around the world . in the run-up to the plan 's passage through parliament , the german government slashed its 2009 economic growth forecast to a feeble 0.2 percent .
party meetings lead to unease and discontent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan is seen by some as a quick fix not long-term solution despite being approved by merkel 's cabinet on monday and by the country 's 16 states on thursday , the plan was still being fiercely debated on thursday evening during a round of party meetings .
the social democrats , who initially signaled their full support for the plan , called for a revision of the proposed bill before friday 's bundestag debate .
the spd insisted that a caveat must be added that makes it clear that responsibility for any losses to the state through the package must be taken by those german banks accepting aid .
the free market liberal opposition free democrats party -lrb- fdp -rrb- also decided after its previously unanimous support for the package that the handling of the current financial crisis needed stricter controls , calling for a more future-orientated plan which would bolster the german economy against further demands .
guido westerwelle , leader of the fdp , also warned the government not to give up its target to curb spending and balance the budget over the crisis .
both the green party and the left party emerged from their meetings with a more critical stance , saying that the level of parliamentary control over the package was insufficient .
both made it clear that the parliamentary " cooperation committee , " which would oversee the implementation of the package , had to guarantee " effective and thorough control of the federation for the banks " while government control of the plan had to be strengthened .
" it 's a 500-billion-euro blank cheque , " said green parliamentary chief renate kuenast . left party unanimously rejects plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oskar lafontaine : show me the money the opposition left party unanimously rejected the rescue package at its meeting .
the left party 's parliamentary group accused the government of not recognizing the full extent of the recession threat facing germany and that , instead of a financial sticking plaster , the country needed a full reform of its economic program .
left party leader oskar lafontaine called for measures to boost domestic demand , adding that many germans found the cabinet 's multi-billion bank rescue package hard to fathom as they suffered the effects of a weakening economy .
" when we asked for more money for hartz iv -lrb- unemployment benefits -rrb- , the answer was ' there 's no money . '
when we asked for more money for pensioners , the answer was ' there 's no money , " ' lafontaine said .

according to wowereit , the mosque symbolizes " religious and cultural tolerance " in berlin .

" it will play a role in boosting integration and promoting dialogue with politicians and other religious groups . "

in the vote , 476 members supported chancellor angela merkel 's government and 99 were against . bolstering tottering banks the package aims to shore up confidence in banks following weeks of market turmoil .
it foresees up to 400 billion euros in lending guarantees for banks .
on top of that , up to 80 billion euros are to be made available to recapitalize banks and buy up risky assets if necessary while another 20 billion euros is to back up the guarantees . the sums are considered a maximum , and might not all be spent if the financial crisis eases . chancellor merkel unveiled the plan on monday this week as part of a concerted effort by governments around the world to stabilize markets and help troubled financial institutions limp through the crisis . the current efforts differ from the $ 700-billion takeover of bad assets by washington last month , since they aim to breathe life back into world banks paralyzed by the crisis that began as a crash in the us subprime mortgage market . a plan for citizens , not for bankers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos heard the concerns towards the plan and reacted german economics minister michael glos insisted that the government 's plan was aimed at protecting the nation 's citizens rather than the bankers .
there was no reason for pessimism about the outlook for the economy . " the opposite , " he said .
" we can solve the problems . " chancellor angela merkel has insisted the bailout would help avert further harm to europe 's biggest economy , which is expected to grind to a near-halt next year . in an unusual move to save time , the bill was then emailed back to german government offices , a few hundred meters away , for its final formalities , including a signature by the finance minister , the chancellor and president horst koehler . most of the euro zone nations and some allies have agreed to identical aid packages , each comprising a huge guarantee for interbank lending and semi-nationalizations of banks by state equity funds . germany has not identified which banks need rescuing , but the nine landesbank companies owned by the states are seen as the weakest units .
two of them , westlb and bayernlb , were hurt by investing in low-grade derivatives . news agency afp quoted a financial source saying germany 's biggest bank , deutsche bank , would not seek state aid .
" deutsche bank 's capital structure is very strong , as a result there is no need to seek state aid , " afp quoted the unnamed source as saying .
the bundestag agreed to the plan amid signs of an element of calm returning to european share markets friday after days of turbulence .
however , the german parliament 's backing for the plan is unlikely to save europe 's biggest economy from a sharp downturn as the financial crisis hits growth around the world . in the run-up to the plan 's passage through parliament , the german government slashed its 2009 economic growth forecast to a feeble 0.2 percent .
party meetings lead to unease and discontent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan is seen by some as a quick fix not long-term solution despite being approved by merkel 's cabinet on monday and by the country 's 16 states on thursday , the plan was still being fiercely debated on thursday evening during a round of party meetings .
the social democrats , who initially signaled their full support for the plan , called for a revision of the proposed bill before friday 's bundestag debate .
the spd insisted that a caveat must be added that makes it clear that responsibility for any losses to the state through the package must be taken by those german banks accepting aid .
the free market liberal opposition free democrats party -lrb- fdp -rrb- also decided after its previously unanimous support for the package that the handling of the current financial crisis needed stricter controls , calling for a more future-orientated plan which would bolster the german economy against further demands .
guido westerwelle , leader of the fdp , also warned the government not to give up its target to curb spending and balance the budget over the crisis .
both the green party and the left party emerged from their meetings with a more critical stance , saying that the level of parliamentary control over the package was insufficient .
both made it clear that the parliamentary " cooperation committee , " which would oversee the implementation of the package , had to guarantee " effective and thorough control of the federation for the banks " while government control of the plan had to be strengthened .
" it 's a 500-billion-euro blank cheque , " said green parliamentary chief renate kuenast . left party unanimously rejects plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oskar lafontaine : show me the money the opposition left party unanimously rejected the rescue package at its meeting .
the left party 's parliamentary group accused the government of not recognizing the full extent of the recession threat facing germany and that , instead of a financial sticking plaster , the country needed a full reform of its economic program .
left party leader oskar lafontaine called for measures to boost domestic demand , adding that many germans found the cabinet 's multi-billion bank rescue package hard to fathom as they suffered the effects of a weakening economy .
" when we asked for more money for hartz iv -lrb- unemployment benefits -rrb- , the answer was ' there 's no money . '
when we asked for more money for pensioners , the answer was ' there 's no money , " ' lafontaine said .

the university is considering taking the case to the highest court in germany . bremen university is considering taking its case against the prohibition of neurological research using primates to the federal constitutional court after the state 's senator for health rejected the institute for cognitive research 's application for a ten-year extension of its project on ethical grounds .
the university 's rector wilfried mueller told reporters on thursday , oct .
16 , that the refusal of social democrat ingelore rosenkoetter to extend the research program under neurobiologist andreas kreiter was " politically motivated interference into the fundamental right and liberty of science and research " and said that the situation could lead to emergency legal steps by the institute .
university argues against political interference bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists say the state has not made an informed decision mueller argued that the state authority did not have the right to evaluate the program on ethical grounds but only on its practical plausibility .
he also added that the decision was not based on the effect and purpose of the experiments in relation to the associated experiences of the animals and their rights .
kreiter 's experiments have been approved on a regular basis since 1997 despite protests whenever the program 's approval comes up for consideration .
the neurologist has also been threatened by animal rights activists , according to reports from the bremen police department .
the university is looking to obtain a provisional order from the constitutional court so that the research can continue in the meantime until a final decision is made .
the current mandate for the institute for cognitive research ends in november . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

just blocks away , some 300 people demonstrated against what they called the " islamisation of europe . " located in berlin 's pankow district , the 1.6 million-euro -lrb- $ 2.15-million -rrb- mosque has a 12-meter -lrb- 39-foot -rrb- high minaret and can hold 500 worshippers .
built for members of the ahmadiyya muslim community , the mosque was inaugurated on thursday , oct .
16 , with a celebration attended by approximately 300 people , including berlin mayor klaus wowereit .
according to wowereit , the mosque symbolizes " religious and cultural tolerance " in berlin .
his comments may have been overly optimistic , though , given that hundreds of protesting residents and the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- were gathered only blocks away from the site .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors said they were concerned about the abuse of religious freedom the demonstrators held banners with statements such as , " stop the islamisation of europe " and " stop the abuse of religious freedom . "
a petition against the construction of the mosque had also gathered some 20,000 signatures .
construction plagued by vandalism the ahmadiyya mosque has been a source of controversy since its building plans were announced in 2006 , with attacks on the site hindering its construction .
ijaz ahmad , spokesperson for the mosque , is hopeful however that the new two-story building will help bring clashing muslims and non-muslims in berlin closer together .
" the mosque will be a hub of social activity , not just for praying , " she said .
" it will play a role in boosting integration and promoting dialogue with politicians and other religious groups . "
a local citizens ' group does n't seem to see integration in the cards though .
" we have a big problem with sects that put religion above everything else , allow the beating of women and deny equal rights , " the group said on its web site .
muslims seek asylum in germany berlin is home to about 220,000 muslims , with only 200 belonging to the ahmadiyyah community .
ahmadiyyah 's muslim roots are a source of debate , however , as it is not recognized by some mainstream muslim groups on account of different beliefs .
according to the ahmadiyyah group , it has 30,000 members in germany , many of whom came to the country seeking asylum from religious persecution in pakistan and other islamic countries . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the university is considering taking the case to the highest court in germany . bremen university is considering taking its case against the prohibition of neurological research using primates to the federal constitutional court after the state 's senator for health rejected the institute for cognitive research 's application for a ten-year extension of its project on ethical grounds .
the university 's rector wilfried mueller told reporters on thursday , oct .
16 , that the refusal of social democrat ingelore rosenkoetter to extend the research program under neurobiologist andreas kreiter was " politically motivated interference into the fundamental right and liberty of science and research " and said that the situation could lead to emergency legal steps by the institute .
university argues against political interference bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists say the state has not made an informed decision mueller argued that the state authority did not have the right to evaluate the program on ethical grounds but only on its practical plausibility .
he also added that the decision was not based on the effect and purpose of the experiments in relation to the associated experiences of the animals and their rights .
kreiter 's experiments have been approved on a regular basis since 1997 despite protests whenever the program 's approval comes up for consideration .
the neurologist has also been threatened by animal rights activists , according to reports from the bremen police department .

" the bundesliga lives from its stability and continuity .
this has to be maintained to ensure that the competition remains fair , ” he added hanover 96 officials had earlier called on the dfl to change the ruling to allow them to attract foreign investors for their club .

" we do n't yet have 75 percent , so the recommendations of the league 's board of directors will pass , " he added .
additionally it was decided that the league cup would not be held in 2009 .

just blocks away , some 300 people demonstrated against what they called the " islamisation of europe . " located in berlin 's pankow district , the 1.6 million-euro -lrb- $ 2.15-million -rrb- mosque has a 12-meter -lrb- 39-foot -rrb- high minaret and can hold 500 worshippers .
built for members of the ahmadiyya muslim community , the mosque was inaugurated on thursday , oct .
16 , with a celebration attended by approximately 300 people , including berlin mayor klaus wowereit .
according to wowereit , the mosque symbolizes " religious and cultural tolerance " in berlin .
his comments may have been overly optimistic , though , given that hundreds of protesting residents and the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- were gathered only blocks away from the site .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors said they were concerned about the abuse of religious freedom the demonstrators held banners with statements such as , " stop the islamisation of europe " and " stop the abuse of religious freedom . "
a petition against the construction of the mosque had also gathered some 20,000 signatures .
construction plagued by vandalism the ahmadiyya mosque has been a source of controversy since its building plans were announced in 2006 , with attacks on the site hindering its construction .
ijaz ahmad , spokesperson for the mosque , is hopeful however that the new two-story building will help bring clashing muslims and non-muslims in berlin closer together .
" the mosque will be a hub of social activity , not just for praying , " she said .
" it will play a role in boosting integration and promoting dialogue with politicians and other religious groups . "
a local citizens ' group does n't seem to see integration in the cards though .
" we have a big problem with sects that put religion above everything else , allow the beating of women and deny equal rights , " the group said on its web site .
muslims seek asylum in germany berlin is home to about 220,000 muslims , with only 200 belonging to the ahmadiyyah community .
ahmadiyyah 's muslim roots are a source of debate , however , as it is not recognized by some mainstream muslim groups on account of different beliefs .
according to the ahmadiyyah group , it has 30,000 members in germany , many of whom came to the country seeking asylum from religious persecution in pakistan and other islamic countries . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the vote , 476 members supported chancellor angela merkel 's government and 99 were against . bolstering tottering banks the package aims to shore up confidence in banks following weeks of market turmoil .
it foresees up to 400 billion euros in lending guarantees for banks .
on top of that , up to 80 billion euros are to be made available to recapitalize banks and buy up risky assets if necessary while another 20 billion euros is to back up the guarantees . the sums are considered a maximum , and might not all be spent if the financial crisis eases . chancellor merkel unveiled the plan on monday this week as part of a concerted effort by governments around the world to stabilize markets and help troubled financial institutions limp through the crisis . the current efforts differ from the $ 700-billion takeover of bad assets by washington last month , since they aim to breathe life back into world banks paralyzed by the crisis that began as a crash in the us subprime mortgage market . a plan for citizens , not for bankers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos heard the concerns towards the plan and reacted german economics minister michael glos insisted that the government 's plan was aimed at protecting the nation 's citizens rather than the bankers .
there was no reason for pessimism about the outlook for the economy . " the opposite , " he said .
" we can solve the problems . " chancellor angela merkel has insisted the bailout would help avert further harm to europe 's biggest economy , which is expected to grind to a near-halt next year . in an unusual move to save time , the bill was then emailed back to german government offices , a few hundred meters away , for its final formalities , including a signature by the finance minister , the chancellor and president horst koehler . most of the euro zone nations and some allies have agreed to identical aid packages , each comprising a huge guarantee for interbank lending and semi-nationalizations of banks by state equity funds . germany has not identified which banks need rescuing , but the nine landesbank companies owned by the states are seen as the weakest units .
two of them , westlb and bayernlb , were hurt by investing in low-grade derivatives . news agency afp quoted a financial source saying germany 's biggest bank , deutsche bank , would not seek state aid .
" deutsche bank 's capital structure is very strong , as a result there is no need to seek state aid , " afp quoted the unnamed source as saying .
the bundestag agreed to the plan amid signs of an element of calm returning to european share markets friday after days of turbulence .
however , the german parliament 's backing for the plan is unlikely to save europe 's biggest economy from a sharp downturn as the financial crisis hits growth around the world . in the run-up to the plan 's passage through parliament , the german government slashed its 2009 economic growth forecast to a feeble 0.2 percent .
party meetings lead to unease and discontent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan is seen by some as a quick fix not long-term solution despite being approved by merkel 's cabinet on monday and by the country 's 16 states on thursday , the plan was still being fiercely debated on thursday evening during a round of party meetings .
the social democrats , who initially signaled their full support for the plan , called for a revision of the proposed bill before friday 's bundestag debate .
the spd insisted that a caveat must be added that makes it clear that responsibility for any losses to the state through the package must be taken by those german banks accepting aid .
the free market liberal opposition free democrats party -lrb- fdp -rrb- also decided after its previously unanimous support for the package that the handling of the current financial crisis needed stricter controls , calling for a more future-orientated plan which would bolster the german economy against further demands .
guido westerwelle , leader of the fdp , also warned the government not to give up its target to curb spending and balance the budget over the crisis .
both the green party and the left party emerged from their meetings with a more critical stance , saying that the level of parliamentary control over the package was insufficient .
both made it clear that the parliamentary " cooperation committee , " which would oversee the implementation of the package , had to guarantee " effective and thorough control of the federation for the banks " while government control of the plan had to be strengthened .
" it 's a 500-billion-euro blank cheque , " said green parliamentary chief renate kuenast . left party unanimously rejects plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oskar lafontaine : show me the money the opposition left party unanimously rejected the rescue package at its meeting .
the left party 's parliamentary group accused the government of not recognizing the full extent of the recession threat facing germany and that , instead of a financial sticking plaster , the country needed a full reform of its economic program .
left party leader oskar lafontaine called for measures to boost domestic demand , adding that many germans found the cabinet 's multi-billion bank rescue package hard to fathom as they suffered the effects of a weakening economy .
" when we asked for more money for hartz iv -lrb- unemployment benefits -rrb- , the answer was ' there 's no money . '
when we asked for more money for pensioners , the answer was ' there 's no money , " ' lafontaine said .
" people are surprised that , all of a sudden , 500 billion euros are readily available to manage the crisis ... the people do n't understand that any more , " he said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as world poverty day draws attention to the issue , dw 's dennis stute speaks with activist vandana shiva about india 's huge hunger levels . dr. vandana shiva is a physicist , ecologist , activist and author .
in india she has established navdanya , a movement for biodiversity conservation and farmers ' rights .
she also directs the research foundation for science , technology and natural resource policy .
the un has declared oct .
17 as the international day for the eradication of poverty . dw-world.de : how has the food crisis affected india ?
vandana shiva : very severely .
prices of staples have literally doubled in the last year and that has meant that the poor who were already only eating half of what they should be eating are now eating a quarter of what they should be .
unfortunately , it is the poor who must make a living by working physically and what we 're basically doing is robbing them of their ability to earn a living .
in addition , when children do n't get enough food to eat or when a mother is malnourished and she gives birth to a low birth-weight child , we are creating generations of people deprived of full mental health and full physical health .
according to a new report , there are " alarming " levels of hunger in 12 indian states and " serious " levels in the remaining five .
what , in your view , is the reason for the widespread malnutrition ?
there are two very big reasons why india has emerged as the capital of hunger .
the first is the “ green revolution ” model of agriculture , which was actually a hunger-creating model proposed as a hunger solution .
but when you destroy food sources in pulses , in vegetables , in grains , in oil seeds and create monocultures of rice and wheat , you destroy the millets - the nutritious grains that have 40 times higher level of nutrition - and call them inferior grains and push them to extinction .
on the ground , you have less food per unit acre and you have less nutrition access per capita .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gmo crops require more water and provide less nutritional value , says shiva the second is related to the new thrust of the 1991 policies of trade liberalization which instead of focusing on food for people focused on exports of luxury cash crops to rich countries , destroying india 's food security base .
this was trade-driven and really put food on the back burner then , treated as something you do n't need policy for .
the food situation is particularly bad in the state of madhya pradesh .
why is this state doing even worse than the others ?
the two reasons madhya pradesh is more severely affected than others is that it 's a large forest state and it 's largely a tribal state .
the food security of the tribals came from abundant forest products including edible products from the forest 's produce .
mining and industrialization is so rampant that tribals are losing their food resources .
it 's also the state where the drought impact because of climate change has been felt very severely .
bundelkhan has had a drought and rainfall failure for four years - there has been no cultivation at all .
and that 's partly because the agricultural model is based on new seeds like hybrid seeds which need chemicals .
but that 's the stupidest thing you could do because climate change requires adaption to drought which means planting crops that are resilient to drought - the millets that use only 250 millimeters of rain .
but unfortunately the government , driven by international agencies like the world bank , has walked on the wrong road for a period of market volatility and climate uncertainty .
the combination is a recipe for hunger and famine .
we need to shift our focus from global markets and global trades to local food security and away from export crops to growing food and nutrition for our people .
in the past ten years , more than 140,000 farmers in india have committed suicide according to official figures .
why is their situation so desperate ?
the first suicide came in 1997 .
when the impact of the new policies of liberalizing the seed sector started to get felt and corporations like monsanto , who wanted to sell genetically modified seed , entered the market .
they started to sell non renewable hybrid seeds which meant the farmers had to spent huge amounts of money buying seed every year .
these seeds also needed irrigation and were vulnerable to pests to the farmers had to spend more money putting in irrigation systems and buying pesticides .
that meant a higher debt burden on farmers .
falling prices of the products and rising costs of production squeezed the farmers even further into debt .
and that is what has led to the spate of suicides .
how can you tackle the problem of hunger ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting food into the hands of the poor is difficult due to heavy subsidies i think the most urgent steps to be taken to tackle the problem are to actually develop the farming systems to produce more food per unit acre .
every assumption of industrial agriculture is wrong because it does not produce more food but uses more chemicals and more water per unit acre .
it produces more commodities for international trade per unit acre but it does not produce more food or more nutrition per unit acre .
models of farming that can increase food-production fivefold , ten fold , depending on your climatic conditions have evolved through the organic movement .
those models of biodiverse , ecological systems can solve the problem of hunger .
the second thing that needs to be done is to bring back food-first policies .
in india after independence we have not had hunger on the scale we are now witnessing .
we had a famine in 1942 which killed two million people .
we had enough food in the country but the british were extracting every bit of rice from bengal and exporting it for profit - exporting it to finance the war .
we drove that famine away through public policy that put food first through a universal public distribution system that meant everyone has a right to affordable food .
that was dismantled by the world bank and it has to be resurrected .
the poor must have food at affordable price instead of subsidizing global corporations .
what the government has to do is to buy , preferably organics , from the indian farmers and then subsidize the prices for the poor .
we would save our financial budgets , we would save our taxes and we would have more food at lower prices .
india this year is spending one trillion rupees in subsidies for global corporations to buy chemical fertilizers .
that 's the wrong way to go .
we can lower costs of production , increase output per acre , increase equity and distribution .
that is food sovereignty .
that is food security .
that is food first . dennis stute -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

will books as we know them soon be a thing of the past ?
a new generation of digital " e-readers " has the german publishing industry gearing up for a fast-moving digital future . electronic books were announced as the " next big thing " a decade ago .
but the technology that came out at the time failed to impress consumers , and made few inroads into the market .
now some new e-readers , predicted to be put on the market in europe in the near future , have publishing industry insiders preparing for major changes .
lightweight devices like amazon 's kindle and the sony reader have been the focus of intense interest since they celebrated their german coming-out party at the frankfurt book fair , which runs through oct .
19 .
e-books - stars of the frankfurt fair the press toasted the new readers as the " true stars " of this year 's fair .
but considering the changes they could represent for the staid publishing industry , players are eyeing them with a mixture of fascination and fear .
" overall , i think german publishers are very enthusiastic about e-books , " said thomas wilking , editor in chief of the german publishing trade magazine buchreport .
" they are just waiting for a device they think is attractive enough for a wide public . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sony is hoping its reader will impress europeans book fair organizers took an unscientific survey of 1,000 industry players on the future of the new technology , and published it just before the fair opened .
unfortunately , the data failed to paint any clear road map for the future .
more than 70 percent of respondents said they were ready for the digital challenge - but 60 percent of them had neither used e-readers nor downloaded e-books themselves .
meanwhile , a full 40 percent said they expect e-content to dominate the market by 2018 - compared with one-third of respondents who said e-books will never take over .
12 percent thought the new e-readers would be a short-lived flash in the pan .
' you could take 50 books to the beach ' jak boumans , a dutch media-content consultant who runs his own firm , electronic media reporting , is convinced e-books are here to stay .
but he estimates it will be at least 2030 before they are in wide usage , considering how many details still need to be ironed out , and how ingrained peoples ' attitudes are towards reading .
" this has been a topic for the last 30 years , but the mentality is still trying to catch up with the technology , " boumans said .
" e-readers mean people could go on holiday without packing a stack of heavy books - they can take 50 books with them in one device and still read it on the beach . "
observers praise the kindle and reader as being significantly improved from the last devices that tried to storm the market but failed .
the new devices have extended their battery life and traded the backlit computer screen for a paper-simulating " e-paper " that is less hard on the eyes .
the ritual of turning pages some book lovers wonder if an electronic device will ever really replace paper books , however .
johann schumandl , owner of a small independent book store in cologne , said he thinks people might accept e-readers for reading work documents .
but printed books will never disappear completely : " when you read a book you have the sense of touch , the haptic value , " he said .
" there is something ritualistic about reading a book , turning the pages . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : which e-reader will capture the market ?
boumans agrees that casual readers - who he refers to as " ink sniffers " - will be the last group to make the switch .
but he believes a new generation of people who grew up using ipods will see things differently .
" the only question they are going to have is , ' how many functions will this device combine for me ? " ' he said .
people have been predicting the demise of the bookstore for a long time now , and many now think e-books and e-readers could deliver the coup de grace .
twenty-five percent of respondents to the book fair study thought bookstores would largely disappear within half a century , with online distribution of paper books by firms such as amazon taking over .
copyright quandary some european bookstores seem to be trying to get ahead of the curve by being the first to promote e-books .
top german chain bookstore thalia struck a deal with sony to sell content for its reader devices in thalia stores and online .
assuming e-books do take hold , there are still many questions to be answered .
which reader - amazon 's , sony 's , or perhaps one from a european competitor , like the netherlands ' iliad - will capture the public 's fancy ?
each one has slightly different technical specifications , and is based on different technical platforms .
another big question is how the industry will deal with copyright protection .
some employ digital rights management -lrb- drm , -rrb- a kind of software lock on downloadable books , with the aim of avoiding the music industry 's fate .
since the advent of digital music , record companies have famously seen profits decimated by piracy and illegal downloading .
boumans opposes technological protection on content .
he supports the concept of a " social drm , " which would operate under a " name and shame " system : when a person buys electronic data , his or her name is attached to the file so anyone can see how it is passed around after that .
social pressure would correct the market .
' the ipod principle ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazon 's kindle is a big seller in the us ultimately , boumans says four things need to be in place before e-books really take off : a device , a portfolio of downloadable material , the download service - and the right price for content .
" that 's when you get what i call the ipod principle , " he said .
" people start downloading things and they are willing to pay for it . "
clearly it is difficult to imagine exactly what shape the digital-literature future will take .
according to buchreport editor wilking , the future may be even more unrecognizable than we can imagine .
for one thing , books may cease to be a collection of words on paper - or even e-paper .
" there are a lot of possibilities when it comes to e-publishing , " wilking said .
" people will be able to build in films and interactive elements .
things we ca n't even imagine yet . "
once these technical possibilities are there , he says , then the authors might start taking them into consideration , and writing for multimedia instead of just the page . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

will books as we know them soon be a thing of the past ?
a new generation of digital " e-readers " has the german publishing industry gearing up for a fast-moving digital future . electronic books were announced as the " next big thing " a decade ago .
but the technology that came out at the time failed to impress consumers , and made few inroads into the market .
now some new e-readers , predicted to be put on the market in europe in the near future , have publishing industry insiders preparing for major changes .
lightweight devices like amazon 's kindle and the sony reader have been the focus of intense interest since they celebrated their german coming-out party at the frankfurt book fair , which runs through oct .
19 .
e-books - stars of the frankfurt fair the press toasted the new readers as the " true stars " of this year 's fair .
but considering the changes they could represent for the staid publishing industry , players are eyeing them with a mixture of fascination and fear .
" overall , i think german publishers are very enthusiastic about e-books , " said thomas wilking , editor in chief of the german publishing trade magazine buchreport .
" they are just waiting for a device they think is attractive enough for a wide public . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sony is hoping its reader will impress europeans book fair organizers took an unscientific survey of 1,000 industry players on the future of the new technology , and published it just before the fair opened .
unfortunately , the data failed to paint any clear road map for the future .
more than 70 percent of respondents said they were ready for the digital challenge - but 60 percent of them had neither used e-readers nor downloaded e-books themselves .
meanwhile , a full 40 percent said they expect e-content to dominate the market by 2018 - compared with one-third of respondents who said e-books will never take over .
12 percent thought the new e-readers would be a short-lived flash in the pan .
' you could take 50 books to the beach ' jak boumans , a dutch media-content consultant who runs his own firm , electronic media reporting , is convinced e-books are here to stay .
but he estimates it will be at least 2030 before they are in wide usage , considering how many details still need to be ironed out , and how ingrained peoples ' attitudes are towards reading .
" this has been a topic for the last 30 years , but the mentality is still trying to catch up with the technology , " boumans said .
" e-readers mean people could go on holiday without packing a stack of heavy books - they can take 50 books with them in one device and still read it on the beach . "
observers praise the kindle and reader as being significantly improved from the last devices that tried to storm the market but failed .
the new devices have extended their battery life and traded the backlit computer screen for a paper-simulating " e-paper " that is less hard on the eyes .
the ritual of turning pages some book lovers wonder if an electronic device will ever really replace paper books , however .
johann schumandl , owner of a small independent book store in cologne , said he thinks people might accept e-readers for reading work documents .
but printed books will never disappear completely : " when you read a book you have the sense of touch , the haptic value , " he said .
" there is something ritualistic about reading a book , turning the pages . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : which e-reader will capture the market ?
boumans agrees that casual readers - who he refers to as " ink sniffers " - will be the last group to make the switch .
but he believes a new generation of people who grew up using ipods will see things differently .
" the only question they are going to have is , ' how many functions will this device combine for me ? " ' he said .
people have been predicting the demise of the bookstore for a long time now , and many now think e-books and e-readers could deliver the coup de grace .
twenty-five percent of respondents to the book fair study thought bookstores would largely disappear within half a century , with online distribution of paper books by firms such as amazon taking over .
copyright quandary some european bookstores seem to be trying to get ahead of the curve by being the first to promote e-books .
top german chain bookstore thalia struck a deal with sony to sell content for its reader devices in thalia stores and online .
assuming e-books do take hold , there are still many questions to be answered .
which reader - amazon 's , sony 's , or perhaps one from a european competitor , like the netherlands ' iliad - will capture the public 's fancy ?
each one has slightly different technical specifications , and is based on different technical platforms .
another big question is how the industry will deal with copyright protection .
some employ digital rights management -lrb- drm , -rrb- a kind of software lock on downloadable books , with the aim of avoiding the music industry 's fate .

will books as we know them soon be a thing of the past ?
a new generation of digital " e-readers " has the german publishing industry gearing up for a fast-moving digital future . electronic books were announced as the " next big thing " a decade ago .
but the technology that came out at the time failed to impress consumers , and made few inroads into the market .
now some new e-readers , predicted to be put on the market in europe in the near future , have publishing industry insiders preparing for major changes .
lightweight devices like amazon 's kindle and the sony reader have been the focus of intense interest since they celebrated their german coming-out party at the frankfurt book fair , which runs through oct .
19 .
e-books - stars of the frankfurt fair the press toasted the new readers as the " true stars " of this year 's fair .
but considering the changes they could represent for the staid publishing industry , players are eyeing them with a mixture of fascination and fear .
" overall , i think german publishers are very enthusiastic about e-books , " said thomas wilking , editor in chief of the german publishing trade magazine buchreport .
" they are just waiting for a device they think is attractive enough for a wide public . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sony is hoping its reader will impress europeans book fair organizers took an unscientific survey of 1,000 industry players on the future of the new technology , and published it just before the fair opened .
unfortunately , the data failed to paint any clear road map for the future .
more than 70 percent of respondents said they were ready for the digital challenge - but 60 percent of them had neither used e-readers nor downloaded e-books themselves .
meanwhile , a full 40 percent said they expect e-content to dominate the market by 2018 - compared with one-third of respondents who said e-books will never take over .
12 percent thought the new e-readers would be a short-lived flash in the pan .
' you could take 50 books to the beach ' jak boumans , a dutch media-content consultant who runs his own firm , electronic media reporting , is convinced e-books are here to stay .
but he estimates it will be at least 2030 before they are in wide usage , considering how many details still need to be ironed out , and how ingrained peoples ' attitudes are towards reading .
" this has been a topic for the last 30 years , but the mentality is still trying to catch up with the technology , " boumans said .
" e-readers mean people could go on holiday without packing a stack of heavy books - they can take 50 books with them in one device and still read it on the beach . "
observers praise the kindle and reader as being significantly improved from the last devices that tried to storm the market but failed .
the new devices have extended their battery life and traded the backlit computer screen for a paper-simulating " e-paper " that is less hard on the eyes .
the ritual of turning pages some book lovers wonder if an electronic device will ever really replace paper books , however .
johann schumandl , owner of a small independent book store in cologne , said he thinks people might accept e-readers for reading work documents .
but printed books will never disappear completely : " when you read a book you have the sense of touch , the haptic value , " he said .
" there is something ritualistic about reading a book , turning the pages . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : which e-reader will capture the market ?
boumans agrees that casual readers - who he refers to as " ink sniffers " - will be the last group to make the switch .
but he believes a new generation of people who grew up using ipods will see things differently .
" the only question they are going to have is , ' how many functions will this device combine for me ? " ' he said .
people have been predicting the demise of the bookstore for a long time now , and many now think e-books and e-readers could deliver the coup de grace .
twenty-five percent of respondents to the book fair study thought bookstores would largely disappear within half a century , with online distribution of paper books by firms such as amazon taking over .
copyright quandary some european bookstores seem to be trying to get ahead of the curve by being the first to promote e-books .
top german chain bookstore thalia struck a deal with sony to sell content for its reader devices in thalia stores and online .
assuming e-books do take hold , there are still many questions to be answered .
which reader - amazon 's , sony 's , or perhaps one from a european competitor , like the netherlands ' iliad - will capture the public 's fancy ?
each one has slightly different technical specifications , and is based on different technical platforms .
another big question is how the industry will deal with copyright protection .
some employ digital rights management -lrb- drm , -rrb- a kind of software lock on downloadable books , with the aim of avoiding the music industry 's fate .
since the advent of digital music , record companies have famously seen profits decimated by piracy and illegal downloading .
boumans opposes technological protection on content .
he supports the concept of a " social drm , " which would operate under a " name and shame " system : when a person buys electronic data , his or her name is attached to the file so anyone can see how it is passed around after that .
social pressure would correct the market .
' the ipod principle ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazon 's kindle is a big seller in the us ultimately , boumans says four things need to be in place before e-books really take off : a device , a portfolio of downloadable material , the download service - and the right price for content .
" that 's when you get what i call the ipod principle , " he said .
" people start downloading things and they are willing to pay for it . "
clearly it is difficult to imagine exactly what shape the digital-literature future will take .
according to buchreport editor wilking , the future may be even more unrecognizable than we can imagine .
for one thing , books may cease to be a collection of words on paper - or even e-paper .
" there are a lot of possibilities when it comes to e-publishing , " wilking said .
" people will be able to build in films and interactive elements .
things we ca n't even imagine yet . "
once these technical possibilities are there , he says , then the authors might start taking them into consideration , and writing for multimedia instead of just the page . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the board of directors of the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- decided that the rule , which states that germans have to own the majority of shares in bundesliga clubs and have to have the majority of votes in clubs , should remain in place , the dfl announced thursday .
the proposal to keep the rule in place is to be put to the general dfl body .
to have it changed a two / thirds majority of the dfl membership , as well as of the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- would have to pass it .
at a press conference , dfl president reinhard rauball said that the decision was taken after a thorough discussion and consideration of the arguments put forward by hanover 96 .
" the bundesliga lives from its stability and continuity .
this has to be maintained to ensure that the competition remains fair , ” he added hanover 96 officials had earlier called on the dfl to change the ruling to allow them to attract foreign investors for their club .
martin kind , president of hanover 96 , said that more and more clubs are siding with the north german club .
" we do n't yet have 75 percent , so the recommendations of the league 's board of directors will pass , " he added .
additionally it was decided that the league cup would not be held in 2009 .
the cup , which is a pre-season playoff between the top five teams in the league , was not held this year .
the teams will have to forgo any extra proceeds that would have been earned through ticket sales to the cup ticket . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 17.10.2008 loss of natural capital costs more than bank crisis , says expert großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the financial crisis has left us unable to see the wood for the trees as the eu discusses the affordability of its carbon-reduction targets , economist pavan sukhdev told dw-world.de that the best things in life are free , but not for much longer .
the nature crunch could prove costly . once described as an " economist by profession and an ecologist at heart , " pavan sukhdev holds the chair of deutsche bank 's global market center and is director of the green accounting for indian states project , a study on the economic significance of biodiversity in india .
he also heads an ongoing global report funded by the german ministry for the environment and the european commission on " the economics of ecosystems & biodiversity " -lrb- teeb -rrb- , and is among the architects of the green new deal , spearheaded by the united nations environment program , which will be unveiled in london on oct .
22 .
dw-world.de : you said at the world conservation congress in barcelona last week that the economic burden of environmentally hostile practices like deforestation outweighs that of the bank crisis .
pavan sukhdev : the capital loss to financial firms in the city and wall street has been estimated as $ 1 trillion to $ 1.5 trillion .
in teeb 's first phase report which we presented in may , we looked at the extent of losses taking place as a result of deforestation and degradation .
we estimated the loss in human welfare as a capital item , and worked out that this was $ 2 to $ 4.5 trillion per year , every year , for the last several years .
and it will continue , if we carry on with business as usual .
why is it that a one-off loss of $ 1.5 trillion in financial capital to a group of wall street firms attracts so much attention , whereas the ongoing loss per annum of twice this amount of natural capital is barely reported ?
we 've seen governments bail out the economy - what would a " bailout " for the environment look like ?
it would be comparatively modest .
let me give you a few indicating benchmarks .
today we have something like 100,000 conservation areas , covering some 10-11 percent of the earth 's land surface .
the teeb team believes that we are spending some $ 40-50 billion too little on making that conservation effective .
according to various estimates , these conservation areas produce some $ 4-5 trillion of utility per year .
today , spending on protected areas globally is less than $ 20 billion , and all we 're suggesting is an increase of another $ 50 billion a year to ensure the continuation of the benefits of these protected areas .
we 're not talking about a massive amount of money - single institutions have lost more than that in the current financial chaos .
but for various reasons it doesn ’ t get allocated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pavan sukhdev what are these reasons ?
for one , the loss of natural capital is a loss of public wealth .
eco-system services are public benefits that are pretty much free .
it is not individuals ' or shareholders ' wealth at stake , although it is , if you like , global shareholders ' wealth .
but it 's not private ownership , it 's public ownership .
these are things that are there for all to enjoy : we would dearly miss their absence and we would pay the earth to get them back , but right now , they 're free .
so the public nature of these goods and services is one reason .
to understand the second reason why loss of natural capital does n't grab headlines , we need to think of the frog analogy used by al gore in his book " an inconvenient truth " : if you put a frog in a beaker of water and gradually raise the temperature , it wo n't notice any change .
similarly , what is happening to us is happening continuously .
every year we lose forest , the climate gets worse , poor people 's water supplies and field nutrients decline .
but we see these losses so gradually that we do n't realize that things are getting worse .
whereas in the case of the financial markets it 's one short , sharp shock .
nonetheless , a lot of smart money has started to flow into environmental investment .
in north america , the percentage of venture capital spent on clean technology used to be around 2 percent in 2002 , but had risen to 17 percent by 2007 .
is there a risk that environmental concerns will be abandoned given the current slowdown in the global economy ? i do n't think so , because people are beginning to get the message . i never have to explain myself twice any more .
even two years ago , people 's eyes would glaze over .
now people want to know what needs to be done .
of course , the cost of the financial crisis means there will now be increased distributional pressure on how much can be allocated to solving environmental problems .
but my point is that this money is not much , considering how much is spent on other sectors .
there 's no need to think about it too much .
the time is now .
how viable is a rescue plan like this during a recession , which is what we 're facing right now ?
a $ 45 billion gap per annum is not the end of the world .
look at how much has been lost and how much is being allocated individually by governments in the us and europe - up to $ 700 billion .
to put things in context , the investment per annum of the eu in conservation areas is about 6 billion euros .
these are modest sums .
so economic disaster does n't necessarily have to mean ecological disaster too ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the financial crisis is reported extensively - the environmental one is n't no .
venture capitalists have understood something that the world , generally , has not .
as other businesses begin using the technology into which venture capital has been invested , they will find amazing and sizeable opportunities .
i predict a tectonic shift in the way things are done .
renewable energy is an extraordinary opportunity if you use it not just to fix the supply that comes to you and me in berlin and london , but to fix the supply needed by the world 's 2 billion who do n't have an energy supply - the poorest people in the world who do not actually have energy coming to their homes in the form of oil , coal or electricity .
there are vast opportunities here , in countries like india and china , africa and latin america , to apply well-researched technologies which provide , for example , modular solutions to bring light into the poor home .
just imagine what kind of change you could see - education coming down to a village level , children staying up in order to read . think of the tectonic shift than can be achieved just by shifting focus and providing micro-finance to villagers to implement renewable energy solutions .
and look at the number of people who can benefit from that .
these are the sort of things that smart business is looking at .
there is money in making more efficient equipment and implementing more efficient processes .
does the credit crunch make people more aware that being careful with natural capital is important too ?
yes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 17.10.2008 loss of natural capital costs more than bank crisis , says expert großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the financial crisis has left us unable to see the wood for the trees as the eu discusses the affordability of its carbon-reduction targets , economist pavan sukhdev told dw-world.de that the best things in life are free , but not for much longer .
the nature crunch could prove costly . once described as an " economist by profession and an ecologist at heart , " pavan sukhdev holds the chair of deutsche bank 's global market center and is director of the green accounting for indian states project , a study on the economic significance of biodiversity in india .
he also heads an ongoing global report funded by the german ministry for the environment and the european commission on " the economics of ecosystems & biodiversity " -lrb- teeb -rrb- , and is among the architects of the green new deal , spearheaded by the united nations environment program , which will be unveiled in london on oct .
22 .
dw-world.de : you said at the world conservation congress in barcelona last week that the economic burden of environmentally hostile practices like deforestation outweighs that of the bank crisis .
pavan sukhdev : the capital loss to financial firms in the city and wall street has been estimated as $ 1 trillion to $ 1.5 trillion .
in teeb 's first phase report which we presented in may , we looked at the extent of losses taking place as a result of deforestation and degradation .
we estimated the loss in human welfare as a capital item , and worked out that this was $ 2 to $ 4.5 trillion per year , every year , for the last several years .
and it will continue , if we carry on with business as usual .
why is it that a one-off loss of $ 1.5 trillion in financial capital to a group of wall street firms attracts so much attention , whereas the ongoing loss per annum of twice this amount of natural capital is barely reported ?
we 've seen governments bail out the economy - what would a " bailout " for the environment look like ?
it would be comparatively modest .
let me give you a few indicating benchmarks .
today we have something like 100,000 conservation areas , covering some 10-11 percent of the earth 's land surface .
the teeb team believes that we are spending some $ 40-50 billion too little on making that conservation effective .
according to various estimates , these conservation areas produce some $ 4-5 trillion of utility per year .
today , spending on protected areas globally is less than $ 20 billion , and all we 're suggesting is an increase of another $ 50 billion a year to ensure the continuation of the benefits of these protected areas .
we 're not talking about a massive amount of money - single institutions have lost more than that in the current financial chaos .
but for various reasons it doesn ’ t get allocated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pavan sukhdev what are these reasons ?
for one , the loss of natural capital is a loss of public wealth .
eco-system services are public benefits that are pretty much free .
it is not individuals ' or shareholders ' wealth at stake , although it is , if you like , global shareholders ' wealth .
but it 's not private ownership , it 's public ownership .
these are things that are there for all to enjoy : we would dearly miss their absence and we would pay the earth to get them back , but right now , they 're free .
so the public nature of these goods and services is one reason .
to understand the second reason why loss of natural capital does n't grab headlines , we need to think of the frog analogy used by al gore in his book " an inconvenient truth " : if you put a frog in a beaker of water and gradually raise the temperature , it wo n't notice any change .
similarly , what is happening to us is happening continuously .
every year we lose forest , the climate gets worse , poor people 's water supplies and field nutrients decline .
but we see these losses so gradually that we do n't realize that things are getting worse .
whereas in the case of the financial markets it 's one short , sharp shock .
nonetheless , a lot of smart money has started to flow into environmental investment .
in north america , the percentage of venture capital spent on clean technology used to be around 2 percent in 2002 , but had risen to 17 percent by 2007 .
is there a risk that environmental concerns will be abandoned given the current slowdown in the global economy ? i do n't think so , because people are beginning to get the message . i never have to explain myself twice any more .
even two years ago , people 's eyes would glaze over .
now people want to know what needs to be done .
of course , the cost of the financial crisis means there will now be increased distributional pressure on how much can be allocated to solving environmental problems .
but my point is that this money is not much , considering how much is spent on other sectors .
there 's no need to think about it too much .
the time is now .
how viable is a rescue plan like this during a recession , which is what we 're facing right now ?
a $ 45 billion gap per annum is not the end of the world .
look at how much has been lost and how much is being allocated individually by governments in the us and europe - up to $ 700 billion .
to put things in context , the investment per annum of the eu in conservation areas is about 6 billion euros .
these are modest sums .
so economic disaster does n't necessarily have to mean ecological disaster too ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the financial crisis is reported extensively - the environmental one is n't no .
venture capitalists have understood something that the world , generally , has not .
as other businesses begin using the technology into which venture capital has been invested , they will find amazing and sizeable opportunities .
i predict a tectonic shift in the way things are done .
renewable energy is an extraordinary opportunity if you use it not just to fix the supply that comes to you and me in berlin and london , but to fix the supply needed by the world 's 2 billion who do n't have an energy supply - the poorest people in the world who do not actually have energy coming to their homes in the form of oil , coal or electricity .
there are vast opportunities here , in countries like india and china , africa and latin america , to apply well-researched technologies which provide , for example , modular solutions to bring light into the poor home .
just imagine what kind of change you could see - education coming down to a village level , children staying up in order to read . think of the tectonic shift than can be achieved just by shifting focus and providing micro-finance to villagers to implement renewable energy solutions .
and look at the number of people who can benefit from that .
these are the sort of things that smart business is looking at .
there is money in making more efficient equipment and implementing more efficient processes .
does the credit crunch make people more aware that being careful with natural capital is important too ?

the nature crunch could prove costly . once described as an " economist by profession and an ecologist at heart , " pavan sukhdev holds the chair of deutsche bank 's global market center and is director of the green accounting for indian states project , a study on the economic significance of biodiversity in india .
he also heads an ongoing global report funded by the german ministry for the environment and the european commission on " the economics of ecosystems & biodiversity " -lrb- teeb -rrb- , and is among the architects of the green new deal , spearheaded by the united nations environment program , which will be unveiled in london on oct .
22 .
dw-world.de : you said at the world conservation congress in barcelona last week that the economic burden of environmentally hostile practices like deforestation outweighs that of the bank crisis .
pavan sukhdev : the capital loss to financial firms in the city and wall street has been estimated as $ 1 trillion to $ 1.5 trillion .
in teeb 's first phase report which we presented in may , we looked at the extent of losses taking place as a result of deforestation and degradation .
we estimated the loss in human welfare as a capital item , and worked out that this was $ 2 to $ 4.5 trillion per year , every year , for the last several years .
and it will continue , if we carry on with business as usual .
why is it that a one-off loss of $ 1.5 trillion in financial capital to a group of wall street firms attracts so much attention , whereas the ongoing loss per annum of twice this amount of natural capital is barely reported ?
we 've seen governments bail out the economy - what would a " bailout " for the environment look like ?
it would be comparatively modest .
let me give you a few indicating benchmarks .
today we have something like 100,000 conservation areas , covering some 10-11 percent of the earth 's land surface .
the teeb team believes that we are spending some $ 40-50 billion too little on making that conservation effective .
according to various estimates , these conservation areas produce some $ 4-5 trillion of utility per year .
today , spending on protected areas globally is less than $ 20 billion , and all we 're suggesting is an increase of another $ 50 billion a year to ensure the continuation of the benefits of these protected areas .
we 're not talking about a massive amount of money - single institutions have lost more than that in the current financial chaos .
but for various reasons it doesn ’ t get allocated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pavan sukhdev what are these reasons ?
for one , the loss of natural capital is a loss of public wealth .
eco-system services are public benefits that are pretty much free .
it is not individuals ' or shareholders ' wealth at stake , although it is , if you like , global shareholders ' wealth .
but it 's not private ownership , it 's public ownership .
these are things that are there for all to enjoy : we would dearly miss their absence and we would pay the earth to get them back , but right now , they 're free .
so the public nature of these goods and services is one reason .
to understand the second reason why loss of natural capital does n't grab headlines , we need to think of the frog analogy used by al gore in his book " an inconvenient truth " : if you put a frog in a beaker of water and gradually raise the temperature , it wo n't notice any change .
similarly , what is happening to us is happening continuously .
every year we lose forest , the climate gets worse , poor people 's water supplies and field nutrients decline .
but we see these losses so gradually that we do n't realize that things are getting worse .
whereas in the case of the financial markets it 's one short , sharp shock .
nonetheless , a lot of smart money has started to flow into environmental investment .
in north america , the percentage of venture capital spent on clean technology used to be around 2 percent in 2002 , but had risen to 17 percent by 2007 .
is there a risk that environmental concerns will be abandoned given the current slowdown in the global economy ? i do n't think so , because people are beginning to get the message . i never have to explain myself twice any more .
even two years ago , people 's eyes would glaze over .
now people want to know what needs to be done .
of course , the cost of the financial crisis means there will now be increased distributional pressure on how much can be allocated to solving environmental problems .
but my point is that this money is not much , considering how much is spent on other sectors .
there 's no need to think about it too much .
the time is now .
how viable is a rescue plan like this during a recession , which is what we 're facing right now ?
a $ 45 billion gap per annum is not the end of the world .
look at how much has been lost and how much is being allocated individually by governments in the us and europe - up to $ 700 billion .
to put things in context , the investment per annum of the eu in conservation areas is about 6 billion euros .
these are modest sums .
so economic disaster does n't necessarily have to mean ecological disaster too ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the financial crisis is reported extensively - the environmental one is n't no .
venture capitalists have understood something that the world , generally , has not .
as other businesses begin using the technology into which venture capital has been invested , they will find amazing and sizeable opportunities .
i predict a tectonic shift in the way things are done .
renewable energy is an extraordinary opportunity if you use it not just to fix the supply that comes to you and me in berlin and london , but to fix the supply needed by the world 's 2 billion who do n't have an energy supply - the poorest people in the world who do not actually have energy coming to their homes in the form of oil , coal or electricity .
there are vast opportunities here , in countries like india and china , africa and latin america , to apply well-researched technologies which provide , for example , modular solutions to bring light into the poor home .
just imagine what kind of change you could see - education coming down to a village level , children staying up in order to read . think of the tectonic shift than can be achieved just by shifting focus and providing micro-finance to villagers to implement renewable energy solutions .
and look at the number of people who can benefit from that .
these are the sort of things that smart business is looking at .
there is money in making more efficient equipment and implementing more efficient processes .
does the credit crunch make people more aware that being careful with natural capital is important too ?
yes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 17.10.2008 german lawmakers pass bank rescue package großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a relieved chancellor merkel is flanked by ministers in parliament on friday german president koehler friday signed off on a 500-billion-euro bank bailout after it was passed earlier by the parliament in a fast-track vote to restore confidence in the crisis-ridden financial sector . in an unusually speedy move , german president horst koehler signed into law a massive 500-billion-euro financial rescue package on friday , hours after it was approved by both houses of parliament amid fierce debate . the law will take effect starting saturday , oct 19 , well in time before trading on financial markets opens on monday . the upper chamber of germany 's parliament approved the bank bail-out package announced four days earlier by chancellor angela merkel 's government . the unanimous vote in the bundesrat upper chamber followed a majority vote in the lower chamber or bundestag . the bundestag lower chamber passed the bill with only two small opposition parties , the left and the greens , opposed .
in the vote , 476 members supported chancellor angela merkel 's government and 99 were against . bolstering tottering banks the package aims to shore up confidence in banks following weeks of market turmoil .
it foresees up to 400 billion euros in lending guarantees for banks .
on top of that , up to 80 billion euros are to be made available to recapitalize banks and buy up risky assets if necessary while another 20 billion euros is to back up the guarantees . the sums are considered a maximum , and might not all be spent if the financial crisis eases . chancellor merkel unveiled the plan on monday this week as part of a concerted effort by governments around the world to stabilize markets and help troubled financial institutions limp through the crisis . the current efforts differ from the $ 700-billion takeover of bad assets by washington last month , since they aim to breathe life back into world banks paralyzed by the crisis that began as a crash in the us subprime mortgage market . a plan for citizens , not for bankers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos heard the concerns towards the plan and reacted german economics minister michael glos insisted that the government 's plan was aimed at protecting the nation 's citizens rather than the bankers .
there was no reason for pessimism about the outlook for the economy . " the opposite , " he said .
" we can solve the problems . " chancellor angela merkel has insisted the bailout would help avert further harm to europe 's biggest economy , which is expected to grind to a near-halt next year . in an unusual move to save time , the bill was then emailed back to german government offices , a few hundred meters away , for its final formalities , including a signature by the finance minister , the chancellor and president horst koehler . most of the euro zone nations and some allies have agreed to identical aid packages , each comprising a huge guarantee for interbank lending and semi-nationalizations of banks by state equity funds . germany has not identified which banks need rescuing , but the nine landesbank companies owned by the states are seen as the weakest units .
two of them , westlb and bayernlb , were hurt by investing in low-grade derivatives . news agency afp quoted a financial source saying germany 's biggest bank , deutsche bank , would not seek state aid .
" deutsche bank 's capital structure is very strong , as a result there is no need to seek state aid , " afp quoted the unnamed source as saying .
the bundestag agreed to the plan amid signs of an element of calm returning to european share markets friday after days of turbulence .
however , the german parliament 's backing for the plan is unlikely to save europe 's biggest economy from a sharp downturn as the financial crisis hits growth around the world . in the run-up to the plan 's passage through parliament , the german government slashed its 2009 economic growth forecast to a feeble 0.2 percent .
party meetings lead to unease and discontent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan is seen by some as a quick fix not long-term solution despite being approved by merkel 's cabinet on monday and by the country 's 16 states on thursday , the plan was still being fiercely debated on thursday evening during a round of party meetings .
the social democrats , who initially signaled their full support for the plan , called for a revision of the proposed bill before friday 's bundestag debate .
the spd insisted that a caveat must be added that makes it clear that responsibility for any losses to the state through the package must be taken by those german banks accepting aid .
the free market liberal opposition free democrats party -lrb- fdp -rrb- also decided after its previously unanimous support for the package that the handling of the current financial crisis needed stricter controls , calling for a more future-orientated plan which would bolster the german economy against further demands .
guido westerwelle , leader of the fdp , also warned the government not to give up its target to curb spending and balance the budget over the crisis .
both the green party and the left party emerged from their meetings with a more critical stance , saying that the level of parliamentary control over the package was insufficient .
both made it clear that the parliamentary " cooperation committee , " which would oversee the implementation of the package , had to guarantee " effective and thorough control of the federation for the banks " while government control of the plan had to be strengthened .
" it 's a 500-billion-euro blank cheque , " said green parliamentary chief renate kuenast . left party unanimously rejects plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oskar lafontaine : show me the money the opposition left party unanimously rejected the rescue package at its meeting .
the left party 's parliamentary group accused the government of not recognizing the full extent of the recession threat facing germany and that , instead of a financial sticking plaster , the country needed a full reform of its economic program .
left party leader oskar lafontaine called for measures to boost domestic demand , adding that many germans found the cabinet 's multi-billion bank rescue package hard to fathom as they suffered the effects of a weakening economy .
" when we asked for more money for hartz iv -lrb- unemployment benefits -rrb- , the answer was ' there 's no money . '
when we asked for more money for pensioners , the answer was ' there 's no money , " ' lafontaine said .
" people are surprised that , all of a sudden , 500 billion euros are readily available to manage the crisis ... the people do n't understand that any more , " he said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 17.10.2008 loss of natural capital costs more than bank crisis , says expert großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the financial crisis has left us unable to see the wood for the trees as the eu discusses the affordability of its carbon-reduction targets , economist pavan sukhdev told dw-world.de that the best things in life are free , but not for much longer .
the nature crunch could prove costly . once described as an " economist by profession and an ecologist at heart , " pavan sukhdev holds the chair of deutsche bank 's global market center and is director of the green accounting for indian states project , a study on the economic significance of biodiversity in india .
he also heads an ongoing global report funded by the german ministry for the environment and the european commission on " the economics of ecosystems & biodiversity " -lrb- teeb -rrb- , and is among the architects of the green new deal , spearheaded by the united nations environment program , which will be unveiled in london on oct .
22 .
dw-world.de : you said at the world conservation congress in barcelona last week that the economic burden of environmentally hostile practices like deforestation outweighs that of the bank crisis .
pavan sukhdev : the capital loss to financial firms in the city and wall street has been estimated as $ 1 trillion to $ 1.5 trillion .
in teeb 's first phase report which we presented in may , we looked at the extent of losses taking place as a result of deforestation and degradation .
we estimated the loss in human welfare as a capital item , and worked out that this was $ 2 to $ 4.5 trillion per year , every year , for the last several years .
and it will continue , if we carry on with business as usual .
why is it that a one-off loss of $ 1.5 trillion in financial capital to a group of wall street firms attracts so much attention , whereas the ongoing loss per annum of twice this amount of natural capital is barely reported ?
we 've seen governments bail out the economy - what would a " bailout " for the environment look like ?
it would be comparatively modest .
let me give you a few indicating benchmarks .
today we have something like 100,000 conservation areas , covering some 10-11 percent of the earth 's land surface .
the teeb team believes that we are spending some $ 40-50 billion too little on making that conservation effective .
according to various estimates , these conservation areas produce some $ 4-5 trillion of utility per year .
today , spending on protected areas globally is less than $ 20 billion , and all we 're suggesting is an increase of another $ 50 billion a year to ensure the continuation of the benefits of these protected areas .
we 're not talking about a massive amount of money - single institutions have lost more than that in the current financial chaos .
but for various reasons it doesn ’ t get allocated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pavan sukhdev what are these reasons ?
for one , the loss of natural capital is a loss of public wealth .
eco-system services are public benefits that are pretty much free .
it is not individuals ' or shareholders ' wealth at stake , although it is , if you like , global shareholders ' wealth .
but it 's not private ownership , it 's public ownership .
these are things that are there for all to enjoy : we would dearly miss their absence and we would pay the earth to get them back , but right now , they 're free .
so the public nature of these goods and services is one reason .
to understand the second reason why loss of natural capital does n't grab headlines , we need to think of the frog analogy used by al gore in his book " an inconvenient truth " : if you put a frog in a beaker of water and gradually raise the temperature , it wo n't notice any change .
similarly , what is happening to us is happening continuously .
every year we lose forest , the climate gets worse , poor people 's water supplies and field nutrients decline .
but we see these losses so gradually that we do n't realize that things are getting worse .
whereas in the case of the financial markets it 's one short , sharp shock .
nonetheless , a lot of smart money has started to flow into environmental investment .
in north america , the percentage of venture capital spent on clean technology used to be around 2 percent in 2002 , but had risen to 17 percent by 2007 .
is there a risk that environmental concerns will be abandoned given the current slowdown in the global economy ? i do n't think so , because people are beginning to get the message . i never have to explain myself twice any more .
even two years ago , people 's eyes would glaze over .
now people want to know what needs to be done .
of course , the cost of the financial crisis means there will now be increased distributional pressure on how much can be allocated to solving environmental problems .
but my point is that this money is not much , considering how much is spent on other sectors .
there 's no need to think about it too much .
the time is now .
how viable is a rescue plan like this during a recession , which is what we 're facing right now ?
a $ 45 billion gap per annum is not the end of the world .
look at how much has been lost and how much is being allocated individually by governments in the us and europe - up to $ 700 billion .
to put things in context , the investment per annum of the eu in conservation areas is about 6 billion euros .
these are modest sums .
so economic disaster does n't necessarily have to mean ecological disaster too ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the financial crisis is reported extensively - the environmental one is n't no .
venture capitalists have understood something that the world , generally , has not .
as other businesses begin using the technology into which venture capital has been invested , they will find amazing and sizeable opportunities .
i predict a tectonic shift in the way things are done .
renewable energy is an extraordinary opportunity if you use it not just to fix the supply that comes to you and me in berlin and london , but to fix the supply needed by the world 's 2 billion who do n't have an energy supply - the poorest people in the world who do not actually have energy coming to their homes in the form of oil , coal or electricity .
there are vast opportunities here , in countries like india and china , africa and latin america , to apply well-researched technologies which provide , for example , modular solutions to bring light into the poor home .
just imagine what kind of change you could see - education coming down to a village level , children staying up in order to read . think of the tectonic shift than can be achieved just by shifting focus and providing micro-finance to villagers to implement renewable energy solutions .
and look at the number of people who can benefit from that .
these are the sort of things that smart business is looking at .
there is money in making more efficient equipment and implementing more efficient processes .
does the credit crunch make people more aware that being careful with natural capital is important too ?
yes .
as the saying goes , a crisis is a terrible thing to waste . interview : jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the bundestag agreed to the plan amid signs of an element of calm returning to european share markets friday after days of turbulence .
however , the german parliament 's backing for the plan is unlikely to save europe 's biggest economy from a sharp downturn as the financial crisis hits growth around the world . in the run-up to the plan 's passage through parliament , the german government slashed its 2009 economic growth forecast to a feeble 0.2 percent .

the social democrats , who initially signaled their full support for the plan , called for a revision of the proposed bill before friday 's bundestag debate .
the spd insisted that a caveat must be added that makes it clear that responsibility for any losses to the state through the package must be taken by those german banks accepting aid .
the free market liberal opposition free democrats party -lrb- fdp -rrb- also decided after its previously unanimous support for the package that the handling of the current financial crisis needed stricter controls , calling for a more future-orientated plan which would bolster the german economy against further demands .
guido westerwelle , leader of the fdp , also warned the government not to give up its target to curb spending and balance the budget over the crisis .
both the green party and the left party emerged from their meetings with a more critical stance , saying that the level of parliamentary control over the package was insufficient .
both made it clear that the parliamentary " cooperation committee , " which would oversee the implementation of the package , had to guarantee " effective and thorough control of the federation for the banks " while government control of the plan had to be strengthened .

the board of directors of the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- decided that the rule , which states that germans have to own the majority of shares in bundesliga clubs and have to have the majority of votes in clubs , should remain in place , the dfl announced thursday .
the proposal to keep the rule in place is to be put to the general dfl body .
to have it changed a two / thirds majority of the dfl membership , as well as of the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- would have to pass it .
at a press conference , dfl president reinhard rauball said that the decision was taken after a thorough discussion and consideration of the arguments put forward by hanover 96 .
" the bundesliga lives from its stability and continuity .
this has to be maintained to ensure that the competition remains fair , ” he added hanover 96 officials had earlier called on the dfl to change the ruling to allow them to attract foreign investors for their club .
martin kind , president of hanover 96 , said that more and more clubs are siding with the north german club .
" we do n't yet have 75 percent , so the recommendations of the league 's board of directors will pass , " he added .
additionally it was decided that the league cup would not be held in 2009 .
the cup , which is a pre-season playoff between the top five teams in the league , was not held this year .
the teams will have to forgo any extra proceeds that would have been earned through ticket sales to the cup ticket . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the vote , 476 members supported chancellor angela merkel 's government and 99 were against . bolstering tottering banks the package aims to shore up confidence in banks following weeks of market turmoil .
it foresees up to 400 billion euros in lending guarantees for banks .
on top of that , up to 80 billion euros are to be made available to recapitalize banks and buy up risky assets if necessary while another 20 billion euros is to back up the guarantees . the sums are considered a maximum , and might not all be spent if the financial crisis eases . chancellor merkel unveiled the plan on monday this week as part of a concerted effort by governments around the world to stabilize markets and help troubled financial institutions limp through the crisis . the current efforts differ from the $ 700-billion takeover of bad assets by washington last month , since they aim to breathe life back into world banks paralyzed by the crisis that began as a crash in the us subprime mortgage market . a plan for citizens , not for bankers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos heard the concerns towards the plan and reacted german economics minister michael glos insisted that the government 's plan was aimed at protecting the nation 's citizens rather than the bankers .
there was no reason for pessimism about the outlook for the economy . " the opposite , " he said .
" we can solve the problems . " chancellor angela merkel has insisted the bailout would help avert further harm to europe 's biggest economy , which is expected to grind to a near-halt next year . in an unusual move to save time , the bill was then emailed back to german government offices , a few hundred meters away , for its final formalities , including a signature by the finance minister , the chancellor and president horst koehler . most of the euro zone nations and some allies have agreed to identical aid packages , each comprising a huge guarantee for interbank lending and semi-nationalizations of banks by state equity funds . germany has not identified which banks need rescuing , but the nine landesbank companies owned by the states are seen as the weakest units .
two of them , westlb and bayernlb , were hurt by investing in low-grade derivatives . news agency afp quoted a financial source saying germany 's biggest bank , deutsche bank , would not seek state aid .
" deutsche bank 's capital structure is very strong , as a result there is no need to seek state aid , " afp quoted the unnamed source as saying .
the bundestag agreed to the plan amid signs of an element of calm returning to european share markets friday after days of turbulence .
however , the german parliament 's backing for the plan is unlikely to save europe 's biggest economy from a sharp downturn as the financial crisis hits growth around the world . in the run-up to the plan 's passage through parliament , the german government slashed its 2009 economic growth forecast to a feeble 0.2 percent .
party meetings lead to unease and discontent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan is seen by some as a quick fix not long-term solution despite being approved by merkel 's cabinet on monday and by the country 's 16 states on thursday , the plan was still being fiercely debated on thursday evening during a round of party meetings .
the social democrats , who initially signaled their full support for the plan , called for a revision of the proposed bill before friday 's bundestag debate .
the spd insisted that a caveat must be added that makes it clear that responsibility for any losses to the state through the package must be taken by those german banks accepting aid .
the free market liberal opposition free democrats party -lrb- fdp -rrb- also decided after its previously unanimous support for the package that the handling of the current financial crisis needed stricter controls , calling for a more future-orientated plan which would bolster the german economy against further demands .
guido westerwelle , leader of the fdp , also warned the government not to give up its target to curb spending and balance the budget over the crisis .
both the green party and the left party emerged from their meetings with a more critical stance , saying that the level of parliamentary control over the package was insufficient .
both made it clear that the parliamentary " cooperation committee , " which would oversee the implementation of the package , had to guarantee " effective and thorough control of the federation for the banks " while government control of the plan had to be strengthened .
" it 's a 500-billion-euro blank cheque , " said green parliamentary chief renate kuenast . left party unanimously rejects plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oskar lafontaine : show me the money the opposition left party unanimously rejected the rescue package at its meeting .
the left party 's parliamentary group accused the government of not recognizing the full extent of the recession threat facing germany and that , instead of a financial sticking plaster , the country needed a full reform of its economic program .
left party leader oskar lafontaine called for measures to boost domestic demand , adding that many germans found the cabinet 's multi-billion bank rescue package hard to fathom as they suffered the effects of a weakening economy .
" when we asked for more money for hartz iv -lrb- unemployment benefits -rrb- , the answer was ' there 's no money . '
when we asked for more money for pensioners , the answer was ' there 's no money , " ' lafontaine said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de india -pipe- 17.10.2008 shiva : food-first policies needed to tackle hunger in india großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shiva blames the increase in hunger on the use of genetically engineered seeds dramatic price increases have left nearly a billion people hungry worldwide .
as world poverty day draws attention to the issue , dw 's dennis stute speaks with activist vandana shiva about india 's huge hunger levels . dr. vandana shiva is a physicist , ecologist , activist and author .
in india she has established navdanya , a movement for biodiversity conservation and farmers ' rights .
she also directs the research foundation for science , technology and natural resource policy .
the un has declared oct .
17 as the international day for the eradication of poverty . dw-world.de : how has the food crisis affected india ?
vandana shiva : very severely .
prices of staples have literally doubled in the last year and that has meant that the poor who were already only eating half of what they should be eating are now eating a quarter of what they should be .
unfortunately , it is the poor who must make a living by working physically and what we 're basically doing is robbing them of their ability to earn a living .
in addition , when children do n't get enough food to eat or when a mother is malnourished and she gives birth to a low birth-weight child , we are creating generations of people deprived of full mental health and full physical health .
according to a new report , there are " alarming " levels of hunger in 12 indian states and " serious " levels in the remaining five .
what , in your view , is the reason for the widespread malnutrition ?
there are two very big reasons why india has emerged as the capital of hunger .
the first is the “ green revolution ” model of agriculture , which was actually a hunger-creating model proposed as a hunger solution .
but when you destroy food sources in pulses , in vegetables , in grains , in oil seeds and create monocultures of rice and wheat , you destroy the millets - the nutritious grains that have 40 times higher level of nutrition - and call them inferior grains and push them to extinction .
on the ground , you have less food per unit acre and you have less nutrition access per capita .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gmo crops require more water and provide less nutritional value , says shiva the second is related to the new thrust of the 1991 policies of trade liberalization which instead of focusing on food for people focused on exports of luxury cash crops to rich countries , destroying india 's food security base .
this was trade-driven and really put food on the back burner then , treated as something you do n't need policy for .
the food situation is particularly bad in the state of madhya pradesh .
why is this state doing even worse than the others ?
the two reasons madhya pradesh is more severely affected than others is that it 's a large forest state and it 's largely a tribal state .
the food security of the tribals came from abundant forest products including edible products from the forest 's produce .
mining and industrialization is so rampant that tribals are losing their food resources .
it 's also the state where the drought impact because of climate change has been felt very severely .
bundelkhan has had a drought and rainfall failure for four years - there has been no cultivation at all .
and that 's partly because the agricultural model is based on new seeds like hybrid seeds which need chemicals .
but that 's the stupidest thing you could do because climate change requires adaption to drought which means planting crops that are resilient to drought - the millets that use only 250 millimeters of rain .
but unfortunately the government , driven by international agencies like the world bank , has walked on the wrong road for a period of market volatility and climate uncertainty .
the combination is a recipe for hunger and famine .
we need to shift our focus from global markets and global trades to local food security and away from export crops to growing food and nutrition for our people .
in the past ten years , more than 140,000 farmers in india have committed suicide according to official figures .
why is their situation so desperate ?
the first suicide came in 1997 .
when the impact of the new policies of liberalizing the seed sector started to get felt and corporations like monsanto , who wanted to sell genetically modified seed , entered the market .
they started to sell non renewable hybrid seeds which meant the farmers had to spent huge amounts of money buying seed every year .
these seeds also needed irrigation and were vulnerable to pests to the farmers had to spend more money putting in irrigation systems and buying pesticides .
that meant a higher debt burden on farmers .
falling prices of the products and rising costs of production squeezed the farmers even further into debt .
and that is what has led to the spate of suicides .
how can you tackle the problem of hunger ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting food into the hands of the poor is difficult due to heavy subsidies i think the most urgent steps to be taken to tackle the problem are to actually develop the farming systems to produce more food per unit acre .
every assumption of industrial agriculture is wrong because it does not produce more food but uses more chemicals and more water per unit acre .
it produces more commodities for international trade per unit acre but it does not produce more food or more nutrition per unit acre .
models of farming that can increase food-production fivefold , ten fold , depending on your climatic conditions have evolved through the organic movement .
those models of biodiverse , ecological systems can solve the problem of hunger .
the second thing that needs to be done is to bring back food-first policies .
in india after independence we have not had hunger on the scale we are now witnessing .
we had a famine in 1942 which killed two million people .
we had enough food in the country but the british were extracting every bit of rice from bengal and exporting it for profit - exporting it to finance the war .
we drove that famine away through public policy that put food first through a universal public distribution system that meant everyone has a right to affordable food .
that was dismantled by the world bank and it has to be resurrected .
the poor must have food at affordable price instead of subsidizing global corporations .
what the government has to do is to buy , preferably organics , from the indian farmers and then subsidize the prices for the poor .
we would save our financial budgets , we would save our taxes and we would have more food at lower prices .
india this year is spending one trillion rupees in subsidies for global corporations to buy chemical fertilizers .
that 's the wrong way to go .
we can lower costs of production , increase output per acre , increase equity and distribution .
that is food sovereignty .
that is food security .
that is food first . dennis stute -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as world poverty day draws attention to the issue , dw 's dennis stute speaks with activist vandana shiva about india 's huge hunger levels . dr. vandana shiva is a physicist , ecologist , activist and author .
in india she has established navdanya , a movement for biodiversity conservation and farmers ' rights .
she also directs the research foundation for science , technology and natural resource policy .
the un has declared oct .
17 as the international day for the eradication of poverty . dw-world.de : how has the food crisis affected india ?
vandana shiva : very severely .
prices of staples have literally doubled in the last year and that has meant that the poor who were already only eating half of what they should be eating are now eating a quarter of what they should be .
unfortunately , it is the poor who must make a living by working physically and what we 're basically doing is robbing them of their ability to earn a living .
in addition , when children do n't get enough food to eat or when a mother is malnourished and she gives birth to a low birth-weight child , we are creating generations of people deprived of full mental health and full physical health .
according to a new report , there are " alarming " levels of hunger in 12 indian states and " serious " levels in the remaining five .
what , in your view , is the reason for the widespread malnutrition ?
there are two very big reasons why india has emerged as the capital of hunger .
the first is the “ green revolution ” model of agriculture , which was actually a hunger-creating model proposed as a hunger solution .
but when you destroy food sources in pulses , in vegetables , in grains , in oil seeds and create monocultures of rice and wheat , you destroy the millets - the nutritious grains that have 40 times higher level of nutrition - and call them inferior grains and push them to extinction .
on the ground , you have less food per unit acre and you have less nutrition access per capita .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gmo crops require more water and provide less nutritional value , says shiva the second is related to the new thrust of the 1991 policies of trade liberalization which instead of focusing on food for people focused on exports of luxury cash crops to rich countries , destroying india 's food security base .
this was trade-driven and really put food on the back burner then , treated as something you do n't need policy for .
the food situation is particularly bad in the state of madhya pradesh .
why is this state doing even worse than the others ?
the two reasons madhya pradesh is more severely affected than others is that it 's a large forest state and it 's largely a tribal state .
the food security of the tribals came from abundant forest products including edible products from the forest 's produce .
mining and industrialization is so rampant that tribals are losing their food resources .
it 's also the state where the drought impact because of climate change has been felt very severely .
bundelkhan has had a drought and rainfall failure for four years - there has been no cultivation at all .
and that 's partly because the agricultural model is based on new seeds like hybrid seeds which need chemicals .
but that 's the stupidest thing you could do because climate change requires adaption to drought which means planting crops that are resilient to drought - the millets that use only 250 millimeters of rain .
but unfortunately the government , driven by international agencies like the world bank , has walked on the wrong road for a period of market volatility and climate uncertainty .
the combination is a recipe for hunger and famine .
we need to shift our focus from global markets and global trades to local food security and away from export crops to growing food and nutrition for our people .

and the traps that girls can sometimes fall into .
i don ’ t think it ’ s good that it is already considered normal .
the actors in learning by ear have great voices – it ’ s almost like watching a film .
i hope that there will be programs in the future that directly tackle the problems faced by young people here in kenya . "
-lrb- dennis donga , kenya -rrb- " i would like to congratulate the author of the series on hiv / aids because it really gets to the heart of our society ’ s problems .
even though condoms are now being handed out en masse to prevent pregnancies and illnesses , people still aren ’ t using them .
i believe that many people are learning from this radio play and benefit from what they hear . "
-lrb- saleh mchiro , kenya -rrb- " whenever i listen to deutsche welle and in particular this new program for young people , i always think about how i can change my behavior to protect myself from hiv .
and now i can inform others who do not know about hiv / aids .
this gives them the knowledge to protect themselves against this dangerous disease that is still killing people throughout the world - and especially in africa . "
-lrb- arnold mushuti , tanzania -rrb- " first of all i want to thank deutsche welle for the hard work of preparing youth programs of learning by ear in order to teach youth about hiv-aids .
this program helps me also to get more ideas about hiv and how to protect myself against the disease .
i am sure that any boy and any girl who listens to this program will be able to protect themselves from this disease . "
-lrb- ester gasau , kagera region , tanzania -rrb- " when i listen to the learning by ear serie hiv-aids i am able to give other youths information about this killer disease known as hiv-aids , because this disease is killing many youths .
therefore i am taking this opportunity to educate my fellow youths in order to avoid the disease . "
-lrb- christian richard , buleba district , tanzania -rrb- " i really like the radio dramas , especially the one about the young girl angela .
these sorts of things also happen here in guinea-bissau .
mothers are scared about talking to their daughters about sexuality .
they learn about sex on the street and are accordingly ill -informed .
i believe that good information is one way of fighting aids – and that is what you are doing .
thank you for your work ; it is not going unnoticed . "

and the traps that girls can sometimes fall into .
i don ’ t think it ’ s good that it is already considered normal .
the actors in learning by ear have great voices – it ’ s almost like watching a film .
i hope that there will be programs in the future that directly tackle the problems faced by young people here in kenya . "
-lrb- dennis donga , kenya -rrb- " i would like to congratulate the author of the series on hiv / aids because it really gets to the heart of our society ’ s problems .
even though condoms are now being handed out en masse to prevent pregnancies and illnesses , people still aren ’ t using them .
i believe that many people are learning from this radio play and benefit from what they hear . "
-lrb- saleh mchiro , kenya -rrb- " whenever i listen to deutsche welle and in particular this new program for young people , i always think about how i can change my behavior to protect myself from hiv .
and now i can inform others who do not know about hiv / aids .
this gives them the knowledge to protect themselves against this dangerous disease that is still killing people throughout the world - and especially in africa . "
-lrb- arnold mushuti , tanzania -rrb- " first of all i want to thank deutsche welle for the hard work of preparing youth programs of learning by ear in order to teach youth about hiv-aids .
this program helps me also to get more ideas about hiv and how to protect myself against the disease .
i am sure that any boy and any girl who listens to this program will be able to protect themselves from this disease . "
-lrb- ester gasau , kagera region , tanzania -rrb- " when i listen to the learning by ear serie hiv-aids i am able to give other youths information about this killer disease known as hiv-aids , because this disease is killing many youths .
therefore i am taking this opportunity to educate my fellow youths in order to avoid the disease . "
-lrb- christian richard , buleba district , tanzania -rrb- " i really like the radio dramas , especially the one about the young girl angela .
these sorts of things also happen here in guinea-bissau .
mothers are scared about talking to their daughters about sexuality .
they learn about sex on the street and are accordingly ill -informed .
i believe that good information is one way of fighting aids – and that is what you are doing .
thank you for your work ; it is not going unnoticed . "

i don ’ t think it ’ s good that it is already considered normal .
the actors in learning by ear have great voices – it ’ s almost like watching a film .
i hope that there will be programs in the future that directly tackle the problems faced by young people here in kenya . "
-lrb- dennis donga , kenya -rrb- " i would like to congratulate the author of the series on hiv / aids because it really gets to the heart of our society ’ s problems .

therefore i am taking this opportunity to educate my fellow youths in order to avoid the disease . "
-lrb- christian richard , buleba district , tanzania -rrb- " i really like the radio dramas , especially the one about the young girl angela .
these sorts of things also happen here in guinea-bissau .
mothers are scared about talking to their daughters about sexuality .
they learn about sex on the street and are accordingly ill -informed .
i believe that good information is one way of fighting aids – and that is what you are doing .
thank you for your work ; it is not going unnoticed . "

and the traps that girls can sometimes fall into .
i don ’ t think it ’ s good that it is already considered normal .
the actors in learning by ear have great voices – it ’ s almost like watching a film .
i hope that there will be programs in the future that directly tackle the problems faced by young people here in kenya . "
-lrb- dennis donga , kenya -rrb- " i would like to congratulate the author of the series on hiv / aids because it really gets to the heart of our society ’ s problems .
even though condoms are now being handed out en masse to prevent pregnancies and illnesses , people still aren ’ t using them .
i believe that many people are learning from this radio play and benefit from what they hear . "
-lrb- saleh mchiro , kenya -rrb- " whenever i listen to deutsche welle and in particular this new program for young people , i always think about how i can change my behavior to protect myself from hiv .
and now i can inform others who do not know about hiv / aids .
this gives them the knowledge to protect themselves against this dangerous disease that is still killing people throughout the world - and especially in africa . "
-lrb- arnold mushuti , tanzania -rrb- " first of all i want to thank deutsche welle for the hard work of preparing youth programs of learning by ear in order to teach youth about hiv-aids .
this program helps me also to get more ideas about hiv and how to protect myself against the disease .
i am sure that any boy and any girl who listens to this program will be able to protect themselves from this disease . "
-lrb- ester gasau , kagera region , tanzania -rrb- " when i listen to the learning by ear serie hiv-aids i am able to give other youths information about this killer disease known as hiv-aids , because this disease is killing many youths .
therefore i am taking this opportunity to educate my fellow youths in order to avoid the disease . "
-lrb- christian richard , buleba district , tanzania -rrb- " i really like the radio dramas , especially the one about the young girl angela .
these sorts of things also happen here in guinea-bissau .
mothers are scared about talking to their daughters about sexuality .
they learn about sex on the street and are accordingly ill -informed .
i believe that good information is one way of fighting aids – and that is what you are doing .
thank you for your work ; it is not going unnoticed . "

will books as we know them soon be a thing of the past ?
a new generation of digital " e-readers " has the german publishing industry gearing up for a fast-moving digital future . electronic books were announced as the " next big thing " a decade ago .
but the technology that came out at the time failed to impress consumers , and made few inroads into the market .
now some new e-readers , predicted to be put on the market in europe in the near future , have publishing industry insiders preparing for major changes .
lightweight devices like amazon 's kindle and the sony reader have been the focus of intense interest since they celebrated their german coming-out party at the frankfurt book fair , which runs through oct .
19 .
e-books - stars of the frankfurt fair the press toasted the new readers as the " true stars " of this year 's fair .
but considering the changes they could represent for the staid publishing industry , players are eyeing them with a mixture of fascination and fear .
" overall , i think german publishers are very enthusiastic about e-books , " said thomas wilking , editor in chief of the german publishing trade magazine buchreport .
" they are just waiting for a device they think is attractive enough for a wide public . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sony is hoping its reader will impress europeans book fair organizers took an unscientific survey of 1,000 industry players on the future of the new technology , and published it just before the fair opened .
unfortunately , the data failed to paint any clear road map for the future .
more than 70 percent of respondents said they were ready for the digital challenge - but 60 percent of them had neither used e-readers nor downloaded e-books themselves .
meanwhile , a full 40 percent said they expect e-content to dominate the market by 2018 - compared with one-third of respondents who said e-books will never take over .
12 percent thought the new e-readers would be a short-lived flash in the pan .
' you could take 50 books to the beach ' jak boumans , a dutch media-content consultant who runs his own firm , electronic media reporting , is convinced e-books are here to stay .
but he estimates it will be at least 2030 before they are in wide usage , considering how many details still need to be ironed out , and how ingrained peoples ' attitudes are towards reading .
" this has been a topic for the last 30 years , but the mentality is still trying to catch up with the technology , " boumans said .
" e-readers mean people could go on holiday without packing a stack of heavy books - they can take 50 books with them in one device and still read it on the beach . "
observers praise the kindle and reader as being significantly improved from the last devices that tried to storm the market but failed .
the new devices have extended their battery life and traded the backlit computer screen for a paper-simulating " e-paper " that is less hard on the eyes .
the ritual of turning pages some book lovers wonder if an electronic device will ever really replace paper books , however .
johann schumandl , owner of a small independent book store in cologne , said he thinks people might accept e-readers for reading work documents .
but printed books will never disappear completely : " when you read a book you have the sense of touch , the haptic value , " he said .
" there is something ritualistic about reading a book , turning the pages . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : which e-reader will capture the market ?
boumans agrees that casual readers - who he refers to as " ink sniffers " - will be the last group to make the switch .
but he believes a new generation of people who grew up using ipods will see things differently .
" the only question they are going to have is , ' how many functions will this device combine for me ? " ' he said .
people have been predicting the demise of the bookstore for a long time now , and many now think e-books and e-readers could deliver the coup de grace .
twenty-five percent of respondents to the book fair study thought bookstores would largely disappear within half a century , with online distribution of paper books by firms such as amazon taking over .
copyright quandary some european bookstores seem to be trying to get ahead of the curve by being the first to promote e-books .
top german chain bookstore thalia struck a deal with sony to sell content for its reader devices in thalia stores and online .
assuming e-books do take hold , there are still many questions to be answered .
which reader - amazon 's , sony 's , or perhaps one from a european competitor , like the netherlands ' iliad - will capture the public 's fancy ?
each one has slightly different technical specifications , and is based on different technical platforms .
another big question is how the industry will deal with copyright protection .
some employ digital rights management -lrb- drm , -rrb- a kind of software lock on downloadable books , with the aim of avoiding the music industry 's fate .
since the advent of digital music , record companies have famously seen profits decimated by piracy and illegal downloading .
boumans opposes technological protection on content .
he supports the concept of a " social drm , " which would operate under a " name and shame " system : when a person buys electronic data , his or her name is attached to the file so anyone can see how it is passed around after that .
social pressure would correct the market .
' the ipod principle ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazon 's kindle is a big seller in the us ultimately , boumans says four things need to be in place before e-books really take off : a device , a portfolio of downloadable material , the download service - and the right price for content .
" that 's when you get what i call the ipod principle , " he said .
" people start downloading things and they are willing to pay for it . "
clearly it is difficult to imagine exactly what shape the digital-literature future will take .
according to buchreport editor wilking , the future may be even more unrecognizable than we can imagine .
for one thing , books may cease to be a collection of words on paper - or even e-paper .
" there are a lot of possibilities when it comes to e-publishing , " wilking said .
" people will be able to build in films and interactive elements .
things we ca n't even imagine yet . "
once these technical possibilities are there , he says , then the authors might start taking them into consideration , and writing for multimedia instead of just the page . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but he estimates it will be at least 2030 before they are in wide usage , considering how many details still need to be ironed out , and how ingrained peoples ' attitudes are towards reading .
" this has been a topic for the last 30 years , but the mentality is still trying to catch up with the technology , " boumans said .
" e-readers mean people could go on holiday without packing a stack of heavy books - they can take 50 books with them in one device and still read it on the beach . "
observers praise the kindle and reader as being significantly improved from the last devices that tried to storm the market but failed .
the new devices have extended their battery life and traded the backlit computer screen for a paper-simulating " e-paper " that is less hard on the eyes .
the ritual of turning pages some book lovers wonder if an electronic device will ever really replace paper books , however .
johann schumandl , owner of a small independent book store in cologne , said he thinks people might accept e-readers for reading work documents .
but printed books will never disappear completely : " when you read a book you have the sense of touch , the haptic value , " he said .
" there is something ritualistic about reading a book , turning the pages . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : which e-reader will capture the market ?
boumans agrees that casual readers - who he refers to as " ink sniffers " - will be the last group to make the switch .
but he believes a new generation of people who grew up using ipods will see things differently .
" the only question they are going to have is , ' how many functions will this device combine for me ? " ' he said .
people have been predicting the demise of the bookstore for a long time now , and many now think e-books and e-readers could deliver the coup de grace .
twenty-five percent of respondents to the book fair study thought bookstores would largely disappear within half a century , with online distribution of paper books by firms such as amazon taking over .
copyright quandary some european bookstores seem to be trying to get ahead of the curve by being the first to promote e-books .
top german chain bookstore thalia struck a deal with sony to sell content for its reader devices in thalia stores and online .
assuming e-books do take hold , there are still many questions to be answered .
which reader - amazon 's , sony 's , or perhaps one from a european competitor , like the netherlands ' iliad - will capture the public 's fancy ?
each one has slightly different technical specifications , and is based on different technical platforms .
another big question is how the industry will deal with copyright protection .
some employ digital rights management -lrb- drm , -rrb- a kind of software lock on downloadable books , with the aim of avoiding the music industry 's fate .
since the advent of digital music , record companies have famously seen profits decimated by piracy and illegal downloading .
boumans opposes technological protection on content .
he supports the concept of a " social drm , " which would operate under a " name and shame " system : when a person buys electronic data , his or her name is attached to the file so anyone can see how it is passed around after that .
social pressure would correct the market .
' the ipod principle ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazon 's kindle is a big seller in the us ultimately , boumans says four things need to be in place before e-books really take off : a device , a portfolio of downloadable material , the download service - and the right price for content .
" that 's when you get what i call the ipod principle , " he said .
" people start downloading things and they are willing to pay for it . "
clearly it is difficult to imagine exactly what shape the digital-literature future will take .
according to buchreport editor wilking , the future may be even more unrecognizable than we can imagine .
for one thing , books may cease to be a collection of words on paper - or even e-paper .
" there are a lot of possibilities when it comes to e-publishing , " wilking said .
" people will be able to build in films and interactive elements .
things we ca n't even imagine yet . "
once these technical possibilities are there , he says , then the authors might start taking them into consideration , and writing for multimedia instead of just the page . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a new generation of digital " e-readers " has the german publishing industry gearing up for a fast-moving digital future . electronic books were announced as the " next big thing " a decade ago .
but the technology that came out at the time failed to impress consumers , and made few inroads into the market .
now some new e-readers , predicted to be put on the market in europe in the near future , have publishing industry insiders preparing for major changes .
lightweight devices like amazon 's kindle and the sony reader have been the focus of intense interest since they celebrated their german coming-out party at the frankfurt book fair , which runs through oct .

as world poverty day draws attention to the issue , dw 's dennis stute speaks with activist vandana shiva about india 's huge hunger levels . dr. vandana shiva is a physicist , ecologist , activist and author .
in india she has established navdanya , a movement for biodiversity conservation and farmers ' rights .
she also directs the research foundation for science , technology and natural resource policy .
the un has declared oct .
17 as the international day for the eradication of poverty . dw-world.de : how has the food crisis affected india ?
vandana shiva : very severely .
prices of staples have literally doubled in the last year and that has meant that the poor who were already only eating half of what they should be eating are now eating a quarter of what they should be .
unfortunately , it is the poor who must make a living by working physically and what we 're basically doing is robbing them of their ability to earn a living .
in addition , when children do n't get enough food to eat or when a mother is malnourished and she gives birth to a low birth-weight child , we are creating generations of people deprived of full mental health and full physical health .
according to a new report , there are " alarming " levels of hunger in 12 indian states and " serious " levels in the remaining five .
what , in your view , is the reason for the widespread malnutrition ?
there are two very big reasons why india has emerged as the capital of hunger .
the first is the “ green revolution ” model of agriculture , which was actually a hunger-creating model proposed as a hunger solution .
but when you destroy food sources in pulses , in vegetables , in grains , in oil seeds and create monocultures of rice and wheat , you destroy the millets - the nutritious grains that have 40 times higher level of nutrition - and call them inferior grains and push them to extinction .
on the ground , you have less food per unit acre and you have less nutrition access per capita .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gmo crops require more water and provide less nutritional value , says shiva the second is related to the new thrust of the 1991 policies of trade liberalization which instead of focusing on food for people focused on exports of luxury cash crops to rich countries , destroying india 's food security base .
this was trade-driven and really put food on the back burner then , treated as something you do n't need policy for .
the food situation is particularly bad in the state of madhya pradesh .
why is this state doing even worse than the others ?
the two reasons madhya pradesh is more severely affected than others is that it 's a large forest state and it 's largely a tribal state .
the food security of the tribals came from abundant forest products including edible products from the forest 's produce .
mining and industrialization is so rampant that tribals are losing their food resources .
it 's also the state where the drought impact because of climate change has been felt very severely .
bundelkhan has had a drought and rainfall failure for four years - there has been no cultivation at all .
and that 's partly because the agricultural model is based on new seeds like hybrid seeds which need chemicals .
but that 's the stupidest thing you could do because climate change requires adaption to drought which means planting crops that are resilient to drought - the millets that use only 250 millimeters of rain .
but unfortunately the government , driven by international agencies like the world bank , has walked on the wrong road for a period of market volatility and climate uncertainty .
the combination is a recipe for hunger and famine .
we need to shift our focus from global markets and global trades to local food security and away from export crops to growing food and nutrition for our people .
in the past ten years , more than 140,000 farmers in india have committed suicide according to official figures .
why is their situation so desperate ?
the first suicide came in 1997 .
when the impact of the new policies of liberalizing the seed sector started to get felt and corporations like monsanto , who wanted to sell genetically modified seed , entered the market .
they started to sell non renewable hybrid seeds which meant the farmers had to spent huge amounts of money buying seed every year .
these seeds also needed irrigation and were vulnerable to pests to the farmers had to spend more money putting in irrigation systems and buying pesticides .
that meant a higher debt burden on farmers .
falling prices of the products and rising costs of production squeezed the farmers even further into debt .
and that is what has led to the spate of suicides .
how can you tackle the problem of hunger ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting food into the hands of the poor is difficult due to heavy subsidies i think the most urgent steps to be taken to tackle the problem are to actually develop the farming systems to produce more food per unit acre .
every assumption of industrial agriculture is wrong because it does not produce more food but uses more chemicals and more water per unit acre .
it produces more commodities for international trade per unit acre but it does not produce more food or more nutrition per unit acre .
models of farming that can increase food-production fivefold , ten fold , depending on your climatic conditions have evolved through the organic movement .
those models of biodiverse , ecological systems can solve the problem of hunger .
the second thing that needs to be done is to bring back food-first policies .
in india after independence we have not had hunger on the scale we are now witnessing .
we had a famine in 1942 which killed two million people .
we had enough food in the country but the british were extracting every bit of rice from bengal and exporting it for profit - exporting it to finance the war .
we drove that famine away through public policy that put food first through a universal public distribution system that meant everyone has a right to affordable food .
that was dismantled by the world bank and it has to be resurrected .
the poor must have food at affordable price instead of subsidizing global corporations .
what the government has to do is to buy , preferably organics , from the indian farmers and then subsidize the prices for the poor .
we would save our financial budgets , we would save our taxes and we would have more food at lower prices .
india this year is spending one trillion rupees in subsidies for global corporations to buy chemical fertilizers .
that 's the wrong way to go .

as world poverty day draws attention to the issue , dw 's dennis stute speaks with activist vandana shiva about india 's huge hunger levels . dr. vandana shiva is a physicist , ecologist , activist and author .
in india she has established navdanya , a movement for biodiversity conservation and farmers ' rights .
she also directs the research foundation for science , technology and natural resource policy .
the un has declared oct .
17 as the international day for the eradication of poverty . dw-world.de : how has the food crisis affected india ?
vandana shiva : very severely .
prices of staples have literally doubled in the last year and that has meant that the poor who were already only eating half of what they should be eating are now eating a quarter of what they should be .
unfortunately , it is the poor who must make a living by working physically and what we 're basically doing is robbing them of their ability to earn a living .
in addition , when children do n't get enough food to eat or when a mother is malnourished and she gives birth to a low birth-weight child , we are creating generations of people deprived of full mental health and full physical health .
according to a new report , there are " alarming " levels of hunger in 12 indian states and " serious " levels in the remaining five .
what , in your view , is the reason for the widespread malnutrition ?
there are two very big reasons why india has emerged as the capital of hunger .
the first is the “ green revolution ” model of agriculture , which was actually a hunger-creating model proposed as a hunger solution .
but when you destroy food sources in pulses , in vegetables , in grains , in oil seeds and create monocultures of rice and wheat , you destroy the millets - the nutritious grains that have 40 times higher level of nutrition - and call them inferior grains and push them to extinction .
on the ground , you have less food per unit acre and you have less nutrition access per capita .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gmo crops require more water and provide less nutritional value , says shiva the second is related to the new thrust of the 1991 policies of trade liberalization which instead of focusing on food for people focused on exports of luxury cash crops to rich countries , destroying india 's food security base .
this was trade-driven and really put food on the back burner then , treated as something you do n't need policy for .
the food situation is particularly bad in the state of madhya pradesh .
why is this state doing even worse than the others ?
the two reasons madhya pradesh is more severely affected than others is that it 's a large forest state and it 's largely a tribal state .
the food security of the tribals came from abundant forest products including edible products from the forest 's produce .
mining and industrialization is so rampant that tribals are losing their food resources .
it 's also the state where the drought impact because of climate change has been felt very severely .
bundelkhan has had a drought and rainfall failure for four years - there has been no cultivation at all .
and that 's partly because the agricultural model is based on new seeds like hybrid seeds which need chemicals .
but that 's the stupidest thing you could do because climate change requires adaption to drought which means planting crops that are resilient to drought - the millets that use only 250 millimeters of rain .
but unfortunately the government , driven by international agencies like the world bank , has walked on the wrong road for a period of market volatility and climate uncertainty .
the combination is a recipe for hunger and famine .
we need to shift our focus from global markets and global trades to local food security and away from export crops to growing food and nutrition for our people .
in the past ten years , more than 140,000 farmers in india have committed suicide according to official figures .
why is their situation so desperate ?
the first suicide came in 1997 .
when the impact of the new policies of liberalizing the seed sector started to get felt and corporations like monsanto , who wanted to sell genetically modified seed , entered the market .
they started to sell non renewable hybrid seeds which meant the farmers had to spent huge amounts of money buying seed every year .
these seeds also needed irrigation and were vulnerable to pests to the farmers had to spend more money putting in irrigation systems and buying pesticides .
that meant a higher debt burden on farmers .
falling prices of the products and rising costs of production squeezed the farmers even further into debt .
and that is what has led to the spate of suicides .
how can you tackle the problem of hunger ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting food into the hands of the poor is difficult due to heavy subsidies i think the most urgent steps to be taken to tackle the problem are to actually develop the farming systems to produce more food per unit acre .
every assumption of industrial agriculture is wrong because it does not produce more food but uses more chemicals and more water per unit acre .
it produces more commodities for international trade per unit acre but it does not produce more food or more nutrition per unit acre .
models of farming that can increase food-production fivefold , ten fold , depending on your climatic conditions have evolved through the organic movement .
those models of biodiverse , ecological systems can solve the problem of hunger .
the second thing that needs to be done is to bring back food-first policies .
in india after independence we have not had hunger on the scale we are now witnessing .
we had a famine in 1942 which killed two million people .
we had enough food in the country but the british were extracting every bit of rice from bengal and exporting it for profit - exporting it to finance the war .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 17.10.2008 loss of natural capital costs more than bank crisis , says expert großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the financial crisis has left us unable to see the wood for the trees as the eu discusses the affordability of its carbon-reduction targets , economist pavan sukhdev told dw-world.de that the best things in life are free , but not for much longer .
the nature crunch could prove costly . once described as an " economist by profession and an ecologist at heart , " pavan sukhdev holds the chair of deutsche bank 's global market center and is director of the green accounting for indian states project , a study on the economic significance of biodiversity in india .
he also heads an ongoing global report funded by the german ministry for the environment and the european commission on " the economics of ecosystems & biodiversity " -lrb- teeb -rrb- , and is among the architects of the green new deal , spearheaded by the united nations environment program , which will be unveiled in london on oct .
22 .
dw-world.de : you said at the world conservation congress in barcelona last week that the economic burden of environmentally hostile practices like deforestation outweighs that of the bank crisis .
pavan sukhdev : the capital loss to financial firms in the city and wall street has been estimated as $ 1 trillion to $ 1.5 trillion .
in teeb 's first phase report which we presented in may , we looked at the extent of losses taking place as a result of deforestation and degradation .
we estimated the loss in human welfare as a capital item , and worked out that this was $ 2 to $ 4.5 trillion per year , every year , for the last several years .
and it will continue , if we carry on with business as usual .
why is it that a one-off loss of $ 1.5 trillion in financial capital to a group of wall street firms attracts so much attention , whereas the ongoing loss per annum of twice this amount of natural capital is barely reported ?
we 've seen governments bail out the economy - what would a " bailout " for the environment look like ?
it would be comparatively modest .
let me give you a few indicating benchmarks .
today we have something like 100,000 conservation areas , covering some 10-11 percent of the earth 's land surface .
the teeb team believes that we are spending some $ 40-50 billion too little on making that conservation effective .
according to various estimates , these conservation areas produce some $ 4-5 trillion of utility per year .
today , spending on protected areas globally is less than $ 20 billion , and all we 're suggesting is an increase of another $ 50 billion a year to ensure the continuation of the benefits of these protected areas .
we 're not talking about a massive amount of money - single institutions have lost more than that in the current financial chaos .
but for various reasons it doesn ’ t get allocated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pavan sukhdev what are these reasons ?
for one , the loss of natural capital is a loss of public wealth .
eco-system services are public benefits that are pretty much free .
it is not individuals ' or shareholders ' wealth at stake , although it is , if you like , global shareholders ' wealth .
but it 's not private ownership , it 's public ownership .
these are things that are there for all to enjoy : we would dearly miss their absence and we would pay the earth to get them back , but right now , they 're free .
so the public nature of these goods and services is one reason .
to understand the second reason why loss of natural capital does n't grab headlines , we need to think of the frog analogy used by al gore in his book " an inconvenient truth " : if you put a frog in a beaker of water and gradually raise the temperature , it wo n't notice any change .
similarly , what is happening to us is happening continuously .
every year we lose forest , the climate gets worse , poor people 's water supplies and field nutrients decline .
but we see these losses so gradually that we do n't realize that things are getting worse .
whereas in the case of the financial markets it 's one short , sharp shock .
nonetheless , a lot of smart money has started to flow into environmental investment .
in north america , the percentage of venture capital spent on clean technology used to be around 2 percent in 2002 , but had risen to 17 percent by 2007 .
is there a risk that environmental concerns will be abandoned given the current slowdown in the global economy ? i do n't think so , because people are beginning to get the message . i never have to explain myself twice any more .
even two years ago , people 's eyes would glaze over .
now people want to know what needs to be done .
of course , the cost of the financial crisis means there will now be increased distributional pressure on how much can be allocated to solving environmental problems .
but my point is that this money is not much , considering how much is spent on other sectors .
there 's no need to think about it too much .
the time is now .
how viable is a rescue plan like this during a recession , which is what we 're facing right now ?
a $ 45 billion gap per annum is not the end of the world .
look at how much has been lost and how much is being allocated individually by governments in the us and europe - up to $ 700 billion .
to put things in context , the investment per annum of the eu in conservation areas is about 6 billion euros .
these are modest sums .
so economic disaster does n't necessarily have to mean ecological disaster too ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the financial crisis is reported extensively - the environmental one is n't no .
venture capitalists have understood something that the world , generally , has not .
as other businesses begin using the technology into which venture capital has been invested , they will find amazing and sizeable opportunities .
i predict a tectonic shift in the way things are done .
renewable energy is an extraordinary opportunity if you use it not just to fix the supply that comes to you and me in berlin and london , but to fix the supply needed by the world 's 2 billion who do n't have an energy supply - the poorest people in the world who do not actually have energy coming to their homes in the form of oil , coal or electricity .
there are vast opportunities here , in countries like india and china , africa and latin america , to apply well-researched technologies which provide , for example , modular solutions to bring light into the poor home .
just imagine what kind of change you could see - education coming down to a village level , children staying up in order to read . think of the tectonic shift than can be achieved just by shifting focus and providing micro-finance to villagers to implement renewable energy solutions .
and look at the number of people who can benefit from that .
these are the sort of things that smart business is looking at .
there is money in making more efficient equipment and implementing more efficient processes .
does the credit crunch make people more aware that being careful with natural capital is important too ?
yes .
as the saying goes , a crisis is a terrible thing to waste . interview : jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

will books as we know them soon be a thing of the past ?
a new generation of digital " e-readers " has the german publishing industry gearing up for a fast-moving digital future . electronic books were announced as the " next big thing " a decade ago .
but the technology that came out at the time failed to impress consumers , and made few inroads into the market .
now some new e-readers , predicted to be put on the market in europe in the near future , have publishing industry insiders preparing for major changes .
lightweight devices like amazon 's kindle and the sony reader have been the focus of intense interest since they celebrated their german coming-out party at the frankfurt book fair , which runs through oct .
19 .
e-books - stars of the frankfurt fair the press toasted the new readers as the " true stars " of this year 's fair .
but considering the changes they could represent for the staid publishing industry , players are eyeing them with a mixture of fascination and fear .
" overall , i think german publishers are very enthusiastic about e-books , " said thomas wilking , editor in chief of the german publishing trade magazine buchreport .
" they are just waiting for a device they think is attractive enough for a wide public . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sony is hoping its reader will impress europeans book fair organizers took an unscientific survey of 1,000 industry players on the future of the new technology , and published it just before the fair opened .
unfortunately , the data failed to paint any clear road map for the future .
more than 70 percent of respondents said they were ready for the digital challenge - but 60 percent of them had neither used e-readers nor downloaded e-books themselves .
meanwhile , a full 40 percent said they expect e-content to dominate the market by 2018 - compared with one-third of respondents who said e-books will never take over .
12 percent thought the new e-readers would be a short-lived flash in the pan .
' you could take 50 books to the beach ' jak boumans , a dutch media-content consultant who runs his own firm , electronic media reporting , is convinced e-books are here to stay .
but he estimates it will be at least 2030 before they are in wide usage , considering how many details still need to be ironed out , and how ingrained peoples ' attitudes are towards reading .
" this has been a topic for the last 30 years , but the mentality is still trying to catch up with the technology , " boumans said .
" e-readers mean people could go on holiday without packing a stack of heavy books - they can take 50 books with them in one device and still read it on the beach . "
observers praise the kindle and reader as being significantly improved from the last devices that tried to storm the market but failed .
the new devices have extended their battery life and traded the backlit computer screen for a paper-simulating " e-paper " that is less hard on the eyes .
the ritual of turning pages some book lovers wonder if an electronic device will ever really replace paper books , however .
johann schumandl , owner of a small independent book store in cologne , said he thinks people might accept e-readers for reading work documents .
but printed books will never disappear completely : " when you read a book you have the sense of touch , the haptic value , " he said .
" there is something ritualistic about reading a book , turning the pages . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : which e-reader will capture the market ?
boumans agrees that casual readers - who he refers to as " ink sniffers " - will be the last group to make the switch .
but he believes a new generation of people who grew up using ipods will see things differently .
" the only question they are going to have is , ' how many functions will this device combine for me ? " ' he said .
people have been predicting the demise of the bookstore for a long time now , and many now think e-books and e-readers could deliver the coup de grace .
twenty-five percent of respondents to the book fair study thought bookstores would largely disappear within half a century , with online distribution of paper books by firms such as amazon taking over .
copyright quandary some european bookstores seem to be trying to get ahead of the curve by being the first to promote e-books .
top german chain bookstore thalia struck a deal with sony to sell content for its reader devices in thalia stores and online .
assuming e-books do take hold , there are still many questions to be answered .
which reader - amazon 's , sony 's , or perhaps one from a european competitor , like the netherlands ' iliad - will capture the public 's fancy ?
each one has slightly different technical specifications , and is based on different technical platforms .
another big question is how the industry will deal with copyright protection .
some employ digital rights management -lrb- drm , -rrb- a kind of software lock on downloadable books , with the aim of avoiding the music industry 's fate .
since the advent of digital music , record companies have famously seen profits decimated by piracy and illegal downloading .
boumans opposes technological protection on content .
he supports the concept of a " social drm , " which would operate under a " name and shame " system : when a person buys electronic data , his or her name is attached to the file so anyone can see how it is passed around after that .
social pressure would correct the market .
' the ipod principle ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazon 's kindle is a big seller in the us ultimately , boumans says four things need to be in place before e-books really take off : a device , a portfolio of downloadable material , the download service - and the right price for content .
" that 's when you get what i call the ipod principle , " he said .
" people start downloading things and they are willing to pay for it . "
clearly it is difficult to imagine exactly what shape the digital-literature future will take .
according to buchreport editor wilking , the future may be even more unrecognizable than we can imagine .
for one thing , books may cease to be a collection of words on paper - or even e-paper .
" there are a lot of possibilities when it comes to e-publishing , " wilking said .
" people will be able to build in films and interactive elements .
things we ca n't even imagine yet . "
once these technical possibilities are there , he says , then the authors might start taking them into consideration , and writing for multimedia instead of just the page . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as world poverty day draws attention to the issue , dw 's dennis stute speaks with activist vandana shiva about india 's huge hunger levels . dr. vandana shiva is a physicist , ecologist , activist and author .
in india she has established navdanya , a movement for biodiversity conservation and farmers ' rights .
she also directs the research foundation for science , technology and natural resource policy .
the un has declared oct .
17 as the international day for the eradication of poverty . dw-world.de : how has the food crisis affected india ?
vandana shiva : very severely .
prices of staples have literally doubled in the last year and that has meant that the poor who were already only eating half of what they should be eating are now eating a quarter of what they should be .
unfortunately , it is the poor who must make a living by working physically and what we 're basically doing is robbing them of their ability to earn a living .
in addition , when children do n't get enough food to eat or when a mother is malnourished and she gives birth to a low birth-weight child , we are creating generations of people deprived of full mental health and full physical health .
according to a new report , there are " alarming " levels of hunger in 12 indian states and " serious " levels in the remaining five .
what , in your view , is the reason for the widespread malnutrition ?
there are two very big reasons why india has emerged as the capital of hunger .
the first is the “ green revolution ” model of agriculture , which was actually a hunger-creating model proposed as a hunger solution .
but when you destroy food sources in pulses , in vegetables , in grains , in oil seeds and create monocultures of rice and wheat , you destroy the millets - the nutritious grains that have 40 times higher level of nutrition - and call them inferior grains and push them to extinction .
on the ground , you have less food per unit acre and you have less nutrition access per capita .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gmo crops require more water and provide less nutritional value , says shiva the second is related to the new thrust of the 1991 policies of trade liberalization which instead of focusing on food for people focused on exports of luxury cash crops to rich countries , destroying india 's food security base .
this was trade-driven and really put food on the back burner then , treated as something you do n't need policy for .
the food situation is particularly bad in the state of madhya pradesh .
why is this state doing even worse than the others ?
the two reasons madhya pradesh is more severely affected than others is that it 's a large forest state and it 's largely a tribal state .
the food security of the tribals came from abundant forest products including edible products from the forest 's produce .
mining and industrialization is so rampant that tribals are losing their food resources .
it 's also the state where the drought impact because of climate change has been felt very severely .
bundelkhan has had a drought and rainfall failure for four years - there has been no cultivation at all .
and that 's partly because the agricultural model is based on new seeds like hybrid seeds which need chemicals .
but that 's the stupidest thing you could do because climate change requires adaption to drought which means planting crops that are resilient to drought - the millets that use only 250 millimeters of rain .
but unfortunately the government , driven by international agencies like the world bank , has walked on the wrong road for a period of market volatility and climate uncertainty .
the combination is a recipe for hunger and famine .
we need to shift our focus from global markets and global trades to local food security and away from export crops to growing food and nutrition for our people .
in the past ten years , more than 140,000 farmers in india have committed suicide according to official figures .
why is their situation so desperate ?
the first suicide came in 1997 .
when the impact of the new policies of liberalizing the seed sector started to get felt and corporations like monsanto , who wanted to sell genetically modified seed , entered the market .
they started to sell non renewable hybrid seeds which meant the farmers had to spent huge amounts of money buying seed every year .
these seeds also needed irrigation and were vulnerable to pests to the farmers had to spend more money putting in irrigation systems and buying pesticides .
that meant a higher debt burden on farmers .
falling prices of the products and rising costs of production squeezed the farmers even further into debt .
and that is what has led to the spate of suicides .
how can you tackle the problem of hunger ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting food into the hands of the poor is difficult due to heavy subsidies i think the most urgent steps to be taken to tackle the problem are to actually develop the farming systems to produce more food per unit acre .
every assumption of industrial agriculture is wrong because it does not produce more food but uses more chemicals and more water per unit acre .
it produces more commodities for international trade per unit acre but it does not produce more food or more nutrition per unit acre .
models of farming that can increase food-production fivefold , ten fold , depending on your climatic conditions have evolved through the organic movement .
those models of biodiverse , ecological systems can solve the problem of hunger .
the second thing that needs to be done is to bring back food-first policies .
in india after independence we have not had hunger on the scale we are now witnessing .
we had a famine in 1942 which killed two million people .
we had enough food in the country but the british were extracting every bit of rice from bengal and exporting it for profit - exporting it to finance the war .
we drove that famine away through public policy that put food first through a universal public distribution system that meant everyone has a right to affordable food .
that was dismantled by the world bank and it has to be resurrected .
the poor must have food at affordable price instead of subsidizing global corporations .
what the government has to do is to buy , preferably organics , from the indian farmers and then subsidize the prices for the poor .
we would save our financial budgets , we would save our taxes and we would have more food at lower prices .
india this year is spending one trillion rupees in subsidies for global corporations to buy chemical fertilizers .
that 's the wrong way to go .
we can lower costs of production , increase output per acre , increase equity and distribution .
that is food sovereignty .
that is food security .
that is food first . dennis stute -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the nature crunch could prove costly . once described as an " economist by profession and an ecologist at heart , " pavan sukhdev holds the chair of deutsche bank 's global market center and is director of the green accounting for indian states project , a study on the economic significance of biodiversity in india .
he also heads an ongoing global report funded by the german ministry for the environment and the european commission on " the economics of ecosystems & biodiversity " -lrb- teeb -rrb- , and is among the architects of the green new deal , spearheaded by the united nations environment program , which will be unveiled in london on oct .
22 .
dw-world.de : you said at the world conservation congress in barcelona last week that the economic burden of environmentally hostile practices like deforestation outweighs that of the bank crisis .
pavan sukhdev : the capital loss to financial firms in the city and wall street has been estimated as $ 1 trillion to $ 1.5 trillion .
in teeb 's first phase report which we presented in may , we looked at the extent of losses taking place as a result of deforestation and degradation .
we estimated the loss in human welfare as a capital item , and worked out that this was $ 2 to $ 4.5 trillion per year , every year , for the last several years .
and it will continue , if we carry on with business as usual .
why is it that a one-off loss of $ 1.5 trillion in financial capital to a group of wall street firms attracts so much attention , whereas the ongoing loss per annum of twice this amount of natural capital is barely reported ?
we 've seen governments bail out the economy - what would a " bailout " for the environment look like ?
it would be comparatively modest .
let me give you a few indicating benchmarks .
today we have something like 100,000 conservation areas , covering some 10-11 percent of the earth 's land surface .
the teeb team believes that we are spending some $ 40-50 billion too little on making that conservation effective .
according to various estimates , these conservation areas produce some $ 4-5 trillion of utility per year .
today , spending on protected areas globally is less than $ 20 billion , and all we 're suggesting is an increase of another $ 50 billion a year to ensure the continuation of the benefits of these protected areas .
we 're not talking about a massive amount of money - single institutions have lost more than that in the current financial chaos .
but for various reasons it doesn ’ t get allocated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pavan sukhdev what are these reasons ?
for one , the loss of natural capital is a loss of public wealth .
eco-system services are public benefits that are pretty much free .
it is not individuals ' or shareholders ' wealth at stake , although it is , if you like , global shareholders ' wealth .
but it 's not private ownership , it 's public ownership .
these are things that are there for all to enjoy : we would dearly miss their absence and we would pay the earth to get them back , but right now , they 're free .
so the public nature of these goods and services is one reason .
to understand the second reason why loss of natural capital does n't grab headlines , we need to think of the frog analogy used by al gore in his book " an inconvenient truth " : if you put a frog in a beaker of water and gradually raise the temperature , it wo n't notice any change .
similarly , what is happening to us is happening continuously .
every year we lose forest , the climate gets worse , poor people 's water supplies and field nutrients decline .
but we see these losses so gradually that we do n't realize that things are getting worse .
whereas in the case of the financial markets it 's one short , sharp shock .
nonetheless , a lot of smart money has started to flow into environmental investment .
in north america , the percentage of venture capital spent on clean technology used to be around 2 percent in 2002 , but had risen to 17 percent by 2007 .
is there a risk that environmental concerns will be abandoned given the current slowdown in the global economy ? i do n't think so , because people are beginning to get the message . i never have to explain myself twice any more .
even two years ago , people 's eyes would glaze over .
now people want to know what needs to be done .
of course , the cost of the financial crisis means there will now be increased distributional pressure on how much can be allocated to solving environmental problems .
but my point is that this money is not much , considering how much is spent on other sectors .
there 's no need to think about it too much .
the time is now .
how viable is a rescue plan like this during a recession , which is what we 're facing right now ?
a $ 45 billion gap per annum is not the end of the world .
look at how much has been lost and how much is being allocated individually by governments in the us and europe - up to $ 700 billion .
to put things in context , the investment per annum of the eu in conservation areas is about 6 billion euros .
these are modest sums .
so economic disaster does n't necessarily have to mean ecological disaster too ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the financial crisis is reported extensively - the environmental one is n't no .
venture capitalists have understood something that the world , generally , has not .
as other businesses begin using the technology into which venture capital has been invested , they will find amazing and sizeable opportunities .
i predict a tectonic shift in the way things are done .
renewable energy is an extraordinary opportunity if you use it not just to fix the supply that comes to you and me in berlin and london , but to fix the supply needed by the world 's 2 billion who do n't have an energy supply - the poorest people in the world who do not actually have energy coming to their homes in the form of oil , coal or electricity .
there are vast opportunities here , in countries like india and china , africa and latin america , to apply well-researched technologies which provide , for example , modular solutions to bring light into the poor home .
just imagine what kind of change you could see - education coming down to a village level , children staying up in order to read . think of the tectonic shift than can be achieved just by shifting focus and providing micro-finance to villagers to implement renewable energy solutions .
and look at the number of people who can benefit from that .
these are the sort of things that smart business is looking at .
there is money in making more efficient equipment and implementing more efficient processes .
does the credit crunch make people more aware that being careful with natural capital is important too ?
yes .
as the saying goes , a crisis is a terrible thing to waste . interview : jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 17.10.2008 loss of natural capital costs more than bank crisis , says expert großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the financial crisis has left us unable to see the wood for the trees as the eu discusses the affordability of its carbon-reduction targets , economist pavan sukhdev told dw-world.de that the best things in life are free , but not for much longer .
the nature crunch could prove costly . once described as an " economist by profession and an ecologist at heart , " pavan sukhdev holds the chair of deutsche bank 's global market center and is director of the green accounting for indian states project , a study on the economic significance of biodiversity in india .
he also heads an ongoing global report funded by the german ministry for the environment and the european commission on " the economics of ecosystems & biodiversity " -lrb- teeb -rrb- , and is among the architects of the green new deal , spearheaded by the united nations environment program , which will be unveiled in london on oct .
22 .
dw-world.de : you said at the world conservation congress in barcelona last week that the economic burden of environmentally hostile practices like deforestation outweighs that of the bank crisis .
pavan sukhdev : the capital loss to financial firms in the city and wall street has been estimated as $ 1 trillion to $ 1.5 trillion .
in teeb 's first phase report which we presented in may , we looked at the extent of losses taking place as a result of deforestation and degradation .
we estimated the loss in human welfare as a capital item , and worked out that this was $ 2 to $ 4.5 trillion per year , every year , for the last several years .
and it will continue , if we carry on with business as usual .
why is it that a one-off loss of $ 1.5 trillion in financial capital to a group of wall street firms attracts so much attention , whereas the ongoing loss per annum of twice this amount of natural capital is barely reported ?
we 've seen governments bail out the economy - what would a " bailout " for the environment look like ?
it would be comparatively modest .
let me give you a few indicating benchmarks .
today we have something like 100,000 conservation areas , covering some 10-11 percent of the earth 's land surface .
the teeb team believes that we are spending some $ 40-50 billion too little on making that conservation effective .
according to various estimates , these conservation areas produce some $ 4-5 trillion of utility per year .
today , spending on protected areas globally is less than $ 20 billion , and all we 're suggesting is an increase of another $ 50 billion a year to ensure the continuation of the benefits of these protected areas .
we 're not talking about a massive amount of money - single institutions have lost more than that in the current financial chaos .
but for various reasons it doesn ’ t get allocated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pavan sukhdev what are these reasons ?
for one , the loss of natural capital is a loss of public wealth .
eco-system services are public benefits that are pretty much free .
it is not individuals ' or shareholders ' wealth at stake , although it is , if you like , global shareholders ' wealth .
but it 's not private ownership , it 's public ownership .
these are things that are there for all to enjoy : we would dearly miss their absence and we would pay the earth to get them back , but right now , they 're free .
so the public nature of these goods and services is one reason .
to understand the second reason why loss of natural capital does n't grab headlines , we need to think of the frog analogy used by al gore in his book " an inconvenient truth " : if you put a frog in a beaker of water and gradually raise the temperature , it wo n't notice any change .
similarly , what is happening to us is happening continuously .
every year we lose forest , the climate gets worse , poor people 's water supplies and field nutrients decline .
but we see these losses so gradually that we do n't realize that things are getting worse .
whereas in the case of the financial markets it 's one short , sharp shock .
nonetheless , a lot of smart money has started to flow into environmental investment .
in north america , the percentage of venture capital spent on clean technology used to be around 2 percent in 2002 , but had risen to 17 percent by 2007 .
is there a risk that environmental concerns will be abandoned given the current slowdown in the global economy ? i do n't think so , because people are beginning to get the message . i never have to explain myself twice any more .
even two years ago , people 's eyes would glaze over .
now people want to know what needs to be done .
of course , the cost of the financial crisis means there will now be increased distributional pressure on how much can be allocated to solving environmental problems .
but my point is that this money is not much , considering how much is spent on other sectors .
there 's no need to think about it too much .
the time is now .
how viable is a rescue plan like this during a recession , which is what we 're facing right now ?
a $ 45 billion gap per annum is not the end of the world .
look at how much has been lost and how much is being allocated individually by governments in the us and europe - up to $ 700 billion .
to put things in context , the investment per annum of the eu in conservation areas is about 6 billion euros .
these are modest sums .
so economic disaster does n't necessarily have to mean ecological disaster too ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the financial crisis is reported extensively - the environmental one is n't no .
venture capitalists have understood something that the world , generally , has not .
as other businesses begin using the technology into which venture capital has been invested , they will find amazing and sizeable opportunities .
i predict a tectonic shift in the way things are done .
renewable energy is an extraordinary opportunity if you use it not just to fix the supply that comes to you and me in berlin and london , but to fix the supply needed by the world 's 2 billion who do n't have an energy supply - the poorest people in the world who do not actually have energy coming to their homes in the form of oil , coal or electricity .
there are vast opportunities here , in countries like india and china , africa and latin america , to apply well-researched technologies which provide , for example , modular solutions to bring light into the poor home .
just imagine what kind of change you could see - education coming down to a village level , children staying up in order to read . think of the tectonic shift than can be achieved just by shifting focus and providing micro-finance to villagers to implement renewable energy solutions .
and look at the number of people who can benefit from that .
these are the sort of things that smart business is looking at .
there is money in making more efficient equipment and implementing more efficient processes .
does the credit crunch make people more aware that being careful with natural capital is important too ?
yes .
as the saying goes , a crisis is a terrible thing to waste . interview : jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as world poverty day draws attention to the issue , dw 's dennis stute speaks with activist vandana shiva about india 's huge hunger levels . dr. vandana shiva is a physicist , ecologist , activist and author .
in india she has established navdanya , a movement for biodiversity conservation and farmers ' rights .
she also directs the research foundation for science , technology and natural resource policy .
the un has declared oct .
17 as the international day for the eradication of poverty . dw-world.de : how has the food crisis affected india ?
vandana shiva : very severely .
prices of staples have literally doubled in the last year and that has meant that the poor who were already only eating half of what they should be eating are now eating a quarter of what they should be .
unfortunately , it is the poor who must make a living by working physically and what we 're basically doing is robbing them of their ability to earn a living .
in addition , when children do n't get enough food to eat or when a mother is malnourished and she gives birth to a low birth-weight child , we are creating generations of people deprived of full mental health and full physical health .
according to a new report , there are " alarming " levels of hunger in 12 indian states and " serious " levels in the remaining five .
what , in your view , is the reason for the widespread malnutrition ?
there are two very big reasons why india has emerged as the capital of hunger .
the first is the “ green revolution ” model of agriculture , which was actually a hunger-creating model proposed as a hunger solution .
but when you destroy food sources in pulses , in vegetables , in grains , in oil seeds and create monocultures of rice and wheat , you destroy the millets - the nutritious grains that have 40 times higher level of nutrition - and call them inferior grains and push them to extinction .
on the ground , you have less food per unit acre and you have less nutrition access per capita .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gmo crops require more water and provide less nutritional value , says shiva the second is related to the new thrust of the 1991 policies of trade liberalization which instead of focusing on food for people focused on exports of luxury cash crops to rich countries , destroying india 's food security base .
this was trade-driven and really put food on the back burner then , treated as something you do n't need policy for .
the food situation is particularly bad in the state of madhya pradesh .
why is this state doing even worse than the others ?
the two reasons madhya pradesh is more severely affected than others is that it 's a large forest state and it 's largely a tribal state .
the food security of the tribals came from abundant forest products including edible products from the forest 's produce .
mining and industrialization is so rampant that tribals are losing their food resources .
it 's also the state where the drought impact because of climate change has been felt very severely .
bundelkhan has had a drought and rainfall failure for four years - there has been no cultivation at all .
and that 's partly because the agricultural model is based on new seeds like hybrid seeds which need chemicals .
but that 's the stupidest thing you could do because climate change requires adaption to drought which means planting crops that are resilient to drought - the millets that use only 250 millimeters of rain .
but unfortunately the government , driven by international agencies like the world bank , has walked on the wrong road for a period of market volatility and climate uncertainty .
the combination is a recipe for hunger and famine .
we need to shift our focus from global markets and global trades to local food security and away from export crops to growing food and nutrition for our people .
in the past ten years , more than 140,000 farmers in india have committed suicide according to official figures .
why is their situation so desperate ?
the first suicide came in 1997 .
when the impact of the new policies of liberalizing the seed sector started to get felt and corporations like monsanto , who wanted to sell genetically modified seed , entered the market .
they started to sell non renewable hybrid seeds which meant the farmers had to spent huge amounts of money buying seed every year .
these seeds also needed irrigation and were vulnerable to pests to the farmers had to spend more money putting in irrigation systems and buying pesticides .
that meant a higher debt burden on farmers .
falling prices of the products and rising costs of production squeezed the farmers even further into debt .
and that is what has led to the spate of suicides .
how can you tackle the problem of hunger ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting food into the hands of the poor is difficult due to heavy subsidies i think the most urgent steps to be taken to tackle the problem are to actually develop the farming systems to produce more food per unit acre .
every assumption of industrial agriculture is wrong because it does not produce more food but uses more chemicals and more water per unit acre .
it produces more commodities for international trade per unit acre but it does not produce more food or more nutrition per unit acre .
models of farming that can increase food-production fivefold , ten fold , depending on your climatic conditions have evolved through the organic movement .
those models of biodiverse , ecological systems can solve the problem of hunger .
the second thing that needs to be done is to bring back food-first policies .
in india after independence we have not had hunger on the scale we are now witnessing .
we had a famine in 1942 which killed two million people .
we had enough food in the country but the british were extracting every bit of rice from bengal and exporting it for profit - exporting it to finance the war .
we drove that famine away through public policy that put food first through a universal public distribution system that meant everyone has a right to affordable food .
that was dismantled by the world bank and it has to be resurrected .
the poor must have food at affordable price instead of subsidizing global corporations .
what the government has to do is to buy , preferably organics , from the indian farmers and then subsidize the prices for the poor .
we would save our financial budgets , we would save our taxes and we would have more food at lower prices .
india this year is spending one trillion rupees in subsidies for global corporations to buy chemical fertilizers .
that 's the wrong way to go .
we can lower costs of production , increase output per acre , increase equity and distribution .
that is food sovereignty .
that is food security .
that is food first . dennis stute -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the first is the “ green revolution ” model of agriculture , which was actually a hunger-creating model proposed as a hunger solution .
but when you destroy food sources in pulses , in vegetables , in grains , in oil seeds and create monocultures of rice and wheat , you destroy the millets - the nutritious grains that have 40 times higher level of nutrition - and call them inferior grains and push them to extinction .
on the ground , you have less food per unit acre and you have less nutrition access per capita .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gmo crops require more water and provide less nutritional value , says shiva the second is related to the new thrust of the 1991 policies of trade liberalization which instead of focusing on food for people focused on exports of luxury cash crops to rich countries , destroying india 's food security base .
this was trade-driven and really put food on the back burner then , treated as something you do n't need policy for .
the food situation is particularly bad in the state of madhya pradesh .
why is this state doing even worse than the others ?
the two reasons madhya pradesh is more severely affected than others is that it 's a large forest state and it 's largely a tribal state .
the food security of the tribals came from abundant forest products including edible products from the forest 's produce .
mining and industrialization is so rampant that tribals are losing their food resources .
it 's also the state where the drought impact because of climate change has been felt very severely .
bundelkhan has had a drought and rainfall failure for four years - there has been no cultivation at all .
and that 's partly because the agricultural model is based on new seeds like hybrid seeds which need chemicals .
but that 's the stupidest thing you could do because climate change requires adaption to drought which means planting crops that are resilient to drought - the millets that use only 250 millimeters of rain .
but unfortunately the government , driven by international agencies like the world bank , has walked on the wrong road for a period of market volatility and climate uncertainty .
the combination is a recipe for hunger and famine .
we need to shift our focus from global markets and global trades to local food security and away from export crops to growing food and nutrition for our people .
in the past ten years , more than 140,000 farmers in india have committed suicide according to official figures .
why is their situation so desperate ?
the first suicide came in 1997 .
when the impact of the new policies of liberalizing the seed sector started to get felt and corporations like monsanto , who wanted to sell genetically modified seed , entered the market .
they started to sell non renewable hybrid seeds which meant the farmers had to spent huge amounts of money buying seed every year .
these seeds also needed irrigation and were vulnerable to pests to the farmers had to spend more money putting in irrigation systems and buying pesticides .
that meant a higher debt burden on farmers .
falling prices of the products and rising costs of production squeezed the farmers even further into debt .
and that is what has led to the spate of suicides .
how can you tackle the problem of hunger ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting food into the hands of the poor is difficult due to heavy subsidies i think the most urgent steps to be taken to tackle the problem are to actually develop the farming systems to produce more food per unit acre .
every assumption of industrial agriculture is wrong because it does not produce more food but uses more chemicals and more water per unit acre .
it produces more commodities for international trade per unit acre but it does not produce more food or more nutrition per unit acre .
models of farming that can increase food-production fivefold , ten fold , depending on your climatic conditions have evolved through the organic movement .
those models of biodiverse , ecological systems can solve the problem of hunger .
the second thing that needs to be done is to bring back food-first policies .
in india after independence we have not had hunger on the scale we are now witnessing .
we had a famine in 1942 which killed two million people .
we had enough food in the country but the british were extracting every bit of rice from bengal and exporting it for profit - exporting it to finance the war .
we drove that famine away through public policy that put food first through a universal public distribution system that meant everyone has a right to affordable food .
that was dismantled by the world bank and it has to be resurrected .
the poor must have food at affordable price instead of subsidizing global corporations .
what the government has to do is to buy , preferably organics , from the indian farmers and then subsidize the prices for the poor .
we would save our financial budgets , we would save our taxes and we would have more food at lower prices .
india this year is spending one trillion rupees in subsidies for global corporations to buy chemical fertilizers .
that 's the wrong way to go .
we can lower costs of production , increase output per acre , increase equity and distribution .
that is food sovereignty .
that is food security .
that is food first . dennis stute -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the nature crunch could prove costly . once described as an " economist by profession and an ecologist at heart , " pavan sukhdev holds the chair of deutsche bank 's global market center and is director of the green accounting for indian states project , a study on the economic significance of biodiversity in india .
he also heads an ongoing global report funded by the german ministry for the environment and the european commission on " the economics of ecosystems & biodiversity " -lrb- teeb -rrb- , and is among the architects of the green new deal , spearheaded by the united nations environment program , which will be unveiled in london on oct .
22 .
dw-world.de : you said at the world conservation congress in barcelona last week that the economic burden of environmentally hostile practices like deforestation outweighs that of the bank crisis .
pavan sukhdev : the capital loss to financial firms in the city and wall street has been estimated as $ 1 trillion to $ 1.5 trillion .
in teeb 's first phase report which we presented in may , we looked at the extent of losses taking place as a result of deforestation and degradation .
we estimated the loss in human welfare as a capital item , and worked out that this was $ 2 to $ 4.5 trillion per year , every year , for the last several years .
and it will continue , if we carry on with business as usual .
why is it that a one-off loss of $ 1.5 trillion in financial capital to a group of wall street firms attracts so much attention , whereas the ongoing loss per annum of twice this amount of natural capital is barely reported ?
we 've seen governments bail out the economy - what would a " bailout " for the environment look like ?
it would be comparatively modest .
let me give you a few indicating benchmarks .
today we have something like 100,000 conservation areas , covering some 10-11 percent of the earth 's land surface .
the teeb team believes that we are spending some $ 40-50 billion too little on making that conservation effective .
according to various estimates , these conservation areas produce some $ 4-5 trillion of utility per year .
today , spending on protected areas globally is less than $ 20 billion , and all we 're suggesting is an increase of another $ 50 billion a year to ensure the continuation of the benefits of these protected areas .
we 're not talking about a massive amount of money - single institutions have lost more than that in the current financial chaos .
but for various reasons it doesn ’ t get allocated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pavan sukhdev what are these reasons ?
for one , the loss of natural capital is a loss of public wealth .
eco-system services are public benefits that are pretty much free .
it is not individuals ' or shareholders ' wealth at stake , although it is , if you like , global shareholders ' wealth .
but it 's not private ownership , it 's public ownership .
these are things that are there for all to enjoy : we would dearly miss their absence and we would pay the earth to get them back , but right now , they 're free .
so the public nature of these goods and services is one reason .
to understand the second reason why loss of natural capital does n't grab headlines , we need to think of the frog analogy used by al gore in his book " an inconvenient truth " : if you put a frog in a beaker of water and gradually raise the temperature , it wo n't notice any change .
similarly , what is happening to us is happening continuously .
every year we lose forest , the climate gets worse , poor people 's water supplies and field nutrients decline .
but we see these losses so gradually that we do n't realize that things are getting worse .
whereas in the case of the financial markets it 's one short , sharp shock .
nonetheless , a lot of smart money has started to flow into environmental investment .
in north america , the percentage of venture capital spent on clean technology used to be around 2 percent in 2002 , but had risen to 17 percent by 2007 .
is there a risk that environmental concerns will be abandoned given the current slowdown in the global economy ? i do n't think so , because people are beginning to get the message . i never have to explain myself twice any more .
even two years ago , people 's eyes would glaze over .
now people want to know what needs to be done .
of course , the cost of the financial crisis means there will now be increased distributional pressure on how much can be allocated to solving environmental problems .
but my point is that this money is not much , considering how much is spent on other sectors .
there 's no need to think about it too much .
the time is now .
how viable is a rescue plan like this during a recession , which is what we 're facing right now ?
a $ 45 billion gap per annum is not the end of the world .
look at how much has been lost and how much is being allocated individually by governments in the us and europe - up to $ 700 billion .
to put things in context , the investment per annum of the eu in conservation areas is about 6 billion euros .
these are modest sums .
so economic disaster does n't necessarily have to mean ecological disaster too ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the financial crisis is reported extensively - the environmental one is n't no .
venture capitalists have understood something that the world , generally , has not .
as other businesses begin using the technology into which venture capital has been invested , they will find amazing and sizeable opportunities .
i predict a tectonic shift in the way things are done .
renewable energy is an extraordinary opportunity if you use it not just to fix the supply that comes to you and me in berlin and london , but to fix the supply needed by the world 's 2 billion who do n't have an energy supply - the poorest people in the world who do not actually have energy coming to their homes in the form of oil , coal or electricity .
there are vast opportunities here , in countries like india and china , africa and latin america , to apply well-researched technologies which provide , for example , modular solutions to bring light into the poor home .
just imagine what kind of change you could see - education coming down to a village level , children staying up in order to read . think of the tectonic shift than can be achieved just by shifting focus and providing micro-finance to villagers to implement renewable energy solutions .
and look at the number of people who can benefit from that .
these are the sort of things that smart business is looking at .
there is money in making more efficient equipment and implementing more efficient processes .
does the credit crunch make people more aware that being careful with natural capital is important too ?
yes .
as the saying goes , a crisis is a terrible thing to waste . interview : jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the nature crunch could prove costly . once described as an " economist by profession and an ecologist at heart , " pavan sukhdev holds the chair of deutsche bank 's global market center and is director of the green accounting for indian states project , a study on the economic significance of biodiversity in india .
he also heads an ongoing global report funded by the german ministry for the environment and the european commission on " the economics of ecosystems & biodiversity " -lrb- teeb -rrb- , and is among the architects of the green new deal , spearheaded by the united nations environment program , which will be unveiled in london on oct .
22 .
dw-world.de : you said at the world conservation congress in barcelona last week that the economic burden of environmentally hostile practices like deforestation outweighs that of the bank crisis .
pavan sukhdev : the capital loss to financial firms in the city and wall street has been estimated as $ 1 trillion to $ 1.5 trillion .
in teeb 's first phase report which we presented in may , we looked at the extent of losses taking place as a result of deforestation and degradation .
we estimated the loss in human welfare as a capital item , and worked out that this was $ 2 to $ 4.5 trillion per year , every year , for the last several years .
and it will continue , if we carry on with business as usual .
why is it that a one-off loss of $ 1.5 trillion in financial capital to a group of wall street firms attracts so much attention , whereas the ongoing loss per annum of twice this amount of natural capital is barely reported ?
we 've seen governments bail out the economy - what would a " bailout " for the environment look like ?
it would be comparatively modest .
let me give you a few indicating benchmarks .
today we have something like 100,000 conservation areas , covering some 10-11 percent of the earth 's land surface .
the teeb team believes that we are spending some $ 40-50 billion too little on making that conservation effective .
according to various estimates , these conservation areas produce some $ 4-5 trillion of utility per year .
today , spending on protected areas globally is less than $ 20 billion , and all we 're suggesting is an increase of another $ 50 billion a year to ensure the continuation of the benefits of these protected areas .
we 're not talking about a massive amount of money - single institutions have lost more than that in the current financial chaos .
but for various reasons it doesn ’ t get allocated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pavan sukhdev what are these reasons ?
for one , the loss of natural capital is a loss of public wealth .
eco-system services are public benefits that are pretty much free .
it is not individuals ' or shareholders ' wealth at stake , although it is , if you like , global shareholders ' wealth .
but it 's not private ownership , it 's public ownership .
these are things that are there for all to enjoy : we would dearly miss their absence and we would pay the earth to get them back , but right now , they 're free .
so the public nature of these goods and services is one reason .
to understand the second reason why loss of natural capital does n't grab headlines , we need to think of the frog analogy used by al gore in his book " an inconvenient truth " : if you put a frog in a beaker of water and gradually raise the temperature , it wo n't notice any change .
similarly , what is happening to us is happening continuously .
every year we lose forest , the climate gets worse , poor people 's water supplies and field nutrients decline .
but we see these losses so gradually that we do n't realize that things are getting worse .
whereas in the case of the financial markets it 's one short , sharp shock .
nonetheless , a lot of smart money has started to flow into environmental investment .
in north america , the percentage of venture capital spent on clean technology used to be around 2 percent in 2002 , but had risen to 17 percent by 2007 .
is there a risk that environmental concerns will be abandoned given the current slowdown in the global economy ? i do n't think so , because people are beginning to get the message . i never have to explain myself twice any more .

will books as we know them soon be a thing of the past ?
a new generation of digital " e-readers " has the german publishing industry gearing up for a fast-moving digital future . electronic books were announced as the " next big thing " a decade ago .
but the technology that came out at the time failed to impress consumers , and made few inroads into the market .
now some new e-readers , predicted to be put on the market in europe in the near future , have publishing industry insiders preparing for major changes .
lightweight devices like amazon 's kindle and the sony reader have been the focus of intense interest since they celebrated their german coming-out party at the frankfurt book fair , which runs through oct .
19 .
e-books - stars of the frankfurt fair the press toasted the new readers as the " true stars " of this year 's fair .
but considering the changes they could represent for the staid publishing industry , players are eyeing them with a mixture of fascination and fear .
" overall , i think german publishers are very enthusiastic about e-books , " said thomas wilking , editor in chief of the german publishing trade magazine buchreport .
" they are just waiting for a device they think is attractive enough for a wide public . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sony is hoping its reader will impress europeans book fair organizers took an unscientific survey of 1,000 industry players on the future of the new technology , and published it just before the fair opened .
unfortunately , the data failed to paint any clear road map for the future .
more than 70 percent of respondents said they were ready for the digital challenge - but 60 percent of them had neither used e-readers nor downloaded e-books themselves .
meanwhile , a full 40 percent said they expect e-content to dominate the market by 2018 - compared with one-third of respondents who said e-books will never take over .
12 percent thought the new e-readers would be a short-lived flash in the pan .
' you could take 50 books to the beach ' jak boumans , a dutch media-content consultant who runs his own firm , electronic media reporting , is convinced e-books are here to stay .
but he estimates it will be at least 2030 before they are in wide usage , considering how many details still need to be ironed out , and how ingrained peoples ' attitudes are towards reading .
" this has been a topic for the last 30 years , but the mentality is still trying to catch up with the technology , " boumans said .
" e-readers mean people could go on holiday without packing a stack of heavy books - they can take 50 books with them in one device and still read it on the beach . "
observers praise the kindle and reader as being significantly improved from the last devices that tried to storm the market but failed .
the new devices have extended their battery life and traded the backlit computer screen for a paper-simulating " e-paper " that is less hard on the eyes .
the ritual of turning pages some book lovers wonder if an electronic device will ever really replace paper books , however .
johann schumandl , owner of a small independent book store in cologne , said he thinks people might accept e-readers for reading work documents .
but printed books will never disappear completely : " when you read a book you have the sense of touch , the haptic value , " he said .
" there is something ritualistic about reading a book , turning the pages . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : which e-reader will capture the market ?
boumans agrees that casual readers - who he refers to as " ink sniffers " - will be the last group to make the switch .
but he believes a new generation of people who grew up using ipods will see things differently .
" the only question they are going to have is , ' how many functions will this device combine for me ? " ' he said .
people have been predicting the demise of the bookstore for a long time now , and many now think e-books and e-readers could deliver the coup de grace .
twenty-five percent of respondents to the book fair study thought bookstores would largely disappear within half a century , with online distribution of paper books by firms such as amazon taking over .
copyright quandary some european bookstores seem to be trying to get ahead of the curve by being the first to promote e-books .
top german chain bookstore thalia struck a deal with sony to sell content for its reader devices in thalia stores and online .
assuming e-books do take hold , there are still many questions to be answered .
which reader - amazon 's , sony 's , or perhaps one from a european competitor , like the netherlands ' iliad - will capture the public 's fancy ?
each one has slightly different technical specifications , and is based on different technical platforms .
another big question is how the industry will deal with copyright protection .
some employ digital rights management -lrb- drm , -rrb- a kind of software lock on downloadable books , with the aim of avoiding the music industry 's fate .
since the advent of digital music , record companies have famously seen profits decimated by piracy and illegal downloading .
boumans opposes technological protection on content .
he supports the concept of a " social drm , " which would operate under a " name and shame " system : when a person buys electronic data , his or her name is attached to the file so anyone can see how it is passed around after that .
social pressure would correct the market .
' the ipod principle ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazon 's kindle is a big seller in the us ultimately , boumans says four things need to be in place before e-books really take off : a device , a portfolio of downloadable material , the download service - and the right price for content .
" that 's when you get what i call the ipod principle , " he said .
" people start downloading things and they are willing to pay for it . "
clearly it is difficult to imagine exactly what shape the digital-literature future will take .
according to buchreport editor wilking , the future may be even more unrecognizable than we can imagine .
for one thing , books may cease to be a collection of words on paper - or even e-paper .
" there are a lot of possibilities when it comes to e-publishing , " wilking said .
" people will be able to build in films and interactive elements .
things we ca n't even imagine yet . "
once these technical possibilities are there , he says , then the authors might start taking them into consideration , and writing for multimedia instead of just the page . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

22 .
dw-world.de : you said at the world conservation congress in barcelona last week that the economic burden of environmentally hostile practices like deforestation outweighs that of the bank crisis .
pavan sukhdev : the capital loss to financial firms in the city and wall street has been estimated as $ 1 trillion to $ 1.5 trillion .

we 're not talking about a massive amount of money - single institutions have lost more than that in the current financial chaos .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pavan sukhdev what are these reasons ?
for one , the loss of natural capital is a loss of public wealth .

so the public nature of these goods and services is one reason .
to understand the second reason why loss of natural capital does n't grab headlines , we need to think of the frog analogy used by al gore in his book " an inconvenient truth " : if you put a frog in a beaker of water and gradually raise the temperature , it wo n't notice any change .
similarly , what is happening to us is happening continuously .
every year we lose forest , the climate gets worse , poor people 's water supplies and field nutrients decline .
but we see these losses so gradually that we do n't realize that things are getting worse .
whereas in the case of the financial markets it 's one short , sharp shock .
nonetheless , a lot of smart money has started to flow into environmental investment .
in north america , the percentage of venture capital spent on clean technology used to be around 2 percent in 2002 , but had risen to 17 percent by 2007 .
is there a risk that environmental concerns will be abandoned given the current slowdown in the global economy ? i do n't think so , because people are beginning to get the message . i never have to explain myself twice any more .
even two years ago , people 's eyes would glaze over .
now people want to know what needs to be done .
of course , the cost of the financial crisis means there will now be increased distributional pressure on how much can be allocated to solving environmental problems .
but my point is that this money is not much , considering how much is spent on other sectors .
there 's no need to think about it too much .
the time is now .
how viable is a rescue plan like this during a recession , which is what we 're facing right now ?
a $ 45 billion gap per annum is not the end of the world .
look at how much has been lost and how much is being allocated individually by governments in the us and europe - up to $ 700 billion .
to put things in context , the investment per annum of the eu in conservation areas is about 6 billion euros .
these are modest sums .
so economic disaster does n't necessarily have to mean ecological disaster too ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the financial crisis is reported extensively - the environmental one is n't no .
venture capitalists have understood something that the world , generally , has not .
as other businesses begin using the technology into which venture capital has been invested , they will find amazing and sizeable opportunities .
i predict a tectonic shift in the way things are done .
renewable energy is an extraordinary opportunity if you use it not just to fix the supply that comes to you and me in berlin and london , but to fix the supply needed by the world 's 2 billion who do n't have an energy supply - the poorest people in the world who do not actually have energy coming to their homes in the form of oil , coal or electricity .
there are vast opportunities here , in countries like india and china , africa and latin america , to apply well-researched technologies which provide , for example , modular solutions to bring light into the poor home .
just imagine what kind of change you could see - education coming down to a village level , children staying up in order to read . think of the tectonic shift than can be achieved just by shifting focus and providing micro-finance to villagers to implement renewable energy solutions .
and look at the number of people who can benefit from that .

the nature crunch could prove costly . once described as an " economist by profession and an ecologist at heart , " pavan sukhdev holds the chair of deutsche bank 's global market center and is director of the green accounting for indian states project , a study on the economic significance of biodiversity in india .
he also heads an ongoing global report funded by the german ministry for the environment and the european commission on " the economics of ecosystems & biodiversity " -lrb- teeb -rrb- , and is among the architects of the green new deal , spearheaded by the united nations environment program , which will be unveiled in london on oct .
22 .
dw-world.de : you said at the world conservation congress in barcelona last week that the economic burden of environmentally hostile practices like deforestation outweighs that of the bank crisis .
pavan sukhdev : the capital loss to financial firms in the city and wall street has been estimated as $ 1 trillion to $ 1.5 trillion .
in teeb 's first phase report which we presented in may , we looked at the extent of losses taking place as a result of deforestation and degradation .
we estimated the loss in human welfare as a capital item , and worked out that this was $ 2 to $ 4.5 trillion per year , every year , for the last several years .
and it will continue , if we carry on with business as usual .
why is it that a one-off loss of $ 1.5 trillion in financial capital to a group of wall street firms attracts so much attention , whereas the ongoing loss per annum of twice this amount of natural capital is barely reported ?
we 've seen governments bail out the economy - what would a " bailout " for the environment look like ?
it would be comparatively modest .
let me give you a few indicating benchmarks .
today we have something like 100,000 conservation areas , covering some 10-11 percent of the earth 's land surface .
the teeb team believes that we are spending some $ 40-50 billion too little on making that conservation effective .
according to various estimates , these conservation areas produce some $ 4-5 trillion of utility per year .
today , spending on protected areas globally is less than $ 20 billion , and all we 're suggesting is an increase of another $ 50 billion a year to ensure the continuation of the benefits of these protected areas .
we 're not talking about a massive amount of money - single institutions have lost more than that in the current financial chaos .
but for various reasons it doesn ’ t get allocated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pavan sukhdev what are these reasons ?
for one , the loss of natural capital is a loss of public wealth .
eco-system services are public benefits that are pretty much free .
it is not individuals ' or shareholders ' wealth at stake , although it is , if you like , global shareholders ' wealth .
but it 's not private ownership , it 's public ownership .
these are things that are there for all to enjoy : we would dearly miss their absence and we would pay the earth to get them back , but right now , they 're free .
so the public nature of these goods and services is one reason .
to understand the second reason why loss of natural capital does n't grab headlines , we need to think of the frog analogy used by al gore in his book " an inconvenient truth " : if you put a frog in a beaker of water and gradually raise the temperature , it wo n't notice any change .
similarly , what is happening to us is happening continuously .
every year we lose forest , the climate gets worse , poor people 's water supplies and field nutrients decline .
but we see these losses so gradually that we do n't realize that things are getting worse .
whereas in the case of the financial markets it 's one short , sharp shock .
nonetheless , a lot of smart money has started to flow into environmental investment .
in north america , the percentage of venture capital spent on clean technology used to be around 2 percent in 2002 , but had risen to 17 percent by 2007 .
is there a risk that environmental concerns will be abandoned given the current slowdown in the global economy ? i do n't think so , because people are beginning to get the message . i never have to explain myself twice any more .
even two years ago , people 's eyes would glaze over .
now people want to know what needs to be done .
of course , the cost of the financial crisis means there will now be increased distributional pressure on how much can be allocated to solving environmental problems .
but my point is that this money is not much , considering how much is spent on other sectors .
there 's no need to think about it too much .
the time is now .
how viable is a rescue plan like this during a recession , which is what we 're facing right now ?
a $ 45 billion gap per annum is not the end of the world .
look at how much has been lost and how much is being allocated individually by governments in the us and europe - up to $ 700 billion .
to put things in context , the investment per annum of the eu in conservation areas is about 6 billion euros .
these are modest sums .
so economic disaster does n't necessarily have to mean ecological disaster too ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the financial crisis is reported extensively - the environmental one is n't no .
venture capitalists have understood something that the world , generally , has not .
as other businesses begin using the technology into which venture capital has been invested , they will find amazing and sizeable opportunities .
i predict a tectonic shift in the way things are done .
renewable energy is an extraordinary opportunity if you use it not just to fix the supply that comes to you and me in berlin and london , but to fix the supply needed by the world 's 2 billion who do n't have an energy supply - the poorest people in the world who do not actually have energy coming to their homes in the form of oil , coal or electricity .
there are vast opportunities here , in countries like india and china , africa and latin america , to apply well-researched technologies which provide , for example , modular solutions to bring light into the poor home .
just imagine what kind of change you could see - education coming down to a village level , children staying up in order to read . think of the tectonic shift than can be achieved just by shifting focus and providing micro-finance to villagers to implement renewable energy solutions .
and look at the number of people who can benefit from that .
these are the sort of things that smart business is looking at .
there is money in making more efficient equipment and implementing more efficient processes .
does the credit crunch make people more aware that being careful with natural capital is important too ?
yes .

will books as we know them soon be a thing of the past ?
a new generation of digital " e-readers " has the german publishing industry gearing up for a fast-moving digital future . electronic books were announced as the " next big thing " a decade ago .
but the technology that came out at the time failed to impress consumers , and made few inroads into the market .
now some new e-readers , predicted to be put on the market in europe in the near future , have publishing industry insiders preparing for major changes .
lightweight devices like amazon 's kindle and the sony reader have been the focus of intense interest since they celebrated their german coming-out party at the frankfurt book fair , which runs through oct .
19 .
e-books - stars of the frankfurt fair the press toasted the new readers as the " true stars " of this year 's fair .
but considering the changes they could represent for the staid publishing industry , players are eyeing them with a mixture of fascination and fear .
" overall , i think german publishers are very enthusiastic about e-books , " said thomas wilking , editor in chief of the german publishing trade magazine buchreport .
" they are just waiting for a device they think is attractive enough for a wide public . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sony is hoping its reader will impress europeans book fair organizers took an unscientific survey of 1,000 industry players on the future of the new technology , and published it just before the fair opened .
unfortunately , the data failed to paint any clear road map for the future .
more than 70 percent of respondents said they were ready for the digital challenge - but 60 percent of them had neither used e-readers nor downloaded e-books themselves .
meanwhile , a full 40 percent said they expect e-content to dominate the market by 2018 - compared with one-third of respondents who said e-books will never take over .
12 percent thought the new e-readers would be a short-lived flash in the pan .
' you could take 50 books to the beach ' jak boumans , a dutch media-content consultant who runs his own firm , electronic media reporting , is convinced e-books are here to stay .
but he estimates it will be at least 2030 before they are in wide usage , considering how many details still need to be ironed out , and how ingrained peoples ' attitudes are towards reading .
" this has been a topic for the last 30 years , but the mentality is still trying to catch up with the technology , " boumans said .
" e-readers mean people could go on holiday without packing a stack of heavy books - they can take 50 books with them in one device and still read it on the beach . "
observers praise the kindle and reader as being significantly improved from the last devices that tried to storm the market but failed .
the new devices have extended their battery life and traded the backlit computer screen for a paper-simulating " e-paper " that is less hard on the eyes .
the ritual of turning pages some book lovers wonder if an electronic device will ever really replace paper books , however .
johann schumandl , owner of a small independent book store in cologne , said he thinks people might accept e-readers for reading work documents .
but printed books will never disappear completely : " when you read a book you have the sense of touch , the haptic value , " he said .
" there is something ritualistic about reading a book , turning the pages . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : which e-reader will capture the market ?
boumans agrees that casual readers - who he refers to as " ink sniffers " - will be the last group to make the switch .
but he believes a new generation of people who grew up using ipods will see things differently .
" the only question they are going to have is , ' how many functions will this device combine for me ? " ' he said .
people have been predicting the demise of the bookstore for a long time now , and many now think e-books and e-readers could deliver the coup de grace .
twenty-five percent of respondents to the book fair study thought bookstores would largely disappear within half a century , with online distribution of paper books by firms such as amazon taking over .
copyright quandary some european bookstores seem to be trying to get ahead of the curve by being the first to promote e-books .
top german chain bookstore thalia struck a deal with sony to sell content for its reader devices in thalia stores and online .
assuming e-books do take hold , there are still many questions to be answered .
which reader - amazon 's , sony 's , or perhaps one from a european competitor , like the netherlands ' iliad - will capture the public 's fancy ?
each one has slightly different technical specifications , and is based on different technical platforms .
another big question is how the industry will deal with copyright protection .
some employ digital rights management -lrb- drm , -rrb- a kind of software lock on downloadable books , with the aim of avoiding the music industry 's fate .
since the advent of digital music , record companies have famously seen profits decimated by piracy and illegal downloading .
boumans opposes technological protection on content .
he supports the concept of a " social drm , " which would operate under a " name and shame " system : when a person buys electronic data , his or her name is attached to the file so anyone can see how it is passed around after that .
social pressure would correct the market .
' the ipod principle ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazon 's kindle is a big seller in the us ultimately , boumans says four things need to be in place before e-books really take off : a device , a portfolio of downloadable material , the download service - and the right price for content .
" that 's when you get what i call the ipod principle , " he said .
" people start downloading things and they are willing to pay for it . "
clearly it is difficult to imagine exactly what shape the digital-literature future will take .
according to buchreport editor wilking , the future may be even more unrecognizable than we can imagine .
for one thing , books may cease to be a collection of words on paper - or even e-paper .
" there are a lot of possibilities when it comes to e-publishing , " wilking said .
" people will be able to build in films and interactive elements .
things we ca n't even imagine yet . "
once these technical possibilities are there , he says , then the authors might start taking them into consideration , and writing for multimedia instead of just the page . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

more than 70 percent of respondents said they were ready for the digital challenge - but 60 percent of them had neither used e-readers nor downloaded e-books themselves .
meanwhile , a full 40 percent said they expect e-content to dominate the market by 2018 - compared with one-third of respondents who said e-books will never take over .
12 percent thought the new e-readers would be a short-lived flash in the pan .
' you could take 50 books to the beach ' jak boumans , a dutch media-content consultant who runs his own firm , electronic media reporting , is convinced e-books are here to stay .
but he estimates it will be at least 2030 before they are in wide usage , considering how many details still need to be ironed out , and how ingrained peoples ' attitudes are towards reading .
" this has been a topic for the last 30 years , but the mentality is still trying to catch up with the technology , " boumans said .
" e-readers mean people could go on holiday without packing a stack of heavy books - they can take 50 books with them in one device and still read it on the beach . "
observers praise the kindle and reader as being significantly improved from the last devices that tried to storm the market but failed .
the new devices have extended their battery life and traded the backlit computer screen for a paper-simulating " e-paper " that is less hard on the eyes .
the ritual of turning pages some book lovers wonder if an electronic device will ever really replace paper books , however .
johann schumandl , owner of a small independent book store in cologne , said he thinks people might accept e-readers for reading work documents .
but printed books will never disappear completely : " when you read a book you have the sense of touch , the haptic value , " he said .
" there is something ritualistic about reading a book , turning the pages . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : which e-reader will capture the market ?
boumans agrees that casual readers - who he refers to as " ink sniffers " - will be the last group to make the switch .
but he believes a new generation of people who grew up using ipods will see things differently .
" the only question they are going to have is , ' how many functions will this device combine for me ? " ' he said .
people have been predicting the demise of the bookstore for a long time now , and many now think e-books and e-readers could deliver the coup de grace .
twenty-five percent of respondents to the book fair study thought bookstores would largely disappear within half a century , with online distribution of paper books by firms such as amazon taking over .
copyright quandary some european bookstores seem to be trying to get ahead of the curve by being the first to promote e-books .
top german chain bookstore thalia struck a deal with sony to sell content for its reader devices in thalia stores and online .
assuming e-books do take hold , there are still many questions to be answered .
which reader - amazon 's , sony 's , or perhaps one from a european competitor , like the netherlands ' iliad - will capture the public 's fancy ?
each one has slightly different technical specifications , and is based on different technical platforms .
another big question is how the industry will deal with copyright protection .
some employ digital rights management -lrb- drm , -rrb- a kind of software lock on downloadable books , with the aim of avoiding the music industry 's fate .
since the advent of digital music , record companies have famously seen profits decimated by piracy and illegal downloading .
boumans opposes technological protection on content .
he supports the concept of a " social drm , " which would operate under a " name and shame " system : when a person buys electronic data , his or her name is attached to the file so anyone can see how it is passed around after that .
social pressure would correct the market .
' the ipod principle ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazon 's kindle is a big seller in the us ultimately , boumans says four things need to be in place before e-books really take off : a device , a portfolio of downloadable material , the download service - and the right price for content .
" that 's when you get what i call the ipod principle , " he said .
" people start downloading things and they are willing to pay for it . "
clearly it is difficult to imagine exactly what shape the digital-literature future will take .
according to buchreport editor wilking , the future may be even more unrecognizable than we can imagine .
for one thing , books may cease to be a collection of words on paper - or even e-paper .
" there are a lot of possibilities when it comes to e-publishing , " wilking said .
" people will be able to build in films and interactive elements .
things we ca n't even imagine yet . "
once these technical possibilities are there , he says , then the authors might start taking them into consideration , and writing for multimedia instead of just the page . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a new generation of digital " e-readers " has the german publishing industry gearing up for a fast-moving digital future . electronic books were announced as the " next big thing " a decade ago .
but the technology that came out at the time failed to impress consumers , and made few inroads into the market .
now some new e-readers , predicted to be put on the market in europe in the near future , have publishing industry insiders preparing for major changes .
lightweight devices like amazon 's kindle and the sony reader have been the focus of intense interest since they celebrated their german coming-out party at the frankfurt book fair , which runs through oct .

since the advent of digital music , record companies have famously seen profits decimated by piracy and illegal downloading .
boumans opposes technological protection on content .
he supports the concept of a " social drm , " which would operate under a " name and shame " system : when a person buys electronic data , his or her name is attached to the file so anyone can see how it is passed around after that .
social pressure would correct the market .
' the ipod principle ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazon 's kindle is a big seller in the us ultimately , boumans says four things need to be in place before e-books really take off : a device , a portfolio of downloadable material , the download service - and the right price for content .
" that 's when you get what i call the ipod principle , " he said .
" people start downloading things and they are willing to pay for it . "
clearly it is difficult to imagine exactly what shape the digital-literature future will take .
according to buchreport editor wilking , the future may be even more unrecognizable than we can imagine .
for one thing , books may cease to be a collection of words on paper - or even e-paper .
" there are a lot of possibilities when it comes to e-publishing , " wilking said .
" people will be able to build in films and interactive elements .
things we ca n't even imagine yet . "
once these technical possibilities are there , he says , then the authors might start taking them into consideration , and writing for multimedia instead of just the page . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as world poverty day draws attention to the issue , dw 's dennis stute speaks with activist vandana shiva about india 's huge hunger levels . dr. vandana shiva is a physicist , ecologist , activist and author .
in india she has established navdanya , a movement for biodiversity conservation and farmers ' rights .
she also directs the research foundation for science , technology and natural resource policy .
the un has declared oct .
17 as the international day for the eradication of poverty . dw-world.de : how has the food crisis affected india ?
vandana shiva : very severely .
prices of staples have literally doubled in the last year and that has meant that the poor who were already only eating half of what they should be eating are now eating a quarter of what they should be .
unfortunately , it is the poor who must make a living by working physically and what we 're basically doing is robbing them of their ability to earn a living .
in addition , when children do n't get enough food to eat or when a mother is malnourished and she gives birth to a low birth-weight child , we are creating generations of people deprived of full mental health and full physical health .
according to a new report , there are " alarming " levels of hunger in 12 indian states and " serious " levels in the remaining five .
what , in your view , is the reason for the widespread malnutrition ?
there are two very big reasons why india has emerged as the capital of hunger .
the first is the “ green revolution ” model of agriculture , which was actually a hunger-creating model proposed as a hunger solution .
but when you destroy food sources in pulses , in vegetables , in grains , in oil seeds and create monocultures of rice and wheat , you destroy the millets - the nutritious grains that have 40 times higher level of nutrition - and call them inferior grains and push them to extinction .
on the ground , you have less food per unit acre and you have less nutrition access per capita .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gmo crops require more water and provide less nutritional value , says shiva the second is related to the new thrust of the 1991 policies of trade liberalization which instead of focusing on food for people focused on exports of luxury cash crops to rich countries , destroying india 's food security base .
this was trade-driven and really put food on the back burner then , treated as something you do n't need policy for .
the food situation is particularly bad in the state of madhya pradesh .
why is this state doing even worse than the others ?
the two reasons madhya pradesh is more severely affected than others is that it 's a large forest state and it 's largely a tribal state .
the food security of the tribals came from abundant forest products including edible products from the forest 's produce .
mining and industrialization is so rampant that tribals are losing their food resources .
it 's also the state where the drought impact because of climate change has been felt very severely .
bundelkhan has had a drought and rainfall failure for four years - there has been no cultivation at all .
and that 's partly because the agricultural model is based on new seeds like hybrid seeds which need chemicals .
but that 's the stupidest thing you could do because climate change requires adaption to drought which means planting crops that are resilient to drought - the millets that use only 250 millimeters of rain .
but unfortunately the government , driven by international agencies like the world bank , has walked on the wrong road for a period of market volatility and climate uncertainty .
the combination is a recipe for hunger and famine .
we need to shift our focus from global markets and global trades to local food security and away from export crops to growing food and nutrition for our people .
in the past ten years , more than 140,000 farmers in india have committed suicide according to official figures .
why is their situation so desperate ?
the first suicide came in 1997 .
when the impact of the new policies of liberalizing the seed sector started to get felt and corporations like monsanto , who wanted to sell genetically modified seed , entered the market .
they started to sell non renewable hybrid seeds which meant the farmers had to spent huge amounts of money buying seed every year .
these seeds also needed irrigation and were vulnerable to pests to the farmers had to spend more money putting in irrigation systems and buying pesticides .
that meant a higher debt burden on farmers .
falling prices of the products and rising costs of production squeezed the farmers even further into debt .
and that is what has led to the spate of suicides .
how can you tackle the problem of hunger ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting food into the hands of the poor is difficult due to heavy subsidies i think the most urgent steps to be taken to tackle the problem are to actually develop the farming systems to produce more food per unit acre .
every assumption of industrial agriculture is wrong because it does not produce more food but uses more chemicals and more water per unit acre .
it produces more commodities for international trade per unit acre but it does not produce more food or more nutrition per unit acre .
models of farming that can increase food-production fivefold , ten fold , depending on your climatic conditions have evolved through the organic movement .
those models of biodiverse , ecological systems can solve the problem of hunger .
the second thing that needs to be done is to bring back food-first policies .
in india after independence we have not had hunger on the scale we are now witnessing .
we had a famine in 1942 which killed two million people .
we had enough food in the country but the british were extracting every bit of rice from bengal and exporting it for profit - exporting it to finance the war .
we drove that famine away through public policy that put food first through a universal public distribution system that meant everyone has a right to affordable food .
that was dismantled by the world bank and it has to be resurrected .
the poor must have food at affordable price instead of subsidizing global corporations .
what the government has to do is to buy , preferably organics , from the indian farmers and then subsidize the prices for the poor .
we would save our financial budgets , we would save our taxes and we would have more food at lower prices .
india this year is spending one trillion rupees in subsidies for global corporations to buy chemical fertilizers .
that 's the wrong way to go .
we can lower costs of production , increase output per acre , increase equity and distribution .
that is food sovereignty .
that is food security .
that is food first . dennis stute -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as world poverty day draws attention to the issue , dw 's dennis stute speaks with activist vandana shiva about india 's huge hunger levels . dr. vandana shiva is a physicist , ecologist , activist and author .
in india she has established navdanya , a movement for biodiversity conservation and farmers ' rights .
she also directs the research foundation for science , technology and natural resource policy .
the un has declared oct .
17 as the international day for the eradication of poverty . dw-world.de : how has the food crisis affected india ?
vandana shiva : very severely .
prices of staples have literally doubled in the last year and that has meant that the poor who were already only eating half of what they should be eating are now eating a quarter of what they should be .
unfortunately , it is the poor who must make a living by working physically and what we 're basically doing is robbing them of their ability to earn a living .
in addition , when children do n't get enough food to eat or when a mother is malnourished and she gives birth to a low birth-weight child , we are creating generations of people deprived of full mental health and full physical health .
according to a new report , there are " alarming " levels of hunger in 12 indian states and " serious " levels in the remaining five .
what , in your view , is the reason for the widespread malnutrition ?
there are two very big reasons why india has emerged as the capital of hunger .
the first is the “ green revolution ” model of agriculture , which was actually a hunger-creating model proposed as a hunger solution .
but when you destroy food sources in pulses , in vegetables , in grains , in oil seeds and create monocultures of rice and wheat , you destroy the millets - the nutritious grains that have 40 times higher level of nutrition - and call them inferior grains and push them to extinction .
on the ground , you have less food per unit acre and you have less nutrition access per capita .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gmo crops require more water and provide less nutritional value , says shiva the second is related to the new thrust of the 1991 policies of trade liberalization which instead of focusing on food for people focused on exports of luxury cash crops to rich countries , destroying india 's food security base .
this was trade-driven and really put food on the back burner then , treated as something you do n't need policy for .
the food situation is particularly bad in the state of madhya pradesh .
why is this state doing even worse than the others ?
the two reasons madhya pradesh is more severely affected than others is that it 's a large forest state and it 's largely a tribal state .
the food security of the tribals came from abundant forest products including edible products from the forest 's produce .
mining and industrialization is so rampant that tribals are losing their food resources .
it 's also the state where the drought impact because of climate change has been felt very severely .
bundelkhan has had a drought and rainfall failure for four years - there has been no cultivation at all .
and that 's partly because the agricultural model is based on new seeds like hybrid seeds which need chemicals .
but that 's the stupidest thing you could do because climate change requires adaption to drought which means planting crops that are resilient to drought - the millets that use only 250 millimeters of rain .
but unfortunately the government , driven by international agencies like the world bank , has walked on the wrong road for a period of market volatility and climate uncertainty .
the combination is a recipe for hunger and famine .
we need to shift our focus from global markets and global trades to local food security and away from export crops to growing food and nutrition for our people .
in the past ten years , more than 140,000 farmers in india have committed suicide according to official figures .
why is their situation so desperate ?
the first suicide came in 1997 .
when the impact of the new policies of liberalizing the seed sector started to get felt and corporations like monsanto , who wanted to sell genetically modified seed , entered the market .
they started to sell non renewable hybrid seeds which meant the farmers had to spent huge amounts of money buying seed every year .
these seeds also needed irrigation and were vulnerable to pests to the farmers had to spend more money putting in irrigation systems and buying pesticides .
that meant a higher debt burden on farmers .
falling prices of the products and rising costs of production squeezed the farmers even further into debt .
and that is what has led to the spate of suicides .
how can you tackle the problem of hunger ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting food into the hands of the poor is difficult due to heavy subsidies i think the most urgent steps to be taken to tackle the problem are to actually develop the farming systems to produce more food per unit acre .
every assumption of industrial agriculture is wrong because it does not produce more food but uses more chemicals and more water per unit acre .
it produces more commodities for international trade per unit acre but it does not produce more food or more nutrition per unit acre .
models of farming that can increase food-production fivefold , ten fold , depending on your climatic conditions have evolved through the organic movement .
those models of biodiverse , ecological systems can solve the problem of hunger .
the second thing that needs to be done is to bring back food-first policies .
in india after independence we have not had hunger on the scale we are now witnessing .
we had a famine in 1942 which killed two million people .
we had enough food in the country but the british were extracting every bit of rice from bengal and exporting it for profit - exporting it to finance the war .
we drove that famine away through public policy that put food first through a universal public distribution system that meant everyone has a right to affordable food .
that was dismantled by the world bank and it has to be resurrected .
the poor must have food at affordable price instead of subsidizing global corporations .
what the government has to do is to buy , preferably organics , from the indian farmers and then subsidize the prices for the poor .
we would save our financial budgets , we would save our taxes and we would have more food at lower prices .
india this year is spending one trillion rupees in subsidies for global corporations to buy chemical fertilizers .
that 's the wrong way to go .
we can lower costs of production , increase output per acre , increase equity and distribution .
that is food sovereignty .
that is food security .
that is food first . dennis stute -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as world poverty day draws attention to the issue , dw 's dennis stute speaks with activist vandana shiva about india 's huge hunger levels . dr. vandana shiva is a physicist , ecologist , activist and author .
in india she has established navdanya , a movement for biodiversity conservation and farmers ' rights .
she also directs the research foundation for science , technology and natural resource policy .
the un has declared oct .
17 as the international day for the eradication of poverty . dw-world.de : how has the food crisis affected india ?
vandana shiva : very severely .
prices of staples have literally doubled in the last year and that has meant that the poor who were already only eating half of what they should be eating are now eating a quarter of what they should be .
unfortunately , it is the poor who must make a living by working physically and what we 're basically doing is robbing them of their ability to earn a living .
in addition , when children do n't get enough food to eat or when a mother is malnourished and she gives birth to a low birth-weight child , we are creating generations of people deprived of full mental health and full physical health .
according to a new report , there are " alarming " levels of hunger in 12 indian states and " serious " levels in the remaining five .
what , in your view , is the reason for the widespread malnutrition ?
there are two very big reasons why india has emerged as the capital of hunger .
the first is the “ green revolution ” model of agriculture , which was actually a hunger-creating model proposed as a hunger solution .
but when you destroy food sources in pulses , in vegetables , in grains , in oil seeds and create monocultures of rice and wheat , you destroy the millets - the nutritious grains that have 40 times higher level of nutrition - and call them inferior grains and push them to extinction .
on the ground , you have less food per unit acre and you have less nutrition access per capita .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gmo crops require more water and provide less nutritional value , says shiva the second is related to the new thrust of the 1991 policies of trade liberalization which instead of focusing on food for people focused on exports of luxury cash crops to rich countries , destroying india 's food security base .
this was trade-driven and really put food on the back burner then , treated as something you do n't need policy for .
the food situation is particularly bad in the state of madhya pradesh .
why is this state doing even worse than the others ?
the two reasons madhya pradesh is more severely affected than others is that it 's a large forest state and it 's largely a tribal state .
the food security of the tribals came from abundant forest products including edible products from the forest 's produce .
mining and industrialization is so rampant that tribals are losing their food resources .
it 's also the state where the drought impact because of climate change has been felt very severely .
bundelkhan has had a drought and rainfall failure for four years - there has been no cultivation at all .
and that 's partly because the agricultural model is based on new seeds like hybrid seeds which need chemicals .
but that 's the stupidest thing you could do because climate change requires adaption to drought which means planting crops that are resilient to drought - the millets that use only 250 millimeters of rain .
but unfortunately the government , driven by international agencies like the world bank , has walked on the wrong road for a period of market volatility and climate uncertainty .
the combination is a recipe for hunger and famine .
we need to shift our focus from global markets and global trades to local food security and away from export crops to growing food and nutrition for our people .
in the past ten years , more than 140,000 farmers in india have committed suicide according to official figures .
why is their situation so desperate ?
the first suicide came in 1997 .
when the impact of the new policies of liberalizing the seed sector started to get felt and corporations like monsanto , who wanted to sell genetically modified seed , entered the market .
they started to sell non renewable hybrid seeds which meant the farmers had to spent huge amounts of money buying seed every year .
these seeds also needed irrigation and were vulnerable to pests to the farmers had to spend more money putting in irrigation systems and buying pesticides .
that meant a higher debt burden on farmers .
falling prices of the products and rising costs of production squeezed the farmers even further into debt .
and that is what has led to the spate of suicides .
how can you tackle the problem of hunger ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting food into the hands of the poor is difficult due to heavy subsidies i think the most urgent steps to be taken to tackle the problem are to actually develop the farming systems to produce more food per unit acre .
every assumption of industrial agriculture is wrong because it does not produce more food but uses more chemicals and more water per unit acre .
it produces more commodities for international trade per unit acre but it does not produce more food or more nutrition per unit acre .
models of farming that can increase food-production fivefold , ten fold , depending on your climatic conditions have evolved through the organic movement .
those models of biodiverse , ecological systems can solve the problem of hunger .
the second thing that needs to be done is to bring back food-first policies .
in india after independence we have not had hunger on the scale we are now witnessing .
we had a famine in 1942 which killed two million people .
we had enough food in the country but the british were extracting every bit of rice from bengal and exporting it for profit - exporting it to finance the war .
we drove that famine away through public policy that put food first through a universal public distribution system that meant everyone has a right to affordable food .
that was dismantled by the world bank and it has to be resurrected .
the poor must have food at affordable price instead of subsidizing global corporations .
what the government has to do is to buy , preferably organics , from the indian farmers and then subsidize the prices for the poor .
we would save our financial budgets , we would save our taxes and we would have more food at lower prices .
india this year is spending one trillion rupees in subsidies for global corporations to buy chemical fertilizers .
that 's the wrong way to go .
we can lower costs of production , increase output per acre , increase equity and distribution .
that is food sovereignty .
that is food security .
that is food first . dennis stute -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 17.10.2008 eastern germany 's first mosque opens amid protests großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's mayor said the mosque symbolizes ' religious and cultural tolerance ' a new mosque has opened in berlin - the first in former east germany .
just blocks away , some 300 people demonstrated against what they called the " islamisation of europe . " located in berlin 's pankow district , the 1.6 million-euro -lrb- $ 2.15-million -rrb- mosque has a 12-meter -lrb- 39-foot -rrb- high minaret and can hold 500 worshippers .
built for members of the ahmadiyya muslim community , the mosque was inaugurated on thursday , oct .
16 , with a celebration attended by approximately 300 people , including berlin mayor klaus wowereit .
according to wowereit , the mosque symbolizes " religious and cultural tolerance " in berlin .
his comments may have been overly optimistic , though , given that hundreds of protesting residents and the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- were gathered only blocks away from the site .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors said they were concerned about the abuse of religious freedom the demonstrators held banners with statements such as , " stop the islamisation of europe " and " stop the abuse of religious freedom . "
a petition against the construction of the mosque had also gathered some 20,000 signatures .
construction plagued by vandalism the ahmadiyya mosque has been a source of controversy since its building plans were announced in 2006 , with attacks on the site hindering its construction .
ijaz ahmad , spokesperson for the mosque , is hopeful however that the new two-story building will help bring clashing muslims and non-muslims in berlin closer together .
" the mosque will be a hub of social activity , not just for praying , " she said .
" it will play a role in boosting integration and promoting dialogue with politicians and other religious groups . "
a local citizens ' group does n't seem to see integration in the cards though .
" we have a big problem with sects that put religion above everything else , allow the beating of women and deny equal rights , " the group said on its web site .

just blocks away , some 300 people demonstrated against what they called the " islamisation of europe . " located in berlin 's pankow district , the 1.6 million-euro -lrb- $ 2.15-million -rrb- mosque has a 12-meter -lrb- 39-foot -rrb- high minaret and can hold 500 worshippers .
built for members of the ahmadiyya muslim community , the mosque was inaugurated on thursday , oct .
16 , with a celebration attended by approximately 300 people , including berlin mayor klaus wowereit .
according to wowereit , the mosque symbolizes " religious and cultural tolerance " in berlin .
his comments may have been overly optimistic , though , given that hundreds of protesting residents and the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- were gathered only blocks away from the site .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors said they were concerned about the abuse of religious freedom the demonstrators held banners with statements such as , " stop the islamisation of europe " and " stop the abuse of religious freedom . "
a petition against the construction of the mosque had also gathered some 20,000 signatures .
construction plagued by vandalism the ahmadiyya mosque has been a source of controversy since its building plans were announced in 2006 , with attacks on the site hindering its construction .
ijaz ahmad , spokesperson for the mosque , is hopeful however that the new two-story building will help bring clashing muslims and non-muslims in berlin closer together .
" the mosque will be a hub of social activity , not just for praying , " she said .
" it will play a role in boosting integration and promoting dialogue with politicians and other religious groups . "
a local citizens ' group does n't seem to see integration in the cards though .
" we have a big problem with sects that put religion above everything else , allow the beating of women and deny equal rights , " the group said on its web site .
muslims seek asylum in germany berlin is home to about 220,000 muslims , with only 200 belonging to the ahmadiyyah community .
ahmadiyyah 's muslim roots are a source of debate , however , as it is not recognized by some mainstream muslim groups on account of different beliefs .
according to the ahmadiyyah group , it has 30,000 members in germany , many of whom came to the country seeking asylum from religious persecution in pakistan and other islamic countries . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the vote , 476 members supported chancellor angela merkel 's government and 99 were against . bolstering tottering banks the package aims to shore up confidence in banks following weeks of market turmoil .
it foresees up to 400 billion euros in lending guarantees for banks .
on top of that , up to 80 billion euros are to be made available to recapitalize banks and buy up risky assets if necessary while another 20 billion euros is to back up the guarantees . the sums are considered a maximum , and might not all be spent if the financial crisis eases . chancellor merkel unveiled the plan on monday this week as part of a concerted effort by governments around the world to stabilize markets and help troubled financial institutions limp through the crisis . the current efforts differ from the $ 700-billion takeover of bad assets by washington last month , since they aim to breathe life back into world banks paralyzed by the crisis that began as a crash in the us subprime mortgage market . a plan for citizens , not for bankers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos heard the concerns towards the plan and reacted german economics minister michael glos insisted that the government 's plan was aimed at protecting the nation 's citizens rather than the bankers .
there was no reason for pessimism about the outlook for the economy . " the opposite , " he said .
" we can solve the problems . " chancellor angela merkel has insisted the bailout would help avert further harm to europe 's biggest economy , which is expected to grind to a near-halt next year . in an unusual move to save time , the bill was then emailed back to german government offices , a few hundred meters away , for its final formalities , including a signature by the finance minister , the chancellor and president horst koehler . most of the euro zone nations and some allies have agreed to identical aid packages , each comprising a huge guarantee for interbank lending and semi-nationalizations of banks by state equity funds . germany has not identified which banks need rescuing , but the nine landesbank companies owned by the states are seen as the weakest units .
two of them , westlb and bayernlb , were hurt by investing in low-grade derivatives . news agency afp quoted a financial source saying germany 's biggest bank , deutsche bank , would not seek state aid .
" deutsche bank 's capital structure is very strong , as a result there is no need to seek state aid , " afp quoted the unnamed source as saying .
the bundestag agreed to the plan amid signs of an element of calm returning to european share markets friday after days of turbulence .
however , the german parliament 's backing for the plan is unlikely to save europe 's biggest economy from a sharp downturn as the financial crisis hits growth around the world . in the run-up to the plan 's passage through parliament , the german government slashed its 2009 economic growth forecast to a feeble 0.2 percent .
party meetings lead to unease and discontent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan is seen by some as a quick fix not long-term solution despite being approved by merkel 's cabinet on monday and by the country 's 16 states on thursday , the plan was still being fiercely debated on thursday evening during a round of party meetings .
the social democrats , who initially signaled their full support for the plan , called for a revision of the proposed bill before friday 's bundestag debate .
the spd insisted that a caveat must be added that makes it clear that responsibility for any losses to the state through the package must be taken by those german banks accepting aid .
the free market liberal opposition free democrats party -lrb- fdp -rrb- also decided after its previously unanimous support for the package that the handling of the current financial crisis needed stricter controls , calling for a more future-orientated plan which would bolster the german economy against further demands .
guido westerwelle , leader of the fdp , also warned the government not to give up its target to curb spending and balance the budget over the crisis .
both the green party and the left party emerged from their meetings with a more critical stance , saying that the level of parliamentary control over the package was insufficient .
both made it clear that the parliamentary " cooperation committee , " which would oversee the implementation of the package , had to guarantee " effective and thorough control of the federation for the banks " while government control of the plan had to be strengthened .
" it 's a 500-billion-euro blank cheque , " said green parliamentary chief renate kuenast . left party unanimously rejects plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oskar lafontaine : show me the money the opposition left party unanimously rejected the rescue package at its meeting .
the left party 's parliamentary group accused the government of not recognizing the full extent of the recession threat facing germany and that , instead of a financial sticking plaster , the country needed a full reform of its economic program .
left party leader oskar lafontaine called for measures to boost domestic demand , adding that many germans found the cabinet 's multi-billion bank rescue package hard to fathom as they suffered the effects of a weakening economy .
" when we asked for more money for hartz iv -lrb- unemployment benefits -rrb- , the answer was ' there 's no money . '
when we asked for more money for pensioners , the answer was ' there 's no money , " ' lafontaine said .
" people are surprised that , all of a sudden , 500 billion euros are readily available to manage the crisis ... the people do n't understand that any more , " he said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the vote , 476 members supported chancellor angela merkel 's government and 99 were against . bolstering tottering banks the package aims to shore up confidence in banks following weeks of market turmoil .
it foresees up to 400 billion euros in lending guarantees for banks .
on top of that , up to 80 billion euros are to be made available to recapitalize banks and buy up risky assets if necessary while another 20 billion euros is to back up the guarantees . the sums are considered a maximum , and might not all be spent if the financial crisis eases . chancellor merkel unveiled the plan on monday this week as part of a concerted effort by governments around the world to stabilize markets and help troubled financial institutions limp through the crisis . the current efforts differ from the $ 700-billion takeover of bad assets by washington last month , since they aim to breathe life back into world banks paralyzed by the crisis that began as a crash in the us subprime mortgage market . a plan for citizens , not for bankers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos heard the concerns towards the plan and reacted german economics minister michael glos insisted that the government 's plan was aimed at protecting the nation 's citizens rather than the bankers .
there was no reason for pessimism about the outlook for the economy . " the opposite , " he said .
" we can solve the problems . " chancellor angela merkel has insisted the bailout would help avert further harm to europe 's biggest economy , which is expected to grind to a near-halt next year . in an unusual move to save time , the bill was then emailed back to german government offices , a few hundred meters away , for its final formalities , including a signature by the finance minister , the chancellor and president horst koehler . most of the euro zone nations and some allies have agreed to identical aid packages , each comprising a huge guarantee for interbank lending and semi-nationalizations of banks by state equity funds . germany has not identified which banks need rescuing , but the nine landesbank companies owned by the states are seen as the weakest units .
two of them , westlb and bayernlb , were hurt by investing in low-grade derivatives . news agency afp quoted a financial source saying germany 's biggest bank , deutsche bank , would not seek state aid .
" deutsche bank 's capital structure is very strong , as a result there is no need to seek state aid , " afp quoted the unnamed source as saying .
the bundestag agreed to the plan amid signs of an element of calm returning to european share markets friday after days of turbulence .
however , the german parliament 's backing for the plan is unlikely to save europe 's biggest economy from a sharp downturn as the financial crisis hits growth around the world . in the run-up to the plan 's passage through parliament , the german government slashed its 2009 economic growth forecast to a feeble 0.2 percent .
party meetings lead to unease and discontent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan is seen by some as a quick fix not long-term solution despite being approved by merkel 's cabinet on monday and by the country 's 16 states on thursday , the plan was still being fiercely debated on thursday evening during a round of party meetings .
the social democrats , who initially signaled their full support for the plan , called for a revision of the proposed bill before friday 's bundestag debate .
the spd insisted that a caveat must be added that makes it clear that responsibility for any losses to the state through the package must be taken by those german banks accepting aid .
the free market liberal opposition free democrats party -lrb- fdp -rrb- also decided after its previously unanimous support for the package that the handling of the current financial crisis needed stricter controls , calling for a more future-orientated plan which would bolster the german economy against further demands .
guido westerwelle , leader of the fdp , also warned the government not to give up its target to curb spending and balance the budget over the crisis .
both the green party and the left party emerged from their meetings with a more critical stance , saying that the level of parliamentary control over the package was insufficient .
both made it clear that the parliamentary " cooperation committee , " which would oversee the implementation of the package , had to guarantee " effective and thorough control of the federation for the banks " while government control of the plan had to be strengthened .
" it 's a 500-billion-euro blank cheque , " said green parliamentary chief renate kuenast . left party unanimously rejects plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oskar lafontaine : show me the money the opposition left party unanimously rejected the rescue package at its meeting .
the left party 's parliamentary group accused the government of not recognizing the full extent of the recession threat facing germany and that , instead of a financial sticking plaster , the country needed a full reform of its economic program .
left party leader oskar lafontaine called for measures to boost domestic demand , adding that many germans found the cabinet 's multi-billion bank rescue package hard to fathom as they suffered the effects of a weakening economy .
" when we asked for more money for hartz iv -lrb- unemployment benefits -rrb- , the answer was ' there 's no money . '
when we asked for more money for pensioners , the answer was ' there 's no money , " ' lafontaine said .

in the vote , 476 members supported chancellor angela merkel 's government and 99 were against . bolstering tottering banks the package aims to shore up confidence in banks following weeks of market turmoil .
it foresees up to 400 billion euros in lending guarantees for banks .
on top of that , up to 80 billion euros are to be made available to recapitalize banks and buy up risky assets if necessary while another 20 billion euros is to back up the guarantees . the sums are considered a maximum , and might not all be spent if the financial crisis eases . chancellor merkel unveiled the plan on monday this week as part of a concerted effort by governments around the world to stabilize markets and help troubled financial institutions limp through the crisis . the current efforts differ from the $ 700-billion takeover of bad assets by washington last month , since they aim to breathe life back into world banks paralyzed by the crisis that began as a crash in the us subprime mortgage market . a plan for citizens , not for bankers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos heard the concerns towards the plan and reacted german economics minister michael glos insisted that the government 's plan was aimed at protecting the nation 's citizens rather than the bankers .
there was no reason for pessimism about the outlook for the economy . " the opposite , " he said .
" we can solve the problems . " chancellor angela merkel has insisted the bailout would help avert further harm to europe 's biggest economy , which is expected to grind to a near-halt next year . in an unusual move to save time , the bill was then emailed back to german government offices , a few hundred meters away , for its final formalities , including a signature by the finance minister , the chancellor and president horst koehler . most of the euro zone nations and some allies have agreed to identical aid packages , each comprising a huge guarantee for interbank lending and semi-nationalizations of banks by state equity funds . germany has not identified which banks need rescuing , but the nine landesbank companies owned by the states are seen as the weakest units .
two of them , westlb and bayernlb , were hurt by investing in low-grade derivatives . news agency afp quoted a financial source saying germany 's biggest bank , deutsche bank , would not seek state aid .
" deutsche bank 's capital structure is very strong , as a result there is no need to seek state aid , " afp quoted the unnamed source as saying .
the bundestag agreed to the plan amid signs of an element of calm returning to european share markets friday after days of turbulence .
however , the german parliament 's backing for the plan is unlikely to save europe 's biggest economy from a sharp downturn as the financial crisis hits growth around the world . in the run-up to the plan 's passage through parliament , the german government slashed its 2009 economic growth forecast to a feeble 0.2 percent .
party meetings lead to unease and discontent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan is seen by some as a quick fix not long-term solution despite being approved by merkel 's cabinet on monday and by the country 's 16 states on thursday , the plan was still being fiercely debated on thursday evening during a round of party meetings .
the social democrats , who initially signaled their full support for the plan , called for a revision of the proposed bill before friday 's bundestag debate .
the spd insisted that a caveat must be added that makes it clear that responsibility for any losses to the state through the package must be taken by those german banks accepting aid .
the free market liberal opposition free democrats party -lrb- fdp -rrb- also decided after its previously unanimous support for the package that the handling of the current financial crisis needed stricter controls , calling for a more future-orientated plan which would bolster the german economy against further demands .
guido westerwelle , leader of the fdp , also warned the government not to give up its target to curb spending and balance the budget over the crisis .
both the green party and the left party emerged from their meetings with a more critical stance , saying that the level of parliamentary control over the package was insufficient .
both made it clear that the parliamentary " cooperation committee , " which would oversee the implementation of the package , had to guarantee " effective and thorough control of the federation for the banks " while government control of the plan had to be strengthened .
" it 's a 500-billion-euro blank cheque , " said green parliamentary chief renate kuenast . left party unanimously rejects plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oskar lafontaine : show me the money the opposition left party unanimously rejected the rescue package at its meeting .
the left party 's parliamentary group accused the government of not recognizing the full extent of the recession threat facing germany and that , instead of a financial sticking plaster , the country needed a full reform of its economic program .
left party leader oskar lafontaine called for measures to boost domestic demand , adding that many germans found the cabinet 's multi-billion bank rescue package hard to fathom as they suffered the effects of a weakening economy .
" when we asked for more money for hartz iv -lrb- unemployment benefits -rrb- , the answer was ' there 's no money . '
when we asked for more money for pensioners , the answer was ' there 's no money , " ' lafontaine said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 17.10.2008 loss of natural capital costs more than bank crisis , says expert großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the financial crisis has left us unable to see the wood for the trees as the eu discusses the affordability of its carbon-reduction targets , economist pavan sukhdev told dw-world.de that the best things in life are free , but not for much longer .
the nature crunch could prove costly . once described as an " economist by profession and an ecologist at heart , " pavan sukhdev holds the chair of deutsche bank 's global market center and is director of the green accounting for indian states project , a study on the economic significance of biodiversity in india .
he also heads an ongoing global report funded by the german ministry for the environment and the european commission on " the economics of ecosystems & biodiversity " -lrb- teeb -rrb- , and is among the architects of the green new deal , spearheaded by the united nations environment program , which will be unveiled in london on oct .
22 .
dw-world.de : you said at the world conservation congress in barcelona last week that the economic burden of environmentally hostile practices like deforestation outweighs that of the bank crisis .
pavan sukhdev : the capital loss to financial firms in the city and wall street has been estimated as $ 1 trillion to $ 1.5 trillion .
in teeb 's first phase report which we presented in may , we looked at the extent of losses taking place as a result of deforestation and degradation .
we estimated the loss in human welfare as a capital item , and worked out that this was $ 2 to $ 4.5 trillion per year , every year , for the last several years .
and it will continue , if we carry on with business as usual .
why is it that a one-off loss of $ 1.5 trillion in financial capital to a group of wall street firms attracts so much attention , whereas the ongoing loss per annum of twice this amount of natural capital is barely reported ?
we 've seen governments bail out the economy - what would a " bailout " for the environment look like ?
it would be comparatively modest .
let me give you a few indicating benchmarks .
today we have something like 100,000 conservation areas , covering some 10-11 percent of the earth 's land surface .
the teeb team believes that we are spending some $ 40-50 billion too little on making that conservation effective .
according to various estimates , these conservation areas produce some $ 4-5 trillion of utility per year .
today , spending on protected areas globally is less than $ 20 billion , and all we 're suggesting is an increase of another $ 50 billion a year to ensure the continuation of the benefits of these protected areas .
we 're not talking about a massive amount of money - single institutions have lost more than that in the current financial chaos .
but for various reasons it doesn ’ t get allocated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pavan sukhdev what are these reasons ?
for one , the loss of natural capital is a loss of public wealth .
eco-system services are public benefits that are pretty much free .
it is not individuals ' or shareholders ' wealth at stake , although it is , if you like , global shareholders ' wealth .
but it 's not private ownership , it 's public ownership .
these are things that are there for all to enjoy : we would dearly miss their absence and we would pay the earth to get them back , but right now , they 're free .
so the public nature of these goods and services is one reason .
to understand the second reason why loss of natural capital does n't grab headlines , we need to think of the frog analogy used by al gore in his book " an inconvenient truth " : if you put a frog in a beaker of water and gradually raise the temperature , it wo n't notice any change .
similarly , what is happening to us is happening continuously .
every year we lose forest , the climate gets worse , poor people 's water supplies and field nutrients decline .
but we see these losses so gradually that we do n't realize that things are getting worse .
whereas in the case of the financial markets it 's one short , sharp shock .
nonetheless , a lot of smart money has started to flow into environmental investment .
in north america , the percentage of venture capital spent on clean technology used to be around 2 percent in 2002 , but had risen to 17 percent by 2007 .
is there a risk that environmental concerns will be abandoned given the current slowdown in the global economy ? i do n't think so , because people are beginning to get the message . i never have to explain myself twice any more .
even two years ago , people 's eyes would glaze over .
now people want to know what needs to be done .
of course , the cost of the financial crisis means there will now be increased distributional pressure on how much can be allocated to solving environmental problems .
but my point is that this money is not much , considering how much is spent on other sectors .
there 's no need to think about it too much .
the time is now .
how viable is a rescue plan like this during a recession , which is what we 're facing right now ?
a $ 45 billion gap per annum is not the end of the world .
look at how much has been lost and how much is being allocated individually by governments in the us and europe - up to $ 700 billion .
to put things in context , the investment per annum of the eu in conservation areas is about 6 billion euros .
these are modest sums .
so economic disaster does n't necessarily have to mean ecological disaster too ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the financial crisis is reported extensively - the environmental one is n't no .
venture capitalists have understood something that the world , generally , has not .
as other businesses begin using the technology into which venture capital has been invested , they will find amazing and sizeable opportunities .
i predict a tectonic shift in the way things are done .
renewable energy is an extraordinary opportunity if you use it not just to fix the supply that comes to you and me in berlin and london , but to fix the supply needed by the world 's 2 billion who do n't have an energy supply - the poorest people in the world who do not actually have energy coming to their homes in the form of oil , coal or electricity .
there are vast opportunities here , in countries like india and china , africa and latin america , to apply well-researched technologies which provide , for example , modular solutions to bring light into the poor home .
just imagine what kind of change you could see - education coming down to a village level , children staying up in order to read . think of the tectonic shift than can be achieved just by shifting focus and providing micro-finance to villagers to implement renewable energy solutions .
and look at the number of people who can benefit from that .
these are the sort of things that smart business is looking at .
there is money in making more efficient equipment and implementing more efficient processes .
does the credit crunch make people more aware that being careful with natural capital is important too ?
yes .
as the saying goes , a crisis is a terrible thing to waste . interview : jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the vote , 476 members supported chancellor angela merkel 's government and 99 were against . bolstering tottering banks the package aims to shore up confidence in banks following weeks of market turmoil .
it foresees up to 400 billion euros in lending guarantees for banks .
on top of that , up to 80 billion euros are to be made available to recapitalize banks and buy up risky assets if necessary while another 20 billion euros is to back up the guarantees . the sums are considered a maximum , and might not all be spent if the financial crisis eases . chancellor merkel unveiled the plan on monday this week as part of a concerted effort by governments around the world to stabilize markets and help troubled financial institutions limp through the crisis . the current efforts differ from the $ 700-billion takeover of bad assets by washington last month , since they aim to breathe life back into world banks paralyzed by the crisis that began as a crash in the us subprime mortgage market . a plan for citizens , not for bankers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos heard the concerns towards the plan and reacted german economics minister michael glos insisted that the government 's plan was aimed at protecting the nation 's citizens rather than the bankers .
there was no reason for pessimism about the outlook for the economy . " the opposite , " he said .
" we can solve the problems . " chancellor angela merkel has insisted the bailout would help avert further harm to europe 's biggest economy , which is expected to grind to a near-halt next year . in an unusual move to save time , the bill was then emailed back to german government offices , a few hundred meters away , for its final formalities , including a signature by the finance minister , the chancellor and president horst koehler . most of the euro zone nations and some allies have agreed to identical aid packages , each comprising a huge guarantee for interbank lending and semi-nationalizations of banks by state equity funds . germany has not identified which banks need rescuing , but the nine landesbank companies owned by the states are seen as the weakest units .
two of them , westlb and bayernlb , were hurt by investing in low-grade derivatives . news agency afp quoted a financial source saying germany 's biggest bank , deutsche bank , would not seek state aid .
" deutsche bank 's capital structure is very strong , as a result there is no need to seek state aid , " afp quoted the unnamed source as saying .
the bundestag agreed to the plan amid signs of an element of calm returning to european share markets friday after days of turbulence .
however , the german parliament 's backing for the plan is unlikely to save europe 's biggest economy from a sharp downturn as the financial crisis hits growth around the world . in the run-up to the plan 's passage through parliament , the german government slashed its 2009 economic growth forecast to a feeble 0.2 percent .
party meetings lead to unease and discontent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan is seen by some as a quick fix not long-term solution despite being approved by merkel 's cabinet on monday and by the country 's 16 states on thursday , the plan was still being fiercely debated on thursday evening during a round of party meetings .
the social democrats , who initially signaled their full support for the plan , called for a revision of the proposed bill before friday 's bundestag debate .
the spd insisted that a caveat must be added that makes it clear that responsibility for any losses to the state through the package must be taken by those german banks accepting aid .
the free market liberal opposition free democrats party -lrb- fdp -rrb- also decided after its previously unanimous support for the package that the handling of the current financial crisis needed stricter controls , calling for a more future-orientated plan which would bolster the german economy against further demands .
guido westerwelle , leader of the fdp , also warned the government not to give up its target to curb spending and balance the budget over the crisis .
both the green party and the left party emerged from their meetings with a more critical stance , saying that the level of parliamentary control over the package was insufficient .
both made it clear that the parliamentary " cooperation committee , " which would oversee the implementation of the package , had to guarantee " effective and thorough control of the federation for the banks " while government control of the plan had to be strengthened .
" it 's a 500-billion-euro blank cheque , " said green parliamentary chief renate kuenast . left party unanimously rejects plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oskar lafontaine : show me the money the opposition left party unanimously rejected the rescue package at its meeting .
the left party 's parliamentary group accused the government of not recognizing the full extent of the recession threat facing germany and that , instead of a financial sticking plaster , the country needed a full reform of its economic program .
left party leader oskar lafontaine called for measures to boost domestic demand , adding that many germans found the cabinet 's multi-billion bank rescue package hard to fathom as they suffered the effects of a weakening economy .
" when we asked for more money for hartz iv -lrb- unemployment benefits -rrb- , the answer was ' there 's no money . '
when we asked for more money for pensioners , the answer was ' there 's no money , " ' lafontaine said .
" people are surprised that , all of a sudden , 500 billion euros are readily available to manage the crisis ... the people do n't understand that any more , " he said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

pavan sukhdev : the capital loss to financial firms in the city and wall street has been estimated as $ 1 trillion to $ 1.5 trillion .
in teeb 's first phase report which we presented in may , we looked at the extent of losses taking place as a result of deforestation and degradation .
we estimated the loss in human welfare as a capital item , and worked out that this was $ 2 to $ 4.5 trillion per year , every year , for the last several years .
and it will continue , if we carry on with business as usual .
why is it that a one-off loss of $ 1.5 trillion in financial capital to a group of wall street firms attracts so much attention , whereas the ongoing loss per annum of twice this amount of natural capital is barely reported ?
we 've seen governments bail out the economy - what would a " bailout " for the environment look like ?
it would be comparatively modest .
let me give you a few indicating benchmarks .
today we have something like 100,000 conservation areas , covering some 10-11 percent of the earth 's land surface .
the teeb team believes that we are spending some $ 40-50 billion too little on making that conservation effective .
according to various estimates , these conservation areas produce some $ 4-5 trillion of utility per year .
today , spending on protected areas globally is less than $ 20 billion , and all we 're suggesting is an increase of another $ 50 billion a year to ensure the continuation of the benefits of these protected areas .
we 're not talking about a massive amount of money - single institutions have lost more than that in the current financial chaos .
but for various reasons it doesn ’ t get allocated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pavan sukhdev what are these reasons ?
for one , the loss of natural capital is a loss of public wealth .
eco-system services are public benefits that are pretty much free .
it is not individuals ' or shareholders ' wealth at stake , although it is , if you like , global shareholders ' wealth .
but it 's not private ownership , it 's public ownership .
these are things that are there for all to enjoy : we would dearly miss their absence and we would pay the earth to get them back , but right now , they 're free .
so the public nature of these goods and services is one reason .
to understand the second reason why loss of natural capital does n't grab headlines , we need to think of the frog analogy used by al gore in his book " an inconvenient truth " : if you put a frog in a beaker of water and gradually raise the temperature , it wo n't notice any change .
similarly , what is happening to us is happening continuously .
every year we lose forest , the climate gets worse , poor people 's water supplies and field nutrients decline .
but we see these losses so gradually that we do n't realize that things are getting worse .
whereas in the case of the financial markets it 's one short , sharp shock .
nonetheless , a lot of smart money has started to flow into environmental investment .
in north america , the percentage of venture capital spent on clean technology used to be around 2 percent in 2002 , but had risen to 17 percent by 2007 .
is there a risk that environmental concerns will be abandoned given the current slowdown in the global economy ? i do n't think so , because people are beginning to get the message . i never have to explain myself twice any more .
even two years ago , people 's eyes would glaze over .
now people want to know what needs to be done .
of course , the cost of the financial crisis means there will now be increased distributional pressure on how much can be allocated to solving environmental problems .
but my point is that this money is not much , considering how much is spent on other sectors .
there 's no need to think about it too much .
the time is now .
how viable is a rescue plan like this during a recession , which is what we 're facing right now ?
a $ 45 billion gap per annum is not the end of the world .
look at how much has been lost and how much is being allocated individually by governments in the us and europe - up to $ 700 billion .
to put things in context , the investment per annum of the eu in conservation areas is about 6 billion euros .
these are modest sums .
so economic disaster does n't necessarily have to mean ecological disaster too ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the financial crisis is reported extensively - the environmental one is n't no .
venture capitalists have understood something that the world , generally , has not .
as other businesses begin using the technology into which venture capital has been invested , they will find amazing and sizeable opportunities .
i predict a tectonic shift in the way things are done .
renewable energy is an extraordinary opportunity if you use it not just to fix the supply that comes to you and me in berlin and london , but to fix the supply needed by the world 's 2 billion who do n't have an energy supply - the poorest people in the world who do not actually have energy coming to their homes in the form of oil , coal or electricity .
there are vast opportunities here , in countries like india and china , africa and latin america , to apply well-researched technologies which provide , for example , modular solutions to bring light into the poor home .
just imagine what kind of change you could see - education coming down to a village level , children staying up in order to read . think of the tectonic shift than can be achieved just by shifting focus and providing micro-finance to villagers to implement renewable energy solutions .
and look at the number of people who can benefit from that .
these are the sort of things that smart business is looking at .
there is money in making more efficient equipment and implementing more efficient processes .
does the credit crunch make people more aware that being careful with natural capital is important too ?
yes .
as the saying goes , a crisis is a terrible thing to waste . interview : jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the vote , 476 members supported chancellor angela merkel 's government and 99 were against . bolstering tottering banks the package aims to shore up confidence in banks following weeks of market turmoil .
it foresees up to 400 billion euros in lending guarantees for banks .
on top of that , up to 80 billion euros are to be made available to recapitalize banks and buy up risky assets if necessary while another 20 billion euros is to back up the guarantees . the sums are considered a maximum , and might not all be spent if the financial crisis eases . chancellor merkel unveiled the plan on monday this week as part of a concerted effort by governments around the world to stabilize markets and help troubled financial institutions limp through the crisis . the current efforts differ from the $ 700-billion takeover of bad assets by washington last month , since they aim to breathe life back into world banks paralyzed by the crisis that began as a crash in the us subprime mortgage market . a plan for citizens , not for bankers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos heard the concerns towards the plan and reacted german economics minister michael glos insisted that the government 's plan was aimed at protecting the nation 's citizens rather than the bankers .
there was no reason for pessimism about the outlook for the economy . " the opposite , " he said .
" we can solve the problems . " chancellor angela merkel has insisted the bailout would help avert further harm to europe 's biggest economy , which is expected to grind to a near-halt next year . in an unusual move to save time , the bill was then emailed back to german government offices , a few hundred meters away , for its final formalities , including a signature by the finance minister , the chancellor and president horst koehler . most of the euro zone nations and some allies have agreed to identical aid packages , each comprising a huge guarantee for interbank lending and semi-nationalizations of banks by state equity funds . germany has not identified which banks need rescuing , but the nine landesbank companies owned by the states are seen as the weakest units .
two of them , westlb and bayernlb , were hurt by investing in low-grade derivatives . news agency afp quoted a financial source saying germany 's biggest bank , deutsche bank , would not seek state aid .
" deutsche bank 's capital structure is very strong , as a result there is no need to seek state aid , " afp quoted the unnamed source as saying .
the bundestag agreed to the plan amid signs of an element of calm returning to european share markets friday after days of turbulence .
however , the german parliament 's backing for the plan is unlikely to save europe 's biggest economy from a sharp downturn as the financial crisis hits growth around the world . in the run-up to the plan 's passage through parliament , the german government slashed its 2009 economic growth forecast to a feeble 0.2 percent .
party meetings lead to unease and discontent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan is seen by some as a quick fix not long-term solution despite being approved by merkel 's cabinet on monday and by the country 's 16 states on thursday , the plan was still being fiercely debated on thursday evening during a round of party meetings .
the social democrats , who initially signaled their full support for the plan , called for a revision of the proposed bill before friday 's bundestag debate .
the spd insisted that a caveat must be added that makes it clear that responsibility for any losses to the state through the package must be taken by those german banks accepting aid .
the free market liberal opposition free democrats party -lrb- fdp -rrb- also decided after its previously unanimous support for the package that the handling of the current financial crisis needed stricter controls , calling for a more future-orientated plan which would bolster the german economy against further demands .
guido westerwelle , leader of the fdp , also warned the government not to give up its target to curb spending and balance the budget over the crisis .
both the green party and the left party emerged from their meetings with a more critical stance , saying that the level of parliamentary control over the package was insufficient .
both made it clear that the parliamentary " cooperation committee , " which would oversee the implementation of the package , had to guarantee " effective and thorough control of the federation for the banks " while government control of the plan had to be strengthened .
" it 's a 500-billion-euro blank cheque , " said green parliamentary chief renate kuenast . left party unanimously rejects plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oskar lafontaine : show me the money the opposition left party unanimously rejected the rescue package at its meeting .
the left party 's parliamentary group accused the government of not recognizing the full extent of the recession threat facing germany and that , instead of a financial sticking plaster , the country needed a full reform of its economic program .
left party leader oskar lafontaine called for measures to boost domestic demand , adding that many germans found the cabinet 's multi-billion bank rescue package hard to fathom as they suffered the effects of a weakening economy .
" when we asked for more money for hartz iv -lrb- unemployment benefits -rrb- , the answer was ' there 's no money . '
when we asked for more money for pensioners , the answer was ' there 's no money , " ' lafontaine said .

will books as we know them soon be a thing of the past ?
a new generation of digital " e-readers " has the german publishing industry gearing up for a fast-moving digital future . electronic books were announced as the " next big thing " a decade ago .
but the technology that came out at the time failed to impress consumers , and made few inroads into the market .
now some new e-readers , predicted to be put on the market in europe in the near future , have publishing industry insiders preparing for major changes .
lightweight devices like amazon 's kindle and the sony reader have been the focus of intense interest since they celebrated their german coming-out party at the frankfurt book fair , which runs through oct .
19 .
e-books - stars of the frankfurt fair the press toasted the new readers as the " true stars " of this year 's fair .
but considering the changes they could represent for the staid publishing industry , players are eyeing them with a mixture of fascination and fear .
" overall , i think german publishers are very enthusiastic about e-books , " said thomas wilking , editor in chief of the german publishing trade magazine buchreport .
" they are just waiting for a device they think is attractive enough for a wide public . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sony is hoping its reader will impress europeans book fair organizers took an unscientific survey of 1,000 industry players on the future of the new technology , and published it just before the fair opened .
unfortunately , the data failed to paint any clear road map for the future .
more than 70 percent of respondents said they were ready for the digital challenge - but 60 percent of them had neither used e-readers nor downloaded e-books themselves .
meanwhile , a full 40 percent said they expect e-content to dominate the market by 2018 - compared with one-third of respondents who said e-books will never take over .
12 percent thought the new e-readers would be a short-lived flash in the pan .
' you could take 50 books to the beach ' jak boumans , a dutch media-content consultant who runs his own firm , electronic media reporting , is convinced e-books are here to stay .
but he estimates it will be at least 2030 before they are in wide usage , considering how many details still need to be ironed out , and how ingrained peoples ' attitudes are towards reading .
" this has been a topic for the last 30 years , but the mentality is still trying to catch up with the technology , " boumans said .
" e-readers mean people could go on holiday without packing a stack of heavy books - they can take 50 books with them in one device and still read it on the beach . "
observers praise the kindle and reader as being significantly improved from the last devices that tried to storm the market but failed .
the new devices have extended their battery life and traded the backlit computer screen for a paper-simulating " e-paper " that is less hard on the eyes .
the ritual of turning pages some book lovers wonder if an electronic device will ever really replace paper books , however .
johann schumandl , owner of a small independent book store in cologne , said he thinks people might accept e-readers for reading work documents .
but printed books will never disappear completely : " when you read a book you have the sense of touch , the haptic value , " he said .
" there is something ritualistic about reading a book , turning the pages . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : which e-reader will capture the market ?
boumans agrees that casual readers - who he refers to as " ink sniffers " - will be the last group to make the switch .
but he believes a new generation of people who grew up using ipods will see things differently .
" the only question they are going to have is , ' how many functions will this device combine for me ? " ' he said .
people have been predicting the demise of the bookstore for a long time now , and many now think e-books and e-readers could deliver the coup de grace .
twenty-five percent of respondents to the book fair study thought bookstores would largely disappear within half a century , with online distribution of paper books by firms such as amazon taking over .
copyright quandary some european bookstores seem to be trying to get ahead of the curve by being the first to promote e-books .
top german chain bookstore thalia struck a deal with sony to sell content for its reader devices in thalia stores and online .
assuming e-books do take hold , there are still many questions to be answered .
which reader - amazon 's , sony 's , or perhaps one from a european competitor , like the netherlands ' iliad - will capture the public 's fancy ?
each one has slightly different technical specifications , and is based on different technical platforms .
another big question is how the industry will deal with copyright protection .
some employ digital rights management -lrb- drm , -rrb- a kind of software lock on downloadable books , with the aim of avoiding the music industry 's fate .
since the advent of digital music , record companies have famously seen profits decimated by piracy and illegal downloading .
boumans opposes technological protection on content .
he supports the concept of a " social drm , " which would operate under a " name and shame " system : when a person buys electronic data , his or her name is attached to the file so anyone can see how it is passed around after that .
social pressure would correct the market .
' the ipod principle ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazon 's kindle is a big seller in the us ultimately , boumans says four things need to be in place before e-books really take off : a device , a portfolio of downloadable material , the download service - and the right price for content .
" that 's when you get what i call the ipod principle , " he said .
" people start downloading things and they are willing to pay for it . "
clearly it is difficult to imagine exactly what shape the digital-literature future will take .
according to buchreport editor wilking , the future may be even more unrecognizable than we can imagine .
for one thing , books may cease to be a collection of words on paper - or even e-paper .
" there are a lot of possibilities when it comes to e-publishing , " wilking said .
" people will be able to build in films and interactive elements .
things we ca n't even imagine yet . "
once these technical possibilities are there , he says , then the authors might start taking them into consideration , and writing for multimedia instead of just the page . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this has been a topic for the last 30 years , but the mentality is still trying to catch up with the technology , " boumans said .
" e-readers mean people could go on holiday without packing a stack of heavy books - they can take 50 books with them in one device and still read it on the beach . "
observers praise the kindle and reader as being significantly improved from the last devices that tried to storm the market but failed .
the new devices have extended their battery life and traded the backlit computer screen for a paper-simulating " e-paper " that is less hard on the eyes .
the ritual of turning pages some book lovers wonder if an electronic device will ever really replace paper books , however .
johann schumandl , owner of a small independent book store in cologne , said he thinks people might accept e-readers for reading work documents .
but printed books will never disappear completely : " when you read a book you have the sense of touch , the haptic value , " he said .
" there is something ritualistic about reading a book , turning the pages . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : which e-reader will capture the market ?
boumans agrees that casual readers - who he refers to as " ink sniffers " - will be the last group to make the switch .
but he believes a new generation of people who grew up using ipods will see things differently .
" the only question they are going to have is , ' how many functions will this device combine for me ? " ' he said .
people have been predicting the demise of the bookstore for a long time now , and many now think e-books and e-readers could deliver the coup de grace .
twenty-five percent of respondents to the book fair study thought bookstores would largely disappear within half a century , with online distribution of paper books by firms such as amazon taking over .
copyright quandary some european bookstores seem to be trying to get ahead of the curve by being the first to promote e-books .
top german chain bookstore thalia struck a deal with sony to sell content for its reader devices in thalia stores and online .
assuming e-books do take hold , there are still many questions to be answered .
which reader - amazon 's , sony 's , or perhaps one from a european competitor , like the netherlands ' iliad - will capture the public 's fancy ?
each one has slightly different technical specifications , and is based on different technical platforms .
another big question is how the industry will deal with copyright protection .
some employ digital rights management -lrb- drm , -rrb- a kind of software lock on downloadable books , with the aim of avoiding the music industry 's fate .
since the advent of digital music , record companies have famously seen profits decimated by piracy and illegal downloading .
boumans opposes technological protection on content .
he supports the concept of a " social drm , " which would operate under a " name and shame " system : when a person buys electronic data , his or her name is attached to the file so anyone can see how it is passed around after that .
social pressure would correct the market .
' the ipod principle ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazon 's kindle is a big seller in the us ultimately , boumans says four things need to be in place before e-books really take off : a device , a portfolio of downloadable material , the download service - and the right price for content .
" that 's when you get what i call the ipod principle , " he said .
" people start downloading things and they are willing to pay for it . "
clearly it is difficult to imagine exactly what shape the digital-literature future will take .
according to buchreport editor wilking , the future may be even more unrecognizable than we can imagine .
for one thing , books may cease to be a collection of words on paper - or even e-paper .
" there are a lot of possibilities when it comes to e-publishing , " wilking said .
" people will be able to build in films and interactive elements .
things we ca n't even imagine yet . "
once these technical possibilities are there , he says , then the authors might start taking them into consideration , and writing for multimedia instead of just the page . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a new generation of digital " e-readers " has the german publishing industry gearing up for a fast-moving digital future . electronic books were announced as the " next big thing " a decade ago .
but the technology that came out at the time failed to impress consumers , and made few inroads into the market .
now some new e-readers , predicted to be put on the market in europe in the near future , have publishing industry insiders preparing for major changes .
lightweight devices like amazon 's kindle and the sony reader have been the focus of intense interest since they celebrated their german coming-out party at the frankfurt book fair , which runs through oct .

e-books - stars of the frankfurt fair the press toasted the new readers as the " true stars " of this year 's fair .
but considering the changes they could represent for the staid publishing industry , players are eyeing them with a mixture of fascination and fear .

the nature crunch could prove costly . once described as an " economist by profession and an ecologist at heart , " pavan sukhdev holds the chair of deutsche bank 's global market center and is director of the green accounting for indian states project , a study on the economic significance of biodiversity in india .
he also heads an ongoing global report funded by the german ministry for the environment and the european commission on " the economics of ecosystems & biodiversity " -lrb- teeb -rrb- , and is among the architects of the green new deal , spearheaded by the united nations environment program , which will be unveiled in london on oct .
22 .
dw-world.de : you said at the world conservation congress in barcelona last week that the economic burden of environmentally hostile practices like deforestation outweighs that of the bank crisis .
pavan sukhdev : the capital loss to financial firms in the city and wall street has been estimated as $ 1 trillion to $ 1.5 trillion .
in teeb 's first phase report which we presented in may , we looked at the extent of losses taking place as a result of deforestation and degradation .
we estimated the loss in human welfare as a capital item , and worked out that this was $ 2 to $ 4.5 trillion per year , every year , for the last several years .
and it will continue , if we carry on with business as usual .
why is it that a one-off loss of $ 1.5 trillion in financial capital to a group of wall street firms attracts so much attention , whereas the ongoing loss per annum of twice this amount of natural capital is barely reported ?
we 've seen governments bail out the economy - what would a " bailout " for the environment look like ?
it would be comparatively modest .
let me give you a few indicating benchmarks .
today we have something like 100,000 conservation areas , covering some 10-11 percent of the earth 's land surface .
the teeb team believes that we are spending some $ 40-50 billion too little on making that conservation effective .
according to various estimates , these conservation areas produce some $ 4-5 trillion of utility per year .
today , spending on protected areas globally is less than $ 20 billion , and all we 're suggesting is an increase of another $ 50 billion a year to ensure the continuation of the benefits of these protected areas .
we 're not talking about a massive amount of money - single institutions have lost more than that in the current financial chaos .
but for various reasons it doesn ’ t get allocated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pavan sukhdev what are these reasons ?
for one , the loss of natural capital is a loss of public wealth .
eco-system services are public benefits that are pretty much free .
it is not individuals ' or shareholders ' wealth at stake , although it is , if you like , global shareholders ' wealth .
but it 's not private ownership , it 's public ownership .
these are things that are there for all to enjoy : we would dearly miss their absence and we would pay the earth to get them back , but right now , they 're free .
so the public nature of these goods and services is one reason .
to understand the second reason why loss of natural capital does n't grab headlines , we need to think of the frog analogy used by al gore in his book " an inconvenient truth " : if you put a frog in a beaker of water and gradually raise the temperature , it wo n't notice any change .
similarly , what is happening to us is happening continuously .
every year we lose forest , the climate gets worse , poor people 's water supplies and field nutrients decline .
but we see these losses so gradually that we do n't realize that things are getting worse .
whereas in the case of the financial markets it 's one short , sharp shock .
nonetheless , a lot of smart money has started to flow into environmental investment .
in north america , the percentage of venture capital spent on clean technology used to be around 2 percent in 2002 , but had risen to 17 percent by 2007 .
is there a risk that environmental concerns will be abandoned given the current slowdown in the global economy ? i do n't think so , because people are beginning to get the message . i never have to explain myself twice any more .
even two years ago , people 's eyes would glaze over .
now people want to know what needs to be done .
of course , the cost of the financial crisis means there will now be increased distributional pressure on how much can be allocated to solving environmental problems .
but my point is that this money is not much , considering how much is spent on other sectors .
there 's no need to think about it too much .
the time is now .
how viable is a rescue plan like this during a recession , which is what we 're facing right now ?
a $ 45 billion gap per annum is not the end of the world .
look at how much has been lost and how much is being allocated individually by governments in the us and europe - up to $ 700 billion .
to put things in context , the investment per annum of the eu in conservation areas is about 6 billion euros .
these are modest sums .
so economic disaster does n't necessarily have to mean ecological disaster too ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the financial crisis is reported extensively - the environmental one is n't no .
venture capitalists have understood something that the world , generally , has not .
as other businesses begin using the technology into which venture capital has been invested , they will find amazing and sizeable opportunities .

renewable energy is an extraordinary opportunity if you use it not just to fix the supply that comes to you and me in berlin and london , but to fix the supply needed by the world 's 2 billion who do n't have an energy supply - the poorest people in the world who do not actually have energy coming to their homes in the form of oil , coal or electricity .
there are vast opportunities here , in countries like india and china , africa and latin america , to apply well-researched technologies which provide , for example , modular solutions to bring light into the poor home .
just imagine what kind of change you could see - education coming down to a village level , children staying up in order to read . think of the tectonic shift than can be achieved just by shifting focus and providing micro-finance to villagers to implement renewable energy solutions .
and look at the number of people who can benefit from that .
these are the sort of things that smart business is looking at .
there is money in making more efficient equipment and implementing more efficient processes .
does the credit crunch make people more aware that being careful with natural capital is important too ?
yes .

as world poverty day draws attention to the issue , dw 's dennis stute speaks with activist vandana shiva about india 's huge hunger levels . dr. vandana shiva is a physicist , ecologist , activist and author .
in india she has established navdanya , a movement for biodiversity conservation and farmers ' rights .
she also directs the research foundation for science , technology and natural resource policy .
the un has declared oct .
17 as the international day for the eradication of poverty . dw-world.de : how has the food crisis affected india ?
vandana shiva : very severely .
prices of staples have literally doubled in the last year and that has meant that the poor who were already only eating half of what they should be eating are now eating a quarter of what they should be .
unfortunately , it is the poor who must make a living by working physically and what we 're basically doing is robbing them of their ability to earn a living .
in addition , when children do n't get enough food to eat or when a mother is malnourished and she gives birth to a low birth-weight child , we are creating generations of people deprived of full mental health and full physical health .
according to a new report , there are " alarming " levels of hunger in 12 indian states and " serious " levels in the remaining five .
what , in your view , is the reason for the widespread malnutrition ?
there are two very big reasons why india has emerged as the capital of hunger .
the first is the “ green revolution ” model of agriculture , which was actually a hunger-creating model proposed as a hunger solution .
but when you destroy food sources in pulses , in vegetables , in grains , in oil seeds and create monocultures of rice and wheat , you destroy the millets - the nutritious grains that have 40 times higher level of nutrition - and call them inferior grains and push them to extinction .
on the ground , you have less food per unit acre and you have less nutrition access per capita .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gmo crops require more water and provide less nutritional value , says shiva the second is related to the new thrust of the 1991 policies of trade liberalization which instead of focusing on food for people focused on exports of luxury cash crops to rich countries , destroying india 's food security base .
this was trade-driven and really put food on the back burner then , treated as something you do n't need policy for .
the food situation is particularly bad in the state of madhya pradesh .
why is this state doing even worse than the others ?
the two reasons madhya pradesh is more severely affected than others is that it 's a large forest state and it 's largely a tribal state .
the food security of the tribals came from abundant forest products including edible products from the forest 's produce .
mining and industrialization is so rampant that tribals are losing their food resources .
it 's also the state where the drought impact because of climate change has been felt very severely .
bundelkhan has had a drought and rainfall failure for four years - there has been no cultivation at all .
and that 's partly because the agricultural model is based on new seeds like hybrid seeds which need chemicals .
but that 's the stupidest thing you could do because climate change requires adaption to drought which means planting crops that are resilient to drought - the millets that use only 250 millimeters of rain .
but unfortunately the government , driven by international agencies like the world bank , has walked on the wrong road for a period of market volatility and climate uncertainty .
the combination is a recipe for hunger and famine .
we need to shift our focus from global markets and global trades to local food security and away from export crops to growing food and nutrition for our people .
in the past ten years , more than 140,000 farmers in india have committed suicide according to official figures .
why is their situation so desperate ?
the first suicide came in 1997 .
when the impact of the new policies of liberalizing the seed sector started to get felt and corporations like monsanto , who wanted to sell genetically modified seed , entered the market .
they started to sell non renewable hybrid seeds which meant the farmers had to spent huge amounts of money buying seed every year .
these seeds also needed irrigation and were vulnerable to pests to the farmers had to spend more money putting in irrigation systems and buying pesticides .
that meant a higher debt burden on farmers .
falling prices of the products and rising costs of production squeezed the farmers even further into debt .
and that is what has led to the spate of suicides .
how can you tackle the problem of hunger ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting food into the hands of the poor is difficult due to heavy subsidies i think the most urgent steps to be taken to tackle the problem are to actually develop the farming systems to produce more food per unit acre .
every assumption of industrial agriculture is wrong because it does not produce more food but uses more chemicals and more water per unit acre .
it produces more commodities for international trade per unit acre but it does not produce more food or more nutrition per unit acre .
models of farming that can increase food-production fivefold , ten fold , depending on your climatic conditions have evolved through the organic movement .
those models of biodiverse , ecological systems can solve the problem of hunger .
the second thing that needs to be done is to bring back food-first policies .
in india after independence we have not had hunger on the scale we are now witnessing .
we had a famine in 1942 which killed two million people .
we had enough food in the country but the british were extracting every bit of rice from bengal and exporting it for profit - exporting it to finance the war .
we drove that famine away through public policy that put food first through a universal public distribution system that meant everyone has a right to affordable food .
that was dismantled by the world bank and it has to be resurrected .
the poor must have food at affordable price instead of subsidizing global corporations .
what the government has to do is to buy , preferably organics , from the indian farmers and then subsidize the prices for the poor .
we would save our financial budgets , we would save our taxes and we would have more food at lower prices .
india this year is spending one trillion rupees in subsidies for global corporations to buy chemical fertilizers .
that 's the wrong way to go .
we can lower costs of production , increase output per acre , increase equity and distribution .
that is food sovereignty .
that is food security .
that is food first . dennis stute -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 17.10.2008 loss of natural capital costs more than bank crisis , says expert großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the financial crisis has left us unable to see the wood for the trees as the eu discusses the affordability of its carbon-reduction targets , economist pavan sukhdev told dw-world.de that the best things in life are free , but not for much longer .
the nature crunch could prove costly . once described as an " economist by profession and an ecologist at heart , " pavan sukhdev holds the chair of deutsche bank 's global market center and is director of the green accounting for indian states project , a study on the economic significance of biodiversity in india .
he also heads an ongoing global report funded by the german ministry for the environment and the european commission on " the economics of ecosystems & biodiversity " -lrb- teeb -rrb- , and is among the architects of the green new deal , spearheaded by the united nations environment program , which will be unveiled in london on oct .
22 .
dw-world.de : you said at the world conservation congress in barcelona last week that the economic burden of environmentally hostile practices like deforestation outweighs that of the bank crisis .
pavan sukhdev : the capital loss to financial firms in the city and wall street has been estimated as $ 1 trillion to $ 1.5 trillion .
in teeb 's first phase report which we presented in may , we looked at the extent of losses taking place as a result of deforestation and degradation .
we estimated the loss in human welfare as a capital item , and worked out that this was $ 2 to $ 4.5 trillion per year , every year , for the last several years .
and it will continue , if we carry on with business as usual .
why is it that a one-off loss of $ 1.5 trillion in financial capital to a group of wall street firms attracts so much attention , whereas the ongoing loss per annum of twice this amount of natural capital is barely reported ?
we 've seen governments bail out the economy - what would a " bailout " for the environment look like ?
it would be comparatively modest .
let me give you a few indicating benchmarks .
today we have something like 100,000 conservation areas , covering some 10-11 percent of the earth 's land surface .
the teeb team believes that we are spending some $ 40-50 billion too little on making that conservation effective .
according to various estimates , these conservation areas produce some $ 4-5 trillion of utility per year .
today , spending on protected areas globally is less than $ 20 billion , and all we 're suggesting is an increase of another $ 50 billion a year to ensure the continuation of the benefits of these protected areas .
we 're not talking about a massive amount of money - single institutions have lost more than that in the current financial chaos .
but for various reasons it doesn ’ t get allocated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pavan sukhdev what are these reasons ?
for one , the loss of natural capital is a loss of public wealth .
eco-system services are public benefits that are pretty much free .
it is not individuals ' or shareholders ' wealth at stake , although it is , if you like , global shareholders ' wealth .
but it 's not private ownership , it 's public ownership .
these are things that are there for all to enjoy : we would dearly miss their absence and we would pay the earth to get them back , but right now , they 're free .
so the public nature of these goods and services is one reason .
to understand the second reason why loss of natural capital does n't grab headlines , we need to think of the frog analogy used by al gore in his book " an inconvenient truth " : if you put a frog in a beaker of water and gradually raise the temperature , it wo n't notice any change .
similarly , what is happening to us is happening continuously .
every year we lose forest , the climate gets worse , poor people 's water supplies and field nutrients decline .
but we see these losses so gradually that we do n't realize that things are getting worse .
whereas in the case of the financial markets it 's one short , sharp shock .
nonetheless , a lot of smart money has started to flow into environmental investment .
in north america , the percentage of venture capital spent on clean technology used to be around 2 percent in 2002 , but had risen to 17 percent by 2007 .
is there a risk that environmental concerns will be abandoned given the current slowdown in the global economy ? i do n't think so , because people are beginning to get the message . i never have to explain myself twice any more .
even two years ago , people 's eyes would glaze over .
now people want to know what needs to be done .
of course , the cost of the financial crisis means there will now be increased distributional pressure on how much can be allocated to solving environmental problems .
but my point is that this money is not much , considering how much is spent on other sectors .
there 's no need to think about it too much .
the time is now .
how viable is a rescue plan like this during a recession , which is what we 're facing right now ?
a $ 45 billion gap per annum is not the end of the world .
look at how much has been lost and how much is being allocated individually by governments in the us and europe - up to $ 700 billion .
to put things in context , the investment per annum of the eu in conservation areas is about 6 billion euros .
these are modest sums .
so economic disaster does n't necessarily have to mean ecological disaster too ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the financial crisis is reported extensively - the environmental one is n't no .
venture capitalists have understood something that the world , generally , has not .
as other businesses begin using the technology into which venture capital has been invested , they will find amazing and sizeable opportunities .
i predict a tectonic shift in the way things are done .
renewable energy is an extraordinary opportunity if you use it not just to fix the supply that comes to you and me in berlin and london , but to fix the supply needed by the world 's 2 billion who do n't have an energy supply - the poorest people in the world who do not actually have energy coming to their homes in the form of oil , coal or electricity .

as world poverty day draws attention to the issue , dw 's dennis stute speaks with activist vandana shiva about india 's huge hunger levels . dr. vandana shiva is a physicist , ecologist , activist and author .
in india she has established navdanya , a movement for biodiversity conservation and farmers ' rights .
she also directs the research foundation for science , technology and natural resource policy .
the un has declared oct .
17 as the international day for the eradication of poverty . dw-world.de : how has the food crisis affected india ?
vandana shiva : very severely .
prices of staples have literally doubled in the last year and that has meant that the poor who were already only eating half of what they should be eating are now eating a quarter of what they should be .
unfortunately , it is the poor who must make a living by working physically and what we 're basically doing is robbing them of their ability to earn a living .
in addition , when children do n't get enough food to eat or when a mother is malnourished and she gives birth to a low birth-weight child , we are creating generations of people deprived of full mental health and full physical health .
according to a new report , there are " alarming " levels of hunger in 12 indian states and " serious " levels in the remaining five .
what , in your view , is the reason for the widespread malnutrition ?
there are two very big reasons why india has emerged as the capital of hunger .
the first is the “ green revolution ” model of agriculture , which was actually a hunger-creating model proposed as a hunger solution .
but when you destroy food sources in pulses , in vegetables , in grains , in oil seeds and create monocultures of rice and wheat , you destroy the millets - the nutritious grains that have 40 times higher level of nutrition - and call them inferior grains and push them to extinction .
on the ground , you have less food per unit acre and you have less nutrition access per capita .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gmo crops require more water and provide less nutritional value , says shiva the second is related to the new thrust of the 1991 policies of trade liberalization which instead of focusing on food for people focused on exports of luxury cash crops to rich countries , destroying india 's food security base .
this was trade-driven and really put food on the back burner then , treated as something you do n't need policy for .
the food situation is particularly bad in the state of madhya pradesh .
why is this state doing even worse than the others ?
the two reasons madhya pradesh is more severely affected than others is that it 's a large forest state and it 's largely a tribal state .
the food security of the tribals came from abundant forest products including edible products from the forest 's produce .
mining and industrialization is so rampant that tribals are losing their food resources .
it 's also the state where the drought impact because of climate change has been felt very severely .
bundelkhan has had a drought and rainfall failure for four years - there has been no cultivation at all .
and that 's partly because the agricultural model is based on new seeds like hybrid seeds which need chemicals .
but that 's the stupidest thing you could do because climate change requires adaption to drought which means planting crops that are resilient to drought - the millets that use only 250 millimeters of rain .
but unfortunately the government , driven by international agencies like the world bank , has walked on the wrong road for a period of market volatility and climate uncertainty .
the combination is a recipe for hunger and famine .
we need to shift our focus from global markets and global trades to local food security and away from export crops to growing food and nutrition for our people .
in the past ten years , more than 140,000 farmers in india have committed suicide according to official figures .
why is their situation so desperate ?
the first suicide came in 1997 .
when the impact of the new policies of liberalizing the seed sector started to get felt and corporations like monsanto , who wanted to sell genetically modified seed , entered the market .
they started to sell non renewable hybrid seeds which meant the farmers had to spent huge amounts of money buying seed every year .
these seeds also needed irrigation and were vulnerable to pests to the farmers had to spend more money putting in irrigation systems and buying pesticides .
that meant a higher debt burden on farmers .
falling prices of the products and rising costs of production squeezed the farmers even further into debt .
and that is what has led to the spate of suicides .
how can you tackle the problem of hunger ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting food into the hands of the poor is difficult due to heavy subsidies i think the most urgent steps to be taken to tackle the problem are to actually develop the farming systems to produce more food per unit acre .
every assumption of industrial agriculture is wrong because it does not produce more food but uses more chemicals and more water per unit acre .
it produces more commodities for international trade per unit acre but it does not produce more food or more nutrition per unit acre .
models of farming that can increase food-production fivefold , ten fold , depending on your climatic conditions have evolved through the organic movement .
those models of biodiverse , ecological systems can solve the problem of hunger .
the second thing that needs to be done is to bring back food-first policies .
in india after independence we have not had hunger on the scale we are now witnessing .
we had a famine in 1942 which killed two million people .
we had enough food in the country but the british were extracting every bit of rice from bengal and exporting it for profit - exporting it to finance the war .
we drove that famine away through public policy that put food first through a universal public distribution system that meant everyone has a right to affordable food .
that was dismantled by the world bank and it has to be resurrected .
the poor must have food at affordable price instead of subsidizing global corporations .
what the government has to do is to buy , preferably organics , from the indian farmers and then subsidize the prices for the poor .
we would save our financial budgets , we would save our taxes and we would have more food at lower prices .
india this year is spending one trillion rupees in subsidies for global corporations to buy chemical fertilizers .
that 's the wrong way to go .
we can lower costs of production , increase output per acre , increase equity and distribution .
that is food sovereignty .
that is food security .
that is food first . dennis stute -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as world poverty day draws attention to the issue , dw 's dennis stute speaks with activist vandana shiva about india 's huge hunger levels . dr. vandana shiva is a physicist , ecologist , activist and author .
in india she has established navdanya , a movement for biodiversity conservation and farmers ' rights .
she also directs the research foundation for science , technology and natural resource policy .
the un has declared oct .
17 as the international day for the eradication of poverty . dw-world.de : how has the food crisis affected india ?
vandana shiva : very severely .
prices of staples have literally doubled in the last year and that has meant that the poor who were already only eating half of what they should be eating are now eating a quarter of what they should be .
unfortunately , it is the poor who must make a living by working physically and what we 're basically doing is robbing them of their ability to earn a living .
in addition , when children do n't get enough food to eat or when a mother is malnourished and she gives birth to a low birth-weight child , we are creating generations of people deprived of full mental health and full physical health .
according to a new report , there are " alarming " levels of hunger in 12 indian states and " serious " levels in the remaining five .
what , in your view , is the reason for the widespread malnutrition ?
there are two very big reasons why india has emerged as the capital of hunger .
the first is the “ green revolution ” model of agriculture , which was actually a hunger-creating model proposed as a hunger solution .
but when you destroy food sources in pulses , in vegetables , in grains , in oil seeds and create monocultures of rice and wheat , you destroy the millets - the nutritious grains that have 40 times higher level of nutrition - and call them inferior grains and push them to extinction .
on the ground , you have less food per unit acre and you have less nutrition access per capita .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gmo crops require more water and provide less nutritional value , says shiva the second is related to the new thrust of the 1991 policies of trade liberalization which instead of focusing on food for people focused on exports of luxury cash crops to rich countries , destroying india 's food security base .
this was trade-driven and really put food on the back burner then , treated as something you do n't need policy for .
the food situation is particularly bad in the state of madhya pradesh .
why is this state doing even worse than the others ?
the two reasons madhya pradesh is more severely affected than others is that it 's a large forest state and it 's largely a tribal state .
the food security of the tribals came from abundant forest products including edible products from the forest 's produce .
mining and industrialization is so rampant that tribals are losing their food resources .
it 's also the state where the drought impact because of climate change has been felt very severely .
bundelkhan has had a drought and rainfall failure for four years - there has been no cultivation at all .
and that 's partly because the agricultural model is based on new seeds like hybrid seeds which need chemicals .
but that 's the stupidest thing you could do because climate change requires adaption to drought which means planting crops that are resilient to drought - the millets that use only 250 millimeters of rain .
but unfortunately the government , driven by international agencies like the world bank , has walked on the wrong road for a period of market volatility and climate uncertainty .
the combination is a recipe for hunger and famine .
we need to shift our focus from global markets and global trades to local food security and away from export crops to growing food and nutrition for our people .
in the past ten years , more than 140,000 farmers in india have committed suicide according to official figures .
why is their situation so desperate ?
the first suicide came in 1997 .
when the impact of the new policies of liberalizing the seed sector started to get felt and corporations like monsanto , who wanted to sell genetically modified seed , entered the market .
they started to sell non renewable hybrid seeds which meant the farmers had to spent huge amounts of money buying seed every year .
these seeds also needed irrigation and were vulnerable to pests to the farmers had to spend more money putting in irrigation systems and buying pesticides .
that meant a higher debt burden on farmers .
falling prices of the products and rising costs of production squeezed the farmers even further into debt .
and that is what has led to the spate of suicides .
how can you tackle the problem of hunger ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting food into the hands of the poor is difficult due to heavy subsidies i think the most urgent steps to be taken to tackle the problem are to actually develop the farming systems to produce more food per unit acre .
every assumption of industrial agriculture is wrong because it does not produce more food but uses more chemicals and more water per unit acre .
it produces more commodities for international trade per unit acre but it does not produce more food or more nutrition per unit acre .
models of farming that can increase food-production fivefold , ten fold , depending on your climatic conditions have evolved through the organic movement .
those models of biodiverse , ecological systems can solve the problem of hunger .
the second thing that needs to be done is to bring back food-first policies .
in india after independence we have not had hunger on the scale we are now witnessing .
we had a famine in 1942 which killed two million people .
we had enough food in the country but the british were extracting every bit of rice from bengal and exporting it for profit - exporting it to finance the war .
we drove that famine away through public policy that put food first through a universal public distribution system that meant everyone has a right to affordable food .
that was dismantled by the world bank and it has to be resurrected .
the poor must have food at affordable price instead of subsidizing global corporations .
what the government has to do is to buy , preferably organics , from the indian farmers and then subsidize the prices for the poor .
we would save our financial budgets , we would save our taxes and we would have more food at lower prices .
india this year is spending one trillion rupees in subsidies for global corporations to buy chemical fertilizers .
that 's the wrong way to go .
we can lower costs of production , increase output per acre , increase equity and distribution .
that is food sovereignty .
that is food security .
that is food first . dennis stute -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

will books as we know them soon be a thing of the past ?
a new generation of digital " e-readers " has the german publishing industry gearing up for a fast-moving digital future . electronic books were announced as the " next big thing " a decade ago .
but the technology that came out at the time failed to impress consumers , and made few inroads into the market .
now some new e-readers , predicted to be put on the market in europe in the near future , have publishing industry insiders preparing for major changes .
lightweight devices like amazon 's kindle and the sony reader have been the focus of intense interest since they celebrated their german coming-out party at the frankfurt book fair , which runs through oct .
19 .
e-books - stars of the frankfurt fair the press toasted the new readers as the " true stars " of this year 's fair .
but considering the changes they could represent for the staid publishing industry , players are eyeing them with a mixture of fascination and fear .
" overall , i think german publishers are very enthusiastic about e-books , " said thomas wilking , editor in chief of the german publishing trade magazine buchreport .
" they are just waiting for a device they think is attractive enough for a wide public . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sony is hoping its reader will impress europeans book fair organizers took an unscientific survey of 1,000 industry players on the future of the new technology , and published it just before the fair opened .
unfortunately , the data failed to paint any clear road map for the future .
more than 70 percent of respondents said they were ready for the digital challenge - but 60 percent of them had neither used e-readers nor downloaded e-books themselves .
meanwhile , a full 40 percent said they expect e-content to dominate the market by 2018 - compared with one-third of respondents who said e-books will never take over .
12 percent thought the new e-readers would be a short-lived flash in the pan .
' you could take 50 books to the beach ' jak boumans , a dutch media-content consultant who runs his own firm , electronic media reporting , is convinced e-books are here to stay .
but he estimates it will be at least 2030 before they are in wide usage , considering how many details still need to be ironed out , and how ingrained peoples ' attitudes are towards reading .
" this has been a topic for the last 30 years , but the mentality is still trying to catch up with the technology , " boumans said .
" e-readers mean people could go on holiday without packing a stack of heavy books - they can take 50 books with them in one device and still read it on the beach . "
observers praise the kindle and reader as being significantly improved from the last devices that tried to storm the market but failed .
the new devices have extended their battery life and traded the backlit computer screen for a paper-simulating " e-paper " that is less hard on the eyes .
the ritual of turning pages some book lovers wonder if an electronic device will ever really replace paper books , however .
johann schumandl , owner of a small independent book store in cologne , said he thinks people might accept e-readers for reading work documents .
but printed books will never disappear completely : " when you read a book you have the sense of touch , the haptic value , " he said .
" there is something ritualistic about reading a book , turning the pages . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : which e-reader will capture the market ?
boumans agrees that casual readers - who he refers to as " ink sniffers " - will be the last group to make the switch .
but he believes a new generation of people who grew up using ipods will see things differently .
" the only question they are going to have is , ' how many functions will this device combine for me ? " ' he said .
people have been predicting the demise of the bookstore for a long time now , and many now think e-books and e-readers could deliver the coup de grace .
twenty-five percent of respondents to the book fair study thought bookstores would largely disappear within half a century , with online distribution of paper books by firms such as amazon taking over .
copyright quandary some european bookstores seem to be trying to get ahead of the curve by being the first to promote e-books .
top german chain bookstore thalia struck a deal with sony to sell content for its reader devices in thalia stores and online .
assuming e-books do take hold , there are still many questions to be answered .
which reader - amazon 's , sony 's , or perhaps one from a european competitor , like the netherlands ' iliad - will capture the public 's fancy ?
each one has slightly different technical specifications , and is based on different technical platforms .
another big question is how the industry will deal with copyright protection .
some employ digital rights management -lrb- drm , -rrb- a kind of software lock on downloadable books , with the aim of avoiding the music industry 's fate .
since the advent of digital music , record companies have famously seen profits decimated by piracy and illegal downloading .
boumans opposes technological protection on content .
he supports the concept of a " social drm , " which would operate under a " name and shame " system : when a person buys electronic data , his or her name is attached to the file so anyone can see how it is passed around after that .
social pressure would correct the market .
' the ipod principle ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazon 's kindle is a big seller in the us ultimately , boumans says four things need to be in place before e-books really take off : a device , a portfolio of downloadable material , the download service - and the right price for content .
" that 's when you get what i call the ipod principle , " he said .
" people start downloading things and they are willing to pay for it . "
clearly it is difficult to imagine exactly what shape the digital-literature future will take .
according to buchreport editor wilking , the future may be even more unrecognizable than we can imagine .
for one thing , books may cease to be a collection of words on paper - or even e-paper .
" there are a lot of possibilities when it comes to e-publishing , " wilking said .
" people will be able to build in films and interactive elements .
things we ca n't even imagine yet . "
once these technical possibilities are there , he says , then the authors might start taking them into consideration , and writing for multimedia instead of just the page . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 17.10.2008 loss of natural capital costs more than bank crisis , says expert großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the financial crisis has left us unable to see the wood for the trees as the eu discusses the affordability of its carbon-reduction targets , economist pavan sukhdev told dw-world.de that the best things in life are free , but not for much longer .
the nature crunch could prove costly . once described as an " economist by profession and an ecologist at heart , " pavan sukhdev holds the chair of deutsche bank 's global market center and is director of the green accounting for indian states project , a study on the economic significance of biodiversity in india .
he also heads an ongoing global report funded by the german ministry for the environment and the european commission on " the economics of ecosystems & biodiversity " -lrb- teeb -rrb- , and is among the architects of the green new deal , spearheaded by the united nations environment program , which will be unveiled in london on oct .
22 .
dw-world.de : you said at the world conservation congress in barcelona last week that the economic burden of environmentally hostile practices like deforestation outweighs that of the bank crisis .
pavan sukhdev : the capital loss to financial firms in the city and wall street has been estimated as $ 1 trillion to $ 1.5 trillion .
in teeb 's first phase report which we presented in may , we looked at the extent of losses taking place as a result of deforestation and degradation .
we estimated the loss in human welfare as a capital item , and worked out that this was $ 2 to $ 4.5 trillion per year , every year , for the last several years .
and it will continue , if we carry on with business as usual .
why is it that a one-off loss of $ 1.5 trillion in financial capital to a group of wall street firms attracts so much attention , whereas the ongoing loss per annum of twice this amount of natural capital is barely reported ?
we 've seen governments bail out the economy - what would a " bailout " for the environment look like ?
it would be comparatively modest .
let me give you a few indicating benchmarks .
today we have something like 100,000 conservation areas , covering some 10-11 percent of the earth 's land surface .
the teeb team believes that we are spending some $ 40-50 billion too little on making that conservation effective .
according to various estimates , these conservation areas produce some $ 4-5 trillion of utility per year .
today , spending on protected areas globally is less than $ 20 billion , and all we 're suggesting is an increase of another $ 50 billion a year to ensure the continuation of the benefits of these protected areas .
we 're not talking about a massive amount of money - single institutions have lost more than that in the current financial chaos .
but for various reasons it doesn ’ t get allocated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pavan sukhdev what are these reasons ?
for one , the loss of natural capital is a loss of public wealth .
eco-system services are public benefits that are pretty much free .
it is not individuals ' or shareholders ' wealth at stake , although it is , if you like , global shareholders ' wealth .
but it 's not private ownership , it 's public ownership .
these are things that are there for all to enjoy : we would dearly miss their absence and we would pay the earth to get them back , but right now , they 're free .
so the public nature of these goods and services is one reason .
to understand the second reason why loss of natural capital does n't grab headlines , we need to think of the frog analogy used by al gore in his book " an inconvenient truth " : if you put a frog in a beaker of water and gradually raise the temperature , it wo n't notice any change .
similarly , what is happening to us is happening continuously .
every year we lose forest , the climate gets worse , poor people 's water supplies and field nutrients decline .
but we see these losses so gradually that we do n't realize that things are getting worse .
whereas in the case of the financial markets it 's one short , sharp shock .
nonetheless , a lot of smart money has started to flow into environmental investment .
in north america , the percentage of venture capital spent on clean technology used to be around 2 percent in 2002 , but had risen to 17 percent by 2007 .
is there a risk that environmental concerns will be abandoned given the current slowdown in the global economy ? i do n't think so , because people are beginning to get the message . i never have to explain myself twice any more .
even two years ago , people 's eyes would glaze over .
now people want to know what needs to be done .
of course , the cost of the financial crisis means there will now be increased distributional pressure on how much can be allocated to solving environmental problems .
but my point is that this money is not much , considering how much is spent on other sectors .
there 's no need to think about it too much .
the time is now .
how viable is a rescue plan like this during a recession , which is what we 're facing right now ?
a $ 45 billion gap per annum is not the end of the world .
look at how much has been lost and how much is being allocated individually by governments in the us and europe - up to $ 700 billion .
to put things in context , the investment per annum of the eu in conservation areas is about 6 billion euros .
these are modest sums .
so economic disaster does n't necessarily have to mean ecological disaster too ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the financial crisis is reported extensively - the environmental one is n't no .
venture capitalists have understood something that the world , generally , has not .
as other businesses begin using the technology into which venture capital has been invested , they will find amazing and sizeable opportunities .
i predict a tectonic shift in the way things are done .
renewable energy is an extraordinary opportunity if you use it not just to fix the supply that comes to you and me in berlin and london , but to fix the supply needed by the world 's 2 billion who do n't have an energy supply - the poorest people in the world who do not actually have energy coming to their homes in the form of oil , coal or electricity .
there are vast opportunities here , in countries like india and china , africa and latin america , to apply well-researched technologies which provide , for example , modular solutions to bring light into the poor home .
just imagine what kind of change you could see - education coming down to a village level , children staying up in order to read . think of the tectonic shift than can be achieved just by shifting focus and providing micro-finance to villagers to implement renewable energy solutions .
and look at the number of people who can benefit from that .
these are the sort of things that smart business is looking at .
there is money in making more efficient equipment and implementing more efficient processes .
does the credit crunch make people more aware that being careful with natural capital is important too ?
yes .
as the saying goes , a crisis is a terrible thing to waste . interview : jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

seeing more bench time than field play these days , the german midfielder expresses his frustration as well as his need to evaluate his future in the sport .
joachim loew insists his player is still a factor . midfielder torsten frings is the latest germany player toying with retirement as coach joachim loew now no longer guarantees anyone a place in the starting 11 .
" i am really thinking about it , retiring is more and more on my mind , " frings told friday 's edition of the bild daily .
the 31-year-old from werder bremen was a key player in germany 's run to third place at the 2006 world cup and also played at euro 2008 where germany lost the final against spain .
tired of being a benchwarmer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : also tired of being benched , kuranyi made headlines when he walked out during germany 's match against wales however , he was fielded only for seven minutes in saturday 's 2-1 win against russia and not at all on wednesday when germany beat wales 1-0 in another world cup qualifier .
frings insisted he was not sulking but named the fact that he was n't even told to warm up against wales " a humiliation . "
the statements of the 78-times capped frings come less than a week after schalke 04 forward kevin kuranyi left the team during the russia game .
kuranyi later apologized but loew said he would n't pick him again as long as he was coach .
frings told bild he missed " support , trust and respect " from loew , which led to the retirement considerations .

seeing more bench time than field play these days , the german midfielder expresses his frustration as well as his need to evaluate his future in the sport .
joachim loew insists his player is still a factor . midfielder torsten frings is the latest germany player toying with retirement as coach joachim loew now no longer guarantees anyone a place in the starting 11 .
" i am really thinking about it , retiring is more and more on my mind , " frings told friday 's edition of the bild daily .
the 31-year-old from werder bremen was a key player in germany 's run to third place at the 2006 world cup and also played at euro 2008 where germany lost the final against spain .
tired of being a benchwarmer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : also tired of being benched , kuranyi made headlines when he walked out during germany 's match against wales however , he was fielded only for seven minutes in saturday 's 2-1 win against russia and not at all on wednesday when germany beat wales 1-0 in another world cup qualifier .
frings insisted he was not sulking but named the fact that he was n't even told to warm up against wales " a humiliation . "
the statements of the 78-times capped frings come less than a week after schalke 04 forward kevin kuranyi left the team during the russia game .
kuranyi later apologized but loew said he would n't pick him again as long as he was coach .
frings told bild he missed " support , trust and respect " from loew , which led to the retirement considerations .
" i ca n't rule it out .
of course i am thinking about retirement .
not because i am sulking but because the last days were an eye-opener ...
at almost 32 you have a feeling for it .
i ca n't see a future for myself under him -lrb- loew -rrb- right now , " frings said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lowe stays close to ballack as the coach 's popularity with his players wanes frings has been through several injury setbacks over the past two years but insisted that he was still as good as thomas hitzlsperger or simon rolfes who have recently played in his place in midfield .
“ i hold nothing against simon rofes or thomas hitzlsperger .
but i also know that they are not better ! " he said .
coach still wants frings loew , for his part , said earlier this week that he picks his players based on present form and not on past merits .
he said after the wales match that he has talked with frings and wants him for the 2010 world cup in south africa .
" i expressed my appreciation .
players who do n't play are naturally dissatisfied .
but that 's a situation i want . ”
" i know he can perform well and that he will perform well .
for now he has to live with this .
i continue to have faith in him , " said loew . dpa news agency -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the board of directors of the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- decided that the rule , which states that germans have to own the majority of shares in bundesliga clubs and have to have the majority of votes in clubs , should remain in place , the dfl announced thursday .
the proposal to keep the rule in place is to be put to the general dfl body .
to have it changed a two / thirds majority of the dfl membership , as well as of the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- would have to pass it .
at a press conference , dfl president reinhard rauball said that the decision was taken after a thorough discussion and consideration of the arguments put forward by hanover 96 .
" the bundesliga lives from its stability and continuity .
this has to be maintained to ensure that the competition remains fair , ” he added hanover 96 officials had earlier called on the dfl to change the ruling to allow them to attract foreign investors for their club .
martin kind , president of hanover 96 , said that more and more clubs are siding with the north german club .
" we do n't yet have 75 percent , so the recommendations of the league 's board of directors will pass , " he added .
additionally it was decided that the league cup would not be held in 2009 .
the cup , which is a pre-season playoff between the top five teams in the league , was not held this year .
the teams will have to forgo any extra proceeds that would have been earned through ticket sales to the cup ticket . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the vote , 476 members supported chancellor angela merkel 's government and 99 were against . bolstering tottering banks the package aims to shore up confidence in banks following weeks of market turmoil .
it foresees up to 400 billion euros in lending guarantees for banks .
on top of that , up to 80 billion euros are to be made available to recapitalize banks and buy up risky assets if necessary while another 20 billion euros is to back up the guarantees . the sums are considered a maximum , and might not all be spent if the financial crisis eases . chancellor merkel unveiled the plan on monday this week as part of a concerted effort by governments around the world to stabilize markets and help troubled financial institutions limp through the crisis . the current efforts differ from the $ 700-billion takeover of bad assets by washington last month , since they aim to breathe life back into world banks paralyzed by the crisis that began as a crash in the us subprime mortgage market . a plan for citizens , not for bankers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos heard the concerns towards the plan and reacted german economics minister michael glos insisted that the government 's plan was aimed at protecting the nation 's citizens rather than the bankers .
there was no reason for pessimism about the outlook for the economy . " the opposite , " he said .
" we can solve the problems . " chancellor angela merkel has insisted the bailout would help avert further harm to europe 's biggest economy , which is expected to grind to a near-halt next year . in an unusual move to save time , the bill was then emailed back to german government offices , a few hundred meters away , for its final formalities , including a signature by the finance minister , the chancellor and president horst koehler . most of the euro zone nations and some allies have agreed to identical aid packages , each comprising a huge guarantee for interbank lending and semi-nationalizations of banks by state equity funds . germany has not identified which banks need rescuing , but the nine landesbank companies owned by the states are seen as the weakest units .
two of them , westlb and bayernlb , were hurt by investing in low-grade derivatives . news agency afp quoted a financial source saying germany 's biggest bank , deutsche bank , would not seek state aid .
" deutsche bank 's capital structure is very strong , as a result there is no need to seek state aid , " afp quoted the unnamed source as saying .
the bundestag agreed to the plan amid signs of an element of calm returning to european share markets friday after days of turbulence .
however , the german parliament 's backing for the plan is unlikely to save europe 's biggest economy from a sharp downturn as the financial crisis hits growth around the world . in the run-up to the plan 's passage through parliament , the german government slashed its 2009 economic growth forecast to a feeble 0.2 percent .
party meetings lead to unease and discontent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan is seen by some as a quick fix not long-term solution despite being approved by merkel 's cabinet on monday and by the country 's 16 states on thursday , the plan was still being fiercely debated on thursday evening during a round of party meetings .
the social democrats , who initially signaled their full support for the plan , called for a revision of the proposed bill before friday 's bundestag debate .
the spd insisted that a caveat must be added that makes it clear that responsibility for any losses to the state through the package must be taken by those german banks accepting aid .
the free market liberal opposition free democrats party -lrb- fdp -rrb- also decided after its previously unanimous support for the package that the handling of the current financial crisis needed stricter controls , calling for a more future-orientated plan which would bolster the german economy against further demands .
guido westerwelle , leader of the fdp , also warned the government not to give up its target to curb spending and balance the budget over the crisis .
both the green party and the left party emerged from their meetings with a more critical stance , saying that the level of parliamentary control over the package was insufficient .
both made it clear that the parliamentary " cooperation committee , " which would oversee the implementation of the package , had to guarantee " effective and thorough control of the federation for the banks " while government control of the plan had to be strengthened .
" it 's a 500-billion-euro blank cheque , " said green parliamentary chief renate kuenast . left party unanimously rejects plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oskar lafontaine : show me the money the opposition left party unanimously rejected the rescue package at its meeting .
the left party 's parliamentary group accused the government of not recognizing the full extent of the recession threat facing germany and that , instead of a financial sticking plaster , the country needed a full reform of its economic program .
left party leader oskar lafontaine called for measures to boost domestic demand , adding that many germans found the cabinet 's multi-billion bank rescue package hard to fathom as they suffered the effects of a weakening economy .
" when we asked for more money for hartz iv -lrb- unemployment benefits -rrb- , the answer was ' there 's no money . '
when we asked for more money for pensioners , the answer was ' there 's no money , " ' lafontaine said .

in the vote , 476 members supported chancellor angela merkel 's government and 99 were against . bolstering tottering banks the package aims to shore up confidence in banks following weeks of market turmoil .
it foresees up to 400 billion euros in lending guarantees for banks .
on top of that , up to 80 billion euros are to be made available to recapitalize banks and buy up risky assets if necessary while another 20 billion euros is to back up the guarantees . the sums are considered a maximum , and might not all be spent if the financial crisis eases . chancellor merkel unveiled the plan on monday this week as part of a concerted effort by governments around the world to stabilize markets and help troubled financial institutions limp through the crisis . the current efforts differ from the $ 700-billion takeover of bad assets by washington last month , since they aim to breathe life back into world banks paralyzed by the crisis that began as a crash in the us subprime mortgage market . a plan for citizens , not for bankers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos heard the concerns towards the plan and reacted german economics minister michael glos insisted that the government 's plan was aimed at protecting the nation 's citizens rather than the bankers .
there was no reason for pessimism about the outlook for the economy . " the opposite , " he said .
" we can solve the problems . " chancellor angela merkel has insisted the bailout would help avert further harm to europe 's biggest economy , which is expected to grind to a near-halt next year . in an unusual move to save time , the bill was then emailed back to german government offices , a few hundred meters away , for its final formalities , including a signature by the finance minister , the chancellor and president horst koehler . most of the euro zone nations and some allies have agreed to identical aid packages , each comprising a huge guarantee for interbank lending and semi-nationalizations of banks by state equity funds . germany has not identified which banks need rescuing , but the nine landesbank companies owned by the states are seen as the weakest units .
two of them , westlb and bayernlb , were hurt by investing in low-grade derivatives . news agency afp quoted a financial source saying germany 's biggest bank , deutsche bank , would not seek state aid .
" deutsche bank 's capital structure is very strong , as a result there is no need to seek state aid , " afp quoted the unnamed source as saying .
the bundestag agreed to the plan amid signs of an element of calm returning to european share markets friday after days of turbulence .
however , the german parliament 's backing for the plan is unlikely to save europe 's biggest economy from a sharp downturn as the financial crisis hits growth around the world . in the run-up to the plan 's passage through parliament , the german government slashed its 2009 economic growth forecast to a feeble 0.2 percent .
party meetings lead to unease and discontent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan is seen by some as a quick fix not long-term solution despite being approved by merkel 's cabinet on monday and by the country 's 16 states on thursday , the plan was still being fiercely debated on thursday evening during a round of party meetings .
the social democrats , who initially signaled their full support for the plan , called for a revision of the proposed bill before friday 's bundestag debate .
the spd insisted that a caveat must be added that makes it clear that responsibility for any losses to the state through the package must be taken by those german banks accepting aid .
the free market liberal opposition free democrats party -lrb- fdp -rrb- also decided after its previously unanimous support for the package that the handling of the current financial crisis needed stricter controls , calling for a more future-orientated plan which would bolster the german economy against further demands .
guido westerwelle , leader of the fdp , also warned the government not to give up its target to curb spending and balance the budget over the crisis .
both the green party and the left party emerged from their meetings with a more critical stance , saying that the level of parliamentary control over the package was insufficient .
both made it clear that the parliamentary " cooperation committee , " which would oversee the implementation of the package , had to guarantee " effective and thorough control of the federation for the banks " while government control of the plan had to be strengthened .

seeing more bench time than field play these days , the german midfielder expresses his frustration as well as his need to evaluate his future in the sport .
joachim loew insists his player is still a factor . midfielder torsten frings is the latest germany player toying with retirement as coach joachim loew now no longer guarantees anyone a place in the starting 11 .
" i am really thinking about it , retiring is more and more on my mind , " frings told friday 's edition of the bild daily .
the 31-year-old from werder bremen was a key player in germany 's run to third place at the 2006 world cup and also played at euro 2008 where germany lost the final against spain .
tired of being a benchwarmer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : also tired of being benched , kuranyi made headlines when he walked out during germany 's match against wales however , he was fielded only for seven minutes in saturday 's 2-1 win against russia and not at all on wednesday when germany beat wales 1-0 in another world cup qualifier .
frings insisted he was not sulking but named the fact that he was n't even told to warm up against wales " a humiliation . "
the statements of the 78-times capped frings come less than a week after schalke 04 forward kevin kuranyi left the team during the russia game .
kuranyi later apologized but loew said he would n't pick him again as long as he was coach .
frings told bild he missed " support , trust and respect " from loew , which led to the retirement considerations .
" i ca n't rule it out .
of course i am thinking about retirement .
not because i am sulking but because the last days were an eye-opener ...
at almost 32 you have a feeling for it .
i ca n't see a future for myself under him -lrb- loew -rrb- right now , " frings said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lowe stays close to ballack as the coach 's popularity with his players wanes frings has been through several injury setbacks over the past two years but insisted that he was still as good as thomas hitzlsperger or simon rolfes who have recently played in his place in midfield .
“ i hold nothing against simon rofes or thomas hitzlsperger .
but i also know that they are not better ! " he said .
coach still wants frings loew , for his part , said earlier this week that he picks his players based on present form and not on past merits .
he said after the wales match that he has talked with frings and wants him for the 2010 world cup in south africa .
" i expressed my appreciation .
players who do n't play are naturally dissatisfied .
but that 's a situation i want . ”
" i know he can perform well and that he will perform well .
for now he has to live with this .
i continue to have faith in him , " said loew . dpa news agency -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

just blocks away , some 300 people demonstrated against what they called the " islamisation of europe . " located in berlin 's pankow district , the 1.6 million-euro -lrb- $ 2.15-million -rrb- mosque has a 12-meter -lrb- 39-foot -rrb- high minaret and can hold 500 worshippers .
built for members of the ahmadiyya muslim community , the mosque was inaugurated on thursday , oct .
16 , with a celebration attended by approximately 300 people , including berlin mayor klaus wowereit .
according to wowereit , the mosque symbolizes " religious and cultural tolerance " in berlin .
his comments may have been overly optimistic , though , given that hundreds of protesting residents and the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- were gathered only blocks away from the site .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors said they were concerned about the abuse of religious freedom the demonstrators held banners with statements such as , " stop the islamisation of europe " and " stop the abuse of religious freedom . "
a petition against the construction of the mosque had also gathered some 20,000 signatures .
construction plagued by vandalism the ahmadiyya mosque has been a source of controversy since its building plans were announced in 2006 , with attacks on the site hindering its construction .
ijaz ahmad , spokesperson for the mosque , is hopeful however that the new two-story building will help bring clashing muslims and non-muslims in berlin closer together .
" the mosque will be a hub of social activity , not just for praying , " she said .
" it will play a role in boosting integration and promoting dialogue with politicians and other religious groups . "
a local citizens ' group does n't seem to see integration in the cards though .
" we have a big problem with sects that put religion above everything else , allow the beating of women and deny equal rights , " the group said on its web site .
muslims seek asylum in germany berlin is home to about 220,000 muslims , with only 200 belonging to the ahmadiyyah community .
ahmadiyyah 's muslim roots are a source of debate , however , as it is not recognized by some mainstream muslim groups on account of different beliefs .
according to the ahmadiyyah group , it has 30,000 members in germany , many of whom came to the country seeking asylum from religious persecution in pakistan and other islamic countries . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

just blocks away , some 300 people demonstrated against what they called the " islamisation of europe . " located in berlin 's pankow district , the 1.6 million-euro -lrb- $ 2.15-million -rrb- mosque has a 12-meter -lrb- 39-foot -rrb- high minaret and can hold 500 worshippers .
built for members of the ahmadiyya muslim community , the mosque was inaugurated on thursday , oct .
16 , with a celebration attended by approximately 300 people , including berlin mayor klaus wowereit .
according to wowereit , the mosque symbolizes " religious and cultural tolerance " in berlin .
his comments may have been overly optimistic , though , given that hundreds of protesting residents and the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- were gathered only blocks away from the site .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors said they were concerned about the abuse of religious freedom the demonstrators held banners with statements such as , " stop the islamisation of europe " and " stop the abuse of religious freedom . "
a petition against the construction of the mosque had also gathered some 20,000 signatures .
construction plagued by vandalism the ahmadiyya mosque has been a source of controversy since its building plans were announced in 2006 , with attacks on the site hindering its construction .
ijaz ahmad , spokesperson for the mosque , is hopeful however that the new two-story building will help bring clashing muslims and non-muslims in berlin closer together .
" the mosque will be a hub of social activity , not just for praying , " she said .
" it will play a role in boosting integration and promoting dialogue with politicians and other religious groups . "
a local citizens ' group does n't seem to see integration in the cards though .
" we have a big problem with sects that put religion above everything else , allow the beating of women and deny equal rights , " the group said on its web site .
muslims seek asylum in germany berlin is home to about 220,000 muslims , with only 200 belonging to the ahmadiyyah community .
ahmadiyyah 's muslim roots are a source of debate , however , as it is not recognized by some mainstream muslim groups on account of different beliefs .
according to the ahmadiyyah group , it has 30,000 members in germany , many of whom came to the country seeking asylum from religious persecution in pakistan and other islamic countries . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as world poverty day draws attention to the issue , dw 's dennis stute speaks with activist vandana shiva about india 's huge hunger levels . dr. vandana shiva is a physicist , ecologist , activist and author .
in india she has established navdanya , a movement for biodiversity conservation and farmers ' rights .
she also directs the research foundation for science , technology and natural resource policy .
the un has declared oct .
17 as the international day for the eradication of poverty . dw-world.de : how has the food crisis affected india ?
vandana shiva : very severely .
prices of staples have literally doubled in the last year and that has meant that the poor who were already only eating half of what they should be eating are now eating a quarter of what they should be .
unfortunately , it is the poor who must make a living by working physically and what we 're basically doing is robbing them of their ability to earn a living .
in addition , when children do n't get enough food to eat or when a mother is malnourished and she gives birth to a low birth-weight child , we are creating generations of people deprived of full mental health and full physical health .
according to a new report , there are " alarming " levels of hunger in 12 indian states and " serious " levels in the remaining five .
what , in your view , is the reason for the widespread malnutrition ?
there are two very big reasons why india has emerged as the capital of hunger .
the first is the “ green revolution ” model of agriculture , which was actually a hunger-creating model proposed as a hunger solution .
but when you destroy food sources in pulses , in vegetables , in grains , in oil seeds and create monocultures of rice and wheat , you destroy the millets - the nutritious grains that have 40 times higher level of nutrition - and call them inferior grains and push them to extinction .
on the ground , you have less food per unit acre and you have less nutrition access per capita .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gmo crops require more water and provide less nutritional value , says shiva the second is related to the new thrust of the 1991 policies of trade liberalization which instead of focusing on food for people focused on exports of luxury cash crops to rich countries , destroying india 's food security base .
this was trade-driven and really put food on the back burner then , treated as something you do n't need policy for .
the food situation is particularly bad in the state of madhya pradesh .
why is this state doing even worse than the others ?
the two reasons madhya pradesh is more severely affected than others is that it 's a large forest state and it 's largely a tribal state .
the food security of the tribals came from abundant forest products including edible products from the forest 's produce .
mining and industrialization is so rampant that tribals are losing their food resources .
it 's also the state where the drought impact because of climate change has been felt very severely .
bundelkhan has had a drought and rainfall failure for four years - there has been no cultivation at all .
and that 's partly because the agricultural model is based on new seeds like hybrid seeds which need chemicals .
but that 's the stupidest thing you could do because climate change requires adaption to drought which means planting crops that are resilient to drought - the millets that use only 250 millimeters of rain .
but unfortunately the government , driven by international agencies like the world bank , has walked on the wrong road for a period of market volatility and climate uncertainty .
the combination is a recipe for hunger and famine .
we need to shift our focus from global markets and global trades to local food security and away from export crops to growing food and nutrition for our people .
in the past ten years , more than 140,000 farmers in india have committed suicide according to official figures .
why is their situation so desperate ?
the first suicide came in 1997 .
when the impact of the new policies of liberalizing the seed sector started to get felt and corporations like monsanto , who wanted to sell genetically modified seed , entered the market .
they started to sell non renewable hybrid seeds which meant the farmers had to spent huge amounts of money buying seed every year .
these seeds also needed irrigation and were vulnerable to pests to the farmers had to spend more money putting in irrigation systems and buying pesticides .
that meant a higher debt burden on farmers .
falling prices of the products and rising costs of production squeezed the farmers even further into debt .
and that is what has led to the spate of suicides .
how can you tackle the problem of hunger ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting food into the hands of the poor is difficult due to heavy subsidies i think the most urgent steps to be taken to tackle the problem are to actually develop the farming systems to produce more food per unit acre .
every assumption of industrial agriculture is wrong because it does not produce more food but uses more chemicals and more water per unit acre .
it produces more commodities for international trade per unit acre but it does not produce more food or more nutrition per unit acre .
models of farming that can increase food-production fivefold , ten fold , depending on your climatic conditions have evolved through the organic movement .
those models of biodiverse , ecological systems can solve the problem of hunger .
the second thing that needs to be done is to bring back food-first policies .
in india after independence we have not had hunger on the scale we are now witnessing .
we had a famine in 1942 which killed two million people .
we had enough food in the country but the british were extracting every bit of rice from bengal and exporting it for profit - exporting it to finance the war .
we drove that famine away through public policy that put food first through a universal public distribution system that meant everyone has a right to affordable food .
that was dismantled by the world bank and it has to be resurrected .
the poor must have food at affordable price instead of subsidizing global corporations .
what the government has to do is to buy , preferably organics , from the indian farmers and then subsidize the prices for the poor .
we would save our financial budgets , we would save our taxes and we would have more food at lower prices .
india this year is spending one trillion rupees in subsidies for global corporations to buy chemical fertilizers .
that 's the wrong way to go .
we can lower costs of production , increase output per acre , increase equity and distribution .
that is food sovereignty .
that is food security .
that is food first . dennis stute -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 17.10.2008 european publishers gear up for brave new world of e-books großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are ink and paper a thing of the past ?
will books as we know them soon be a thing of the past ?
a new generation of digital " e-readers " has the german publishing industry gearing up for a fast-moving digital future . electronic books were announced as the " next big thing " a decade ago .
but the technology that came out at the time failed to impress consumers , and made few inroads into the market .
now some new e-readers , predicted to be put on the market in europe in the near future , have publishing industry insiders preparing for major changes .
lightweight devices like amazon 's kindle and the sony reader have been the focus of intense interest since they celebrated their german coming-out party at the frankfurt book fair , which runs through oct .
19 .
e-books - stars of the frankfurt fair the press toasted the new readers as the " true stars " of this year 's fair .
but considering the changes they could represent for the staid publishing industry , players are eyeing them with a mixture of fascination and fear .
" overall , i think german publishers are very enthusiastic about e-books , " said thomas wilking , editor in chief of the german publishing trade magazine buchreport .
" they are just waiting for a device they think is attractive enough for a wide public . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sony is hoping its reader will impress europeans book fair organizers took an unscientific survey of 1,000 industry players on the future of the new technology , and published it just before the fair opened .
unfortunately , the data failed to paint any clear road map for the future .
more than 70 percent of respondents said they were ready for the digital challenge - but 60 percent of them had neither used e-readers nor downloaded e-books themselves .
meanwhile , a full 40 percent said they expect e-content to dominate the market by 2018 - compared with one-third of respondents who said e-books will never take over .
12 percent thought the new e-readers would be a short-lived flash in the pan .
' you could take 50 books to the beach ' jak boumans , a dutch media-content consultant who runs his own firm , electronic media reporting , is convinced e-books are here to stay .
but he estimates it will be at least 2030 before they are in wide usage , considering how many details still need to be ironed out , and how ingrained peoples ' attitudes are towards reading .
" this has been a topic for the last 30 years , but the mentality is still trying to catch up with the technology , " boumans said .
" e-readers mean people could go on holiday without packing a stack of heavy books - they can take 50 books with them in one device and still read it on the beach . "
observers praise the kindle and reader as being significantly improved from the last devices that tried to storm the market but failed .
the new devices have extended their battery life and traded the backlit computer screen for a paper-simulating " e-paper " that is less hard on the eyes .
the ritual of turning pages some book lovers wonder if an electronic device will ever really replace paper books , however .
johann schumandl , owner of a small independent book store in cologne , said he thinks people might accept e-readers for reading work documents .
but printed books will never disappear completely : " when you read a book you have the sense of touch , the haptic value , " he said .
" there is something ritualistic about reading a book , turning the pages . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : which e-reader will capture the market ?
boumans agrees that casual readers - who he refers to as " ink sniffers " - will be the last group to make the switch .
but he believes a new generation of people who grew up using ipods will see things differently .
" the only question they are going to have is , ' how many functions will this device combine for me ? " ' he said .
people have been predicting the demise of the bookstore for a long time now , and many now think e-books and e-readers could deliver the coup de grace .
twenty-five percent of respondents to the book fair study thought bookstores would largely disappear within half a century , with online distribution of paper books by firms such as amazon taking over .
copyright quandary some european bookstores seem to be trying to get ahead of the curve by being the first to promote e-books .
top german chain bookstore thalia struck a deal with sony to sell content for its reader devices in thalia stores and online .
assuming e-books do take hold , there are still many questions to be answered .
which reader - amazon 's , sony 's , or perhaps one from a european competitor , like the netherlands ' iliad - will capture the public 's fancy ?
each one has slightly different technical specifications , and is based on different technical platforms .
another big question is how the industry will deal with copyright protection .
some employ digital rights management -lrb- drm , -rrb- a kind of software lock on downloadable books , with the aim of avoiding the music industry 's fate .
since the advent of digital music , record companies have famously seen profits decimated by piracy and illegal downloading .
boumans opposes technological protection on content .
he supports the concept of a " social drm , " which would operate under a " name and shame " system : when a person buys electronic data , his or her name is attached to the file so anyone can see how it is passed around after that .
social pressure would correct the market .
' the ipod principle ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazon 's kindle is a big seller in the us ultimately , boumans says four things need to be in place before e-books really take off : a device , a portfolio of downloadable material , the download service - and the right price for content .
" that 's when you get what i call the ipod principle , " he said .
" people start downloading things and they are willing to pay for it . "
clearly it is difficult to imagine exactly what shape the digital-literature future will take .
according to buchreport editor wilking , the future may be even more unrecognizable than we can imagine .
for one thing , books may cease to be a collection of words on paper - or even e-paper .
" there are a lot of possibilities when it comes to e-publishing , " wilking said .
" people will be able to build in films and interactive elements .
things we ca n't even imagine yet . "
once these technical possibilities are there , he says , then the authors might start taking them into consideration , and writing for multimedia instead of just the page . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the vote , 476 members supported chancellor angela merkel 's government and 99 were against . bolstering tottering banks the package aims to shore up confidence in banks following weeks of market turmoil .
it foresees up to 400 billion euros in lending guarantees for banks .
on top of that , up to 80 billion euros are to be made available to recapitalize banks and buy up risky assets if necessary while another 20 billion euros is to back up the guarantees . the sums are considered a maximum , and might not all be spent if the financial crisis eases . chancellor merkel unveiled the plan on monday this week as part of a concerted effort by governments around the world to stabilize markets and help troubled financial institutions limp through the crisis . the current efforts differ from the $ 700-billion takeover of bad assets by washington last month , since they aim to breathe life back into world banks paralyzed by the crisis that began as a crash in the us subprime mortgage market . a plan for citizens , not for bankers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos heard the concerns towards the plan and reacted german economics minister michael glos insisted that the government 's plan was aimed at protecting the nation 's citizens rather than the bankers .
there was no reason for pessimism about the outlook for the economy . " the opposite , " he said .
" we can solve the problems . " chancellor angela merkel has insisted the bailout would help avert further harm to europe 's biggest economy , which is expected to grind to a near-halt next year . in an unusual move to save time , the bill was then emailed back to german government offices , a few hundred meters away , for its final formalities , including a signature by the finance minister , the chancellor and president horst koehler . most of the euro zone nations and some allies have agreed to identical aid packages , each comprising a huge guarantee for interbank lending and semi-nationalizations of banks by state equity funds . germany has not identified which banks need rescuing , but the nine landesbank companies owned by the states are seen as the weakest units .
two of them , westlb and bayernlb , were hurt by investing in low-grade derivatives . news agency afp quoted a financial source saying germany 's biggest bank , deutsche bank , would not seek state aid .
" deutsche bank 's capital structure is very strong , as a result there is no need to seek state aid , " afp quoted the unnamed source as saying .
the bundestag agreed to the plan amid signs of an element of calm returning to european share markets friday after days of turbulence .
however , the german parliament 's backing for the plan is unlikely to save europe 's biggest economy from a sharp downturn as the financial crisis hits growth around the world . in the run-up to the plan 's passage through parliament , the german government slashed its 2009 economic growth forecast to a feeble 0.2 percent .
party meetings lead to unease and discontent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plan is seen by some as a quick fix not long-term solution despite being approved by merkel 's cabinet on monday and by the country 's 16 states on thursday , the plan was still being fiercely debated on thursday evening during a round of party meetings .
the social democrats , who initially signaled their full support for the plan , called for a revision of the proposed bill before friday 's bundestag debate .
the spd insisted that a caveat must be added that makes it clear that responsibility for any losses to the state through the package must be taken by those german banks accepting aid .
the free market liberal opposition free democrats party -lrb- fdp -rrb- also decided after its previously unanimous support for the package that the handling of the current financial crisis needed stricter controls , calling for a more future-orientated plan which would bolster the german economy against further demands .
guido westerwelle , leader of the fdp , also warned the government not to give up its target to curb spending and balance the budget over the crisis .
both the green party and the left party emerged from their meetings with a more critical stance , saying that the level of parliamentary control over the package was insufficient .
both made it clear that the parliamentary " cooperation committee , " which would oversee the implementation of the package , had to guarantee " effective and thorough control of the federation for the banks " while government control of the plan had to be strengthened .
" it 's a 500-billion-euro blank cheque , " said green parliamentary chief renate kuenast . left party unanimously rejects plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oskar lafontaine : show me the money the opposition left party unanimously rejected the rescue package at its meeting .
the left party 's parliamentary group accused the government of not recognizing the full extent of the recession threat facing germany and that , instead of a financial sticking plaster , the country needed a full reform of its economic program .
left party leader oskar lafontaine called for measures to boost domestic demand , adding that many germans found the cabinet 's multi-billion bank rescue package hard to fathom as they suffered the effects of a weakening economy .
" when we asked for more money for hartz iv -lrb- unemployment benefits -rrb- , the answer was ' there 's no money . '
when we asked for more money for pensioners , the answer was ' there 's no money , " ' lafontaine said .
" people are surprised that , all of a sudden , 500 billion euros are readily available to manage the crisis ... the people do n't understand that any more , " he said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

will books as we know them soon be a thing of the past ?
a new generation of digital " e-readers " has the german publishing industry gearing up for a fast-moving digital future . electronic books were announced as the " next big thing " a decade ago .
but the technology that came out at the time failed to impress consumers , and made few inroads into the market .
now some new e-readers , predicted to be put on the market in europe in the near future , have publishing industry insiders preparing for major changes .
lightweight devices like amazon 's kindle and the sony reader have been the focus of intense interest since they celebrated their german coming-out party at the frankfurt book fair , which runs through oct .
19 .
e-books - stars of the frankfurt fair the press toasted the new readers as the " true stars " of this year 's fair .
but considering the changes they could represent for the staid publishing industry , players are eyeing them with a mixture of fascination and fear .
" overall , i think german publishers are very enthusiastic about e-books , " said thomas wilking , editor in chief of the german publishing trade magazine buchreport .
" they are just waiting for a device they think is attractive enough for a wide public . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sony is hoping its reader will impress europeans book fair organizers took an unscientific survey of 1,000 industry players on the future of the new technology , and published it just before the fair opened .
unfortunately , the data failed to paint any clear road map for the future .
more than 70 percent of respondents said they were ready for the digital challenge - but 60 percent of them had neither used e-readers nor downloaded e-books themselves .
meanwhile , a full 40 percent said they expect e-content to dominate the market by 2018 - compared with one-third of respondents who said e-books will never take over .
12 percent thought the new e-readers would be a short-lived flash in the pan .
' you could take 50 books to the beach ' jak boumans , a dutch media-content consultant who runs his own firm , electronic media reporting , is convinced e-books are here to stay .
but he estimates it will be at least 2030 before they are in wide usage , considering how many details still need to be ironed out , and how ingrained peoples ' attitudes are towards reading .
" this has been a topic for the last 30 years , but the mentality is still trying to catch up with the technology , " boumans said .
" e-readers mean people could go on holiday without packing a stack of heavy books - they can take 50 books with them in one device and still read it on the beach . "
observers praise the kindle and reader as being significantly improved from the last devices that tried to storm the market but failed .
the new devices have extended their battery life and traded the backlit computer screen for a paper-simulating " e-paper " that is less hard on the eyes .
the ritual of turning pages some book lovers wonder if an electronic device will ever really replace paper books , however .
johann schumandl , owner of a small independent book store in cologne , said he thinks people might accept e-readers for reading work documents .
but printed books will never disappear completely : " when you read a book you have the sense of touch , the haptic value , " he said .
" there is something ritualistic about reading a book , turning the pages . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : which e-reader will capture the market ?
boumans agrees that casual readers - who he refers to as " ink sniffers " - will be the last group to make the switch .
but he believes a new generation of people who grew up using ipods will see things differently .
" the only question they are going to have is , ' how many functions will this device combine for me ? " ' he said .
people have been predicting the demise of the bookstore for a long time now , and many now think e-books and e-readers could deliver the coup de grace .
twenty-five percent of respondents to the book fair study thought bookstores would largely disappear within half a century , with online distribution of paper books by firms such as amazon taking over .
copyright quandary some european bookstores seem to be trying to get ahead of the curve by being the first to promote e-books .
top german chain bookstore thalia struck a deal with sony to sell content for its reader devices in thalia stores and online .
assuming e-books do take hold , there are still many questions to be answered .
which reader - amazon 's , sony 's , or perhaps one from a european competitor , like the netherlands ' iliad - will capture the public 's fancy ?
each one has slightly different technical specifications , and is based on different technical platforms .
another big question is how the industry will deal with copyright protection .
some employ digital rights management -lrb- drm , -rrb- a kind of software lock on downloadable books , with the aim of avoiding the music industry 's fate .
since the advent of digital music , record companies have famously seen profits decimated by piracy and illegal downloading .
boumans opposes technological protection on content .
he supports the concept of a " social drm , " which would operate under a " name and shame " system : when a person buys electronic data , his or her name is attached to the file so anyone can see how it is passed around after that .
social pressure would correct the market .
' the ipod principle ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazon 's kindle is a big seller in the us ultimately , boumans says four things need to be in place before e-books really take off : a device , a portfolio of downloadable material , the download service - and the right price for content .
" that 's when you get what i call the ipod principle , " he said .
" people start downloading things and they are willing to pay for it . "
clearly it is difficult to imagine exactly what shape the digital-literature future will take .
according to buchreport editor wilking , the future may be even more unrecognizable than we can imagine .
for one thing , books may cease to be a collection of words on paper - or even e-paper .
" there are a lot of possibilities when it comes to e-publishing , " wilking said .
" people will be able to build in films and interactive elements .
things we ca n't even imagine yet . "
once these technical possibilities are there , he says , then the authors might start taking them into consideration , and writing for multimedia instead of just the page . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and the traps that girls can sometimes fall into .
i don ’ t think it ’ s good that it is already considered normal .
the actors in learning by ear have great voices – it ’ s almost like watching a film .
i hope that there will be programs in the future that directly tackle the problems faced by young people here in kenya . "
-lrb- dennis donga , kenya -rrb- " i would like to congratulate the author of the series on hiv / aids because it really gets to the heart of our society ’ s problems .
even though condoms are now being handed out en masse to prevent pregnancies and illnesses , people still aren ’ t using them .
i believe that many people are learning from this radio play and benefit from what they hear . "
-lrb- saleh mchiro , kenya -rrb- " whenever i listen to deutsche welle and in particular this new program for young people , i always think about how i can change my behavior to protect myself from hiv .
and now i can inform others who do not know about hiv / aids .
this gives them the knowledge to protect themselves against this dangerous disease that is still killing people throughout the world - and especially in africa . "
-lrb- arnold mushuti , tanzania -rrb- " first of all i want to thank deutsche welle for the hard work of preparing youth programs of learning by ear in order to teach youth about hiv-aids .
this program helps me also to get more ideas about hiv and how to protect myself against the disease .
i am sure that any boy and any girl who listens to this program will be able to protect themselves from this disease . "
-lrb- ester gasau , kagera region , tanzania -rrb- " when i listen to the learning by ear serie hiv-aids i am able to give other youths information about this killer disease known as hiv-aids , because this disease is killing many youths .
therefore i am taking this opportunity to educate my fellow youths in order to avoid the disease . "
-lrb- christian richard , buleba district , tanzania -rrb- " i really like the radio dramas , especially the one about the young girl angela .

seeing more bench time than field play these days , the german midfielder expresses his frustration as well as his need to evaluate his future in the sport .
joachim loew insists his player is still a factor . midfielder torsten frings is the latest germany player toying with retirement as coach joachim loew now no longer guarantees anyone a place in the starting 11 .
" i am really thinking about it , retiring is more and more on my mind , " frings told friday 's edition of the bild daily .
the 31-year-old from werder bremen was a key player in germany 's run to third place at the 2006 world cup and also played at euro 2008 where germany lost the final against spain .
tired of being a benchwarmer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : also tired of being benched , kuranyi made headlines when he walked out during germany 's match against wales however , he was fielded only for seven minutes in saturday 's 2-1 win against russia and not at all on wednesday when germany beat wales 1-0 in another world cup qualifier .
frings insisted he was not sulking but named the fact that he was n't even told to warm up against wales " a humiliation . "
the statements of the 78-times capped frings come less than a week after schalke 04 forward kevin kuranyi left the team during the russia game .
kuranyi later apologized but loew said he would n't pick him again as long as he was coach .
frings told bild he missed " support , trust and respect " from loew , which led to the retirement considerations .
" i ca n't rule it out .
of course i am thinking about retirement .
not because i am sulking but because the last days were an eye-opener ...
at almost 32 you have a feeling for it .
i ca n't see a future for myself under him -lrb- loew -rrb- right now , " frings said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lowe stays close to ballack as the coach 's popularity with his players wanes frings has been through several injury setbacks over the past two years but insisted that he was still as good as thomas hitzlsperger or simon rolfes who have recently played in his place in midfield .
“ i hold nothing against simon rofes or thomas hitzlsperger .
but i also know that they are not better ! " he said .
coach still wants frings loew , for his part , said earlier this week that he picks his players based on present form and not on past merits .
he said after the wales match that he has talked with frings and wants him for the 2010 world cup in south africa .
" i expressed my appreciation .
players who do n't play are naturally dissatisfied .
but that 's a situation i want . ”
" i know he can perform well and that he will perform well .
for now he has to live with this .
i continue to have faith in him , " said loew . dpa news agency -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the country 's top commercial bank , deutsche bank , said thursday , oct .

analysts said customers were moving out of market-driven investments such as stock into safer deposits .
unicredit 's german unit , hypovereinsbank -lrb- hvb -rrb- , said it had gained 400 million euros in deposits in the past four weeks , with term deposits and savings account in busy use , but the number of customers had remained much the same .

just blocks away , some 300 people demonstrated against what they called the " islamisation of europe . " located in berlin 's pankow district , the 1.6 million-euro -lrb- $ 2.15-million -rrb- mosque has a 12-meter -lrb- 39-foot -rrb- high minaret and can hold 500 worshippers .
built for members of the ahmadiyya muslim community , the mosque was inaugurated on thursday , oct .
16 , with a celebration attended by approximately 300 people , including berlin mayor klaus wowereit .
according to wowereit , the mosque symbolizes " religious and cultural tolerance " in berlin .
his comments may have been overly optimistic , though , given that hundreds of protesting residents and the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- were gathered only blocks away from the site .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors said they were concerned about the abuse of religious freedom the demonstrators held banners with statements such as , " stop the islamisation of europe " and " stop the abuse of religious freedom . "
a petition against the construction of the mosque had also gathered some 20,000 signatures .
construction plagued by vandalism the ahmadiyya mosque has been a source of controversy since its building plans were announced in 2006 , with attacks on the site hindering its construction .
ijaz ahmad , spokesperson for the mosque , is hopeful however that the new two-story building will help bring clashing muslims and non-muslims in berlin closer together .
" the mosque will be a hub of social activity , not just for praying , " she said .
" it will play a role in boosting integration and promoting dialogue with politicians and other religious groups . "
a local citizens ' group does n't seem to see integration in the cards though .
" we have a big problem with sects that put religion above everything else , allow the beating of women and deny equal rights , " the group said on its web site .
muslims seek asylum in germany berlin is home to about 220,000 muslims , with only 200 belonging to the ahmadiyyah community .
ahmadiyyah 's muslim roots are a source of debate , however , as it is not recognized by some mainstream muslim groups on account of different beliefs .
according to the ahmadiyyah group , it has 30,000 members in germany , many of whom came to the country seeking asylum from religious persecution in pakistan and other islamic countries . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the university is considering taking the case to the highest court in germany . bremen university is considering taking its case against the prohibition of neurological research using primates to the federal constitutional court after the state 's senator for health rejected the institute for cognitive research 's application for a ten-year extension of its project on ethical grounds .
the university 's rector wilfried mueller told reporters on thursday , oct .
16 , that the refusal of social democrat ingelore rosenkoetter to extend the research program under neurobiologist andreas kreiter was " politically motivated interference into the fundamental right and liberty of science and research " and said that the situation could lead to emergency legal steps by the institute .
university argues against political interference bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists say the state has not made an informed decision mueller argued that the state authority did not have the right to evaluate the program on ethical grounds but only on its practical plausibility .
he also added that the decision was not based on the effect and purpose of the experiments in relation to the associated experiences of the animals and their rights .
kreiter 's experiments have been approved on a regular basis since 1997 despite protests whenever the program 's approval comes up for consideration .
the neurologist has also been threatened by animal rights activists , according to reports from the bremen police department .
the university is looking to obtain a provisional order from the constitutional court so that the research can continue in the meantime until a final decision is made .

the board of directors of the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- decided that the rule , which states that germans have to own the majority of shares in bundesliga clubs and have to have the majority of votes in clubs , should remain in place , the dfl announced thursday .
the proposal to keep the rule in place is to be put to the general dfl body .
to have it changed a two / thirds majority of the dfl membership , as well as of the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- would have to pass it .
at a press conference , dfl president reinhard rauball said that the decision was taken after a thorough discussion and consideration of the arguments put forward by hanover 96 .
" the bundesliga lives from its stability and continuity .
this has to be maintained to ensure that the competition remains fair , ” he added hanover 96 officials had earlier called on the dfl to change the ruling to allow them to attract foreign investors for their club .
martin kind , president of hanover 96 , said that more and more clubs are siding with the north german club .
" we do n't yet have 75 percent , so the recommendations of the league 's board of directors will pass , " he added .
additionally it was decided that the league cup would not be held in 2009 .
the cup , which is a pre-season playoff between the top five teams in the league , was not held this year .
the teams will have to forgo any extra proceeds that would have been earned through ticket sales to the cup ticket . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as world poverty day draws attention to the issue , dw 's dennis stute speaks with activist vandana shiva about india 's huge hunger levels . dr. vandana shiva is a physicist , ecologist , activist and author .
in india she has established navdanya , a movement for biodiversity conservation and farmers ' rights .
she also directs the research foundation for science , technology and natural resource policy .
the un has declared oct .
17 as the international day for the eradication of poverty . dw-world.de : how has the food crisis affected india ?
vandana shiva : very severely .
prices of staples have literally doubled in the last year and that has meant that the poor who were already only eating half of what they should be eating are now eating a quarter of what they should be .
unfortunately , it is the poor who must make a living by working physically and what we 're basically doing is robbing them of their ability to earn a living .
in addition , when children do n't get enough food to eat or when a mother is malnourished and she gives birth to a low birth-weight child , we are creating generations of people deprived of full mental health and full physical health .
according to a new report , there are " alarming " levels of hunger in 12 indian states and " serious " levels in the remaining five .
what , in your view , is the reason for the widespread malnutrition ?
there are two very big reasons why india has emerged as the capital of hunger .
the first is the “ green revolution ” model of agriculture , which was actually a hunger-creating model proposed as a hunger solution .
but when you destroy food sources in pulses , in vegetables , in grains , in oil seeds and create monocultures of rice and wheat , you destroy the millets - the nutritious grains that have 40 times higher level of nutrition - and call them inferior grains and push them to extinction .
on the ground , you have less food per unit acre and you have less nutrition access per capita .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gmo crops require more water and provide less nutritional value , says shiva the second is related to the new thrust of the 1991 policies of trade liberalization which instead of focusing on food for people focused on exports of luxury cash crops to rich countries , destroying india 's food security base .
this was trade-driven and really put food on the back burner then , treated as something you do n't need policy for .
the food situation is particularly bad in the state of madhya pradesh .
why is this state doing even worse than the others ?
the two reasons madhya pradesh is more severely affected than others is that it 's a large forest state and it 's largely a tribal state .
the food security of the tribals came from abundant forest products including edible products from the forest 's produce .
mining and industrialization is so rampant that tribals are losing their food resources .
it 's also the state where the drought impact because of climate change has been felt very severely .
bundelkhan has had a drought and rainfall failure for four years - there has been no cultivation at all .
and that 's partly because the agricultural model is based on new seeds like hybrid seeds which need chemicals .
but that 's the stupidest thing you could do because climate change requires adaption to drought which means planting crops that are resilient to drought - the millets that use only 250 millimeters of rain .
but unfortunately the government , driven by international agencies like the world bank , has walked on the wrong road for a period of market volatility and climate uncertainty .
the combination is a recipe for hunger and famine .
we need to shift our focus from global markets and global trades to local food security and away from export crops to growing food and nutrition for our people .
in the past ten years , more than 140,000 farmers in india have committed suicide according to official figures .
why is their situation so desperate ?
the first suicide came in 1997 .
when the impact of the new policies of liberalizing the seed sector started to get felt and corporations like monsanto , who wanted to sell genetically modified seed , entered the market .
they started to sell non renewable hybrid seeds which meant the farmers had to spent huge amounts of money buying seed every year .
these seeds also needed irrigation and were vulnerable to pests to the farmers had to spend more money putting in irrigation systems and buying pesticides .
that meant a higher debt burden on farmers .
falling prices of the products and rising costs of production squeezed the farmers even further into debt .
and that is what has led to the spate of suicides .
how can you tackle the problem of hunger ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting food into the hands of the poor is difficult due to heavy subsidies i think the most urgent steps to be taken to tackle the problem are to actually develop the farming systems to produce more food per unit acre .
every assumption of industrial agriculture is wrong because it does not produce more food but uses more chemicals and more water per unit acre .
it produces more commodities for international trade per unit acre but it does not produce more food or more nutrition per unit acre .
models of farming that can increase food-production fivefold , ten fold , depending on your climatic conditions have evolved through the organic movement .
those models of biodiverse , ecological systems can solve the problem of hunger .
the second thing that needs to be done is to bring back food-first policies .
in india after independence we have not had hunger on the scale we are now witnessing .
we had a famine in 1942 which killed two million people .
we had enough food in the country but the british were extracting every bit of rice from bengal and exporting it for profit - exporting it to finance the war .
we drove that famine away through public policy that put food first through a universal public distribution system that meant everyone has a right to affordable food .
that was dismantled by the world bank and it has to be resurrected .
the poor must have food at affordable price instead of subsidizing global corporations .
what the government has to do is to buy , preferably organics , from the indian farmers and then subsidize the prices for the poor .
we would save our financial budgets , we would save our taxes and we would have more food at lower prices .
india this year is spending one trillion rupees in subsidies for global corporations to buy chemical fertilizers .
that 's the wrong way to go .
we can lower costs of production , increase output per acre , increase equity and distribution .
that is food sovereignty .
that is food security .
that is food first . dennis stute -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to a new report , there are " alarming " levels of hunger in 12 indian states and " serious " levels in the remaining five .
what , in your view , is the reason for the widespread malnutrition ?
there are two very big reasons why india has emerged as the capital of hunger .
the first is the “ green revolution ” model of agriculture , which was actually a hunger-creating model proposed as a hunger solution .
but when you destroy food sources in pulses , in vegetables , in grains , in oil seeds and create monocultures of rice and wheat , you destroy the millets - the nutritious grains that have 40 times higher level of nutrition - and call them inferior grains and push them to extinction .
on the ground , you have less food per unit acre and you have less nutrition access per capita .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gmo crops require more water and provide less nutritional value , says shiva the second is related to the new thrust of the 1991 policies of trade liberalization which instead of focusing on food for people focused on exports of luxury cash crops to rich countries , destroying india 's food security base .
this was trade-driven and really put food on the back burner then , treated as something you do n't need policy for .
the food situation is particularly bad in the state of madhya pradesh .
why is this state doing even worse than the others ?
the two reasons madhya pradesh is more severely affected than others is that it 's a large forest state and it 's largely a tribal state .
the food security of the tribals came from abundant forest products including edible products from the forest 's produce .
mining and industrialization is so rampant that tribals are losing their food resources .
it 's also the state where the drought impact because of climate change has been felt very severely .
bundelkhan has had a drought and rainfall failure for four years - there has been no cultivation at all .
and that 's partly because the agricultural model is based on new seeds like hybrid seeds which need chemicals .
but that 's the stupidest thing you could do because climate change requires adaption to drought which means planting crops that are resilient to drought - the millets that use only 250 millimeters of rain .
but unfortunately the government , driven by international agencies like the world bank , has walked on the wrong road for a period of market volatility and climate uncertainty .
the combination is a recipe for hunger and famine .
we need to shift our focus from global markets and global trades to local food security and away from export crops to growing food and nutrition for our people .
in the past ten years , more than 140,000 farmers in india have committed suicide according to official figures .
why is their situation so desperate ?
the first suicide came in 1997 .
when the impact of the new policies of liberalizing the seed sector started to get felt and corporations like monsanto , who wanted to sell genetically modified seed , entered the market .
they started to sell non renewable hybrid seeds which meant the farmers had to spent huge amounts of money buying seed every year .
these seeds also needed irrigation and were vulnerable to pests to the farmers had to spend more money putting in irrigation systems and buying pesticides .
that meant a higher debt burden on farmers .
falling prices of the products and rising costs of production squeezed the farmers even further into debt .
and that is what has led to the spate of suicides .
how can you tackle the problem of hunger ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : getting food into the hands of the poor is difficult due to heavy subsidies i think the most urgent steps to be taken to tackle the problem are to actually develop the farming systems to produce more food per unit acre .
every assumption of industrial agriculture is wrong because it does not produce more food but uses more chemicals and more water per unit acre .
it produces more commodities for international trade per unit acre but it does not produce more food or more nutrition per unit acre .
models of farming that can increase food-production fivefold , ten fold , depending on your climatic conditions have evolved through the organic movement .
those models of biodiverse , ecological systems can solve the problem of hunger .
the second thing that needs to be done is to bring back food-first policies .
in india after independence we have not had hunger on the scale we are now witnessing .
we had a famine in 1942 which killed two million people .
we had enough food in the country but the british were extracting every bit of rice from bengal and exporting it for profit - exporting it to finance the war .
we drove that famine away through public policy that put food first through a universal public distribution system that meant everyone has a right to affordable food .
that was dismantled by the world bank and it has to be resurrected .
the poor must have food at affordable price instead of subsidizing global corporations .
what the government has to do is to buy , preferably organics , from the indian farmers and then subsidize the prices for the poor .
we would save our financial budgets , we would save our taxes and we would have more food at lower prices .
india this year is spending one trillion rupees in subsidies for global corporations to buy chemical fertilizers .
that 's the wrong way to go .
we can lower costs of production , increase output per acre , increase equity and distribution .
that is food sovereignty .
that is food security .
that is food first . dennis stute -lrb- cat -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as world poverty day draws attention to the issue , dw 's dennis stute speaks with activist vandana shiva about india 's huge hunger levels . dr. vandana shiva is a physicist , ecologist , activist and author .
in india she has established navdanya , a movement for biodiversity conservation and farmers ' rights .
she also directs the research foundation for science , technology and natural resource policy .
the un has declared oct .
17 as the international day for the eradication of poverty . dw-world.de : how has the food crisis affected india ?
vandana shiva : very severely .
prices of staples have literally doubled in the last year and that has meant that the poor who were already only eating half of what they should be eating are now eating a quarter of what they should be .
unfortunately , it is the poor who must make a living by working physically and what we 're basically doing is robbing them of their ability to earn a living .

the board of directors of the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- decided that the rule , which states that germans have to own the majority of shares in bundesliga clubs and have to have the majority of votes in clubs , should remain in place , the dfl announced thursday .
the proposal to keep the rule in place is to be put to the general dfl body .
to have it changed a two / thirds majority of the dfl membership , as well as of the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- would have to pass it .
at a press conference , dfl president reinhard rauball said that the decision was taken after a thorough discussion and consideration of the arguments put forward by hanover 96 .
" the bundesliga lives from its stability and continuity .
this has to be maintained to ensure that the competition remains fair , ” he added hanover 96 officials had earlier called on the dfl to change the ruling to allow them to attract foreign investors for their club .
martin kind , president of hanover 96 , said that more and more clubs are siding with the north german club .
" we do n't yet have 75 percent , so the recommendations of the league 's board of directors will pass , " he added .
additionally it was decided that the league cup would not be held in 2009 .
the cup , which is a pre-season playoff between the top five teams in the league , was not held this year .
the teams will have to forgo any extra proceeds that would have been earned through ticket sales to the cup ticket . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

will books as we know them soon be a thing of the past ?
a new generation of digital " e-readers " has the german publishing industry gearing up for a fast-moving digital future . electronic books were announced as the " next big thing " a decade ago .
but the technology that came out at the time failed to impress consumers , and made few inroads into the market .
now some new e-readers , predicted to be put on the market in europe in the near future , have publishing industry insiders preparing for major changes .
lightweight devices like amazon 's kindle and the sony reader have been the focus of intense interest since they celebrated their german coming-out party at the frankfurt book fair , which runs through oct .
19 .
e-books - stars of the frankfurt fair the press toasted the new readers as the " true stars " of this year 's fair .
but considering the changes they could represent for the staid publishing industry , players are eyeing them with a mixture of fascination and fear .
" overall , i think german publishers are very enthusiastic about e-books , " said thomas wilking , editor in chief of the german publishing trade magazine buchreport .
" they are just waiting for a device they think is attractive enough for a wide public . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sony is hoping its reader will impress europeans book fair organizers took an unscientific survey of 1,000 industry players on the future of the new technology , and published it just before the fair opened .
unfortunately , the data failed to paint any clear road map for the future .
more than 70 percent of respondents said they were ready for the digital challenge - but 60 percent of them had neither used e-readers nor downloaded e-books themselves .
meanwhile , a full 40 percent said they expect e-content to dominate the market by 2018 - compared with one-third of respondents who said e-books will never take over .
12 percent thought the new e-readers would be a short-lived flash in the pan .
' you could take 50 books to the beach ' jak boumans , a dutch media-content consultant who runs his own firm , electronic media reporting , is convinced e-books are here to stay .
but he estimates it will be at least 2030 before they are in wide usage , considering how many details still need to be ironed out , and how ingrained peoples ' attitudes are towards reading .
" this has been a topic for the last 30 years , but the mentality is still trying to catch up with the technology , " boumans said .
" e-readers mean people could go on holiday without packing a stack of heavy books - they can take 50 books with them in one device and still read it on the beach . "
observers praise the kindle and reader as being significantly improved from the last devices that tried to storm the market but failed .
the new devices have extended their battery life and traded the backlit computer screen for a paper-simulating " e-paper " that is less hard on the eyes .
the ritual of turning pages some book lovers wonder if an electronic device will ever really replace paper books , however .
johann schumandl , owner of a small independent book store in cologne , said he thinks people might accept e-readers for reading work documents .
but printed books will never disappear completely : " when you read a book you have the sense of touch , the haptic value , " he said .
" there is something ritualistic about reading a book , turning the pages . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : which e-reader will capture the market ?
boumans agrees that casual readers - who he refers to as " ink sniffers " - will be the last group to make the switch .
but he believes a new generation of people who grew up using ipods will see things differently .
" the only question they are going to have is , ' how many functions will this device combine for me ? " ' he said .
people have been predicting the demise of the bookstore for a long time now , and many now think e-books and e-readers could deliver the coup de grace .
twenty-five percent of respondents to the book fair study thought bookstores would largely disappear within half a century , with online distribution of paper books by firms such as amazon taking over .
copyright quandary some european bookstores seem to be trying to get ahead of the curve by being the first to promote e-books .
top german chain bookstore thalia struck a deal with sony to sell content for its reader devices in thalia stores and online .
assuming e-books do take hold , there are still many questions to be answered .
which reader - amazon 's , sony 's , or perhaps one from a european competitor , like the netherlands ' iliad - will capture the public 's fancy ?
each one has slightly different technical specifications , and is based on different technical platforms .
another big question is how the industry will deal with copyright protection .
some employ digital rights management -lrb- drm , -rrb- a kind of software lock on downloadable books , with the aim of avoiding the music industry 's fate .
since the advent of digital music , record companies have famously seen profits decimated by piracy and illegal downloading .
boumans opposes technological protection on content .
he supports the concept of a " social drm , " which would operate under a " name and shame " system : when a person buys electronic data , his or her name is attached to the file so anyone can see how it is passed around after that .
social pressure would correct the market .
' the ipod principle ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazon 's kindle is a big seller in the us ultimately , boumans says four things need to be in place before e-books really take off : a device , a portfolio of downloadable material , the download service - and the right price for content .
" that 's when you get what i call the ipod principle , " he said .
" people start downloading things and they are willing to pay for it . "
clearly it is difficult to imagine exactly what shape the digital-literature future will take .
according to buchreport editor wilking , the future may be even more unrecognizable than we can imagine .
for one thing , books may cease to be a collection of words on paper - or even e-paper .
" there are a lot of possibilities when it comes to e-publishing , " wilking said .
" people will be able to build in films and interactive elements .
things we ca n't even imagine yet . "
once these technical possibilities are there , he says , then the authors might start taking them into consideration , and writing for multimedia instead of just the page . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 17.10.2008 loss of natural capital costs more than bank crisis , says expert großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the financial crisis has left us unable to see the wood for the trees as the eu discusses the affordability of its carbon-reduction targets , economist pavan sukhdev told dw-world.de that the best things in life are free , but not for much longer .
the nature crunch could prove costly . once described as an " economist by profession and an ecologist at heart , " pavan sukhdev holds the chair of deutsche bank 's global market center and is director of the green accounting for indian states project , a study on the economic significance of biodiversity in india .
he also heads an ongoing global report funded by the german ministry for the environment and the european commission on " the economics of ecosystems & biodiversity " -lrb- teeb -rrb- , and is among the architects of the green new deal , spearheaded by the united nations environment program , which will be unveiled in london on oct .
22 .
dw-world.de : you said at the world conservation congress in barcelona last week that the economic burden of environmentally hostile practices like deforestation outweighs that of the bank crisis .
pavan sukhdev : the capital loss to financial firms in the city and wall street has been estimated as $ 1 trillion to $ 1.5 trillion .
in teeb 's first phase report which we presented in may , we looked at the extent of losses taking place as a result of deforestation and degradation .
we estimated the loss in human welfare as a capital item , and worked out that this was $ 2 to $ 4.5 trillion per year , every year , for the last several years .
and it will continue , if we carry on with business as usual .
why is it that a one-off loss of $ 1.5 trillion in financial capital to a group of wall street firms attracts so much attention , whereas the ongoing loss per annum of twice this amount of natural capital is barely reported ?
we 've seen governments bail out the economy - what would a " bailout " for the environment look like ?
it would be comparatively modest .
let me give you a few indicating benchmarks .
today we have something like 100,000 conservation areas , covering some 10-11 percent of the earth 's land surface .
the teeb team believes that we are spending some $ 40-50 billion too little on making that conservation effective .
according to various estimates , these conservation areas produce some $ 4-5 trillion of utility per year .
today , spending on protected areas globally is less than $ 20 billion , and all we 're suggesting is an increase of another $ 50 billion a year to ensure the continuation of the benefits of these protected areas .
we 're not talking about a massive amount of money - single institutions have lost more than that in the current financial chaos .
but for various reasons it doesn ’ t get allocated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pavan sukhdev what are these reasons ?
for one , the loss of natural capital is a loss of public wealth .
eco-system services are public benefits that are pretty much free .
it is not individuals ' or shareholders ' wealth at stake , although it is , if you like , global shareholders ' wealth .
but it 's not private ownership , it 's public ownership .
these are things that are there for all to enjoy : we would dearly miss their absence and we would pay the earth to get them back , but right now , they 're free .
so the public nature of these goods and services is one reason .
to understand the second reason why loss of natural capital does n't grab headlines , we need to think of the frog analogy used by al gore in his book " an inconvenient truth " : if you put a frog in a beaker of water and gradually raise the temperature , it wo n't notice any change .
similarly , what is happening to us is happening continuously .
every year we lose forest , the climate gets worse , poor people 's water supplies and field nutrients decline .
but we see these losses so gradually that we do n't realize that things are getting worse .
whereas in the case of the financial markets it 's one short , sharp shock .
nonetheless , a lot of smart money has started to flow into environmental investment .
in north america , the percentage of venture capital spent on clean technology used to be around 2 percent in 2002 , but had risen to 17 percent by 2007 .
is there a risk that environmental concerns will be abandoned given the current slowdown in the global economy ? i do n't think so , because people are beginning to get the message . i never have to explain myself twice any more .
even two years ago , people 's eyes would glaze over .
now people want to know what needs to be done .
of course , the cost of the financial crisis means there will now be increased distributional pressure on how much can be allocated to solving environmental problems .
but my point is that this money is not much , considering how much is spent on other sectors .
there 's no need to think about it too much .
the time is now .
how viable is a rescue plan like this during a recession , which is what we 're facing right now ?
a $ 45 billion gap per annum is not the end of the world .
look at how much has been lost and how much is being allocated individually by governments in the us and europe - up to $ 700 billion .
to put things in context , the investment per annum of the eu in conservation areas is about 6 billion euros .
these are modest sums .
so economic disaster does n't necessarily have to mean ecological disaster too ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the financial crisis is reported extensively - the environmental one is n't no .
venture capitalists have understood something that the world , generally , has not .
as other businesses begin using the technology into which venture capital has been invested , they will find amazing and sizeable opportunities .
i predict a tectonic shift in the way things are done .
renewable energy is an extraordinary opportunity if you use it not just to fix the supply that comes to you and me in berlin and london , but to fix the supply needed by the world 's 2 billion who do n't have an energy supply - the poorest people in the world who do not actually have energy coming to their homes in the form of oil , coal or electricity .
there are vast opportunities here , in countries like india and china , africa and latin america , to apply well-researched technologies which provide , for example , modular solutions to bring light into the poor home .
just imagine what kind of change you could see - education coming down to a village level , children staying up in order to read . think of the tectonic shift than can be achieved just by shifting focus and providing micro-finance to villagers to implement renewable energy solutions .
and look at the number of people who can benefit from that .
these are the sort of things that smart business is looking at .
there is money in making more efficient equipment and implementing more efficient processes .
does the credit crunch make people more aware that being careful with natural capital is important too ?
yes .
as the saying goes , a crisis is a terrible thing to waste . interview : jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the nature crunch could prove costly . once described as an " economist by profession and an ecologist at heart , " pavan sukhdev holds the chair of deutsche bank 's global market center and is director of the green accounting for indian states project , a study on the economic significance of biodiversity in india .
he also heads an ongoing global report funded by the german ministry for the environment and the european commission on " the economics of ecosystems & biodiversity " -lrb- teeb -rrb- , and is among the architects of the green new deal , spearheaded by the united nations environment program , which will be unveiled in london on oct .
22 .
dw-world.de : you said at the world conservation congress in barcelona last week that the economic burden of environmentally hostile practices like deforestation outweighs that of the bank crisis .
pavan sukhdev : the capital loss to financial firms in the city and wall street has been estimated as $ 1 trillion to $ 1.5 trillion .
in teeb 's first phase report which we presented in may , we looked at the extent of losses taking place as a result of deforestation and degradation .
we estimated the loss in human welfare as a capital item , and worked out that this was $ 2 to $ 4.5 trillion per year , every year , for the last several years .
and it will continue , if we carry on with business as usual .
why is it that a one-off loss of $ 1.5 trillion in financial capital to a group of wall street firms attracts so much attention , whereas the ongoing loss per annum of twice this amount of natural capital is barely reported ?
we 've seen governments bail out the economy - what would a " bailout " for the environment look like ?
it would be comparatively modest .
let me give you a few indicating benchmarks .
today we have something like 100,000 conservation areas , covering some 10-11 percent of the earth 's land surface .
the teeb team believes that we are spending some $ 40-50 billion too little on making that conservation effective .
according to various estimates , these conservation areas produce some $ 4-5 trillion of utility per year .
today , spending on protected areas globally is less than $ 20 billion , and all we 're suggesting is an increase of another $ 50 billion a year to ensure the continuation of the benefits of these protected areas .
we 're not talking about a massive amount of money - single institutions have lost more than that in the current financial chaos .

seeing more bench time than field play these days , the german midfielder expresses his frustration as well as his need to evaluate his future in the sport .
joachim loew insists his player is still a factor . midfielder torsten frings is the latest germany player toying with retirement as coach joachim loew now no longer guarantees anyone a place in the starting 11 .
" i am really thinking about it , retiring is more and more on my mind , " frings told friday 's edition of the bild daily .
the 31-year-old from werder bremen was a key player in germany 's run to third place at the 2006 world cup and also played at euro 2008 where germany lost the final against spain .
tired of being a benchwarmer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : also tired of being benched , kuranyi made headlines when he walked out during germany 's match against wales however , he was fielded only for seven minutes in saturday 's 2-1 win against russia and not at all on wednesday when germany beat wales 1-0 in another world cup qualifier .
frings insisted he was not sulking but named the fact that he was n't even told to warm up against wales " a humiliation . "
the statements of the 78-times capped frings come less than a week after schalke 04 forward kevin kuranyi left the team during the russia game .
kuranyi later apologized but loew said he would n't pick him again as long as he was coach .
frings told bild he missed " support , trust and respect " from loew , which led to the retirement considerations .
" i ca n't rule it out .
of course i am thinking about retirement .
not because i am sulking but because the last days were an eye-opener ...
at almost 32 you have a feeling for it .
i ca n't see a future for myself under him -lrb- loew -rrb- right now , " frings said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lowe stays close to ballack as the coach 's popularity with his players wanes frings has been through several injury setbacks over the past two years but insisted that he was still as good as thomas hitzlsperger or simon rolfes who have recently played in his place in midfield .
“ i hold nothing against simon rofes or thomas hitzlsperger .
but i also know that they are not better ! " he said .
coach still wants frings loew , for his part , said earlier this week that he picks his players based on present form and not on past merits .
he said after the wales match that he has talked with frings and wants him for the 2010 world cup in south africa .
" i expressed my appreciation .
players who do n't play are naturally dissatisfied .
but that 's a situation i want . ”
" i know he can perform well and that he will perform well .
for now he has to live with this .
i continue to have faith in him , " said loew . dpa news agency -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

seeing more bench time than field play these days , the german midfielder expresses his frustration as well as his need to evaluate his future in the sport .
joachim loew insists his player is still a factor . midfielder torsten frings is the latest germany player toying with retirement as coach joachim loew now no longer guarantees anyone a place in the starting 11 .
" i am really thinking about it , retiring is more and more on my mind , " frings told friday 's edition of the bild daily .
the 31-year-old from werder bremen was a key player in germany 's run to third place at the 2006 world cup and also played at euro 2008 where germany lost the final against spain .
tired of being a benchwarmer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : also tired of being benched , kuranyi made headlines when he walked out during germany 's match against wales however , he was fielded only for seven minutes in saturday 's 2-1 win against russia and not at all on wednesday when germany beat wales 1-0 in another world cup qualifier .
frings insisted he was not sulking but named the fact that he was n't even told to warm up against wales " a humiliation . "
the statements of the 78-times capped frings come less than a week after schalke 04 forward kevin kuranyi left the team during the russia game .
kuranyi later apologized but loew said he would n't pick him again as long as he was coach .
frings told bild he missed " support , trust and respect " from loew , which led to the retirement considerations .
" i ca n't rule it out .
of course i am thinking about retirement .
not because i am sulking but because the last days were an eye-opener ...
at almost 32 you have a feeling for it .
i ca n't see a future for myself under him -lrb- loew -rrb- right now , " frings said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lowe stays close to ballack as the coach 's popularity with his players wanes frings has been through several injury setbacks over the past two years but insisted that he was still as good as thomas hitzlsperger or simon rolfes who have recently played in his place in midfield .
“ i hold nothing against simon rofes or thomas hitzlsperger .
but i also know that they are not better ! " he said .
coach still wants frings loew , for his part , said earlier this week that he picks his players based on present form and not on past merits .
he said after the wales match that he has talked with frings and wants him for the 2010 world cup in south africa .
" i expressed my appreciation .
players who do n't play are naturally dissatisfied .
but that 's a situation i want . ”
" i know he can perform well and that he will perform well .
for now he has to live with this .
i continue to have faith in him , " said loew . dpa news agency -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and the traps that girls can sometimes fall into .
i don ’ t think it ’ s good that it is already considered normal .
the actors in learning by ear have great voices – it ’ s almost like watching a film .
i hope that there will be programs in the future that directly tackle the problems faced by young people here in kenya . "

these sorts of things also happen here in guinea-bissau .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de literature -pipe- 17.10.2008 european publishers gear up for brave new world of e-books großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are ink and paper a thing of the past ?
will books as we know them soon be a thing of the past ?
a new generation of digital " e-readers " has the german publishing industry gearing up for a fast-moving digital future . electronic books were announced as the " next big thing " a decade ago .
but the technology that came out at the time failed to impress consumers , and made few inroads into the market .
now some new e-readers , predicted to be put on the market in europe in the near future , have publishing industry insiders preparing for major changes .
lightweight devices like amazon 's kindle and the sony reader have been the focus of intense interest since they celebrated their german coming-out party at the frankfurt book fair , which runs through oct .
19 .
e-books - stars of the frankfurt fair the press toasted the new readers as the " true stars " of this year 's fair .
but considering the changes they could represent for the staid publishing industry , players are eyeing them with a mixture of fascination and fear .
" overall , i think german publishers are very enthusiastic about e-books , " said thomas wilking , editor in chief of the german publishing trade magazine buchreport .
" they are just waiting for a device they think is attractive enough for a wide public . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sony is hoping its reader will impress europeans book fair organizers took an unscientific survey of 1,000 industry players on the future of the new technology , and published it just before the fair opened .
unfortunately , the data failed to paint any clear road map for the future .
more than 70 percent of respondents said they were ready for the digital challenge - but 60 percent of them had neither used e-readers nor downloaded e-books themselves .
meanwhile , a full 40 percent said they expect e-content to dominate the market by 2018 - compared with one-third of respondents who said e-books will never take over .
12 percent thought the new e-readers would be a short-lived flash in the pan .
' you could take 50 books to the beach ' jak boumans , a dutch media-content consultant who runs his own firm , electronic media reporting , is convinced e-books are here to stay .
but he estimates it will be at least 2030 before they are in wide usage , considering how many details still need to be ironed out , and how ingrained peoples ' attitudes are towards reading .
" this has been a topic for the last 30 years , but the mentality is still trying to catch up with the technology , " boumans said .
" e-readers mean people could go on holiday without packing a stack of heavy books - they can take 50 books with them in one device and still read it on the beach . "
observers praise the kindle and reader as being significantly improved from the last devices that tried to storm the market but failed .
the new devices have extended their battery life and traded the backlit computer screen for a paper-simulating " e-paper " that is less hard on the eyes .
the ritual of turning pages some book lovers wonder if an electronic device will ever really replace paper books , however .
johann schumandl , owner of a small independent book store in cologne , said he thinks people might accept e-readers for reading work documents .
but printed books will never disappear completely : " when you read a book you have the sense of touch , the haptic value , " he said .
" there is something ritualistic about reading a book , turning the pages . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : which e-reader will capture the market ?
boumans agrees that casual readers - who he refers to as " ink sniffers " - will be the last group to make the switch .
but he believes a new generation of people who grew up using ipods will see things differently .
" the only question they are going to have is , ' how many functions will this device combine for me ? " ' he said .
people have been predicting the demise of the bookstore for a long time now , and many now think e-books and e-readers could deliver the coup de grace .
twenty-five percent of respondents to the book fair study thought bookstores would largely disappear within half a century , with online distribution of paper books by firms such as amazon taking over .
copyright quandary some european bookstores seem to be trying to get ahead of the curve by being the first to promote e-books .
top german chain bookstore thalia struck a deal with sony to sell content for its reader devices in thalia stores and online .
assuming e-books do take hold , there are still many questions to be answered .
which reader - amazon 's , sony 's , or perhaps one from a european competitor , like the netherlands ' iliad - will capture the public 's fancy ?
each one has slightly different technical specifications , and is based on different technical platforms .
another big question is how the industry will deal with copyright protection .
some employ digital rights management -lrb- drm , -rrb- a kind of software lock on downloadable books , with the aim of avoiding the music industry 's fate .
since the advent of digital music , record companies have famously seen profits decimated by piracy and illegal downloading .
boumans opposes technological protection on content .
he supports the concept of a " social drm , " which would operate under a " name and shame " system : when a person buys electronic data , his or her name is attached to the file so anyone can see how it is passed around after that .
social pressure would correct the market .
' the ipod principle ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amazon 's kindle is a big seller in the us ultimately , boumans says four things need to be in place before e-books really take off : a device , a portfolio of downloadable material , the download service - and the right price for content .
" that 's when you get what i call the ipod principle , " he said .
" people start downloading things and they are willing to pay for it . "
clearly it is difficult to imagine exactly what shape the digital-literature future will take .
according to buchreport editor wilking , the future may be even more unrecognizable than we can imagine .
for one thing , books may cease to be a collection of words on paper - or even e-paper .
" there are a lot of possibilities when it comes to e-publishing , " wilking said .
" people will be able to build in films and interactive elements .
things we ca n't even imagine yet . "
once these technical possibilities are there , he says , then the authors might start taking them into consideration , and writing for multimedia instead of just the page . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and the traps that girls can sometimes fall into .
i don ’ t think it ’ s good that it is already considered normal .
the actors in learning by ear have great voices – it ’ s almost like watching a film .
i hope that there will be programs in the future that directly tackle the problems faced by young people here in kenya . "
-lrb- dennis donga , kenya -rrb- " i would like to congratulate the author of the series on hiv / aids because it really gets to the heart of our society ’ s problems .
even though condoms are now being handed out en masse to prevent pregnancies and illnesses , people still aren ’ t using them .
i believe that many people are learning from this radio play and benefit from what they hear . "
-lrb- saleh mchiro , kenya -rrb- " whenever i listen to deutsche welle and in particular this new program for young people , i always think about how i can change my behavior to protect myself from hiv .
and now i can inform others who do not know about hiv / aids .
this gives them the knowledge to protect themselves against this dangerous disease that is still killing people throughout the world - and especially in africa . "
-lrb- arnold mushuti , tanzania -rrb- " first of all i want to thank deutsche welle for the hard work of preparing youth programs of learning by ear in order to teach youth about hiv-aids .
this program helps me also to get more ideas about hiv and how to protect myself against the disease .
i am sure that any boy and any girl who listens to this program will be able to protect themselves from this disease . "
-lrb- ester gasau , kagera region , tanzania -rrb- " when i listen to the learning by ear serie hiv-aids i am able to give other youths information about this killer disease known as hiv-aids , because this disease is killing many youths .
therefore i am taking this opportunity to educate my fellow youths in order to avoid the disease . "
-lrb- christian richard , buleba district , tanzania -rrb- " i really like the radio dramas , especially the one about the young girl angela .
these sorts of things also happen here in guinea-bissau .
mothers are scared about talking to their daughters about sexuality .
they learn about sex on the street and are accordingly ill -informed .
i believe that good information is one way of fighting aids – and that is what you are doing .
thank you for your work ; it is not going unnoticed . "

and the traps that girls can sometimes fall into .
i don ’ t think it ’ s good that it is already considered normal .
the actors in learning by ear have great voices – it ’ s almost like watching a film .
i hope that there will be programs in the future that directly tackle the problems faced by young people here in kenya . "
-lrb- dennis donga , kenya -rrb- " i would like to congratulate the author of the series on hiv / aids because it really gets to the heart of our society ’ s problems .
even though condoms are now being handed out en masse to prevent pregnancies and illnesses , people still aren ’ t using them .
i believe that many people are learning from this radio play and benefit from what they hear . "
-lrb- saleh mchiro , kenya -rrb- " whenever i listen to deutsche welle and in particular this new program for young people , i always think about how i can change my behavior to protect myself from hiv .
and now i can inform others who do not know about hiv / aids .
this gives them the knowledge to protect themselves against this dangerous disease that is still killing people throughout the world - and especially in africa . "
-lrb- arnold mushuti , tanzania -rrb- " first of all i want to thank deutsche welle for the hard work of preparing youth programs of learning by ear in order to teach youth about hiv-aids .
this program helps me also to get more ideas about hiv and how to protect myself against the disease .
i am sure that any boy and any girl who listens to this program will be able to protect themselves from this disease . "
-lrb- ester gasau , kagera region , tanzania -rrb- " when i listen to the learning by ear serie hiv-aids i am able to give other youths information about this killer disease known as hiv-aids , because this disease is killing many youths .
therefore i am taking this opportunity to educate my fellow youths in order to avoid the disease . "
-lrb- christian richard , buleba district , tanzania -rrb- " i really like the radio dramas , especially the one about the young girl angela .
these sorts of things also happen here in guinea-bissau .
mothers are scared about talking to their daughters about sexuality .
they learn about sex on the street and are accordingly ill -informed .
i believe that good information is one way of fighting aids – and that is what you are doing .
thank you for your work ; it is not going unnoticed . "

just blocks away , some 300 people demonstrated against what they called the " islamisation of europe . " located in berlin 's pankow district , the 1.6 million-euro -lrb- $ 2.15-million -rrb- mosque has a 12-meter -lrb- 39-foot -rrb- high minaret and can hold 500 worshippers .
built for members of the ahmadiyya muslim community , the mosque was inaugurated on thursday , oct .
16 , with a celebration attended by approximately 300 people , including berlin mayor klaus wowereit .
according to wowereit , the mosque symbolizes " religious and cultural tolerance " in berlin .
his comments may have been overly optimistic , though , given that hundreds of protesting residents and the far-right national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- were gathered only blocks away from the site .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors said they were concerned about the abuse of religious freedom the demonstrators held banners with statements such as , " stop the islamisation of europe " and " stop the abuse of religious freedom . "
a petition against the construction of the mosque had also gathered some 20,000 signatures .
construction plagued by vandalism the ahmadiyya mosque has been a source of controversy since its building plans were announced in 2006 , with attacks on the site hindering its construction .
ijaz ahmad , spokesperson for the mosque , is hopeful however that the new two-story building will help bring clashing muslims and non-muslims in berlin closer together .
" the mosque will be a hub of social activity , not just for praying , " she said .
" it will play a role in boosting integration and promoting dialogue with politicians and other religious groups . "
a local citizens ' group does n't seem to see integration in the cards though .
" we have a big problem with sects that put religion above everything else , allow the beating of women and deny equal rights , " the group said on its web site .
muslims seek asylum in germany berlin is home to about 220,000 muslims , with only 200 belonging to the ahmadiyyah community .
ahmadiyyah 's muslim roots are a source of debate , however , as it is not recognized by some mainstream muslim groups on account of different beliefs .
according to the ahmadiyyah group , it has 30,000 members in germany , many of whom came to the country seeking asylum from religious persecution in pakistan and other islamic countries . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

rhyl and colwyn bay have been designated as part of a regeneration area by the welsh assembly government .
the scheme is designed to boost prosperity of the towns and rid them of negative images .
the rhyl west ward recently topped an index of multiple deprivation while two other local ward areas also feature in table 's top 10 .
the announcement of the regeneration area was made by deputy regeneration minister leighton andrews .
he is visiting rhyl and colwyn bay to discuss the scheme on friday .
the first thing we need to do is reorganise where people are working , and what colwyn bay is about businessman , neil formstone " the issues facing both towns are well known and include poor housing , high levels of deprivation , unemployment , skills and areas where the physical environment is of a poor standard , " he said .
" the towns also suffer from a poor image and public perception .
" these are real challenges to face and overcome but there are also real opportunities that we can work with .

" rhyl and colwyn bay have two of the principal shopping centres on the coast and remain family tourism destinations . "
the scheme is meant to target money more effectively by working with other agencies like the local authority , boosting areas such as tourism and the economy .
pride neil formstone , a businessman and the last chairman of the colwyn bay regeneration partnership , said he remained immensely proud of his home town , but recognised that more needed to be done to help it .
" we had problems in the late 80s , 90s and early 2000s of people coming in - the ' dole by the sea ' scenario that both colwyn bay and rhyl went through , " he said .
" the first thing we need to do is reorganise where people are working , and what colwyn bay is about .
a " stolen goods " sign in rhyl was painted over by mp , chris ruane " are we really a destination for holidaymakers or is this going to be an office town ?
" the town has got to get a bit of pride back in it . "
it is hoped that giving the area regeneration status should allow private and public money to be spent on other projects like housing .
in rhyl , there have been calls to tackle the large number of number of houses of multiple occupation -lrb- hmos -rrb- .
' blighted ' streets " carrots or sticks should be used to turn them back into quality living accommodation , or diversify them in some way , " said chris ruane mp for vale of clwyd .
mr ruane had recently joined councillors to paint over a shop sign which read " rhyl 's biggest receiver of stolen goods " .
he said it had been a constant blight on the town and black paint was used to get rid of the sign .
" i welcome this move of designating area for regeneration .
housing is the key issue , " he said .
" there are 450 hmos in rhyl alone and it only takes one hmo in a street to cause absolute mayhem , " he added .
the designation of a north wales coastal strategic regeneration area would be for seven years initially and could involve millions of pounds for projects in public and private money .
there may be schemes to boost tourism in rhyl and colwyn bay , improve the environment and raise skill levels .

rhyl and colwyn bay have been designated as part of a regeneration area by the welsh assembly government .
the scheme is designed to boost prosperity of the towns and rid them of negative images .
the rhyl west ward recently topped an index of multiple deprivation while two other local ward areas also feature in table 's top 10 .
the announcement of the regeneration area was made by deputy regeneration minister leighton andrews .
he is visiting rhyl and colwyn bay to discuss the scheme on friday .
the first thing we need to do is reorganise where people are working , and what colwyn bay is about businessman , neil formstone " the issues facing both towns are well known and include poor housing , high levels of deprivation , unemployment , skills and areas where the physical environment is of a poor standard , " he said .
" the towns also suffer from a poor image and public perception .
" these are real challenges to face and overcome but there are also real opportunities that we can work with .

" rhyl and colwyn bay have two of the principal shopping centres on the coast and remain family tourism destinations . "
the scheme is meant to target money more effectively by working with other agencies like the local authority , boosting areas such as tourism and the economy .
pride neil formstone , a businessman and the last chairman of the colwyn bay regeneration partnership , said he remained immensely proud of his home town , but recognised that more needed to be done to help it .
" we had problems in the late 80s , 90s and early 2000s of people coming in - the ' dole by the sea ' scenario that both colwyn bay and rhyl went through , " he said .
" the first thing we need to do is reorganise where people are working , and what colwyn bay is about .
a " stolen goods " sign in rhyl was painted over by mp , chris ruane " are we really a destination for holidaymakers or is this going to be an office town ?
" the town has got to get a bit of pride back in it . "
it is hoped that giving the area regeneration status should allow private and public money to be spent on other projects like housing .
in rhyl , there have been calls to tackle the large number of number of houses of multiple occupation -lrb- hmos -rrb- .
' blighted ' streets " carrots or sticks should be used to turn them back into quality living accommodation , or diversify them in some way , " said chris ruane mp for vale of clwyd .
mr ruane had recently joined councillors to paint over a shop sign which read " rhyl 's biggest receiver of stolen goods " .
he said it had been a constant blight on the town and black paint was used to get rid of the sign .
" i welcome this move of designating area for regeneration .
housing is the key issue , " he said .
" there are 450 hmos in rhyl alone and it only takes one hmo in a street to cause absolute mayhem , " he added .
the designation of a north wales coastal strategic regeneration area would be for seven years initially and could involve millions of pounds for projects in public and private money .
there may be schemes to boost tourism in rhyl and colwyn bay , improve the environment and raise skill levels .

shelter cymru said some 24,500 empty private sector properties could be used for families on council waiting lists .
the charity wants councils to use their legislative and financial resources to find homes for the 80,000 households on local authority waiting lists in wales .
the welsh local government association said turmoil in the housing market was restricting what councils could do .
shelter cymru said each of the 24,500 private homes not in use have been empty for six months or longer .
it added that some councils and their partners were carrying out positive work to make better use of empty homes but that more needed to be done .
allowing properties to remain empty and dilapidated is a continual drain on the resources of local authorities and communities john pritchard , shelter cymru john pritchard , from shelter cymru , said : " with the lack of affordable housing across wales and the difficulties that many people are facing in accessing either owner-occupied or rented homes , it is unacceptable that properties are languishing empty in this way .
" people are unable to find suitable homes in their communities , and allowing properties to remain empty has both social and economic costs .
" we need national and local partners to prioritise investment and to work together to implement innovative solutions to this problem . "
' renovation and letting ' shelter cymru 's work with councils has been funded by the assembly government and will provide free advice consultancies and good practice exchanges with the aim of accelerating the effective use of privately owned empty homes .
mr pritchard added : " we call on both the assembly government and local government in wales to prioritise the renovation and letting of empty properties .
" this would ensure that we are making the best use of existing housing at a time of high housing need .
" this also makes sense from an economic and environmental perspective as allowing properties to remain empty and dilapidated is a continual drain on the resources of local authorities and communities . "
a wlga spokesperson said councils recognised that " behind every empty house is a human story " .
she said : " local authorities do have powers to compulsorily purchase or manage a property but this is a complicated process and wherever possible local authorities try to reach an agreement with the owners .
' squeeze ' " next year 's local government settlement will be very tough for councils and will inevitably put a real squeeze on councils ' resources in important areas such as this . "
the welsh assembly government said 17,634 private homes were recorded as vacant for more than six months during 2006/07 and of these 1.49 % -lrb- 263 -rrb- were brought back into use during the year through direct action by local authorities .

gavin allen editor - the politics show oh well - you win some , you lose some .
we interviewed the snp leader alex salmond last sunday .
with the share prices of scottish banks tanking , a £ 1bn aid request submitted to the treasury and the party 's annual conference opening this week , it seemed an opportune moment to put some serious questions to the first minister .
we talked about recession - " it 'll be extremely difficult for scottish output to keep increasing - we 're not immune ...
" our job is to try to avoid a deep recession . "
we challenged him on the snp 's " arc of prosperity " - namely the economies of norway , iceland and ireland , which are cited by the party as models for scotland 's future .
not surprisingly mr salmond endeavoured to focus on norway ...
he expressed his opposition to the lloyds tsb-hbos merger : " my preferred position for hbos is as an independent bank . "
and there was even time to discuss the merits of the snp proposal to ban 18-year-olds from buying alcohol at an off-licence .
stenhousemuir and other areas that have experimented with the scheme had , we learned , " seen a 50 % drop over the weekends in recorded breach of the peace incidents and other reports to the police " .
so plenty to chew on there .
we thought .
but one viewer was brutal in his summary : " i ca n't remember a word that either of them said " .
what ?
why ?
not analytical enough ?
not relevant enough ?
well no ...
" i was transfixed by the backdrop , " explained the viewer matthew parris in his times column .
" sitting in -lrb- presumably -rrb- his garden , the scottish first minister was framed by a gurgling river flowing beneath a rustic stone bridge . -lrb- spot the frog here ... -rrb-
the ripples and bubbles and waving trees were hypnotising .
i even think i saw a frog " .
and off matthew 's mind trotted , musing on the psychological impact of various backdrops , from log fires to a tank of thrashing alligators . -lrb- you can read matthew 's article here ... -rrb-
as i say you win some , you lose some .
on this occasion , we lost , the babbling brook won .
and i guess we should be grateful there was n't an alligator to compete with .
but imagine how mr salmond feels ¿ how do you grab attention and spread the political message when even former mps get distracted by the stream behind you ?
mind you , now he comes to mention it , is that a frog over his left shoulder .. ? -lrb- go on ... spot the frog here ... -rrb-

gavin allen editor - the politics show oh well - you win some , you lose some .
we interviewed the snp leader alex salmond last sunday .
with the share prices of scottish banks tanking , a £ 1bn aid request submitted to the treasury and the party 's annual conference opening this week , it seemed an opportune moment to put some serious questions to the first minister .
we talked about recession - " it 'll be extremely difficult for scottish output to keep increasing - we 're not immune ...
" our job is to try to avoid a deep recession . "
we challenged him on the snp 's " arc of prosperity " - namely the economies of norway , iceland and ireland , which are cited by the party as models for scotland 's future .
not surprisingly mr salmond endeavoured to focus on norway ...
he expressed his opposition to the lloyds tsb-hbos merger : " my preferred position for hbos is as an independent bank . "
and there was even time to discuss the merits of the snp proposal to ban 18-year-olds from buying alcohol at an off-licence .
stenhousemuir and other areas that have experimented with the scheme had , we learned , " seen a 50 % drop over the weekends in recorded breach of the peace incidents and other reports to the police " .
so plenty to chew on there .
we thought .
but one viewer was brutal in his summary : " i ca n't remember a word that either of them said " .
what ?
why ?
not analytical enough ?
not relevant enough ?
well no ...
" i was transfixed by the backdrop , " explained the viewer matthew parris in his times column .
" sitting in -lrb- presumably -rrb- his garden , the scottish first minister was framed by a gurgling river flowing beneath a rustic stone bridge . -lrb- spot the frog here ... -rrb-
the ripples and bubbles and waving trees were hypnotising .
i even think i saw a frog " .
and off matthew 's mind trotted , musing on the psychological impact of various backdrops , from log fires to a tank of thrashing alligators . -lrb- you can read matthew 's article here ... -rrb-
as i say you win some , you lose some .
on this occasion , we lost , the babbling brook won .
and i guess we should be grateful there was n't an alligator to compete with .
but imagine how mr salmond feels ¿ how do you grab attention and spread the political message when even former mps get distracted by the stream behind you ?
mind you , now he comes to mention it , is that a frog over his left shoulder .. ? -lrb- go on ... spot the frog here ... -rrb-

the 47-year-old said his us agent had been approached about the job , along with a list of many other names .
the star told bbc news he would be " scared " to do it because " i do n't think i 'd get the freedom i needed " .
he added : " if it was a fun night and they said you could ad-lib , i 'd do it because i really enjoy that . "

" the reason i turn down films is because they 're arbitrary or i thought i could n't have enough sway or power . "
the actor revealed he believed jerry seinfeld had turned down the job when he was asked to do it on a previous occasion .
gervais claimed the us comedian had not accepted the role because " no-one 's there to hear jokes , they 're there to see if they 've won an oscar " .
ghost town is gervais 's first hollywood lead role gervais added that hosting the academy awards ceremony for that reason would be a " thankless task " .
despite that , he admitted he is " flattered " to be considered .
likening the job to a party invitation , he said : " i still want to be invited .
i want the invite to turn it down . "
but the office star has not completely ruled out accepting the presenting role .
" it 's one i 'd certainly think about , " he said .

the 47-year-old said his us agent had been approached about the job , along with a list of many other names .
the star told bbc news he would be " scared " to do it because " i do n't think i 'd get the freedom i needed " .

the actor revealed he believed jerry seinfeld had turned down the job when he was asked to do it on a previous occasion .
gervais claimed the us comedian had not accepted the role because " no-one 's there to hear jokes , they 're there to see if they 've won an oscar " .

its chairman , naresh goyal , said the move had been his alone and apologised " for all the agony you went through " .
reports suggest that the government persuaded mr goyal to take back the employees , but he denied this .
the company had announced it planned to lay off a total of 1,900 staff in the coming days in an effort to cut costs .
india 's once booming aviation sector has been hard hit by soaring costs , mainly due to global fuel price rises .
earlier , air india said it was planning to offer nearly 15,000 of its employees leave without pay for up to five years .
a spokesman for the state-owned airline stressed that the offer would be voluntary .
' tears in the eyes ' jet airways had announced on wednesday that some 800 cabin crew who were recently recruited for a planned expansion programme would be laid off , and that it expected to cut a further 1,100 jobs .

late on thursday , jet airways chairman naresh goyal said that he had personally decided to reverse the cost-cutting decision and reinstate the cabin crew .
" i apologise for all the agony you went through , " he told a news conference in mumbai , adding that he could not bear to " see tears in their eyes " .
" the management will have to understand sometimes in a family there are disagreements , but the father of the family decides . "
mr goyal also stressed that the decision had not been the result of political pressure or meetings with any concerned parties .
federal aviation minister praful patel told reporters that he had spoken to mr goyal about resolving the problem .
" i had also told him that in 24 hours we must find a resolution to this problem , otherwise we in the ministry would certainly not be very happy with the approach of jet airways , " he said .
" wisdom has -lsb- now -rsb- prevailed and we are all happy . "
channels showed pictures of reinstated jet airways employees celebrating the decision and returning to work on friday .
on monday , jet airways announced a code-sharing alliance with another private indian airline , kingfisher , to help cut costs .

its chairman , naresh goyal , said the move had been his alone and apologised " for all the agony you went through " .

but much like his us arch nemesis george w bush , mr ahmadinejad has faced growing criticism at home over his economic record .
newspapers are dominated by stories of soaring prices and high unemployment , with some pointing the finger of blame at the president 's populist policies .
with less than a year to go before the next presidential election , discontent over the economy could harm mr ahmadinejad 's chances of securing another term in office .
economic policy mr ahmadinejad came to power in 2005 with a pledge to fight corruption and defend the interests of iran 's poor .

despite widespread public debate over economic policy , there is no single official document setting out the government 's economic objectives .
it is now considering a so-called " economic transformation plan " , which will be put before iran 's parliament , the majlis .
the hope is that it will reduce government subsidies -lrb- especially on energy -rrb- , give more freedom to the private sector and reduce the country 's reliance on oil revenue .
there has been consistent criticism of government economic policy from iran 's pro-reform political parties .
in september , mosharekat , the party of former president mohammad khatami , said that " despite mythical levels of oil revenue , iran 's economic status has been in decline " .
a survey in tehran showed big fears over the high prices it added that " the class gap has increased , the lower and middle classes , particularly labourers and public sector workers , have been hurt and the development of infrastructure has suffered " .
another opposition party , the organisation of the mojahedin of the islamic revolution of iran -lrb- omiri -rrb- , has accused the government of " unwise and destructive " policies , and also blamed mr ahmadinejad 's " aggressive " foreign policy for bringing international sanctions upon the country .
meanwhile , the man who holds ultimate power in iran , supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei , has given only guarded support to mr ahmadinejad 's policies .
in august , he told the president to be " cautious " and avoid any " hasty behaviour " regarding the economy .
public opinion but how do ordinary iranians feel ?
due to restrictions imposed on the media , little is known about the level of discontent in the private sector or among trade unions .
but other indicators , such as opinion polls and readers ' letters to newspapers , suggest that the economy is priority number one .

some 90 % felt that inflation and high prices were a big problem .
housing and unemployment were also major concerns .
mr ahmadinejad has frequently railed against western " pressure " and the sanctions imposed on tehran over its nuclear programme .
the same survey asked people whether they thought these were to blame for iran 's economic difficulties .
