he has linked the issue with national security , saying that protectionism would isolate the united states .
mccain expressed his enthusiasm for a huge free trading bloc .
" i am an unashamed and unabashed defender of nafta .
i am an unabashed supporter of free trade agreements .
in fact , it would be interesting to have a free trade agreement between ourselves and the european union , " mccain said in a speech to the world affairs council on wednesday , march 26 .
" they are one of the largest economic blocs in the world , if not the largest .
i think to head a free trade agreement with the european union would be a great thing to happen , " mccain told reporters as he headed for his next campaign event in monterey , california .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nafta free trade deal between canada , us and mexico is a us electoral issue the unites states and the eu already have low tariffs on most of the manufactured goods that cross the atlantic .
recently , they have also begun an initiative aimed at eliminating regulatory barriers that hamper commerce .
agriculture has been an obstacle to bilateral trade deal but both sides have preferred to deal with the tricky agricultural issues within the context of world trade talks , rather than negotiate a bilateral free trade deal to entirely phase out tariffs on each other 's farm goods .
at the same time , some members of congress have called for a services free trade agreement that would reduce or eliminate barriers to trade and investment in areas such as banking , insurance and telecommunications .
the issue of foreign trade is an emotive issue in the united states particularly in democratic heartlands , such as the rust belt of the united states where cheap imports have been blamed for the region 's economic woes and in farming communities .
all just electoral maneuvering ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both clinton and obama have taken a more cautious tack on free trade democratic presidential candidates barack obama and hillary clinton have threatened to withdraw from nafta if mexico and canada do not agree to renegotiate the pact and include stronger labor and environmental provisions .
clinton has also said she would introduce " time-out " from new free trade agreements if elected president .
in an allusion to his opponents ' stance , mccain drew attention to the fact that some eu environmental standards and labor standards were higher than us requirements and added that it would be interesting to see how free trade opponents would react to that .
the republican candidate has shown himself eager to play up his pro-european credentials with a transatlantic trip to paris and london earlier this month .
some observers have , however , have raised doubts about his intentions , with some suggesting mccain 's european drive is designed to serve a domestic purpose . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" a mine , which was planted by taliban militants in qasab area of the district , hit a nato forces ' tank , " omar said .
" the tank was damaged and three german soldiers were seriously wounded . "
he blamed taliban militants , whose government was toppled in a us- led military invasion in late 2001 , for the attack .
" during the taliban time , they were very active in this area , and now they still have their loyalists , whom they can use for this kind of attacks , " the governor said .
taliban claim responsibility as part of new offensive the taliban took responsibility for the attack in kunduz .
" in qasab village of chardara , a nato tank was blown up by a mine , planted on the road by our mujahideen , " the group said in a statement posted on a rebel website .
it claimed that the tank was " completely destroyed and 13 soldiers inside the vehicle were killed or wounded . "
the statement said that the attack was part of a " spring offensive , " announced by the militants on wednesday .
taliban militants are not very active in the northern provinces of afghanistan , compared to southern and eastern regions , where the rebels are the most entrenched .
afghan defence minister abdul rahim wardak said on thursday in a video conference from nato headquarters in kabul that the militants intended to expand their insurgency to the peaceful northern and western provinces of the country this year .
" we are expecting the taliban to rely very heavily on ied roadside bombs and suicide attacks , " wardak said .
pressure has been growing on germany to deploy some of its forces to help combat the taliban insurgency in the more volatile south of the country .
the attack on the troops near kunduz comes just a day after canadian defense minister peter mackay became the latest to call for a german combat deployment in an interview with der spiegel magazine .
canadian defense minister questions germany 's commitment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many leaders want german troops deployed in the south mackay said nato allies were not sharing the burden evenly between them and that germany should send its troops to help with combat operations in southern afghanistan instead of confining them to the relatively peaceful north , hinting that he thought germany was not fulfilling its international obligations .
" i understand that troop deployments are very difficult to push through in germany for domestic political reasons , but there are also international commitments that we all have to meet , " mackay said .
canada had lost more than 80 soldiers in operations , mainly in combat operations in kandahar province , he noted .
german losses in afghanistan total 26 troops and three police officers since forces were first sent there more than five years ago .
mackay warned of the dangers of a " two-class " nato and said all member states had to carry their share of the burdens .
germany would profit from a stable afghanistan unable to export terrorism , he said .
" the future of afghanistan lies in nato 's hands .
the taliban and terrorist organizations are like a cancer .
they proliferate and threaten human lives over the whole world , " he said .
mackay expressed admiration for germany and said german troops wanted to do more in afghanistan .

" a mine , which was planted by taliban militants in qasab area of the district , hit a nato forces ' tank , " omar said .
" the tank was damaged and three german soldiers were seriously wounded . "
he blamed taliban militants , whose government was toppled in a us- led military invasion in late 2001 , for the attack .
" during the taliban time , they were very active in this area , and now they still have their loyalists , whom they can use for this kind of attacks , " the governor said .
taliban claim responsibility as part of new offensive the taliban took responsibility for the attack in kunduz .
" in qasab village of chardara , a nato tank was blown up by a mine , planted on the road by our mujahideen , " the group said in a statement posted on a rebel website .
it claimed that the tank was " completely destroyed and 13 soldiers inside the vehicle were killed or wounded . "
the statement said that the attack was part of a " spring offensive , " announced by the militants on wednesday .
taliban militants are not very active in the northern provinces of afghanistan , compared to southern and eastern regions , where the rebels are the most entrenched .
afghan defence minister abdul rahim wardak said on thursday in a video conference from nato headquarters in kabul that the militants intended to expand their insurgency to the peaceful northern and western provinces of the country this year .
" we are expecting the taliban to rely very heavily on ied roadside bombs and suicide attacks , " wardak said .
pressure has been growing on germany to deploy some of its forces to help combat the taliban insurgency in the more volatile south of the country .
the attack on the troops near kunduz comes just a day after canadian defense minister peter mackay became the latest to call for a german combat deployment in an interview with der spiegel magazine .
canadian defense minister questions germany 's commitment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many leaders want german troops deployed in the south mackay said nato allies were not sharing the burden evenly between them and that germany should send its troops to help with combat operations in southern afghanistan instead of confining them to the relatively peaceful north , hinting that he thought germany was not fulfilling its international obligations .
" i understand that troop deployments are very difficult to push through in germany for domestic political reasons , but there are also international commitments that we all have to meet , " mackay said .
canada had lost more than 80 soldiers in operations , mainly in combat operations in kandahar province , he noted .
german losses in afghanistan total 26 troops and three police officers since forces were first sent there more than five years ago .
mackay warned of the dangers of a " two-class " nato and said all member states had to carry their share of the burdens .
germany would profit from a stable afghanistan unable to export terrorism , he said .
" the future of afghanistan lies in nato 's hands .
the taliban and terrorist organizations are like a cancer .
they proliferate and threaten human lives over the whole world , " he said .
mackay expressed admiration for germany and said german troops wanted to do more in afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has six tornado jets stationed in afghanistan germany has up to 3,500 troops stationed in the country , mainly deployed on reconstruction and training missions from their base at mazar-e-sharif in balkh province .
it also maintains a flight of six reconnaissance tornado jets .
the afghan mission , the annual mandate for which comes up for parliamentary renewal in october , enjoys broad backing in the bundestag but is consistently opposed by a majority of the population .
danish soldier killed in firefight with taliban in an earlier attack in southern afghanistan , a danish soldier was killed and another wounded in a firefight with taliban insurgents , according to a statement from isaf .
the danes were on patrol wednesday in helmand province , a hotbed of taliban activity , when they came under fire in the gereshk area , the isaf spokesman in the province , british lieutenant colonel simon miller , told reporters .
" regrettably as a result of the firefight one danish soldier was killed and another was wounded , " miller said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has lost 26 troops and three police officers including the latest death , denmark has lost 13 soldiers in afghanistan .
two other danes were killed march 17 in an attack on an isaf convoy .
denmark has about 550 troops in helmand , where most international soldiers with isaf are british .
more than 30 international soldiers have been killed this year , most of them in hostile action .
a total of 787 coalition soldiers have lost their lives since the us-led invasion of afghanistan was launched in 2001 .
isaf draws its 47,000 troops from 39 countries .
it is helping the afghan government restore security in the face of an insurgency by the taliban , who were in government between 1996 and 2001 , and promote development . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany is proud that half of its banking sector is state-run , he added . dw-radio : when and where does state intervention make sense ? norbert walter : state intervention only makes sense when all other private economic means have already been implemented - not just theoretically , but also practically .
that means , when a bank incurs speculation losses , changes its management , has used all of its available capital and made an effort to obtain new capital and / or a foreign or domestic strategic investor .
only after these efforts have failed is it appropriate for the state to ask whether it 's important to the financial system in the affected country to rescue the institution that 's in danger of collapsing or not . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norbert walter sometimes it 's wise to rescue an important institution that plays an important role in the economy when there is no private solution .
but this process should be carefully considered and it 's clear that , if this step is taken , it can not be carried out by a central bank .
rather , it 's the job of the government and of those who decide how tax money is spent - namely , the parliament . but there already seems to be an imbalance .
generally speaking , companies pay for their own mistakes , but this does n't seem to be the case in the banking sector .
banks pocket the profits , but expect society to pick up the losses .
is this acceptable ? this is not at all acceptable .
it also is n't a very good arrangement for the future , since it encourages making contracts that burden a third party . and these contracts are responsible for difficulties we 've seen at the westlb and ikb banks ? i did n't say that , you did .
we should keep in mind that in germany - with transparency and with the agreement of the people and nearly all of the political parties - half of the banking sector has been state-run from the very beginning .
we 're very proud of this in germany .
and the politicians are convinced that this is the right way to organize our monetary system .
when institutions that are either owned or overseen by the state experience a crisis , as was the case in dresden -lsb- the former headquarters of sachsenlb , which was bought out by another regional bank - eds . -rsb- and dusseldorf -lsb- headquarters for westlb -rsb- and at ikb , it 's only obvious that the owners have to step in - which in this case is the state . it was the highly paid bank personnel who utterly failed and demonstrated extreme naivete .
what personnel decisions can banks make to avoid a repeat of the situation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank announced it would n't meet its profit target for 2008 the management team was fired and replaced with new managers .
it 's appropriate that those who squander their own money are no longer suited to run a bank .
it 's also appropriate that the state and other institutions like supervisory bodies help find new owners .
we 'd have reason to worry if this process were to be lost .
it 's been successful in a series of cases where domestic capital and management were available .
for example , with bear stones and jp morgan .
in other cases , where owners ' equity was lost , international investors were ready , like in the case of ubs in switzerland , where singapore was ready to subsidize a bank that had lost a gamble but is a very attractive bank in other important areas . the bank crisis started in the us .

germany is proud that half of its banking sector is state-run , he added . dw-radio : when and where does state intervention make sense ? norbert walter : state intervention only makes sense when all other private economic means have already been implemented - not just theoretically , but also practically .
that means , when a bank incurs speculation losses , changes its management , has used all of its available capital and made an effort to obtain new capital and / or a foreign or domestic strategic investor .
only after these efforts have failed is it appropriate for the state to ask whether it 's important to the financial system in the affected country to rescue the institution that 's in danger of collapsing or not . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norbert walter sometimes it 's wise to rescue an important institution that plays an important role in the economy when there is no private solution .
but this process should be carefully considered and it 's clear that , if this step is taken , it can not be carried out by a central bank .
rather , it 's the job of the government and of those who decide how tax money is spent - namely , the parliament . but there already seems to be an imbalance .

" this is the first time that we have had a proper overview of the cost situation , " a company spokesman said . he added that the company had ascertained that it was not possible to implement the project for 1.85 billion euros . the german government had agreed to bear half the cost for the train line , but up to a maximum of 925 million euros .

" this is a bad day for germany 's image as the home of high-tech industry , " beckstein said . the transrapid project would have trimmed the current 40 minute journey from munich to the airport down to 10 minutes - and had been billed by many as a coup for the prosperous southern german city . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the federal government is not prepared to increase its contribution , " tiefensee said .
" we had to conclude that it is not possible to finance this project . " death knell for mag-lev technology ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the transrapid is in operation in shanghai industry observers say that without a showcase project in germany for one of the world 's fastest trains , the technology devised by engineers at siemens and thyssenkrupp is unlikely to have much success abroad . the transrapid technology has currently only been used commercially in china .
another plan to build a magnetic-levitation monorail link between hamburg and berlin has already been scrapped .
a crash that led to 23 deaths on a test stretch in 2006 was caused by human error , but it was clearly a severe pr setback for transrapid . mutual blame game for the failure of the project bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crash in lathen im emsland was blamed on a human error the firms involved in the munich project have blamed each other for the runaway costs . siemens ceo peter loescher indirectly attributed it to construction industry partners hochtief , saying that his company and thyssenkrupp had kept to the guidelines .
thyssenkrupp officials said they were not " responsible " for hochtief 's figures . hochtief rebutted these accusations , saying it had not been involved in the 2004 estimate . " this is the first time that we have had a proper overview of the cost situation , " a company spokesman said . he added that the company had ascertained that it was not possible to implement the project for 1.85 billion euros . the german government had agreed to bear half the cost for the train line , but up to a maximum of 925 million euros .
the state of bavaria had earmarked 500 million euros - with german state railways deutsche bahn , the airport , the european union and the two companies involved making up the remainder . bavaria 's pride and joy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new bavarian state premier said he did his best to keep the project on track the project was announced last year by then bavarian premier edmund stoiber just before he stood down as head of the southern state 's conservative party in september and many observers saw it as a " parting present " from angela merkel 's christian democrats to the csu , the cdu 's bavarian sister party . bavarian premier guenter beckstein said he had lobbied hard to persuade the federal government to increase its contribution , but to no avail . " this is a bad day for germany 's image as the home of high-tech industry , " beckstein said . the transrapid project would have trimmed the current 40 minute journey from munich to the airport down to 10 minutes - and had been billed by many as a coup for the prosperous southern german city . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de banking -pipe- 27.03.2008 state intervention remains last resort , economist says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the state should throw a lifeline when every other option has been tried , said walter when all other avenues have been exhausted , the state should bail out a flailing bank , said deutsche bank 's head economist norbert walter .
germany is proud that half of its banking sector is state-run , he added . dw-radio : when and where does state intervention make sense ? norbert walter : state intervention only makes sense when all other private economic means have already been implemented - not just theoretically , but also practically .
that means , when a bank incurs speculation losses , changes its management , has used all of its available capital and made an effort to obtain new capital and / or a foreign or domestic strategic investor .
only after these efforts have failed is it appropriate for the state to ask whether it 's important to the financial system in the affected country to rescue the institution that 's in danger of collapsing or not . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norbert walter sometimes it 's wise to rescue an important institution that plays an important role in the economy when there is no private solution .
but this process should be carefully considered and it 's clear that , if this step is taken , it can not be carried out by a central bank .
rather , it 's the job of the government and of those who decide how tax money is spent - namely , the parliament . but there already seems to be an imbalance .
generally speaking , companies pay for their own mistakes , but this does n't seem to be the case in the banking sector .
banks pocket the profits , but expect society to pick up the losses .
is this acceptable ? this is not at all acceptable .
it also is n't a very good arrangement for the future , since it encourages making contracts that burden a third party . and these contracts are responsible for difficulties we 've seen at the westlb and ikb banks ? i did n't say that , you did .
we should keep in mind that in germany - with transparency and with the agreement of the people and nearly all of the political parties - half of the banking sector has been state-run from the very beginning .
we 're very proud of this in germany .
and the politicians are convinced that this is the right way to organize our monetary system .
when institutions that are either owned or overseen by the state experience a crisis , as was the case in dresden -lsb- the former headquarters of sachsenlb , which was bought out by another regional bank - eds . -rsb- and dusseldorf -lsb- headquarters for westlb -rsb- and at ikb , it 's only obvious that the owners have to step in - which in this case is the state . it was the highly paid bank personnel who utterly failed and demonstrated extreme naivete .
what personnel decisions can banks make to avoid a repeat of the situation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank announced it would n't meet its profit target for 2008 the management team was fired and replaced with new managers .
it 's appropriate that those who squander their own money are no longer suited to run a bank .
it 's also appropriate that the state and other institutions like supervisory bodies help find new owners .
we 'd have reason to worry if this process were to be lost .
it 's been successful in a series of cases where domestic capital and management were available .
for example , with bear stones and jp morgan .
in other cases , where owners ' equity was lost , international investors were ready , like in the case of ubs in switzerland , where singapore was ready to subsidize a bank that had lost a gamble but is a very attractive bank in other important areas . the bank crisis started in the us .
but how are things looking here in germany ?
is the situation more stable ? unlike in the us , or england or spain or australia , our real estate prices have n't been exaggerated over the past 10 years .
there the prices have more than doubled - or tripled , as is the case in spain .
in germany , the prices have remained stable or even sunk in some cases .
as far as the real estate market itself goes , we 're atypical .
we are n't expecting the problems that england , spain , australia and the us are currently facing . interview : wolfgang dick -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

another plan to build a magnetic-levitation monorail link between hamburg and berlin has already been scrapped .

thyssenkrupp officials said they were not " responsible " for hochtief 's figures . hochtief rebutted these accusations , saying it had not been involved in the 2004 estimate . " this is the first time that we have had a proper overview of the cost situation , " a company spokesman said . he added that the company had ascertained that it was not possible to implement the project for 1.85 billion euros . the german government had agreed to bear half the cost for the train line , but up to a maximum of 925 million euros .

" this is a bad day for germany 's image as the home of high-tech industry , " beckstein said . the transrapid project would have trimmed the current 40 minute journey from munich to the airport down to 10 minutes - and had been billed by many as a coup for the prosperous southern german city . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the near-term outlook continues to be challenging , " deutsche bank ceo josef ackerman wrote in a letter to shareholders .
" conditions remain difficult both in financial markets and the wider economy , " he said .
deutsche said ackermann earned around 14 million euros in salary and bonuses last year with the bank chalking up a record profit of 6.5 billion euros in 2007 .
the bank 's 8.4-billion-euro pre-tax earnings target excludes one-off costs and charges .
after taking hold during the second half of last year , the us mortgage market crisis " has persisted into the early months of 2008 , and continues to weigh on both financial markets and the wider global economy , " ackerman told the bank 's shareholders .
stricken bank may face audit europe has not escaped the credit crunch , which first bit in august when banks worldwide hit the brakes on lending to each other as it emerged that some were dangerously exposed to the us subprime mortgage meltdown .
germany 's main casualty of the subprime crisis , the state-owned ikb bank , faces a possible special audit by the government to find out who is to blame for its losses amounting to millions of euros when its investments in the market for risky us mortgages soured .
ikb became the first victim of the subprime crisis last year and was bailed out twice by shareholders in rescues costing more than six billion euros .
german state-owned bank kfw , which is ikb 's biggest shareholder with a 38-percent stake , has shouldered the lion 's share of the bail-out so far . the audit , which would be conducted by an independent auditing company , will delay a vote of confidence in the bank 's boards . split government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : effects from the us subprime mortgage crisis are continuing to play out around the globe a german finance ministry spokesman told the financial times deutschland that the ministry saw the audit as a way to show that the ikb 's supervisory board had acted correctly . " responsibility lies solely with the executive board , which informed people badly , " the unnamed spokesman told the paper . according to news reports , the audit is a compromise between finance and economics ministries as they failed to agree on a common strategy .

" a mine , which was planted by taliban militants in qasab area of the district , hit a nato forces ' tank , " omar said .
" the tank was damaged and three german soldiers were seriously wounded . "
he blamed taliban militants , whose government was toppled in a us- led military invasion in late 2001 , for the attack .
" during the taliban time , they were very active in this area , and now they still have their loyalists , whom they can use for this kind of attacks , " the governor said .
taliban claim responsibility as part of new offensive the taliban took responsibility for the attack in kunduz .
" in qasab village of chardara , a nato tank was blown up by a mine , planted on the road by our mujahideen , " the group said in a statement posted on a rebel website .
it claimed that the tank was " completely destroyed and 13 soldiers inside the vehicle were killed or wounded . "
the statement said that the attack was part of a " spring offensive , " announced by the militants on wednesday .
taliban militants are not very active in the northern provinces of afghanistan , compared to southern and eastern regions , where the rebels are the most entrenched .
afghan defence minister abdul rahim wardak said on thursday in a video conference from nato headquarters in kabul that the militants intended to expand their insurgency to the peaceful northern and western provinces of the country this year .
" we are expecting the taliban to rely very heavily on ied roadside bombs and suicide attacks , " wardak said .
pressure has been growing on germany to deploy some of its forces to help combat the taliban insurgency in the more volatile south of the country .
the attack on the troops near kunduz comes just a day after canadian defense minister peter mackay became the latest to call for a german combat deployment in an interview with der spiegel magazine .
canadian defense minister questions germany 's commitment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many leaders want german troops deployed in the south mackay said nato allies were not sharing the burden evenly between them and that germany should send its troops to help with combat operations in southern afghanistan instead of confining them to the relatively peaceful north , hinting that he thought germany was not fulfilling its international obligations .
" i understand that troop deployments are very difficult to push through in germany for domestic political reasons , but there are also international commitments that we all have to meet , " mackay said .
canada had lost more than 80 soldiers in operations , mainly in combat operations in kandahar province , he noted .
german losses in afghanistan total 26 troops and three police officers since forces were first sent there more than five years ago .
mackay warned of the dangers of a " two-class " nato and said all member states had to carry their share of the burdens .
germany would profit from a stable afghanistan unable to export terrorism , he said .
" the future of afghanistan lies in nato 's hands .
the taliban and terrorist organizations are like a cancer .
they proliferate and threaten human lives over the whole world , " he said .
mackay expressed admiration for germany and said german troops wanted to do more in afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has six tornado jets stationed in afghanistan germany has up to 3,500 troops stationed in the country , mainly deployed on reconstruction and training missions from their base at mazar-e-sharif in balkh province .
it also maintains a flight of six reconnaissance tornado jets .
the afghan mission , the annual mandate for which comes up for parliamentary renewal in october , enjoys broad backing in the bundestag but is consistently opposed by a majority of the population .
danish soldier killed in firefight with taliban in an earlier attack in southern afghanistan , a danish soldier was killed and another wounded in a firefight with taliban insurgents , according to a statement from isaf .
the danes were on patrol wednesday in helmand province , a hotbed of taliban activity , when they came under fire in the gereshk area , the isaf spokesman in the province , british lieutenant colonel simon miller , told reporters .
" regrettably as a result of the firefight one danish soldier was killed and another was wounded , " miller said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has lost 26 troops and three police officers including the latest death , denmark has lost 13 soldiers in afghanistan .
two other danes were killed march 17 in an attack on an isaf convoy .
denmark has about 550 troops in helmand , where most international soldiers with isaf are british .
more than 30 international soldiers have been killed this year , most of them in hostile action .
a total of 787 coalition soldiers have lost their lives since the us-led invasion of afghanistan was launched in 2001 .
isaf draws its 47,000 troops from 39 countries .
it is helping the afghan government restore security in the face of an insurgency by the taliban , who were in government between 1996 and 2001 , and promote development . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de banking -pipe- 27.03.2008 state intervention remains last resort , economist says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the state should throw a lifeline when every other option has been tried , said walter when all other avenues have been exhausted , the state should bail out a flailing bank , said deutsche bank 's head economist norbert walter .
germany is proud that half of its banking sector is state-run , he added . dw-radio : when and where does state intervention make sense ? norbert walter : state intervention only makes sense when all other private economic means have already been implemented - not just theoretically , but also practically .
that means , when a bank incurs speculation losses , changes its management , has used all of its available capital and made an effort to obtain new capital and / or a foreign or domestic strategic investor .
only after these efforts have failed is it appropriate for the state to ask whether it 's important to the financial system in the affected country to rescue the institution that 's in danger of collapsing or not . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norbert walter sometimes it 's wise to rescue an important institution that plays an important role in the economy when there is no private solution .
but this process should be carefully considered and it 's clear that , if this step is taken , it can not be carried out by a central bank .
rather , it 's the job of the government and of those who decide how tax money is spent - namely , the parliament . but there already seems to be an imbalance .
generally speaking , companies pay for their own mistakes , but this does n't seem to be the case in the banking sector .
banks pocket the profits , but expect society to pick up the losses .
is this acceptable ? this is not at all acceptable .
it also is n't a very good arrangement for the future , since it encourages making contracts that burden a third party . and these contracts are responsible for difficulties we 've seen at the westlb and ikb banks ? i did n't say that , you did .
we should keep in mind that in germany - with transparency and with the agreement of the people and nearly all of the political parties - half of the banking sector has been state-run from the very beginning .
we 're very proud of this in germany .
and the politicians are convinced that this is the right way to organize our monetary system .
when institutions that are either owned or overseen by the state experience a crisis , as was the case in dresden -lsb- the former headquarters of sachsenlb , which was bought out by another regional bank - eds . -rsb- and dusseldorf -lsb- headquarters for westlb -rsb- and at ikb , it 's only obvious that the owners have to step in - which in this case is the state . it was the highly paid bank personnel who utterly failed and demonstrated extreme naivete .
what personnel decisions can banks make to avoid a repeat of the situation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank announced it would n't meet its profit target for 2008 the management team was fired and replaced with new managers .
it 's appropriate that those who squander their own money are no longer suited to run a bank .
it 's also appropriate that the state and other institutions like supervisory bodies help find new owners .
we 'd have reason to worry if this process were to be lost .
it 's been successful in a series of cases where domestic capital and management were available .
for example , with bear stones and jp morgan .
in other cases , where owners ' equity was lost , international investors were ready , like in the case of ubs in switzerland , where singapore was ready to subsidize a bank that had lost a gamble but is a very attractive bank in other important areas . the bank crisis started in the us .
but how are things looking here in germany ?
is the situation more stable ? unlike in the us , or england or spain or australia , our real estate prices have n't been exaggerated over the past 10 years .
there the prices have more than doubled - or tripled , as is the case in spain .
in germany , the prices have remained stable or even sunk in some cases .
as far as the real estate market itself goes , we 're atypical .
we are n't expecting the problems that england , spain , australia and the us are currently facing . interview : wolfgang dick -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the near-term outlook continues to be challenging , " deutsche bank ceo josef ackerman wrote in a letter to shareholders .
" conditions remain difficult both in financial markets and the wider economy , " he said .
deutsche said ackermann earned around 14 million euros in salary and bonuses last year with the bank chalking up a record profit of 6.5 billion euros in 2007 .
the bank 's 8.4-billion-euro pre-tax earnings target excludes one-off costs and charges .
after taking hold during the second half of last year , the us mortgage market crisis " has persisted into the early months of 2008 , and continues to weigh on both financial markets and the wider global economy , " ackerman told the bank 's shareholders .
stricken bank may face audit europe has not escaped the credit crunch , which first bit in august when banks worldwide hit the brakes on lending to each other as it emerged that some were dangerously exposed to the us subprime mortgage meltdown .
germany 's main casualty of the subprime crisis , the state-owned ikb bank , faces a possible special audit by the government to find out who is to blame for its losses amounting to millions of euros when its investments in the market for risky us mortgages soured .
ikb became the first victim of the subprime crisis last year and was bailed out twice by shareholders in rescues costing more than six billion euros .
german state-owned bank kfw , which is ikb 's biggest shareholder with a 38-percent stake , has shouldered the lion 's share of the bail-out so far . the audit , which would be conducted by an independent auditing company , will delay a vote of confidence in the bank 's boards . split government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : effects from the us subprime mortgage crisis are continuing to play out around the globe a german finance ministry spokesman told the financial times deutschland that the ministry saw the audit as a way to show that the ikb 's supervisory board had acted correctly .

" we want to ensure the future of our sites with strong partners who share technology , development costs and capital investments and are able to deliver large work packages at competitive costs .

an ohb statement said that the euro 's strength lowered the prospects for an adequate return on their planned investment in the plants . airbus admitted that the volatility of financial markets and the rise of the euro against the dollar had created obstacles " to an easy and smooth implementation of this process . " the site divestment strategy is part of a vast restructuring plan announced in february last year dubbed power8 , which involves 10,000 job cuts over four years and the sale of six airbus factories .
the major restructuring follows on from severe losses resulting from a two-year delay in delivering the airbus a380 superjumbo . the other sites up for sale are the filton works in britain and the french plants at meaulte and saint nazaire .

" the federal government is not prepared to increase its contribution , " tiefensee said .
" we had to conclude that it is not possible to finance this project . " death knell for mag-lev technology ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the transrapid is in operation in shanghai industry observers say that without a showcase project in germany for one of the world 's fastest trains , the technology devised by engineers at siemens and thyssenkrupp is unlikely to have much success abroad . the transrapid technology has currently only been used commercially in china .
another plan to build a magnetic-levitation monorail link between hamburg and berlin has already been scrapped .
a crash that led to 23 deaths on a test stretch in 2006 was caused by human error , but it was clearly a severe pr setback for transrapid . mutual blame game for the failure of the project bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crash in lathen im emsland was blamed on a human error the firms involved in the munich project have blamed each other for the runaway costs . siemens ceo peter loescher indirectly attributed it to construction industry partners hochtief , saying that his company and thyssenkrupp had kept to the guidelines .
thyssenkrupp officials said they were not " responsible " for hochtief 's figures . hochtief rebutted these accusations , saying it had not been involved in the 2004 estimate . " this is the first time that we have had a proper overview of the cost situation , " a company spokesman said . he added that the company had ascertained that it was not possible to implement the project for 1.85 billion euros . the german government had agreed to bear half the cost for the train line , but up to a maximum of 925 million euros .
the state of bavaria had earmarked 500 million euros - with german state railways deutsche bahn , the airport , the european union and the two companies involved making up the remainder . bavaria 's pride and joy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new bavarian state premier said he did his best to keep the project on track the project was announced last year by then bavarian premier edmund stoiber just before he stood down as head of the southern state 's conservative party in september and many observers saw it as a " parting present " from angela merkel 's christian democrats to the csu , the cdu 's bavarian sister party . bavarian premier guenter beckstein said he had lobbied hard to persuade the federal government to increase its contribution , but to no avail . " this is a bad day for germany 's image as the home of high-tech industry , " beckstein said . the transrapid project would have trimmed the current 40 minute journey from munich to the airport down to 10 minutes - and had been billed by many as a coup for the prosperous southern german city . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

when faced with the subject of their own phobias , people tend to exhibit a number of erratic responses . for example , acrophobics - those who are afraid of heights - may drop to the floor of a tall structure or hug a part of the building which they are convinced is immovable . the stereotypical response for muriphobics - people who are scared of mice - is to stand on a chair , pull their skirt tight around their knees and scream like a banshee ; that is if the muriphobic is a woman or a character from a tom & jerry cartoon . but even those who study phobias can not say for sure how a person will react to being faced with their nemesis .
there is no standard response apart from total and irrational fear . so who to say that the german muriphobic who ran out into the street in sub-zero temperatures wearing just his boxer shorts and a pair of fluffy slippers is any crazier than the next person battling a fear of mice ? the local police who then led a search of the petrified man 's house , that 's who . no time to dress as fear strikes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " a mouse ... a mouse ! "
after being seen cowering semi-naked in a phone booth in the town of goettingen , the man was approached by the officers hoping for something a little racier than just some sleepwalker or an extreme jogger who had forgotten his keys . but instead of accosting a pervert lurking for prey , the local cops found the quivering 23-year-old to be the victim - of mouse-stalking . the man told police he had seen the mouse scurry across the floor while he was watching a film , and had immediately fled his home .
he did not elaborate on what kind of film he was watching , sat at home alone in just his underwear , and the police chose not to pursue this line of enquiry . after the intrepid cops tried and failed to track down the offending rodent , the man ignored their assurances that it was safe to return and instead trudged off through the snow to stay with nearby relatives . " he said there was nothing he was more afraid of , " the goettingen police said in a statement . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but airbus parent eads did score a lucrative contract with britain 's royal air force . eads had been in talks with bremen-based aeronautics company ohb technology 's mt aerospace unit and us private equity investor cerberus on the sale of three plants employing a total of 6,800 workers at varel and nordenham in northern germany and augsburg in the south . eads had announced in december that mt aerospace was its preferred bidder to acquire plants and as recently as last week denied reports that the negotiations had broken down . according to the airbus statement , ohb had turned out to be the wrong partner and that the parties involved in the negotiations had failed to agree on a " viable industrial and financial solution " . airbus investor search continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus ceo enders was not convinced by ohb 's approach airbus chief executive tom enders said airbus would continue to search for a strong partner prepared to share research and development costs at the plants , adding that , " we simply could not get there with ohb . " " we have always said that we will only go for economically and industrially sound solutions , " enders said in a statement .
" we want to ensure the future of our sites with strong partners who share technology , development costs and capital investments and are able to deliver large work packages at competitive costs . " airbus would search for other solutions and " in parallel , will proceed with the carve-out of the three sites , " the company statement said . breakdown blamed on strong euro bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the delayed roll-out of the a380 cost airbus dearly analysts blamed the breakdown on the declining dollar , noting that the talks had started with the euro at $ 1.35 , against almost $ 1.60 at the current rate .
an ohb statement said that the euro 's strength lowered the prospects for an adequate return on their planned investment in the plants . airbus admitted that the volatility of financial markets and the rise of the euro against the dollar had created obstacles " to an easy and smooth implementation of this process . " the site divestment strategy is part of a vast restructuring plan announced in february last year dubbed power8 , which involves 10,000 job cuts over four years and the sale of six airbus factories .
the major restructuring follows on from severe losses resulting from a two-year delay in delivering the airbus a380 superjumbo . the other sites up for sale are the filton works in britain and the french plants at meaulte and saint nazaire . " there will be no turning back " from efforts to attain the plan 's goals , enders added . eads wins british contract there was , however , some good new for eads on thursday .
the european aerospace consortium won a 13 billion pound -lrb- 16.7 billion euro ; $ 26.5 billion -rrb- deal to replace britain 's fleet of air-to-air refueling planes in what is possibly the world 's largest government outsourcing contract . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads beat out boeing for the pentagon deal in late february the 27-year-contract involves leasing 14 converted airbus passenger jets to the royal air force - marking the first time britain 's private finance initiative has been used for a top military program .

" this is the first time that we have had a proper overview of the cost situation , " a company spokesman said . he added that the company had ascertained that it was not possible to implement the project for 1.85 billion euros . the german government had agreed to bear half the cost for the train line , but up to a maximum of 925 million euros .

" this is a bad day for germany 's image as the home of high-tech industry , " beckstein said . the transrapid project would have trimmed the current 40 minute journey from munich to the airport down to 10 minutes - and had been billed by many as a coup for the prosperous southern german city . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he has linked the issue with national security , saying that protectionism would isolate the united states .
mccain expressed his enthusiasm for a huge free trading bloc .
" i am an unashamed and unabashed defender of nafta .
i am an unabashed supporter of free trade agreements .
in fact , it would be interesting to have a free trade agreement between ourselves and the european union , " mccain said in a speech to the world affairs council on wednesday , march 26 .

agriculture has been an obstacle to bilateral trade deal but both sides have preferred to deal with the tricky agricultural issues within the context of world trade talks , rather than negotiate a bilateral free trade deal to entirely phase out tariffs on each other 's farm goods .
at the same time , some members of congress have called for a services free trade agreement that would reduce or eliminate barriers to trade and investment in areas such as banking , insurance and telecommunications .
the issue of foreign trade is an emotive issue in the united states particularly in democratic heartlands , such as the rust belt of the united states where cheap imports have been blamed for the region 's economic woes and in farming communities .

clinton has also said she would introduce " time-out " from new free trade agreements if elected president .
in an allusion to his opponents ' stance , mccain drew attention to the fact that some eu environmental standards and labor standards were higher than us requirements and added that it would be interesting to see how free trade opponents would react to that .

" the near-term outlook continues to be challenging , " deutsche bank ceo josef ackerman wrote in a letter to shareholders .
" conditions remain difficult both in financial markets and the wider economy , " he said .
deutsche said ackermann earned around 14 million euros in salary and bonuses last year with the bank chalking up a record profit of 6.5 billion euros in 2007 .
the bank 's 8.4-billion-euro pre-tax earnings target excludes one-off costs and charges .
after taking hold during the second half of last year , the us mortgage market crisis " has persisted into the early months of 2008 , and continues to weigh on both financial markets and the wider global economy , " ackerman told the bank 's shareholders .

germany 's main casualty of the subprime crisis , the state-owned ikb bank , faces a possible special audit by the government to find out who is to blame for its losses amounting to millions of euros when its investments in the market for risky us mortgages soured .
ikb became the first victim of the subprime crisis last year and was bailed out twice by shareholders in rescues costing more than six billion euros .
german state-owned bank kfw , which is ikb 's biggest shareholder with a 38-percent stake , has shouldered the lion 's share of the bail-out so far . the audit , which would be conducted by an independent auditing company , will delay a vote of confidence in the bank 's boards . split government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : effects from the us subprime mortgage crisis are continuing to play out around the globe a german finance ministry spokesman told the financial times deutschland that the ministry saw the audit as a way to show that the ikb 's supervisory board had acted correctly . " responsibility lies solely with the executive board , which informed people badly , " the unnamed spokesman told the paper . according to news reports , the audit is a compromise between finance and economics ministries as they failed to agree on a common strategy .
while the finance ministry , which has a representative on ikb 's board of supervisors , wanted to exonerate the body , the economics ministry hesitated to do so . the bank has already received billions of euros in aid - much of it taxpayers ' money - to prevent it from collapsing .
some parliamentarians and economics experts have said that ikb should not be given any additional financial help from the state . " we can not make life easier for those who have made mistakes .
they have to pay for their mistakes , " european central bank head jean-claude trichet told german public broadcaster ard on wednesday .

but airbus parent eads did score a lucrative contract with britain 's royal air force . eads had been in talks with bremen-based aeronautics company ohb technology 's mt aerospace unit and us private equity investor cerberus on the sale of three plants employing a total of 6,800 workers at varel and nordenham in northern germany and augsburg in the south . eads had announced in december that mt aerospace was its preferred bidder to acquire plants and as recently as last week denied reports that the negotiations had broken down . according to the airbus statement , ohb had turned out to be the wrong partner and that the parties involved in the negotiations had failed to agree on a " viable industrial and financial solution " . airbus investor search continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus ceo enders was not convinced by ohb 's approach airbus chief executive tom enders said airbus would continue to search for a strong partner prepared to share research and development costs at the plants , adding that , " we simply could not get there with ohb . " " we have always said that we will only go for economically and industrially sound solutions , " enders said in a statement .
" we want to ensure the future of our sites with strong partners who share technology , development costs and capital investments and are able to deliver large work packages at competitive costs . " airbus would search for other solutions and " in parallel , will proceed with the carve-out of the three sites , " the company statement said . breakdown blamed on strong euro bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the delayed roll-out of the a380 cost airbus dearly analysts blamed the breakdown on the declining dollar , noting that the talks had started with the euro at $ 1.35 , against almost $ 1.60 at the current rate .
an ohb statement said that the euro 's strength lowered the prospects for an adequate return on their planned investment in the plants . airbus admitted that the volatility of financial markets and the rise of the euro against the dollar had created obstacles " to an easy and smooth implementation of this process . " the site divestment strategy is part of a vast restructuring plan announced in february last year dubbed power8 , which involves 10,000 job cuts over four years and the sale of six airbus factories .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de banking -pipe- 27.03.2008 state intervention remains last resort , economist says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the state should throw a lifeline when every other option has been tried , said walter when all other avenues have been exhausted , the state should bail out a flailing bank , said deutsche bank 's head economist norbert walter .
germany is proud that half of its banking sector is state-run , he added . dw-radio : when and where does state intervention make sense ? norbert walter : state intervention only makes sense when all other private economic means have already been implemented - not just theoretically , but also practically .
that means , when a bank incurs speculation losses , changes its management , has used all of its available capital and made an effort to obtain new capital and / or a foreign or domestic strategic investor .
only after these efforts have failed is it appropriate for the state to ask whether it 's important to the financial system in the affected country to rescue the institution that 's in danger of collapsing or not . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norbert walter sometimes it 's wise to rescue an important institution that plays an important role in the economy when there is no private solution .
but this process should be carefully considered and it 's clear that , if this step is taken , it can not be carried out by a central bank .
rather , it 's the job of the government and of those who decide how tax money is spent - namely , the parliament . but there already seems to be an imbalance .
generally speaking , companies pay for their own mistakes , but this does n't seem to be the case in the banking sector .
banks pocket the profits , but expect society to pick up the losses .
is this acceptable ? this is not at all acceptable .
it also is n't a very good arrangement for the future , since it encourages making contracts that burden a third party . and these contracts are responsible for difficulties we 've seen at the westlb and ikb banks ? i did n't say that , you did .
we should keep in mind that in germany - with transparency and with the agreement of the people and nearly all of the political parties - half of the banking sector has been state-run from the very beginning .
we 're very proud of this in germany .
and the politicians are convinced that this is the right way to organize our monetary system .
when institutions that are either owned or overseen by the state experience a crisis , as was the case in dresden -lsb- the former headquarters of sachsenlb , which was bought out by another regional bank - eds . -rsb- and dusseldorf -lsb- headquarters for westlb -rsb- and at ikb , it 's only obvious that the owners have to step in - which in this case is the state . it was the highly paid bank personnel who utterly failed and demonstrated extreme naivete .
what personnel decisions can banks make to avoid a repeat of the situation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank announced it would n't meet its profit target for 2008 the management team was fired and replaced with new managers .
it 's appropriate that those who squander their own money are no longer suited to run a bank .
it 's also appropriate that the state and other institutions like supervisory bodies help find new owners .
we 'd have reason to worry if this process were to be lost .
it 's been successful in a series of cases where domestic capital and management were available .
for example , with bear stones and jp morgan .
in other cases , where owners ' equity was lost , international investors were ready , like in the case of ubs in switzerland , where singapore was ready to subsidize a bank that had lost a gamble but is a very attractive bank in other important areas . the bank crisis started in the us .
but how are things looking here in germany ?
is the situation more stable ? unlike in the us , or england or spain or australia , our real estate prices have n't been exaggerated over the past 10 years .
there the prices have more than doubled - or tripled , as is the case in spain .
in germany , the prices have remained stable or even sunk in some cases .
as far as the real estate market itself goes , we 're atypical .
we are n't expecting the problems that england , spain , australia and the us are currently facing . interview : wolfgang dick -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

when faced with the subject of their own phobias , people tend to exhibit a number of erratic responses . for example , acrophobics - those who are afraid of heights - may drop to the floor of a tall structure or hug a part of the building which they are convinced is immovable . the stereotypical response for muriphobics - people who are scared of mice - is to stand on a chair , pull their skirt tight around their knees and scream like a banshee ; that is if the muriphobic is a woman or a character from a tom & jerry cartoon . but even those who study phobias can not say for sure how a person will react to being faced with their nemesis .
there is no standard response apart from total and irrational fear . so who to say that the german muriphobic who ran out into the street in sub-zero temperatures wearing just his boxer shorts and a pair of fluffy slippers is any crazier than the next person battling a fear of mice ? the local police who then led a search of the petrified man 's house , that 's who . no time to dress as fear strikes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " a mouse ... a mouse !

after being seen cowering semi-naked in a phone booth in the town of goettingen , the man was approached by the officers hoping for something a little racier than just some sleepwalker or an extreme jogger who had forgotten his keys . but instead of accosting a pervert lurking for prey , the local cops found the quivering 23-year-old to be the victim - of mouse-stalking . the man told police he had seen the mouse scurry across the floor while he was watching a film , and had immediately fled his home .
he did not elaborate on what kind of film he was watching , sat at home alone in just his underwear , and the police chose not to pursue this line of enquiry . after the intrepid cops tried and failed to track down the offending rodent , the man ignored their assurances that it was safe to return and instead trudged off through the snow to stay with nearby relatives .

" a mine , which was planted by taliban militants in qasab area of the district , hit a nato forces ' tank , " omar said .
" the tank was damaged and three german soldiers were seriously wounded . "
he blamed taliban militants , whose government was toppled in a us- led military invasion in late 2001 , for the attack .
" during the taliban time , they were very active in this area , and now they still have their loyalists , whom they can use for this kind of attacks , " the governor said .
taliban claim responsibility as part of new offensive the taliban took responsibility for the attack in kunduz .
" in qasab village of chardara , a nato tank was blown up by a mine , planted on the road by our mujahideen , " the group said in a statement posted on a rebel website .
it claimed that the tank was " completely destroyed and 13 soldiers inside the vehicle were killed or wounded . "
the statement said that the attack was part of a " spring offensive , " announced by the militants on wednesday .
taliban militants are not very active in the northern provinces of afghanistan , compared to southern and eastern regions , where the rebels are the most entrenched .
afghan defence minister abdul rahim wardak said on thursday in a video conference from nato headquarters in kabul that the militants intended to expand their insurgency to the peaceful northern and western provinces of the country this year .
" we are expecting the taliban to rely very heavily on ied roadside bombs and suicide attacks , " wardak said .
pressure has been growing on germany to deploy some of its forces to help combat the taliban insurgency in the more volatile south of the country .
the attack on the troops near kunduz comes just a day after canadian defense minister peter mackay became the latest to call for a german combat deployment in an interview with der spiegel magazine .
canadian defense minister questions germany 's commitment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many leaders want german troops deployed in the south mackay said nato allies were not sharing the burden evenly between them and that germany should send its troops to help with combat operations in southern afghanistan instead of confining them to the relatively peaceful north , hinting that he thought germany was not fulfilling its international obligations .
" i understand that troop deployments are very difficult to push through in germany for domestic political reasons , but there are also international commitments that we all have to meet , " mackay said .
canada had lost more than 80 soldiers in operations , mainly in combat operations in kandahar province , he noted .
german losses in afghanistan total 26 troops and three police officers since forces were first sent there more than five years ago .
mackay warned of the dangers of a " two-class " nato and said all member states had to carry their share of the burdens .
germany would profit from a stable afghanistan unable to export terrorism , he said .
" the future of afghanistan lies in nato 's hands .
the taliban and terrorist organizations are like a cancer .
they proliferate and threaten human lives over the whole world , " he said .
mackay expressed admiration for germany and said german troops wanted to do more in afghanistan .

germany is proud that half of its banking sector is state-run , he added . dw-radio : when and where does state intervention make sense ? norbert walter : state intervention only makes sense when all other private economic means have already been implemented - not just theoretically , but also practically .
that means , when a bank incurs speculation losses , changes its management , has used all of its available capital and made an effort to obtain new capital and / or a foreign or domestic strategic investor .
only after these efforts have failed is it appropriate for the state to ask whether it 's important to the financial system in the affected country to rescue the institution that 's in danger of collapsing or not . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norbert walter sometimes it 's wise to rescue an important institution that plays an important role in the economy when there is no private solution .
but this process should be carefully considered and it 's clear that , if this step is taken , it can not be carried out by a central bank .
rather , it 's the job of the government and of those who decide how tax money is spent - namely , the parliament . but there already seems to be an imbalance .
generally speaking , companies pay for their own mistakes , but this does n't seem to be the case in the banking sector .
banks pocket the profits , but expect society to pick up the losses .
is this acceptable ? this is not at all acceptable .
it also is n't a very good arrangement for the future , since it encourages making contracts that burden a third party . and these contracts are responsible for difficulties we 've seen at the westlb and ikb banks ? i did n't say that , you did .
we should keep in mind that in germany - with transparency and with the agreement of the people and nearly all of the political parties - half of the banking sector has been state-run from the very beginning .
we 're very proud of this in germany .
and the politicians are convinced that this is the right way to organize our monetary system .
when institutions that are either owned or overseen by the state experience a crisis , as was the case in dresden -lsb- the former headquarters of sachsenlb , which was bought out by another regional bank - eds . -rsb- and dusseldorf -lsb- headquarters for westlb -rsb- and at ikb , it 's only obvious that the owners have to step in - which in this case is the state . it was the highly paid bank personnel who utterly failed and demonstrated extreme naivete .
what personnel decisions can banks make to avoid a repeat of the situation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank announced it would n't meet its profit target for 2008 the management team was fired and replaced with new managers .
it 's appropriate that those who squander their own money are no longer suited to run a bank .
it 's also appropriate that the state and other institutions like supervisory bodies help find new owners .
we 'd have reason to worry if this process were to be lost .
it 's been successful in a series of cases where domestic capital and management were available .
for example , with bear stones and jp morgan .
in other cases , where owners ' equity was lost , international investors were ready , like in the case of ubs in switzerland , where singapore was ready to subsidize a bank that had lost a gamble but is a very attractive bank in other important areas . the bank crisis started in the us .

germany is proud that half of its banking sector is state-run , he added . dw-radio : when and where does state intervention make sense ? norbert walter : state intervention only makes sense when all other private economic means have already been implemented - not just theoretically , but also practically .
that means , when a bank incurs speculation losses , changes its management , has used all of its available capital and made an effort to obtain new capital and / or a foreign or domestic strategic investor .
only after these efforts have failed is it appropriate for the state to ask whether it 's important to the financial system in the affected country to rescue the institution that 's in danger of collapsing or not . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norbert walter sometimes it 's wise to rescue an important institution that plays an important role in the economy when there is no private solution .
but this process should be carefully considered and it 's clear that , if this step is taken , it can not be carried out by a central bank .
rather , it 's the job of the government and of those who decide how tax money is spent - namely , the parliament . but there already seems to be an imbalance .
generally speaking , companies pay for their own mistakes , but this does n't seem to be the case in the banking sector .
banks pocket the profits , but expect society to pick up the losses .

but airbus parent eads did score a lucrative contract with britain 's royal air force . eads had been in talks with bremen-based aeronautics company ohb technology 's mt aerospace unit and us private equity investor cerberus on the sale of three plants employing a total of 6,800 workers at varel and nordenham in northern germany and augsburg in the south . eads had announced in december that mt aerospace was its preferred bidder to acquire plants and as recently as last week denied reports that the negotiations had broken down . according to the airbus statement , ohb had turned out to be the wrong partner and that the parties involved in the negotiations had failed to agree on a " viable industrial and financial solution " . airbus investor search continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus ceo enders was not convinced by ohb 's approach airbus chief executive tom enders said airbus would continue to search for a strong partner prepared to share research and development costs at the plants , adding that , " we simply could not get there with ohb . " " we have always said that we will only go for economically and industrially sound solutions , " enders said in a statement .
" we want to ensure the future of our sites with strong partners who share technology , development costs and capital investments and are able to deliver large work packages at competitive costs . " airbus would search for other solutions and " in parallel , will proceed with the carve-out of the three sites , " the company statement said . breakdown blamed on strong euro bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the delayed roll-out of the a380 cost airbus dearly analysts blamed the breakdown on the declining dollar , noting that the talks had started with the euro at $ 1.35 , against almost $ 1.60 at the current rate .
an ohb statement said that the euro 's strength lowered the prospects for an adequate return on their planned investment in the plants . airbus admitted that the volatility of financial markets and the rise of the euro against the dollar had created obstacles " to an easy and smooth implementation of this process . " the site divestment strategy is part of a vast restructuring plan announced in february last year dubbed power8 , which involves 10,000 job cuts over four years and the sale of six airbus factories .
the major restructuring follows on from severe losses resulting from a two-year delay in delivering the airbus a380 superjumbo . the other sites up for sale are the filton works in britain and the french plants at meaulte and saint nazaire . " there will be no turning back " from efforts to attain the plan 's goals , enders added . eads wins british contract there was , however , some good new for eads on thursday .
the european aerospace consortium won a 13 billion pound -lrb- 16.7 billion euro ; $ 26.5 billion -rrb- deal to replace britain 's fleet of air-to-air refueling planes in what is possibly the world 's largest government outsourcing contract . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads beat out boeing for the pentagon deal in late february the 27-year-contract involves leasing 14 converted airbus passenger jets to the royal air force - marking the first time britain 's private finance initiative has been used for a top military program .

when faced with the subject of their own phobias , people tend to exhibit a number of erratic responses . for example , acrophobics - those who are afraid of heights - may drop to the floor of a tall structure or hug a part of the building which they are convinced is immovable . the stereotypical response for muriphobics - people who are scared of mice - is to stand on a chair , pull their skirt tight around their knees and scream like a banshee ; that is if the muriphobic is a woman or a character from a tom & jerry cartoon . but even those who study phobias can not say for sure how a person will react to being faced with their nemesis .
there is no standard response apart from total and irrational fear . so who to say that the german muriphobic who ran out into the street in sub-zero temperatures wearing just his boxer shorts and a pair of fluffy slippers is any crazier than the next person battling a fear of mice ? the local police who then led a search of the petrified man 's house , that 's who . no time to dress as fear strikes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " a mouse ... a mouse !

he did not elaborate on what kind of film he was watching , sat at home alone in just his underwear , and the police chose not to pursue this line of enquiry . after the intrepid cops tried and failed to track down the offending rodent , the man ignored their assurances that it was safe to return and instead trudged off through the snow to stay with nearby relatives .

when faced with the subject of their own phobias , people tend to exhibit a number of erratic responses . for example , acrophobics - those who are afraid of heights - may drop to the floor of a tall structure or hug a part of the building which they are convinced is immovable . the stereotypical response for muriphobics - people who are scared of mice - is to stand on a chair , pull their skirt tight around their knees and scream like a banshee ; that is if the muriphobic is a woman or a character from a tom & jerry cartoon . but even those who study phobias can not say for sure how a person will react to being faced with their nemesis .
there is no standard response apart from total and irrational fear . so who to say that the german muriphobic who ran out into the street in sub-zero temperatures wearing just his boxer shorts and a pair of fluffy slippers is any crazier than the next person battling a fear of mice ? the local police who then led a search of the petrified man 's house , that 's who . no time to dress as fear strikes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " a mouse ... a mouse ! "
after being seen cowering semi-naked in a phone booth in the town of goettingen , the man was approached by the officers hoping for something a little racier than just some sleepwalker or an extreme jogger who had forgotten his keys . but instead of accosting a pervert lurking for prey , the local cops found the quivering 23-year-old to be the victim - of mouse-stalking . the man told police he had seen the mouse scurry across the floor while he was watching a film , and had immediately fled his home .
he did not elaborate on what kind of film he was watching , sat at home alone in just his underwear , and the police chose not to pursue this line of enquiry . after the intrepid cops tried and failed to track down the offending rodent , the man ignored their assurances that it was safe to return and instead trudged off through the snow to stay with nearby relatives .

he has linked the issue with national security , saying that protectionism would isolate the united states .
mccain expressed his enthusiasm for a huge free trading bloc .
" i am an unashamed and unabashed defender of nafta .
i am an unabashed supporter of free trade agreements .
in fact , it would be interesting to have a free trade agreement between ourselves and the european union , " mccain said in a speech to the world affairs council on wednesday , march 26 .
" they are one of the largest economic blocs in the world , if not the largest .
i think to head a free trade agreement with the european union would be a great thing to happen , " mccain told reporters as he headed for his next campaign event in monterey , california .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nafta free trade deal between canada , us and mexico is a us electoral issue the unites states and the eu already have low tariffs on most of the manufactured goods that cross the atlantic .
recently , they have also begun an initiative aimed at eliminating regulatory barriers that hamper commerce .
agriculture has been an obstacle to bilateral trade deal but both sides have preferred to deal with the tricky agricultural issues within the context of world trade talks , rather than negotiate a bilateral free trade deal to entirely phase out tariffs on each other 's farm goods .
at the same time , some members of congress have called for a services free trade agreement that would reduce or eliminate barriers to trade and investment in areas such as banking , insurance and telecommunications .
the issue of foreign trade is an emotive issue in the united states particularly in democratic heartlands , such as the rust belt of the united states where cheap imports have been blamed for the region 's economic woes and in farming communities .
all just electoral maneuvering ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both clinton and obama have taken a more cautious tack on free trade democratic presidential candidates barack obama and hillary clinton have threatened to withdraw from nafta if mexico and canada do not agree to renegotiate the pact and include stronger labor and environmental provisions .
clinton has also said she would introduce " time-out " from new free trade agreements if elected president .
in an allusion to his opponents ' stance , mccain drew attention to the fact that some eu environmental standards and labor standards were higher than us requirements and added that it would be interesting to see how free trade opponents would react to that .
the republican candidate has shown himself eager to play up his pro-european credentials with a transatlantic trip to paris and london earlier this month .
some observers have , however , have raised doubts about his intentions , with some suggesting mccain 's european drive is designed to serve a domestic purpose . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but airbus parent eads did score a lucrative contract with britain 's royal air force . eads had been in talks with bremen-based aeronautics company ohb technology 's mt aerospace unit and us private equity investor cerberus on the sale of three plants employing a total of 6,800 workers at varel and nordenham in northern germany and augsburg in the south . eads had announced in december that mt aerospace was its preferred bidder to acquire plants and as recently as last week denied reports that the negotiations had broken down . according to the airbus statement , ohb had turned out to be the wrong partner and that the parties involved in the negotiations had failed to agree on a " viable industrial and financial solution " . airbus investor search continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus ceo enders was not convinced by ohb 's approach airbus chief executive tom enders said airbus would continue to search for a strong partner prepared to share research and development costs at the plants , adding that , " we simply could not get there with ohb . " " we have always said that we will only go for economically and industrially sound solutions , " enders said in a statement .
" we want to ensure the future of our sites with strong partners who share technology , development costs and capital investments and are able to deliver large work packages at competitive costs .

an ohb statement said that the euro 's strength lowered the prospects for an adequate return on their planned investment in the plants . airbus admitted that the volatility of financial markets and the rise of the euro against the dollar had created obstacles " to an easy and smooth implementation of this process . " the site divestment strategy is part of a vast restructuring plan announced in february last year dubbed power8 , which involves 10,000 job cuts over four years and the sale of six airbus factories .
the major restructuring follows on from severe losses resulting from a two-year delay in delivering the airbus a380 superjumbo . the other sites up for sale are the filton works in britain and the french plants at meaulte and saint nazaire . " there will be no turning back " from efforts to attain the plan 's goals , enders added . eads wins british contract there was , however , some good new for eads on thursday .
the european aerospace consortium won a 13 billion pound -lrb- 16.7 billion euro ; $ 26.5 billion -rrb- deal to replace britain 's fleet of air-to-air refueling planes in what is possibly the world 's largest government outsourcing contract . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads beat out boeing for the pentagon deal in late february the 27-year-contract involves leasing 14 converted airbus passenger jets to the royal air force - marking the first time britain 's private finance initiative has been used for a top military program .

he has linked the issue with national security , saying that protectionism would isolate the united states .
mccain expressed his enthusiasm for a huge free trading bloc .
" i am an unashamed and unabashed defender of nafta .
i am an unabashed supporter of free trade agreements .
in fact , it would be interesting to have a free trade agreement between ourselves and the european union , " mccain said in a speech to the world affairs council on wednesday , march 26 .
" they are one of the largest economic blocs in the world , if not the largest .
i think to head a free trade agreement with the european union would be a great thing to happen , " mccain told reporters as he headed for his next campaign event in monterey , california .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nafta free trade deal between canada , us and mexico is a us electoral issue the unites states and the eu already have low tariffs on most of the manufactured goods that cross the atlantic .
recently , they have also begun an initiative aimed at eliminating regulatory barriers that hamper commerce .
agriculture has been an obstacle to bilateral trade deal but both sides have preferred to deal with the tricky agricultural issues within the context of world trade talks , rather than negotiate a bilateral free trade deal to entirely phase out tariffs on each other 's farm goods .
at the same time , some members of congress have called for a services free trade agreement that would reduce or eliminate barriers to trade and investment in areas such as banking , insurance and telecommunications .
the issue of foreign trade is an emotive issue in the united states particularly in democratic heartlands , such as the rust belt of the united states where cheap imports have been blamed for the region 's economic woes and in farming communities .
all just electoral maneuvering ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both clinton and obama have taken a more cautious tack on free trade democratic presidential candidates barack obama and hillary clinton have threatened to withdraw from nafta if mexico and canada do not agree to renegotiate the pact and include stronger labor and environmental provisions .
clinton has also said she would introduce " time-out " from new free trade agreements if elected president .
in an allusion to his opponents ' stance , mccain drew attention to the fact that some eu environmental standards and labor standards were higher than us requirements and added that it would be interesting to see how free trade opponents would react to that .

" " we have just received the comments , and we want to take them serious , " said friso roscam abbing , frattini 's spokesman .
" creating big databases poses data-protection challenges , nobody will deny it .
however , precisely because we are aware of those challenges we will do everything that is needed to address them ... and ensure that we are taking duly into consideration all legitimate data protection concerns . " brussels claims citizens no longer hold concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu says there is less of a stigma attached to providing biometric data officials in brussels also argued that a growing number of eu citizens no longer fear being likened to potential suspects simply because their fingerprints are taken , noting that biometric data of this kind has become increasingly common , for instance as an added security measure in laptops . slovenian interior minister dragutin mate , whose country holds the rotating presidency of the eu , acknowledged to reporters that the proposal will likely encounter difficulties when it is due to be discussed by the european parliament and by member states . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

18 by eu justice , freedom and security commissioner franco frattini , the just as european leaders gathered for an important summit in lisbon , the dpa news agency reported . but after peter hustinx , the head of the european data protection watchdog -lsb- edps -rsb- , announced the watchdog agency 's concerns on thursday , march 27 , eu officials worked to calm fears over the potential for privacy infringements . hustinx 's main concerns focus on controversial plans to fingerprint children as young as 6 years old and elderly people who would be physically unable to provide theirs , as well as the creation of a centralized database , which would hold a copy of fingerprints belonging to all eu citizens . civil liberties advocates fear that such a database could be violated and used for criminal purposes . eu defends plan to fingerprint children bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini assures eu citizens everything will be above board frattini 's office on thursday rejected calls for the 6-year-old exemption limit to be raised to include children under the age of 14 so that it may be brought " in line with international practice , " arguing that the measure was needed to prevent child-trafficking . officials also said they were willing to address hustinx 's concerns about the centralized database and respond within " a matter of weeks . " " we have just received the comments , and we want to take them serious , " said friso roscam abbing , frattini 's spokesman .
" creating big databases poses data-protection challenges , nobody will deny it .
however , precisely because we are aware of those challenges we will do everything that is needed to address them ... and ensure that we are taking duly into consideration all legitimate data protection concerns .

when faced with the subject of their own phobias , people tend to exhibit a number of erratic responses . for example , acrophobics - those who are afraid of heights - may drop to the floor of a tall structure or hug a part of the building which they are convinced is immovable . the stereotypical response for muriphobics - people who are scared of mice - is to stand on a chair , pull their skirt tight around their knees and scream like a banshee ; that is if the muriphobic is a woman or a character from a tom & jerry cartoon . but even those who study phobias can not say for sure how a person will react to being faced with their nemesis .
there is no standard response apart from total and irrational fear . so who to say that the german muriphobic who ran out into the street in sub-zero temperatures wearing just his boxer shorts and a pair of fluffy slippers is any crazier than the next person battling a fear of mice ? the local police who then led a search of the petrified man 's house , that 's who . no time to dress as fear strikes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " a mouse ... a mouse !

after being seen cowering semi-naked in a phone booth in the town of goettingen , the man was approached by the officers hoping for something a little racier than just some sleepwalker or an extreme jogger who had forgotten his keys . but instead of accosting a pervert lurking for prey , the local cops found the quivering 23-year-old to be the victim - of mouse-stalking . the man told police he had seen the mouse scurry across the floor while he was watching a film , and had immediately fled his home .
he did not elaborate on what kind of film he was watching , sat at home alone in just his underwear , and the police chose not to pursue this line of enquiry . after the intrepid cops tried and failed to track down the offending rodent , the man ignored their assurances that it was safe to return and instead trudged off through the snow to stay with nearby relatives .

that means , when a bank incurs speculation losses , changes its management , has used all of its available capital and made an effort to obtain new capital and / or a foreign or domestic strategic investor .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 27.03.2008 three german soldiers injured in ambush in afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german army patrols in the north of afghanistan are increasingly at risk of attack three german soldiers were injured , two of them seriously , in an attack on their convoy in northern afghanistan on thursday , march 27 , according to a statement from the german army . the soldiers were patrolling in the chardara district in the northern province kunduz , a relatively peaceful area , when the blast occurred , provincial governor mohammad omar later told reporters .
" a mine , which was planted by taliban militants in qasab area of the district , hit a nato forces ' tank , " omar said .
" the tank was damaged and three german soldiers were seriously wounded . "
he blamed taliban militants , whose government was toppled in a us- led military invasion in late 2001 , for the attack .
" during the taliban time , they were very active in this area , and now they still have their loyalists , whom they can use for this kind of attacks , " the governor said .
taliban claim responsibility as part of new offensive the taliban took responsibility for the attack in kunduz .
" in qasab village of chardara , a nato tank was blown up by a mine , planted on the road by our mujahideen , " the group said in a statement posted on a rebel website .
it claimed that the tank was " completely destroyed and 13 soldiers inside the vehicle were killed or wounded . "
the statement said that the attack was part of a " spring offensive , " announced by the militants on wednesday .
taliban militants are not very active in the northern provinces of afghanistan , compared to southern and eastern regions , where the rebels are the most entrenched .
afghan defence minister abdul rahim wardak said on thursday in a video conference from nato headquarters in kabul that the militants intended to expand their insurgency to the peaceful northern and western provinces of the country this year .
" we are expecting the taliban to rely very heavily on ied roadside bombs and suicide attacks , " wardak said .

" in qasab village of chardara , a nato tank was blown up by a mine , planted on the road by our mujahideen , " the group said in a statement posted on a rebel website .

" i understand that troop deployments are very difficult to push through in germany for domestic political reasons , but there are also international commitments that we all have to meet , " mackay said .
canada had lost more than 80 soldiers in operations , mainly in combat operations in kandahar province , he noted .
german losses in afghanistan total 26 troops and three police officers since forces were first sent there more than five years ago .

when faced with the subject of their own phobias , people tend to exhibit a number of erratic responses . for example , acrophobics - those who are afraid of heights - may drop to the floor of a tall structure or hug a part of the building which they are convinced is immovable . the stereotypical response for muriphobics - people who are scared of mice - is to stand on a chair , pull their skirt tight around their knees and scream like a banshee ; that is if the muriphobic is a woman or a character from a tom & jerry cartoon . but even those who study phobias can not say for sure how a person will react to being faced with their nemesis .
there is no standard response apart from total and irrational fear . so who to say that the german muriphobic who ran out into the street in sub-zero temperatures wearing just his boxer shorts and a pair of fluffy slippers is any crazier than the next person battling a fear of mice ? the local police who then led a search of the petrified man 's house , that 's who . no time to dress as fear strikes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " a mouse ... a mouse ! "
after being seen cowering semi-naked in a phone booth in the town of goettingen , the man was approached by the officers hoping for something a little racier than just some sleepwalker or an extreme jogger who had forgotten his keys . but instead of accosting a pervert lurking for prey , the local cops found the quivering 23-year-old to be the victim - of mouse-stalking . the man told police he had seen the mouse scurry across the floor while he was watching a film , and had immediately fled his home .
he did not elaborate on what kind of film he was watching , sat at home alone in just his underwear , and the police chose not to pursue this line of enquiry . after the intrepid cops tried and failed to track down the offending rodent , the man ignored their assurances that it was safe to return and instead trudged off through the snow to stay with nearby relatives . " he said there was nothing he was more afraid of , " the goettingen police said in a statement . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" a mine , which was planted by taliban militants in qasab area of the district , hit a nato forces ' tank , " omar said .
" the tank was damaged and three german soldiers were seriously wounded . "
he blamed taliban militants , whose government was toppled in a us- led military invasion in late 2001 , for the attack .
" during the taliban time , they were very active in this area , and now they still have their loyalists , whom they can use for this kind of attacks , " the governor said .
taliban claim responsibility as part of new offensive the taliban took responsibility for the attack in kunduz .
" in qasab village of chardara , a nato tank was blown up by a mine , planted on the road by our mujahideen , " the group said in a statement posted on a rebel website .
it claimed that the tank was " completely destroyed and 13 soldiers inside the vehicle were killed or wounded . "
the statement said that the attack was part of a " spring offensive , " announced by the militants on wednesday .
taliban militants are not very active in the northern provinces of afghanistan , compared to southern and eastern regions , where the rebels are the most entrenched .
afghan defence minister abdul rahim wardak said on thursday in a video conference from nato headquarters in kabul that the militants intended to expand their insurgency to the peaceful northern and western provinces of the country this year .
" we are expecting the taliban to rely very heavily on ied roadside bombs and suicide attacks , " wardak said .
pressure has been growing on germany to deploy some of its forces to help combat the taliban insurgency in the more volatile south of the country .
the attack on the troops near kunduz comes just a day after canadian defense minister peter mackay became the latest to call for a german combat deployment in an interview with der spiegel magazine .
canadian defense minister questions germany 's commitment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many leaders want german troops deployed in the south mackay said nato allies were not sharing the burden evenly between them and that germany should send its troops to help with combat operations in southern afghanistan instead of confining them to the relatively peaceful north , hinting that he thought germany was not fulfilling its international obligations .
" i understand that troop deployments are very difficult to push through in germany for domestic political reasons , but there are also international commitments that we all have to meet , " mackay said .
canada had lost more than 80 soldiers in operations , mainly in combat operations in kandahar province , he noted .
german losses in afghanistan total 26 troops and three police officers since forces were first sent there more than five years ago .
mackay warned of the dangers of a " two-class " nato and said all member states had to carry their share of the burdens .
germany would profit from a stable afghanistan unable to export terrorism , he said .
" the future of afghanistan lies in nato 's hands .
the taliban and terrorist organizations are like a cancer .
they proliferate and threaten human lives over the whole world , " he said .
mackay expressed admiration for germany and said german troops wanted to do more in afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has six tornado jets stationed in afghanistan germany has up to 3,500 troops stationed in the country , mainly deployed on reconstruction and training missions from their base at mazar-e-sharif in balkh province .
it also maintains a flight of six reconnaissance tornado jets .
the afghan mission , the annual mandate for which comes up for parliamentary renewal in october , enjoys broad backing in the bundestag but is consistently opposed by a majority of the population .
danish soldier killed in firefight with taliban in an earlier attack in southern afghanistan , a danish soldier was killed and another wounded in a firefight with taliban insurgents , according to a statement from isaf .
the danes were on patrol wednesday in helmand province , a hotbed of taliban activity , when they came under fire in the gereshk area , the isaf spokesman in the province , british lieutenant colonel simon miller , told reporters .
" regrettably as a result of the firefight one danish soldier was killed and another was wounded , " miller said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has lost 26 troops and three police officers including the latest death , denmark has lost 13 soldiers in afghanistan .
two other danes were killed march 17 in an attack on an isaf convoy .
denmark has about 550 troops in helmand , where most international soldiers with isaf are british .
more than 30 international soldiers have been killed this year , most of them in hostile action .
a total of 787 coalition soldiers have lost their lives since the us-led invasion of afghanistan was launched in 2001 .
isaf draws its 47,000 troops from 39 countries .
it is helping the afghan government restore security in the face of an insurgency by the taliban , who were in government between 1996 and 2001 , and promote development . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany is proud that half of its banking sector is state-run , he added . dw-radio : when and where does state intervention make sense ? norbert walter : state intervention only makes sense when all other private economic means have already been implemented - not just theoretically , but also practically .
that means , when a bank incurs speculation losses , changes its management , has used all of its available capital and made an effort to obtain new capital and / or a foreign or domestic strategic investor .
only after these efforts have failed is it appropriate for the state to ask whether it 's important to the financial system in the affected country to rescue the institution that 's in danger of collapsing or not . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norbert walter sometimes it 's wise to rescue an important institution that plays an important role in the economy when there is no private solution .
but this process should be carefully considered and it 's clear that , if this step is taken , it can not be carried out by a central bank .
rather , it 's the job of the government and of those who decide how tax money is spent - namely , the parliament . but there already seems to be an imbalance .
generally speaking , companies pay for their own mistakes , but this does n't seem to be the case in the banking sector .
banks pocket the profits , but expect society to pick up the losses .
is this acceptable ? this is not at all acceptable .
it also is n't a very good arrangement for the future , since it encourages making contracts that burden a third party . and these contracts are responsible for difficulties we 've seen at the westlb and ikb banks ? i did n't say that , you did .
we should keep in mind that in germany - with transparency and with the agreement of the people and nearly all of the political parties - half of the banking sector has been state-run from the very beginning .
we 're very proud of this in germany .
and the politicians are convinced that this is the right way to organize our monetary system .
when institutions that are either owned or overseen by the state experience a crisis , as was the case in dresden -lsb- the former headquarters of sachsenlb , which was bought out by another regional bank - eds . -rsb- and dusseldorf -lsb- headquarters for westlb -rsb- and at ikb , it 's only obvious that the owners have to step in - which in this case is the state . it was the highly paid bank personnel who utterly failed and demonstrated extreme naivete .
what personnel decisions can banks make to avoid a repeat of the situation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank announced it would n't meet its profit target for 2008 the management team was fired and replaced with new managers .
it 's appropriate that those who squander their own money are no longer suited to run a bank .
it 's also appropriate that the state and other institutions like supervisory bodies help find new owners .
we 'd have reason to worry if this process were to be lost .
it 's been successful in a series of cases where domestic capital and management were available .
for example , with bear stones and jp morgan .
in other cases , where owners ' equity was lost , international investors were ready , like in the case of ubs in switzerland , where singapore was ready to subsidize a bank that had lost a gamble but is a very attractive bank in other important areas . the bank crisis started in the us .
but how are things looking here in germany ?
is the situation more stable ? unlike in the us , or england or spain or australia , our real estate prices have n't been exaggerated over the past 10 years .
there the prices have more than doubled - or tripled , as is the case in spain .
in germany , the prices have remained stable or even sunk in some cases .
as far as the real estate market itself goes , we 're atypical .
we are n't expecting the problems that england , spain , australia and the us are currently facing . interview : wolfgang dick -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" a mine , which was planted by taliban militants in qasab area of the district , hit a nato forces ' tank , " omar said .
" the tank was damaged and three german soldiers were seriously wounded . "
he blamed taliban militants , whose government was toppled in a us- led military invasion in late 2001 , for the attack .
" during the taliban time , they were very active in this area , and now they still have their loyalists , whom they can use for this kind of attacks , " the governor said .
taliban claim responsibility as part of new offensive the taliban took responsibility for the attack in kunduz .
" in qasab village of chardara , a nato tank was blown up by a mine , planted on the road by our mujahideen , " the group said in a statement posted on a rebel website .
it claimed that the tank was " completely destroyed and 13 soldiers inside the vehicle were killed or wounded . "
the statement said that the attack was part of a " spring offensive , " announced by the militants on wednesday .
taliban militants are not very active in the northern provinces of afghanistan , compared to southern and eastern regions , where the rebels are the most entrenched .
afghan defence minister abdul rahim wardak said on thursday in a video conference from nato headquarters in kabul that the militants intended to expand their insurgency to the peaceful northern and western provinces of the country this year .
" we are expecting the taliban to rely very heavily on ied roadside bombs and suicide attacks , " wardak said .
pressure has been growing on germany to deploy some of its forces to help combat the taliban insurgency in the more volatile south of the country .
the attack on the troops near kunduz comes just a day after canadian defense minister peter mackay became the latest to call for a german combat deployment in an interview with der spiegel magazine .
canadian defense minister questions germany 's commitment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many leaders want german troops deployed in the south mackay said nato allies were not sharing the burden evenly between them and that germany should send its troops to help with combat operations in southern afghanistan instead of confining them to the relatively peaceful north , hinting that he thought germany was not fulfilling its international obligations .
" i understand that troop deployments are very difficult to push through in germany for domestic political reasons , but there are also international commitments that we all have to meet , " mackay said .
canada had lost more than 80 soldiers in operations , mainly in combat operations in kandahar province , he noted .
german losses in afghanistan total 26 troops and three police officers since forces were first sent there more than five years ago .
mackay warned of the dangers of a " two-class " nato and said all member states had to carry their share of the burdens .
germany would profit from a stable afghanistan unable to export terrorism , he said .
" the future of afghanistan lies in nato 's hands .
the taliban and terrorist organizations are like a cancer .
they proliferate and threaten human lives over the whole world , " he said .
mackay expressed admiration for germany and said german troops wanted to do more in afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has six tornado jets stationed in afghanistan germany has up to 3,500 troops stationed in the country , mainly deployed on reconstruction and training missions from their base at mazar-e-sharif in balkh province .
it also maintains a flight of six reconnaissance tornado jets .
the afghan mission , the annual mandate for which comes up for parliamentary renewal in october , enjoys broad backing in the bundestag but is consistently opposed by a majority of the population .
danish soldier killed in firefight with taliban in an earlier attack in southern afghanistan , a danish soldier was killed and another wounded in a firefight with taliban insurgents , according to a statement from isaf .
the danes were on patrol wednesday in helmand province , a hotbed of taliban activity , when they came under fire in the gereshk area , the isaf spokesman in the province , british lieutenant colonel simon miller , told reporters .
" regrettably as a result of the firefight one danish soldier was killed and another was wounded , " miller said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has lost 26 troops and three police officers including the latest death , denmark has lost 13 soldiers in afghanistan .
two other danes were killed march 17 in an attack on an isaf convoy .
denmark has about 550 troops in helmand , where most international soldiers with isaf are british .
more than 30 international soldiers have been killed this year , most of them in hostile action .
a total of 787 coalition soldiers have lost their lives since the us-led invasion of afghanistan was launched in 2001 .
isaf draws its 47,000 troops from 39 countries .
it is helping the afghan government restore security in the face of an insurgency by the taliban , who were in government between 1996 and 2001 , and promote development . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de banking -pipe- 27.03.2008 state intervention remains last resort , economist says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the state should throw a lifeline when every other option has been tried , said walter when all other avenues have been exhausted , the state should bail out a flailing bank , said deutsche bank 's head economist norbert walter .
germany is proud that half of its banking sector is state-run , he added . dw-radio : when and where does state intervention make sense ? norbert walter : state intervention only makes sense when all other private economic means have already been implemented - not just theoretically , but also practically .
that means , when a bank incurs speculation losses , changes its management , has used all of its available capital and made an effort to obtain new capital and / or a foreign or domestic strategic investor .
only after these efforts have failed is it appropriate for the state to ask whether it 's important to the financial system in the affected country to rescue the institution that 's in danger of collapsing or not . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norbert walter sometimes it 's wise to rescue an important institution that plays an important role in the economy when there is no private solution .
but this process should be carefully considered and it 's clear that , if this step is taken , it can not be carried out by a central bank .
rather , it 's the job of the government and of those who decide how tax money is spent - namely , the parliament . but there already seems to be an imbalance .
generally speaking , companies pay for their own mistakes , but this does n't seem to be the case in the banking sector .
banks pocket the profits , but expect society to pick up the losses .
is this acceptable ? this is not at all acceptable .
it also is n't a very good arrangement for the future , since it encourages making contracts that burden a third party . and these contracts are responsible for difficulties we 've seen at the westlb and ikb banks ? i did n't say that , you did .
we should keep in mind that in germany - with transparency and with the agreement of the people and nearly all of the political parties - half of the banking sector has been state-run from the very beginning .
we 're very proud of this in germany .
and the politicians are convinced that this is the right way to organize our monetary system .
when institutions that are either owned or overseen by the state experience a crisis , as was the case in dresden -lsb- the former headquarters of sachsenlb , which was bought out by another regional bank - eds . -rsb- and dusseldorf -lsb- headquarters for westlb -rsb- and at ikb , it 's only obvious that the owners have to step in - which in this case is the state . it was the highly paid bank personnel who utterly failed and demonstrated extreme naivete .
what personnel decisions can banks make to avoid a repeat of the situation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank announced it would n't meet its profit target for 2008 the management team was fired and replaced with new managers .
it 's appropriate that those who squander their own money are no longer suited to run a bank .
it 's also appropriate that the state and other institutions like supervisory bodies help find new owners .
we 'd have reason to worry if this process were to be lost .
it 's been successful in a series of cases where domestic capital and management were available .
for example , with bear stones and jp morgan .
in other cases , where owners ' equity was lost , international investors were ready , like in the case of ubs in switzerland , where singapore was ready to subsidize a bank that had lost a gamble but is a very attractive bank in other important areas . the bank crisis started in the us .
but how are things looking here in germany ?

when faced with the subject of their own phobias , people tend to exhibit a number of erratic responses . for example , acrophobics - those who are afraid of heights - may drop to the floor of a tall structure or hug a part of the building which they are convinced is immovable . the stereotypical response for muriphobics - people who are scared of mice - is to stand on a chair , pull their skirt tight around their knees and scream like a banshee ; that is if the muriphobic is a woman or a character from a tom & jerry cartoon . but even those who study phobias can not say for sure how a person will react to being faced with their nemesis .
there is no standard response apart from total and irrational fear . so who to say that the german muriphobic who ran out into the street in sub-zero temperatures wearing just his boxer shorts and a pair of fluffy slippers is any crazier than the next person battling a fear of mice ? the local police who then led a search of the petrified man 's house , that 's who . no time to dress as fear strikes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " a mouse ... a mouse !

he did not elaborate on what kind of film he was watching , sat at home alone in just his underwear , and the police chose not to pursue this line of enquiry . after the intrepid cops tried and failed to track down the offending rodent , the man ignored their assurances that it was safe to return and instead trudged off through the snow to stay with nearby relatives .

" the near-term outlook continues to be challenging , " deutsche bank ceo josef ackerman wrote in a letter to shareholders .
" conditions remain difficult both in financial markets and the wider economy , " he said .
deutsche said ackermann earned around 14 million euros in salary and bonuses last year with the bank chalking up a record profit of 6.5 billion euros in 2007 .
the bank 's 8.4-billion-euro pre-tax earnings target excludes one-off costs and charges .
after taking hold during the second half of last year , the us mortgage market crisis " has persisted into the early months of 2008 , and continues to weigh on both financial markets and the wider global economy , " ackerman told the bank 's shareholders .
stricken bank may face audit europe has not escaped the credit crunch , which first bit in august when banks worldwide hit the brakes on lending to each other as it emerged that some were dangerously exposed to the us subprime mortgage meltdown .
germany 's main casualty of the subprime crisis , the state-owned ikb bank , faces a possible special audit by the government to find out who is to blame for its losses amounting to millions of euros when its investments in the market for risky us mortgages soured .
ikb became the first victim of the subprime crisis last year and was bailed out twice by shareholders in rescues costing more than six billion euros .
german state-owned bank kfw , which is ikb 's biggest shareholder with a 38-percent stake , has shouldered the lion 's share of the bail-out so far . the audit , which would be conducted by an independent auditing company , will delay a vote of confidence in the bank 's boards . split government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : effects from the us subprime mortgage crisis are continuing to play out around the globe a german finance ministry spokesman told the financial times deutschland that the ministry saw the audit as a way to show that the ikb 's supervisory board had acted correctly . " responsibility lies solely with the executive board , which informed people badly , " the unnamed spokesman told the paper . according to news reports , the audit is a compromise between finance and economics ministries as they failed to agree on a common strategy .
while the finance ministry , which has a representative on ikb 's board of supervisors , wanted to exonerate the body , the economics ministry hesitated to do so . the bank has already received billions of euros in aid - much of it taxpayers ' money - to prevent it from collapsing .
some parliamentarians and economics experts have said that ikb should not be given any additional financial help from the state . " we can not make life easier for those who have made mistakes .
they have to pay for their mistakes , " european central bank head jean-claude trichet told german public broadcaster ard on wednesday . " not only because it would be unfair if they got off but also because if they do n't pay for the mistakes , they 'll make them again .

18 by eu justice , freedom and security commissioner franco frattini , the just as european leaders gathered for an important summit in lisbon , the dpa news agency reported . but after peter hustinx , the head of the european data protection watchdog -lsb- edps -rsb- , announced the watchdog agency 's concerns on thursday , march 27 , eu officials worked to calm fears over the potential for privacy infringements . hustinx 's main concerns focus on controversial plans to fingerprint children as young as 6 years old and elderly people who would be physically unable to provide theirs , as well as the creation of a centralized database , which would hold a copy of fingerprints belonging to all eu citizens . civil liberties advocates fear that such a database could be violated and used for criminal purposes . eu defends plan to fingerprint children bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini assures eu citizens everything will be above board frattini 's office on thursday rejected calls for the 6-year-old exemption limit to be raised to include children under the age of 14 so that it may be brought " in line with international practice , " arguing that the measure was needed to prevent child-trafficking . officials also said they were willing to address hustinx 's concerns about the centralized database and respond within " a matter of weeks . " " we have just received the comments , and we want to take them serious , " said friso roscam abbing , frattini 's spokesman .
" creating big databases poses data-protection challenges , nobody will deny it .
however , precisely because we are aware of those challenges we will do everything that is needed to address them ... and ensure that we are taking duly into consideration all legitimate data protection concerns . " brussels claims citizens no longer hold concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu says there is less of a stigma attached to providing biometric data officials in brussels also argued that a growing number of eu citizens no longer fear being likened to potential suspects simply because their fingerprints are taken , noting that biometric data of this kind has become increasingly common , for instance as an added security measure in laptops . slovenian interior minister dragutin mate , whose country holds the rotating presidency of the eu , acknowledged to reporters that the proposal will likely encounter difficulties when it is due to be discussed by the european parliament and by member states . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

when faced with the subject of their own phobias , people tend to exhibit a number of erratic responses . for example , acrophobics - those who are afraid of heights - may drop to the floor of a tall structure or hug a part of the building which they are convinced is immovable . the stereotypical response for muriphobics - people who are scared of mice - is to stand on a chair , pull their skirt tight around their knees and scream like a banshee ; that is if the muriphobic is a woman or a character from a tom & jerry cartoon . but even those who study phobias can not say for sure how a person will react to being faced with their nemesis .
there is no standard response apart from total and irrational fear . so who to say that the german muriphobic who ran out into the street in sub-zero temperatures wearing just his boxer shorts and a pair of fluffy slippers is any crazier than the next person battling a fear of mice ? the local police who then led a search of the petrified man 's house , that 's who . no time to dress as fear strikes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " a mouse ... a mouse ! "
after being seen cowering semi-naked in a phone booth in the town of goettingen , the man was approached by the officers hoping for something a little racier than just some sleepwalker or an extreme jogger who had forgotten his keys . but instead of accosting a pervert lurking for prey , the local cops found the quivering 23-year-old to be the victim - of mouse-stalking . the man told police he had seen the mouse scurry across the floor while he was watching a film , and had immediately fled his home .
he did not elaborate on what kind of film he was watching , sat at home alone in just his underwear , and the police chose not to pursue this line of enquiry . after the intrepid cops tried and failed to track down the offending rodent , the man ignored their assurances that it was safe to return and instead trudged off through the snow to stay with nearby relatives . " he said there was nothing he was more afraid of , " the goettingen police said in a statement . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

when faced with the subject of their own phobias , people tend to exhibit a number of erratic responses . for example , acrophobics - those who are afraid of heights - may drop to the floor of a tall structure or hug a part of the building which they are convinced is immovable . the stereotypical response for muriphobics - people who are scared of mice - is to stand on a chair , pull their skirt tight around their knees and scream like a banshee ; that is if the muriphobic is a woman or a character from a tom & jerry cartoon . but even those who study phobias can not say for sure how a person will react to being faced with their nemesis .
there is no standard response apart from total and irrational fear . so who to say that the german muriphobic who ran out into the street in sub-zero temperatures wearing just his boxer shorts and a pair of fluffy slippers is any crazier than the next person battling a fear of mice ? the local police who then led a search of the petrified man 's house , that 's who . no time to dress as fear strikes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " a mouse ... a mouse !

he did not elaborate on what kind of film he was watching , sat at home alone in just his underwear , and the police chose not to pursue this line of enquiry . after the intrepid cops tried and failed to track down the offending rodent , the man ignored their assurances that it was safe to return and instead trudged off through the snow to stay with nearby relatives .

" the near-term outlook continues to be challenging , " deutsche bank ceo josef ackerman wrote in a letter to shareholders .
" conditions remain difficult both in financial markets and the wider economy , " he said .
deutsche said ackermann earned around 14 million euros in salary and bonuses last year with the bank chalking up a record profit of 6.5 billion euros in 2007 .
the bank 's 8.4-billion-euro pre-tax earnings target excludes one-off costs and charges .
after taking hold during the second half of last year , the us mortgage market crisis " has persisted into the early months of 2008 , and continues to weigh on both financial markets and the wider global economy , " ackerman told the bank 's shareholders .
stricken bank may face audit europe has not escaped the credit crunch , which first bit in august when banks worldwide hit the brakes on lending to each other as it emerged that some were dangerously exposed to the us subprime mortgage meltdown .
germany 's main casualty of the subprime crisis , the state-owned ikb bank , faces a possible special audit by the government to find out who is to blame for its losses amounting to millions of euros when its investments in the market for risky us mortgages soured .
ikb became the first victim of the subprime crisis last year and was bailed out twice by shareholders in rescues costing more than six billion euros .

" responsibility lies solely with the executive board , which informed people badly , " the unnamed spokesman told the paper . according to news reports , the audit is a compromise between finance and economics ministries as they failed to agree on a common strategy .
while the finance ministry , which has a representative on ikb 's board of supervisors , wanted to exonerate the body , the economics ministry hesitated to do so . the bank has already received billions of euros in aid - much of it taxpayers ' money - to prevent it from collapsing .
some parliamentarians and economics experts have said that ikb should not be given any additional financial help from the state . " we can not make life easier for those who have made mistakes .

" the federal government is not prepared to increase its contribution , " tiefensee said .
" we had to conclude that it is not possible to finance this project . " death knell for mag-lev technology ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the transrapid is in operation in shanghai industry observers say that without a showcase project in germany for one of the world 's fastest trains , the technology devised by engineers at siemens and thyssenkrupp is unlikely to have much success abroad . the transrapid technology has currently only been used commercially in china .
another plan to build a magnetic-levitation monorail link between hamburg and berlin has already been scrapped .
a crash that led to 23 deaths on a test stretch in 2006 was caused by human error , but it was clearly a severe pr setback for transrapid . mutual blame game for the failure of the project bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crash in lathen im emsland was blamed on a human error the firms involved in the munich project have blamed each other for the runaway costs . siemens ceo peter loescher indirectly attributed it to construction industry partners hochtief , saying that his company and thyssenkrupp had kept to the guidelines .
thyssenkrupp officials said they were not " responsible " for hochtief 's figures . hochtief rebutted these accusations , saying it had not been involved in the 2004 estimate . " this is the first time that we have had a proper overview of the cost situation , " a company spokesman said . he added that the company had ascertained that it was not possible to implement the project for 1.85 billion euros . the german government had agreed to bear half the cost for the train line , but up to a maximum of 925 million euros .
the state of bavaria had earmarked 500 million euros - with german state railways deutsche bahn , the airport , the european union and the two companies involved making up the remainder . bavaria 's pride and joy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new bavarian state premier said he did his best to keep the project on track the project was announced last year by then bavarian premier edmund stoiber just before he stood down as head of the southern state 's conservative party in september and many observers saw it as a " parting present " from angela merkel 's christian democrats to the csu , the cdu 's bavarian sister party . bavarian premier guenter beckstein said he had lobbied hard to persuade the federal government to increase its contribution , but to no avail . " this is a bad day for germany 's image as the home of high-tech industry , " beckstein said . the transrapid project would have trimmed the current 40 minute journey from munich to the airport down to 10 minutes - and had been billed by many as a coup for the prosperous southern german city . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" a mine , which was planted by taliban militants in qasab area of the district , hit a nato forces ' tank , " omar said .
" the tank was damaged and three german soldiers were seriously wounded . "
he blamed taliban militants , whose government was toppled in a us- led military invasion in late 2001 , for the attack .
" during the taliban time , they were very active in this area , and now they still have their loyalists , whom they can use for this kind of attacks , " the governor said .
taliban claim responsibility as part of new offensive the taliban took responsibility for the attack in kunduz .
" in qasab village of chardara , a nato tank was blown up by a mine , planted on the road by our mujahideen , " the group said in a statement posted on a rebel website .
it claimed that the tank was " completely destroyed and 13 soldiers inside the vehicle were killed or wounded . "
the statement said that the attack was part of a " spring offensive , " announced by the militants on wednesday .
taliban militants are not very active in the northern provinces of afghanistan , compared to southern and eastern regions , where the rebels are the most entrenched .
afghan defence minister abdul rahim wardak said on thursday in a video conference from nato headquarters in kabul that the militants intended to expand their insurgency to the peaceful northern and western provinces of the country this year .
" we are expecting the taliban to rely very heavily on ied roadside bombs and suicide attacks , " wardak said .
pressure has been growing on germany to deploy some of its forces to help combat the taliban insurgency in the more volatile south of the country .
the attack on the troops near kunduz comes just a day after canadian defense minister peter mackay became the latest to call for a german combat deployment in an interview with der spiegel magazine .
canadian defense minister questions germany 's commitment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many leaders want german troops deployed in the south mackay said nato allies were not sharing the burden evenly between them and that germany should send its troops to help with combat operations in southern afghanistan instead of confining them to the relatively peaceful north , hinting that he thought germany was not fulfilling its international obligations .
" i understand that troop deployments are very difficult to push through in germany for domestic political reasons , but there are also international commitments that we all have to meet , " mackay said .
canada had lost more than 80 soldiers in operations , mainly in combat operations in kandahar province , he noted .
german losses in afghanistan total 26 troops and three police officers since forces were first sent there more than five years ago .
mackay warned of the dangers of a " two-class " nato and said all member states had to carry their share of the burdens .
germany would profit from a stable afghanistan unable to export terrorism , he said .
" the future of afghanistan lies in nato 's hands .
the taliban and terrorist organizations are like a cancer .
they proliferate and threaten human lives over the whole world , " he said .
mackay expressed admiration for germany and said german troops wanted to do more in afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has six tornado jets stationed in afghanistan germany has up to 3,500 troops stationed in the country , mainly deployed on reconstruction and training missions from their base at mazar-e-sharif in balkh province .
it also maintains a flight of six reconnaissance tornado jets .
the afghan mission , the annual mandate for which comes up for parliamentary renewal in october , enjoys broad backing in the bundestag but is consistently opposed by a majority of the population .
danish soldier killed in firefight with taliban in an earlier attack in southern afghanistan , a danish soldier was killed and another wounded in a firefight with taliban insurgents , according to a statement from isaf .
the danes were on patrol wednesday in helmand province , a hotbed of taliban activity , when they came under fire in the gereshk area , the isaf spokesman in the province , british lieutenant colonel simon miller , told reporters .
" regrettably as a result of the firefight one danish soldier was killed and another was wounded , " miller said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has lost 26 troops and three police officers including the latest death , denmark has lost 13 soldiers in afghanistan .
two other danes were killed march 17 in an attack on an isaf convoy .
denmark has about 550 troops in helmand , where most international soldiers with isaf are british .
more than 30 international soldiers have been killed this year , most of them in hostile action .
a total of 787 coalition soldiers have lost their lives since the us-led invasion of afghanistan was launched in 2001 .
isaf draws its 47,000 troops from 39 countries .
it is helping the afghan government restore security in the face of an insurgency by the taliban , who were in government between 1996 and 2001 , and promote development . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the statement said that the attack was part of a " spring offensive , " announced by the militants on wednesday .
taliban militants are not very active in the northern provinces of afghanistan , compared to southern and eastern regions , where the rebels are the most entrenched .
afghan defence minister abdul rahim wardak said on thursday in a video conference from nato headquarters in kabul that the militants intended to expand their insurgency to the peaceful northern and western provinces of the country this year .
" we are expecting the taliban to rely very heavily on ied roadside bombs and suicide attacks , " wardak said .
pressure has been growing on germany to deploy some of its forces to help combat the taliban insurgency in the more volatile south of the country .

" i understand that troop deployments are very difficult to push through in germany for domestic political reasons , but there are also international commitments that we all have to meet , " mackay said .
canada had lost more than 80 soldiers in operations , mainly in combat operations in kandahar province , he noted .
german losses in afghanistan total 26 troops and three police officers since forces were first sent there more than five years ago .
mackay warned of the dangers of a " two-class " nato and said all member states had to carry their share of the burdens .
germany would profit from a stable afghanistan unable to export terrorism , he said .
" the future of afghanistan lies in nato 's hands .
the taliban and terrorist organizations are like a cancer .
they proliferate and threaten human lives over the whole world , " he said .
mackay expressed admiration for germany and said german troops wanted to do more in afghanistan .

" the near-term outlook continues to be challenging , " deutsche bank ceo josef ackerman wrote in a letter to shareholders .
" conditions remain difficult both in financial markets and the wider economy , " he said .
deutsche said ackermann earned around 14 million euros in salary and bonuses last year with the bank chalking up a record profit of 6.5 billion euros in 2007 .
the bank 's 8.4-billion-euro pre-tax earnings target excludes one-off costs and charges .
after taking hold during the second half of last year , the us mortgage market crisis " has persisted into the early months of 2008 , and continues to weigh on both financial markets and the wider global economy , " ackerman told the bank 's shareholders .
stricken bank may face audit europe has not escaped the credit crunch , which first bit in august when banks worldwide hit the brakes on lending to each other as it emerged that some were dangerously exposed to the us subprime mortgage meltdown .
germany 's main casualty of the subprime crisis , the state-owned ikb bank , faces a possible special audit by the government to find out who is to blame for its losses amounting to millions of euros when its investments in the market for risky us mortgages soured .
ikb became the first victim of the subprime crisis last year and was bailed out twice by shareholders in rescues costing more than six billion euros .
german state-owned bank kfw , which is ikb 's biggest shareholder with a 38-percent stake , has shouldered the lion 's share of the bail-out so far . the audit , which would be conducted by an independent auditing company , will delay a vote of confidence in the bank 's boards . split government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : effects from the us subprime mortgage crisis are continuing to play out around the globe a german finance ministry spokesman told the financial times deutschland that the ministry saw the audit as a way to show that the ikb 's supervisory board had acted correctly . " responsibility lies solely with the executive board , which informed people badly , " the unnamed spokesman told the paper . according to news reports , the audit is a compromise between finance and economics ministries as they failed to agree on a common strategy .
while the finance ministry , which has a representative on ikb 's board of supervisors , wanted to exonerate the body , the economics ministry hesitated to do so . the bank has already received billions of euros in aid - much of it taxpayers ' money - to prevent it from collapsing .
some parliamentarians and economics experts have said that ikb should not be given any additional financial help from the state . " we can not make life easier for those who have made mistakes .
they have to pay for their mistakes , " european central bank head jean-claude trichet told german public broadcaster ard on wednesday . " not only because it would be unfair if they got off but also because if they do n't pay for the mistakes , they 'll make them again .

" a mine , which was planted by taliban militants in qasab area of the district , hit a nato forces ' tank , " omar said .
" the tank was damaged and three german soldiers were seriously wounded . "
he blamed taliban militants , whose government was toppled in a us- led military invasion in late 2001 , for the attack .
" during the taliban time , they were very active in this area , and now they still have their loyalists , whom they can use for this kind of attacks , " the governor said .
taliban claim responsibility as part of new offensive the taliban took responsibility for the attack in kunduz .
" in qasab village of chardara , a nato tank was blown up by a mine , planted on the road by our mujahideen , " the group said in a statement posted on a rebel website .
it claimed that the tank was " completely destroyed and 13 soldiers inside the vehicle were killed or wounded . "
the statement said that the attack was part of a " spring offensive , " announced by the militants on wednesday .
taliban militants are not very active in the northern provinces of afghanistan , compared to southern and eastern regions , where the rebels are the most entrenched .
afghan defence minister abdul rahim wardak said on thursday in a video conference from nato headquarters in kabul that the militants intended to expand their insurgency to the peaceful northern and western provinces of the country this year .
" we are expecting the taliban to rely very heavily on ied roadside bombs and suicide attacks , " wardak said .
pressure has been growing on germany to deploy some of its forces to help combat the taliban insurgency in the more volatile south of the country .
the attack on the troops near kunduz comes just a day after canadian defense minister peter mackay became the latest to call for a german combat deployment in an interview with der spiegel magazine .
canadian defense minister questions germany 's commitment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many leaders want german troops deployed in the south mackay said nato allies were not sharing the burden evenly between them and that germany should send its troops to help with combat operations in southern afghanistan instead of confining them to the relatively peaceful north , hinting that he thought germany was not fulfilling its international obligations .
" i understand that troop deployments are very difficult to push through in germany for domestic political reasons , but there are also international commitments that we all have to meet , " mackay said .
canada had lost more than 80 soldiers in operations , mainly in combat operations in kandahar province , he noted .
german losses in afghanistan total 26 troops and three police officers since forces were first sent there more than five years ago .
mackay warned of the dangers of a " two-class " nato and said all member states had to carry their share of the burdens .
germany would profit from a stable afghanistan unable to export terrorism , he said .
" the future of afghanistan lies in nato 's hands .
the taliban and terrorist organizations are like a cancer .
they proliferate and threaten human lives over the whole world , " he said .

" we are expecting the taliban to rely very heavily on ied roadside bombs and suicide attacks , " wardak said .
pressure has been growing on germany to deploy some of its forces to help combat the taliban insurgency in the more volatile south of the country .
the attack on the troops near kunduz comes just a day after canadian defense minister peter mackay became the latest to call for a german combat deployment in an interview with der spiegel magazine .
canadian defense minister questions germany 's commitment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many leaders want german troops deployed in the south mackay said nato allies were not sharing the burden evenly between them and that germany should send its troops to help with combat operations in southern afghanistan instead of confining them to the relatively peaceful north , hinting that he thought germany was not fulfilling its international obligations .
" i understand that troop deployments are very difficult to push through in germany for domestic political reasons , but there are also international commitments that we all have to meet , " mackay said .
canada had lost more than 80 soldiers in operations , mainly in combat operations in kandahar province , he noted .
german losses in afghanistan total 26 troops and three police officers since forces were first sent there more than five years ago .
mackay warned of the dangers of a " two-class " nato and said all member states had to carry their share of the burdens .
germany would profit from a stable afghanistan unable to export terrorism , he said .
" the future of afghanistan lies in nato 's hands .
the taliban and terrorist organizations are like a cancer .
they proliferate and threaten human lives over the whole world , " he said .
mackay expressed admiration for germany and said german troops wanted to do more in afghanistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has six tornado jets stationed in afghanistan germany has up to 3,500 troops stationed in the country , mainly deployed on reconstruction and training missions from their base at mazar-e-sharif in balkh province .
it also maintains a flight of six reconnaissance tornado jets .
the afghan mission , the annual mandate for which comes up for parliamentary renewal in october , enjoys broad backing in the bundestag but is consistently opposed by a majority of the population .
danish soldier killed in firefight with taliban in an earlier attack in southern afghanistan , a danish soldier was killed and another wounded in a firefight with taliban insurgents , according to a statement from isaf .
the danes were on patrol wednesday in helmand province , a hotbed of taliban activity , when they came under fire in the gereshk area , the isaf spokesman in the province , british lieutenant colonel simon miller , told reporters .
" regrettably as a result of the firefight one danish soldier was killed and another was wounded , " miller said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has lost 26 troops and three police officers including the latest death , denmark has lost 13 soldiers in afghanistan .
two other danes were killed march 17 in an attack on an isaf convoy .
denmark has about 550 troops in helmand , where most international soldiers with isaf are british .
more than 30 international soldiers have been killed this year , most of them in hostile action .
a total of 787 coalition soldiers have lost their lives since the us-led invasion of afghanistan was launched in 2001 .
isaf draws its 47,000 troops from 39 countries .
it is helping the afghan government restore security in the face of an insurgency by the taliban , who were in government between 1996 and 2001 , and promote development . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that means , when a bank incurs speculation losses , changes its management , has used all of its available capital and made an effort to obtain new capital and / or a foreign or domestic strategic investor .

germany is proud that half of its banking sector is state-run , he added . dw-radio : when and where does state intervention make sense ? norbert walter : state intervention only makes sense when all other private economic means have already been implemented - not just theoretically , but also practically .
that means , when a bank incurs speculation losses , changes its management , has used all of its available capital and made an effort to obtain new capital and / or a foreign or domestic strategic investor .
only after these efforts have failed is it appropriate for the state to ask whether it 's important to the financial system in the affected country to rescue the institution that 's in danger of collapsing or not . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norbert walter sometimes it 's wise to rescue an important institution that plays an important role in the economy when there is no private solution .
but this process should be carefully considered and it 's clear that , if this step is taken , it can not be carried out by a central bank .
rather , it 's the job of the government and of those who decide how tax money is spent - namely , the parliament . but there already seems to be an imbalance .
generally speaking , companies pay for their own mistakes , but this does n't seem to be the case in the banking sector .
banks pocket the profits , but expect society to pick up the losses .
is this acceptable ? this is not at all acceptable .
it also is n't a very good arrangement for the future , since it encourages making contracts that burden a third party . and these contracts are responsible for difficulties we 've seen at the westlb and ikb banks ? i did n't say that , you did .
we should keep in mind that in germany - with transparency and with the agreement of the people and nearly all of the political parties - half of the banking sector has been state-run from the very beginning .
we 're very proud of this in germany .
and the politicians are convinced that this is the right way to organize our monetary system .
when institutions that are either owned or overseen by the state experience a crisis , as was the case in dresden -lsb- the former headquarters of sachsenlb , which was bought out by another regional bank - eds . -rsb- and dusseldorf -lsb- headquarters for westlb -rsb- and at ikb , it 's only obvious that the owners have to step in - which in this case is the state . it was the highly paid bank personnel who utterly failed and demonstrated extreme naivete .
what personnel decisions can banks make to avoid a repeat of the situation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank announced it would n't meet its profit target for 2008 the management team was fired and replaced with new managers .
it 's appropriate that those who squander their own money are no longer suited to run a bank .
it 's also appropriate that the state and other institutions like supervisory bodies help find new owners .
we 'd have reason to worry if this process were to be lost .
it 's been successful in a series of cases where domestic capital and management were available .
for example , with bear stones and jp morgan .
in other cases , where owners ' equity was lost , international investors were ready , like in the case of ubs in switzerland , where singapore was ready to subsidize a bank that had lost a gamble but is a very attractive bank in other important areas . the bank crisis started in the us .
but how are things looking here in germany ?
is the situation more stable ? unlike in the us , or england or spain or australia , our real estate prices have n't been exaggerated over the past 10 years .
there the prices have more than doubled - or tripled , as is the case in spain .
in germany , the prices have remained stable or even sunk in some cases .

he has linked the issue with national security , saying that protectionism would isolate the united states .
mccain expressed his enthusiasm for a huge free trading bloc .
" i am an unashamed and unabashed defender of nafta .
i am an unabashed supporter of free trade agreements .
in fact , it would be interesting to have a free trade agreement between ourselves and the european union , " mccain said in a speech to the world affairs council on wednesday , march 26 .
" they are one of the largest economic blocs in the world , if not the largest .
i think to head a free trade agreement with the european union would be a great thing to happen , " mccain told reporters as he headed for his next campaign event in monterey , california .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nafta free trade deal between canada , us and mexico is a us electoral issue the unites states and the eu already have low tariffs on most of the manufactured goods that cross the atlantic .
recently , they have also begun an initiative aimed at eliminating regulatory barriers that hamper commerce .
agriculture has been an obstacle to bilateral trade deal but both sides have preferred to deal with the tricky agricultural issues within the context of world trade talks , rather than negotiate a bilateral free trade deal to entirely phase out tariffs on each other 's farm goods .
at the same time , some members of congress have called for a services free trade agreement that would reduce or eliminate barriers to trade and investment in areas such as banking , insurance and telecommunications .
the issue of foreign trade is an emotive issue in the united states particularly in democratic heartlands , such as the rust belt of the united states where cheap imports have been blamed for the region 's economic woes and in farming communities .
all just electoral maneuvering ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both clinton and obama have taken a more cautious tack on free trade democratic presidential candidates barack obama and hillary clinton have threatened to withdraw from nafta if mexico and canada do not agree to renegotiate the pact and include stronger labor and environmental provisions .
clinton has also said she would introduce " time-out " from new free trade agreements if elected president .
in an allusion to his opponents ' stance , mccain drew attention to the fact that some eu environmental standards and labor standards were higher than us requirements and added that it would be interesting to see how free trade opponents would react to that .
the republican candidate has shown himself eager to play up his pro-european credentials with a transatlantic trip to paris and london earlier this month .
some observers have , however , have raised doubts about his intentions , with some suggesting mccain 's european drive is designed to serve a domestic purpose . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he has linked the issue with national security , saying that protectionism would isolate the united states .
mccain expressed his enthusiasm for a huge free trading bloc .
" i am an unashamed and unabashed defender of nafta .
i am an unabashed supporter of free trade agreements .
in fact , it would be interesting to have a free trade agreement between ourselves and the european union , " mccain said in a speech to the world affairs council on wednesday , march 26 .
" they are one of the largest economic blocs in the world , if not the largest .
i think to head a free trade agreement with the european union would be a great thing to happen , " mccain told reporters as he headed for his next campaign event in monterey , california .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nafta free trade deal between canada , us and mexico is a us electoral issue the unites states and the eu already have low tariffs on most of the manufactured goods that cross the atlantic .
recently , they have also begun an initiative aimed at eliminating regulatory barriers that hamper commerce .
agriculture has been an obstacle to bilateral trade deal but both sides have preferred to deal with the tricky agricultural issues within the context of world trade talks , rather than negotiate a bilateral free trade deal to entirely phase out tariffs on each other 's farm goods .
at the same time , some members of congress have called for a services free trade agreement that would reduce or eliminate barriers to trade and investment in areas such as banking , insurance and telecommunications .
the issue of foreign trade is an emotive issue in the united states particularly in democratic heartlands , such as the rust belt of the united states where cheap imports have been blamed for the region 's economic woes and in farming communities .
all just electoral maneuvering ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both clinton and obama have taken a more cautious tack on free trade democratic presidential candidates barack obama and hillary clinton have threatened to withdraw from nafta if mexico and canada do not agree to renegotiate the pact and include stronger labor and environmental provisions .
clinton has also said she would introduce " time-out " from new free trade agreements if elected president .
in an allusion to his opponents ' stance , mccain drew attention to the fact that some eu environmental standards and labor standards were higher than us requirements and added that it would be interesting to see how free trade opponents would react to that .
the republican candidate has shown himself eager to play up his pro-european credentials with a transatlantic trip to paris and london earlier this month .
some observers have , however , have raised doubts about his intentions , with some suggesting mccain 's european drive is designed to serve a domestic purpose . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

when faced with the subject of their own phobias , people tend to exhibit a number of erratic responses . for example , acrophobics - those who are afraid of heights - may drop to the floor of a tall structure or hug a part of the building which they are convinced is immovable . the stereotypical response for muriphobics - people who are scared of mice - is to stand on a chair , pull their skirt tight around their knees and scream like a banshee ; that is if the muriphobic is a woman or a character from a tom & jerry cartoon . but even those who study phobias can not say for sure how a person will react to being faced with their nemesis .
there is no standard response apart from total and irrational fear . so who to say that the german muriphobic who ran out into the street in sub-zero temperatures wearing just his boxer shorts and a pair of fluffy slippers is any crazier than the next person battling a fear of mice ? the local police who then led a search of the petrified man 's house , that 's who . no time to dress as fear strikes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " a mouse ... a mouse !

he did not elaborate on what kind of film he was watching , sat at home alone in just his underwear , and the police chose not to pursue this line of enquiry . after the intrepid cops tried and failed to track down the offending rodent , the man ignored their assurances that it was safe to return and instead trudged off through the snow to stay with nearby relatives .

when faced with the subject of their own phobias , people tend to exhibit a number of erratic responses . for example , acrophobics - those who are afraid of heights - may drop to the floor of a tall structure or hug a part of the building which they are convinced is immovable . the stereotypical response for muriphobics - people who are scared of mice - is to stand on a chair , pull their skirt tight around their knees and scream like a banshee ; that is if the muriphobic is a woman or a character from a tom & jerry cartoon . but even those who study phobias can not say for sure how a person will react to being faced with their nemesis .
there is no standard response apart from total and irrational fear . so who to say that the german muriphobic who ran out into the street in sub-zero temperatures wearing just his boxer shorts and a pair of fluffy slippers is any crazier than the next person battling a fear of mice ? the local police who then led a search of the petrified man 's house , that 's who . no time to dress as fear strikes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " a mouse ... a mouse ! "
after being seen cowering semi-naked in a phone booth in the town of goettingen , the man was approached by the officers hoping for something a little racier than just some sleepwalker or an extreme jogger who had forgotten his keys . but instead of accosting a pervert lurking for prey , the local cops found the quivering 23-year-old to be the victim - of mouse-stalking . the man told police he had seen the mouse scurry across the floor while he was watching a film , and had immediately fled his home .
he did not elaborate on what kind of film he was watching , sat at home alone in just his underwear , and the police chose not to pursue this line of enquiry . after the intrepid cops tried and failed to track down the offending rodent , the man ignored their assurances that it was safe to return and instead trudged off through the snow to stay with nearby relatives .

" " we have just received the comments , and we want to take them serious , " said friso roscam abbing , frattini 's spokesman .
" creating big databases poses data-protection challenges , nobody will deny it .
however , precisely because we are aware of those challenges we will do everything that is needed to address them ... and ensure that we are taking duly into consideration all legitimate data protection concerns . " brussels claims citizens no longer hold concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu says there is less of a stigma attached to providing biometric data officials in brussels also argued that a growing number of eu citizens no longer fear being likened to potential suspects simply because their fingerprints are taken , noting that biometric data of this kind has become increasingly common , for instance as an added security measure in laptops . slovenian interior minister dragutin mate , whose country holds the rotating presidency of the eu , acknowledged to reporters that the proposal will likely encounter difficulties when it is due to be discussed by the european parliament and by member states . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we want to ensure the future of our sites with strong partners who share technology , development costs and capital investments and are able to deliver large work packages at competitive costs .

an ohb statement said that the euro 's strength lowered the prospects for an adequate return on their planned investment in the plants . airbus admitted that the volatility of financial markets and the rise of the euro against the dollar had created obstacles " to an easy and smooth implementation of this process . " the site divestment strategy is part of a vast restructuring plan announced in february last year dubbed power8 , which involves 10,000 job cuts over four years and the sale of six airbus factories .
the major restructuring follows on from severe losses resulting from a two-year delay in delivering the airbus a380 superjumbo . the other sites up for sale are the filton works in britain and the french plants at meaulte and saint nazaire . " there will be no turning back " from efforts to attain the plan 's goals , enders added . eads wins british contract there was , however , some good new for eads on thursday .

" the federal government is not prepared to increase its contribution , " tiefensee said .
" we had to conclude that it is not possible to finance this project . " death knell for mag-lev technology ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the transrapid is in operation in shanghai industry observers say that without a showcase project in germany for one of the world 's fastest trains , the technology devised by engineers at siemens and thyssenkrupp is unlikely to have much success abroad . the transrapid technology has currently only been used commercially in china .
another plan to build a magnetic-levitation monorail link between hamburg and berlin has already been scrapped .
a crash that led to 23 deaths on a test stretch in 2006 was caused by human error , but it was clearly a severe pr setback for transrapid . mutual blame game for the failure of the project bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crash in lathen im emsland was blamed on a human error the firms involved in the munich project have blamed each other for the runaway costs . siemens ceo peter loescher indirectly attributed it to construction industry partners hochtief , saying that his company and thyssenkrupp had kept to the guidelines .
thyssenkrupp officials said they were not " responsible " for hochtief 's figures . hochtief rebutted these accusations , saying it had not been involved in the 2004 estimate . " this is the first time that we have had a proper overview of the cost situation , " a company spokesman said . he added that the company had ascertained that it was not possible to implement the project for 1.85 billion euros . the german government had agreed to bear half the cost for the train line , but up to a maximum of 925 million euros .
the state of bavaria had earmarked 500 million euros - with german state railways deutsche bahn , the airport , the european union and the two companies involved making up the remainder . bavaria 's pride and joy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new bavarian state premier said he did his best to keep the project on track the project was announced last year by then bavarian premier edmund stoiber just before he stood down as head of the southern state 's conservative party in september and many observers saw it as a " parting present " from angela merkel 's christian democrats to the csu , the cdu 's bavarian sister party . bavarian premier guenter beckstein said he had lobbied hard to persuade the federal government to increase its contribution , but to no avail . " this is a bad day for germany 's image as the home of high-tech industry , " beckstein said . the transrapid project would have trimmed the current 40 minute journey from munich to the airport down to 10 minutes - and had been billed by many as a coup for the prosperous southern german city . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german state-owned bank kfw , which is ikb 's biggest shareholder with a 38-percent stake , has shouldered the lion 's share of the bail-out so far . the audit , which would be conducted by an independent auditing company , will delay a vote of confidence in the bank 's boards . split government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : effects from the us subprime mortgage crisis are continuing to play out around the globe a german finance ministry spokesman told the financial times deutschland that the ministry saw the audit as a way to show that the ikb 's supervisory board had acted correctly . " responsibility lies solely with the executive board , which informed people badly , " the unnamed spokesman told the paper . according to news reports , the audit is a compromise between finance and economics ministries as they failed to agree on a common strategy .
while the finance ministry , which has a representative on ikb 's board of supervisors , wanted to exonerate the body , the economics ministry hesitated to do so . the bank has already received billions of euros in aid - much of it taxpayers ' money - to prevent it from collapsing .
some parliamentarians and economics experts have said that ikb should not be given any additional financial help from the state . " we can not make life easier for those who have made mistakes .
they have to pay for their mistakes , " european central bank head jean-claude trichet told german public broadcaster ard on wednesday .

when faced with the subject of their own phobias , people tend to exhibit a number of erratic responses . for example , acrophobics - those who are afraid of heights - may drop to the floor of a tall structure or hug a part of the building which they are convinced is immovable . the stereotypical response for muriphobics - people who are scared of mice - is to stand on a chair , pull their skirt tight around their knees and scream like a banshee ; that is if the muriphobic is a woman or a character from a tom & jerry cartoon . but even those who study phobias can not say for sure how a person will react to being faced with their nemesis .
there is no standard response apart from total and irrational fear . so who to say that the german muriphobic who ran out into the street in sub-zero temperatures wearing just his boxer shorts and a pair of fluffy slippers is any crazier than the next person battling a fear of mice ? the local police who then led a search of the petrified man 's house , that 's who . no time to dress as fear strikes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " a mouse ... a mouse !

he did not elaborate on what kind of film he was watching , sat at home alone in just his underwear , and the police chose not to pursue this line of enquiry . after the intrepid cops tried and failed to track down the offending rodent , the man ignored their assurances that it was safe to return and instead trudged off through the snow to stay with nearby relatives .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 27.03.2008 three german soldiers injured in ambush in afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german army patrols in the north of afghanistan are increasingly at risk of attack three german soldiers were injured , two of them seriously , in an attack on their convoy in northern afghanistan on thursday , march 27 , according to a statement from the german army . the soldiers were patrolling in the chardara district in the northern province kunduz , a relatively peaceful area , when the blast occurred , provincial governor mohammad omar later told reporters .
" a mine , which was planted by taliban militants in qasab area of the district , hit a nato forces ' tank , " omar said .
" the tank was damaged and three german soldiers were seriously wounded . "
he blamed taliban militants , whose government was toppled in a us- led military invasion in late 2001 , for the attack .
" during the taliban time , they were very active in this area , and now they still have their loyalists , whom they can use for this kind of attacks , " the governor said .
taliban claim responsibility as part of new offensive the taliban took responsibility for the attack in kunduz .
" in qasab village of chardara , a nato tank was blown up by a mine , planted on the road by our mujahideen , " the group said in a statement posted on a rebel website .
it claimed that the tank was " completely destroyed and 13 soldiers inside the vehicle were killed or wounded . "
the statement said that the attack was part of a " spring offensive , " announced by the militants on wednesday .
taliban militants are not very active in the northern provinces of afghanistan , compared to southern and eastern regions , where the rebels are the most entrenched .
afghan defence minister abdul rahim wardak said on thursday in a video conference from nato headquarters in kabul that the militants intended to expand their insurgency to the peaceful northern and western provinces of the country this year .
" we are expecting the taliban to rely very heavily on ied roadside bombs and suicide attacks , " wardak said .
pressure has been growing on germany to deploy some of its forces to help combat the taliban insurgency in the more volatile south of the country .
the attack on the troops near kunduz comes just a day after canadian defense minister peter mackay became the latest to call for a german combat deployment in an interview with der spiegel magazine .
canadian defense minister questions germany 's commitment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many leaders want german troops deployed in the south mackay said nato allies were not sharing the burden evenly between them and that germany should send its troops to help with combat operations in southern afghanistan instead of confining them to the relatively peaceful north , hinting that he thought germany was not fulfilling its international obligations .
" i understand that troop deployments are very difficult to push through in germany for domestic political reasons , but there are also international commitments that we all have to meet , " mackay said .
canada had lost more than 80 soldiers in operations , mainly in combat operations in kandahar province , he noted .
german losses in afghanistan total 26 troops and three police officers since forces were first sent there more than five years ago .
mackay warned of the dangers of a " two-class " nato and said all member states had to carry their share of the burdens .
germany would profit from a stable afghanistan unable to export terrorism , he said .
" the future of afghanistan lies in nato 's hands .
the taliban and terrorist organizations are like a cancer .

but airbus parent eads did score a lucrative contract with britain 's royal air force . eads had been in talks with bremen-based aeronautics company ohb technology 's mt aerospace unit and us private equity investor cerberus on the sale of three plants employing a total of 6,800 workers at varel and nordenham in northern germany and augsburg in the south . eads had announced in december that mt aerospace was its preferred bidder to acquire plants and as recently as last week denied reports that the negotiations had broken down . according to the airbus statement , ohb had turned out to be the wrong partner and that the parties involved in the negotiations had failed to agree on a " viable industrial and financial solution " . airbus investor search continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus ceo enders was not convinced by ohb 's approach airbus chief executive tom enders said airbus would continue to search for a strong partner prepared to share research and development costs at the plants , adding that , " we simply could not get there with ohb . " " we have always said that we will only go for economically and industrially sound solutions , " enders said in a statement .
" we want to ensure the future of our sites with strong partners who share technology , development costs and capital investments and are able to deliver large work packages at competitive costs . " airbus would search for other solutions and " in parallel , will proceed with the carve-out of the three sites , " the company statement said . breakdown blamed on strong euro bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the delayed roll-out of the a380 cost airbus dearly analysts blamed the breakdown on the declining dollar , noting that the talks had started with the euro at $ 1.35 , against almost $ 1.60 at the current rate .
an ohb statement said that the euro 's strength lowered the prospects for an adequate return on their planned investment in the plants . airbus admitted that the volatility of financial markets and the rise of the euro against the dollar had created obstacles " to an easy and smooth implementation of this process . " the site divestment strategy is part of a vast restructuring plan announced in february last year dubbed power8 , which involves 10,000 job cuts over four years and the sale of six airbus factories .
the major restructuring follows on from severe losses resulting from a two-year delay in delivering the airbus a380 superjumbo . the other sites up for sale are the filton works in britain and the french plants at meaulte and saint nazaire . " there will be no turning back " from efforts to attain the plan 's goals , enders added . eads wins british contract there was , however , some good new for eads on thursday .
the european aerospace consortium won a 13 billion pound -lrb- 16.7 billion euro ; $ 26.5 billion -rrb- deal to replace britain 's fleet of air-to-air refueling planes in what is possibly the world 's largest government outsourcing contract . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads beat out boeing for the pentagon deal in late february the 27-year-contract involves leasing 14 converted airbus passenger jets to the royal air force - marking the first time britain 's private finance initiative has been used for a top military program . " this is an innovative pfi program which will provide the raf with modern highly capable air-to-air refueling and passenger transport capability , " defense equipment and support minister baroness ann taylor told reporters . the deal comes after years of negotiations and on the heels of another deal to supply the us department of defense with refueling planes . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the new under ten fishermen 's association believe skippers with boats under 10m -lrb- 33ft -rrb- long are penalised and want their fish quotas increased .
the group is considering legal action and could even consider port blockades .
defra said it was aware of the current difficulties faced by parts of the fleet and it wanted to work with them to secure a sustainable future .
fisheries minister jonathan shaw has said there is simply not enough quota to go around .
' even distribution ' the association was set up by fisherman dave cuthbert who said he was frustrated after seeing the number of smaller boats decrease by about a 1,000 over recent years , with about 2,500 vessels remaining .
the catch of smaller boats was not subject to quota regulations until two years ago .
they make up about 85 % of the national fleet , but the 2006 eu agreement only allows them 4 % of the national quota .
each of devon and cornwall 's small fishing boats , which operate mainly in the zone from south wales to weymouth , are only allowed to land 50kg -lrb- 110lbs -rrb- of cod and 50kg of dover sole a month .
this sometimes equates to as little as seven or eight cod and about 100 dover sole .
mr cuthbert told bbc news he disagreed with the eu quota system .
" i 've been a fisherman for 29 years and i do n't ' own ' my fish and i do n't think anybody should ' own ' fish , " he said .
" that might be a simplistic view , but it one that 's shared by most under 10m fishermen .
" fish is a national resource and as such it should be treated so and evenly distributed throughout all members of the fishing community . "

defra said it was aware of the current difficulties faced by parts of the fleet and it wanted to work with them to secure a sustainable future .
fisheries minister jonathan shaw has said there is simply not enough quota to go around .
' even distribution ' the association was set up by fisherman dave cuthbert who said he was frustrated after seeing the number of smaller boats decrease by about a 1,000 over recent years , with about 2,500 vessels remaining .
the catch of smaller boats was not subject to quota regulations until two years ago .
they make up about 85 % of the national fleet , but the 2006 eu agreement only allows them 4 % of the national quota .

this sometimes equates to as little as seven or eight cod and about 100 dover sole .
mr cuthbert told bbc news he disagreed with the eu quota system .
" i 've been a fisherman for 29 years and i do n't ' own ' my fish and i do n't think anybody should ' own ' fish , " he said .
" that might be a simplistic view , but it one that 's shared by most under 10m fishermen .

but once elected by the skin of his teeth , albeit with the media behind him -lrb- they liked the look of another young fresh faced politician bidding for political stardom -rrb- , life has been less straightforward .
his 100 days in charge may be a milestone greeted more with relief by mr clegg rather than celebration .
life could have been easier , of course , if he had followed on directly after the fall of sir menzies campbell .
instead the party 's stand-in leader , vince cable , rather swept the political milieu off its feet with witty performances at prime minister 's questions and sure-footedness on key economic issues .
commons walkout since mr clegg took over he has struggled to outshine his older and less hirsute deputy .

the decision to whip mps to abstain on the bill resulted in frontbench resignations , leaving the party - once the most united over the issue of europe - looking the most divided .
the leadership agreed it was a high-risk strategy but obviously thought the alternatives were worse .
there are signs , though , that mr clegg is beginning to emerge from the shadows .
commissions he has been seeking to develop a persona as the anti-politician 's politician .
he declared he would be prepared to face prosecution rather than sign up to an id card .
his recent high-profile support for the campaign by the gurkhas for citizenship is another example that might appeal to the public .
on party policy and reorganisation he has also made an impact with a more free market-style liberalism .
mr clegg has announced commissions on social mobility and party reform .
his upfront commitment to more patient choice in the nhs and a generation of " free schools " was a clear message to the rank and file .
for many grassroots members the jury may still be out .
the local elections will be a test of lib dem resolve , particularly if they lose any of their flagship councils .
but mr clegg has time on his side and a parliamentary party that - after all its recent chopping and changing - really knows this leader should be for keeps .

but once elected by the skin of his teeth , albeit with the media behind him -lrb- they liked the look of another young fresh faced politician bidding for political stardom -rrb- , life has been less straightforward .
his 100 days in charge may be a milestone greeted more with relief by mr clegg rather than celebration .
life could have been easier , of course , if he had followed on directly after the fall of sir menzies campbell .
instead the party 's stand-in leader , vince cable , rather swept the political milieu off its feet with witty performances at prime minister 's questions and sure-footedness on key economic issues .
commons walkout since mr clegg took over he has struggled to outshine his older and less hirsute deputy .
his appearances at the weekly prime minister 's questions sessions have been solid rather than exciting .
nick clegg age : 41 job : lib dem leader family : married , two children education : westminster school , cambridge university before mp : journalist , lecturer and euro mp the nick clegg story sir menzies ' first 100 days the orchestrated lib dem commons walkout over the eu lisbon treaty was widely seen as a gaffe .
the decision to whip mps to abstain on the bill resulted in frontbench resignations , leaving the party - once the most united over the issue of europe - looking the most divided .
the leadership agreed it was a high-risk strategy but obviously thought the alternatives were worse .
there are signs , though , that mr clegg is beginning to emerge from the shadows .
commissions he has been seeking to develop a persona as the anti-politician 's politician .
he declared he would be prepared to face prosecution rather than sign up to an id card .
his recent high-profile support for the campaign by the gurkhas for citizenship is another example that might appeal to the public .
on party policy and reorganisation he has also made an impact with a more free market-style liberalism .
mr clegg has announced commissions on social mobility and party reform .
his upfront commitment to more patient choice in the nhs and a generation of " free schools " was a clear message to the rank and file .
for many grassroots members the jury may still be out .
the local elections will be a test of lib dem resolve , particularly if they lose any of their flagship councils .
but mr clegg has time on his side and a parliamentary party that - after all its recent chopping and changing - really knows this leader should be for keeps .

the east road shelter , which opened in 1995 , currently houses 30 homeless people in dormitories .
the money is coming from the department for communities and local government 's places of change programme .

it will provide a kitchen and meeting rooms , where opportunities will be offered to our guests to engage in activities .
" this will also mean that the very important , and substantial , donations we receive from generous individuals and businesses in our region can work harder for our guests and staff , extending our service to help rebuild the lives of those we support . "

it marks the latest saga is the long-running controversy over the jab .
what is mmr ?
mmr is a combined vaccine against measles , mumps and rubella , three common infectious diseases of childhood .
it was introduced in the uk in 1988 to replace single vaccines for each disease .
it is used in countries throughout the world , with millions of doses delivered each year .
why were people worried about it ?
in 1998 , a study published in the respected journal the lancet raised the possibility that the jab may be linked to autism and bowel disease .
the paper and the media furore that followed it prompted many parents to decide against having their children vaccinated with the three-in-one jab .
mmr research no direct link between mmr and autism yet found in the body studies of vaccinated and unvaccinated children show no difference in autism rates between the two more : mmr research since 1998 some opted to have their children vaccinated using single vaccines for each disease .
however , others decided against having their children vaccinated against these diseases at all .
mumps , measles and rubella are all serious diseases , particularly measles which can be fatal .
many doctors were concerned that a drop in vaccination levels could leave many children at risk .
what do other experts say ?
the uk government and the vast majority of scientists insist that the three-in-one jab is safe .
complications of measles 1 in 2,500-5,000 : death 1 in 100 : hospital admission 1 in 1,000 : meningitis no research has been published to back up claims that it may be linked to autism and bowel disease .
there have been many studies examining the safety of mmr since 1998 .
all have concluded that the three-in-one jab is safe .
last year the lancet , which published the controversial mmr paper in the first place , publicly announced it should never have printed it .
it says the study was flawed and that dr andrew wakefield , the lead author , had a serious conflict of interest .
complications of mumps 1 in 25 : deafness - usually with partial or complete recovery 1 in 30 : pancreatitis hospital admission mumps during pregnancy can cause miscarriage dr wakefield insists he has done nothing wrong and that the science behind his study is still valid .
what is the gmc case about ?
it is easy to forget that the hearing is not about whether mmr is safe .
instead , it is about the professional conduct of dr wakefield and two of his colleagues .
the gmc disciplinary panel will examine whether the doctors failed to get proper ethical approval for their research , and then carried out procedures on children that had not been sanctioned by the ethics committee .
it is also alleged that some of the children who took part did not qualify for the study on the basis of their behavioural symptoms .
the doctors are also accused of failing to tell the lancet how they recruited patients - leading to inaccuracies in the published research - and dr wakefield faces a charge to do with a potential conflict of interest .
dr wakefield denies any wrongdoing .

it is a significant decision amid the long-standing controversy over the jab .
what is mmr ?
mmr is a combined vaccine against measles , mumps and rubella , three common infectious diseases of childhood .
it was introduced in the uk in 1988 to replace single vaccines for each disease .
it is used in countries throughout the world , with millions of doses delivered each year .
why were people worried about it ?
in 1998 , a study published in the respected journal the lancet raised the possibility that the jab may be linked to autism and bowel disease .
the paper and the media furore that followed it prompted many parents to decide against having their children vaccinated with the three-in-one jab .
mmr research no direct link between mmr and autism yet found in the body studies of vaccinated and unvaccinated children show no difference in autism rates between the two more : mmr research since 1998 some opted to have their children vaccinated using single vaccines for each disease .
however , others decided against having their children vaccinated against these diseases at all .
mumps , measles and rubella are all serious diseases , particularly measles which can be fatal .
many doctors were concerned that a drop in vaccination levels could leave many children at risk .
what do other experts say ?
the uk government and the vast majority of scientists insist that the three-in-one jab is safe .
complications of measles 1 in 2,500-5,000 : death 1 in 100 : hospital admission 1 in 1,000 : meningitis no research has been published to back up claims that it may be linked to autism and bowel disease .
there have been many studies examining the safety of mmr since 1998 .
all have concluded that the three-in-one jab is safe .
last year the lancet , which published the controversial mmr paper in the first place , publicly announced it should never have printed it .
it says the study was flawed and that dr andrew wakefield , the lead author , had a serious conflict of interest .
dr wakefield insists he has done nothing wrong and that the science behind his study is still valid .

it is easy to forget that the hearing is not about whether mmr is safe .
instead , it is about the professional conduct of dr wakefield and two of his colleagues .
the gmc disciplinary panel will examine whether the doctors failed to get proper ethical approval for their research , and then carried out procedures on children that had not been sanctioned by the ethics committee .
it is also alleged that some of the children who took part did not qualify for the study on the basis of their behavioural symptoms .
the doctors are also accused of failing to tell the lancet how they recruited patients - leading to inaccuracies in the published research - and dr wakefield faces a charge to do with a potential conflict of interest .
dr wakefield denies any wrongdoing .

it is a significant decision amid the long-standing controversy over the jab .
what is mmr ?
mmr is a combined vaccine against measles , mumps and rubella , three common infectious diseases of childhood .
it was introduced in the uk in 1988 to replace single vaccines for each disease .
it is used in countries throughout the world , with millions of doses delivered each year .
why were people worried about it ?
in 1998 , a study published in the respected journal the lancet raised the possibility that the jab may be linked to autism and bowel disease .
the paper and the media furore that followed it prompted many parents to decide against having their children vaccinated with the three-in-one jab .
mmr research no direct link between mmr and autism yet found in the body studies of vaccinated and unvaccinated children show no difference in autism rates between the two more : mmr research since 1998 some opted to have their children vaccinated using single vaccines for each disease .
however , others decided against having their children vaccinated against these diseases at all .
mumps , measles and rubella are all serious diseases , particularly measles which can be fatal .
many doctors were concerned that a drop in vaccination levels could leave many children at risk .
what do other experts say ?
the uk government and the vast majority of scientists insist that the three-in-one jab is safe .
complications of measles 1 in 2,500-5,000 : death 1 in 100 : hospital admission 1 in 1,000 : meningitis no research has been published to back up claims that it may be linked to autism and bowel disease .
there have been many studies examining the safety of mmr since 1998 .
all have concluded that the three-in-one jab is safe .
last year the lancet , which published the controversial mmr paper in the first place , publicly announced it should never have printed it .
it says the study was flawed and that dr andrew wakefield , the lead author , had a serious conflict of interest .
dr wakefield insists he has done nothing wrong and that the science behind his study is still valid .
what was the general medical council hearing about ?
it is easy to forget that the hearing was not about whether mmr is safe .
instead , it was about the professional conduct of dr wakefield and two of his colleagues .
complications of mumps 1 in 25 : deafness - usually with partial or complete recovery 1 in 30 : pancreatitis hospital admission mumps during pregnancy can cause miscarriage the gmc disciplinary panel examined whether the doctors failed to get proper ethical approval for their research , and then carried out procedures on children that had not been sanctioned by the ethics committee .
the general medical council found dr andrew wakefield guilty of serious professional misconduct over the way he carried out his controversial research .
it follows a gmc ruling earlier this year that he had acted unethically .
dr wakefield , who now lives in the us , denies any wrongdoing .

perhaps the demure figure of his wife sitting behind him had felt the same force .
he was not afraid to come on very strong .
" you represent the touchstone of everything our democracies stand for " was his opening gambit .
it was followed by a hymn of praise to british history and courage .
this always goes down well with a british audience , but it is quite rare to hear it these days .
not on this occasion .
" france will never forget , " he declared , when speaking with emotion about the last war .
he did not mention the iraq war .
he did mention the european union .
" my dear british people , the eu needs the uk , " was his message .
practical politics like a smart suitor , he offered some practical measures as well - a kind of political pre-nup which would follow acceptance of his ardour .
there were also hints that for the new partnership to work , the british half of the couple would have to bring something to the table as well .
it is in the follow up to these offers that the real test of the " brotherhood " he is proposing will come . "
europe must be capable of its own security , not just its own prosperity " nicolas sarkozy they include joint action on global warming , energy -lrb- joint exploitation of french nuclear expertise -rrb- , immigration -lrb- a common eu policy -rrb- , development and defence and security .
he even offered a renewed discussion about reform of the eu 's common agricultural policy - music to british ears - while carefully erecting a new defence against farm imports .
we do n't know enough about whether they are safe , he suggested .
defence splits a key element of his offer lay in defence .
he is trying to integrate an atlantic and a european view , claiming that there is no real distinction between the two .
mr sarkozy hinted that france would send more troops to afghanistan , but is seeking political cover by getting nato to put greater emphasis on reconstruction and handing over eventually to the afghans .
his final position will emerge at the nato summit in romania next week . "
mr brown must have been interested in mr sarkozy 's call for reform of the international institutions " but a commitment by france to send troops would be a strong signal that the new relationship has meaning .
and if france also rejoins the nato military structure -lrb- with some good command posts as a reward -rrb- , that would be a further sign of a promising honeymoon .
in return , he might well ask britain to do more to build up a purely european defence policy .
the french leader said pointedly : " europe must be capable of its own security , not just its own prosperity . "
this might run into the caution of the british prime minister gordon brown who had earlier been asked in the house of commons about the eu / nato issue .
his answer - that the eu should concentrate on civilian-type operations - would probably not be what mr sarkozy wants to hear .
the conservative mp who asked that question , bernard jenkin , told me later that defence was the " iceberg " at this summit .
" the french want the eu to have an independent military capability , with a headquarters at tervuren -lsb- a suburb of brussels -rsb- .
the americans are exasperated .
the eu should not have this .
we already have nato . "
a ' fairer ' globalisation there was further potential for disagreement in the french president 's tempered praise of globalisation .
it turned out that he wanted it to be " fairer and more just " and that it was right for the eu to " protect its own interests " .
mr brown , however , must have been interested in mr sarkozy 's call for reform of the international institutions , especially the g8 grouping of industrial nations .
g8 should include china , india and brazil at least , he hinted .
the speech was a good start to the ' entente amicale ' that mr sarkozy wants .
now comes the test .
