the european aerospace consortium had originally beat out us rival boeing for the deal . the contract was initially won by the northrop grumman-eads partnership but a congressional oversight committee upheld a protest by boeing , effectively forcing the pentagon to reopen the competition bid for the $ 35 billion -lrb- 22 billion euro -rrb- contract , which could yield some $ 100 billion over the next 30 years . the pentagon has formally asked the companies to resubmit proposals to build the 179 kc-x aerial refueling planes .
a final request will take place in mid-august and the companies will be asked to submit their proposals by oct.1.
a final decision on the contract is due in the first week of january 2009 . the government accountability office -lrb- gao -rrb- , an investigative arm of the us congress , ruled in a june 18 report that the air force made critical errors in awarding the contract to northrop and eads . initial tender strewn with errors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boeing gets another chance to put its tankers forward the gao upheld a challenge by boeing , saying it found " significant errors " in the air force 's evaluation of the two bids . it agreed that the air force had conducted " unequal and misleading " discussions with boeing , leading the company to believe it had satisfied a key performance parameter , only to decide later that it had only been partially fulfilled . the gao also found that northrop had been given extra credit for offering an aircraft that carries more fuel than the kc-135 aircraft it is meant to replace , even though the solicitation said no consideration would be given for exceeding the performance parameters . " we 've tried to be meticulous in ensuring that the bidders have a very clear and unambiguous understanding of the relative order of importance of our requirements , " said shay assad , the pentagon director for acquisition . he added that the pentagon will still give " positive consideration " to aircraft that can offload more fuel than the minimum required under the contract . but it will now consider the cost of maintaining the aircraft over a 40-year life cycle , rather than a 25-year lifecycle , he said . assad told reporters that the new request was a modification of the previous one that includes gao 's recommendations . " we are addressing this in a very measured and serious way to ensure that we can execute this procurement in a manner that is fair to both parties , " said assad .
" most of what 's there really addresses the gao finding and that exactly what we are trying to do . " northrop-eads unfazed by gao decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : northrop-eads remain confident about a new tender northrop grumman applauded the pentagon 's decision to keep the contract on a fast track . " we are reviewing the draft request for proposal with an eye toward ensuring that it addresses the issues raised by the gao in a way that facilitates a fair and non-political evaluation of the competing bids , " northrop vice-president randy belote said . boeing has offered to use its 767 as a basis for the refueling aircraft , while northrop-eads is using the larger a330 . us defense secretary robert gates announced in early july that he had accepted gao 's findings and planned to restage the competition in an expedited process , citing the need to quickly replace the air force 's aging fleet of tankers . attempts to find a replacement for its aging tanker fleet have run into setback after setback , beginning with a procurement scandal in 2003 that dashed its plans to lease the aircraft from boeing . boeing has been the air force 's sole supplier of air refueling aircraft , but its grip on the business slipped in february when the air force chose northrop grumman and eads to build the next generation aircraft . both companies have mounted major public relations campaigns touting the manufacturing jobs gained or lost if one bid or the other succeeded . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the un security council is considering further sanctions against tehran as the iaea continues talks . the un atomic watchdog 's number two was in tehran on thursday , aug .
7 , for two days of talks concerning iran 's nuclear program as western governments said the time had come for the security council to impose fresh sanctions . the german government saw as " unsatisfactory " tehran 's response to the offer put forward jointly by the five permanent members of the un security council plus germany in cooperation with the european union , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said on wednesday . " we underlined through this offer that we were striving for a diplomatic solution to the nuclear dispute , " steinmeier said . the major powers were sticking to the dual strategy of offering incentives to tehran while warning that the security council would take up the issue again , he said . on tuesday , iran delivered a message to eu officials in brussels to the effect that the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- could send an inspection team to tehran . an unnamed iranian official confirmed that a message was delivered through iranian ambassador ali-asghar khaji but said the message was not , as initially reported by the local media , a reply to the offer by the world powers . the offer by the five un veto powers - the us , france , britain , russia and china - plus germany is for far-reaching economic cooperation with iran , including in the field of civilian-sector nuclear power , in return for a pledge by tehran to refrain from uranium enrichment activities . specter of further sanctions looms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran remains defiant against international efforts to curtail its nuclear activities on wednesday , the us and britain said the major powers had agreed to consider further security council sanctions against iran after it failed to halt its nuclear activities . but at the united nations , russian ambassador vitaly churkin said there was no definite agreement among the six powers for a fourth round of sanctions against iran , reported the international herald tribune . a european union diplomat told the paper there would not be immediate sanctions and dialogue should continue with the iranians .
" it 's not for tomorrow , " said the diplomat . western governments accuse tehran of using a civil nuclear program to cover up work on creating nuclear weapons .
iran insists its nuclear activities are aimed at generating electricity . however , us officials maintained their warning that iran would face new sanctions if it did not accept the offer of fresh talks and incentives . such sanctions would likely take months to be enacted however , as was the case with previous measures , owing to chinese and russian resistance to the move .

the european aerospace consortium had originally beat out us rival boeing for the deal . the contract was initially won by the northrop grumman-eads partnership but a congressional oversight committee upheld a protest by boeing , effectively forcing the pentagon to reopen the competition bid for the $ 35 billion -lrb- 22 billion euro -rrb- contract , which could yield some $ 100 billion over the next 30 years . the pentagon has formally asked the companies to resubmit proposals to build the 179 kc-x aerial refueling planes .
a final request will take place in mid-august and the companies will be asked to submit their proposals by oct.1.
a final decision on the contract is due in the first week of january 2009 . the government accountability office -lrb- gao -rrb- , an investigative arm of the us congress , ruled in a june 18 report that the air force made critical errors in awarding the contract to northrop and eads . initial tender strewn with errors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boeing gets another chance to put its tankers forward the gao upheld a challenge by boeing , saying it found " significant errors " in the air force 's evaluation of the two bids . it agreed that the air force had conducted " unequal and misleading " discussions with boeing , leading the company to believe it had satisfied a key performance parameter , only to decide later that it had only been partially fulfilled . the gao also found that northrop had been given extra credit for offering an aircraft that carries more fuel than the kc-135 aircraft it is meant to replace , even though the solicitation said no consideration would be given for exceeding the performance parameters . " we 've tried to be meticulous in ensuring that the bidders have a very clear and unambiguous understanding of the relative order of importance of our requirements , " said shay assad , the pentagon director for acquisition . he added that the pentagon will still give " positive consideration " to aircraft that can offload more fuel than the minimum required under the contract . but it will now consider the cost of maintaining the aircraft over a 40-year life cycle , rather than a 25-year lifecycle , he said . assad told reporters that the new request was a modification of the previous one that includes gao 's recommendations . " we are addressing this in a very measured and serious way to ensure that we can execute this procurement in a manner that is fair to both parties , " said assad .
" most of what 's there really addresses the gao finding and that exactly what we are trying to do . " northrop-eads unfazed by gao decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : northrop-eads remain confident about a new tender northrop grumman applauded the pentagon 's decision to keep the contract on a fast track . " we are reviewing the draft request for proposal with an eye toward ensuring that it addresses the issues raised by the gao in a way that facilitates a fair and non-political evaluation of the competing bids , " northrop vice-president randy belote said . boeing has offered to use its 767 as a basis for the refueling aircraft , while northrop-eads is using the larger a330 . us defense secretary robert gates announced in early july that he had accepted gao 's findings and planned to restage the competition in an expedited process , citing the need to quickly replace the air force 's aging fleet of tankers . attempts to find a replacement for its aging tanker fleet have run into setback after setback , beginning with a procurement scandal in 2003 that dashed its plans to lease the aircraft from boeing . boeing has been the air force 's sole supplier of air refueling aircraft , but its grip on the business slipped in february when the air force chose northrop grumman and eads to build the next generation aircraft . both companies have mounted major public relations campaigns touting the manufacturing jobs gained or lost if one bid or the other succeeded . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we made good progress during the first half of the year in achieving our strategic objectives , both in operations and in cost savings , " telekom chief rene obermann said in an attempt to put a positive light on the quarterly numbers . several factors contribute to profit drops but while fierce competition in telekom 's domestic german market led again to a fall in its fixed-line customers , the rise in the euro undercut revenue from the group 's us operations , including its mobile phone business , t-mobile usa , which has been a key driving force behind group profits . the euro hit an all-time high of more than $ 1.60 during the second quarter . revenue from t-mobile usa slipped by 0.8 percent during the first half also amid growing competition in the us mobile phone market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obermann has yet to hit the panic button at the same time , more than 650,000 german households abandoned their deutsche telekom fixed-line connection during the second quarter .

" there 's no way around it , " he said . " the important thing is that we continue to grow with broadband and mobile connections and with innovative value-added services .

the un security council is considering further sanctions against tehran as the iaea continues talks . the un atomic watchdog 's number two was in tehran on thursday , aug .
7 , for two days of talks concerning iran 's nuclear program as western governments said the time had come for the security council to impose fresh sanctions . the german government saw as " unsatisfactory " tehran 's response to the offer put forward jointly by the five permanent members of the un security council plus germany in cooperation with the european union , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said on wednesday . " we underlined through this offer that we were striving for a diplomatic solution to the nuclear dispute , " steinmeier said . the major powers were sticking to the dual strategy of offering incentives to tehran while warning that the security council would take up the issue again , he said . on tuesday , iran delivered a message to eu officials in brussels to the effect that the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- could send an inspection team to tehran . an unnamed iranian official confirmed that a message was delivered through iranian ambassador ali-asghar khaji but said the message was not , as initially reported by the local media , a reply to the offer by the world powers . the offer by the five un veto powers - the us , france , britain , russia and china - plus germany is for far-reaching economic cooperation with iran , including in the field of civilian-sector nuclear power , in return for a pledge by tehran to refrain from uranium enrichment activities . specter of further sanctions looms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran remains defiant against international efforts to curtail its nuclear activities on wednesday , the us and britain said the major powers had agreed to consider further security council sanctions against iran after it failed to halt its nuclear activities . but at the united nations , russian ambassador vitaly churkin said there was no definite agreement among the six powers for a fourth round of sanctions against iran , reported the international herald tribune . a european union diplomat told the paper there would not be immediate sanctions and dialogue should continue with the iranians .
" it 's not for tomorrow , " said the diplomat . western governments accuse tehran of using a civil nuclear program to cover up work on creating nuclear weapons .
iran insists its nuclear activities are aimed at generating electricity . however , us officials maintained their warning that iran would face new sanctions if it did not accept the offer of fresh talks and incentives . such sanctions would likely take months to be enacted however , as was the case with previous measures , owing to chinese and russian resistance to the move .
it remains unclear whether sanctions could be agreed upon before the end of the bush administration 's term in jan .

the european aerospace consortium had originally beat out us rival boeing for the deal . the contract was initially won by the northrop grumman-eads partnership but a congressional oversight committee upheld a protest by boeing , effectively forcing the pentagon to reopen the competition bid for the $ 35 billion -lrb- 22 billion euro -rrb- contract , which could yield some $ 100 billion over the next 30 years . the pentagon has formally asked the companies to resubmit proposals to build the 179 kc-x aerial refueling planes .
a final request will take place in mid-august and the companies will be asked to submit their proposals by oct.1.
a final decision on the contract is due in the first week of january 2009 . the government accountability office -lrb- gao -rrb- , an investigative arm of the us congress , ruled in a june 18 report that the air force made critical errors in awarding the contract to northrop and eads . initial tender strewn with errors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boeing gets another chance to put its tankers forward the gao upheld a challenge by boeing , saying it found " significant errors " in the air force 's evaluation of the two bids . it agreed that the air force had conducted " unequal and misleading " discussions with boeing , leading the company to believe it had satisfied a key performance parameter , only to decide later that it had only been partially fulfilled . the gao also found that northrop had been given extra credit for offering an aircraft that carries more fuel than the kc-135 aircraft it is meant to replace , even though the solicitation said no consideration would be given for exceeding the performance parameters . " we 've tried to be meticulous in ensuring that the bidders have a very clear and unambiguous understanding of the relative order of importance of our requirements , " said shay assad , the pentagon director for acquisition . he added that the pentagon will still give " positive consideration " to aircraft that can offload more fuel than the minimum required under the contract . but it will now consider the cost of maintaining the aircraft over a 40-year life cycle , rather than a 25-year lifecycle , he said . assad told reporters that the new request was a modification of the previous one that includes gao 's recommendations . " we are addressing this in a very measured and serious way to ensure that we can execute this procurement in a manner that is fair to both parties , " said assad .
" most of what 's there really addresses the gao finding and that exactly what we are trying to do . " northrop-eads unfazed by gao decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : northrop-eads remain confident about a new tender northrop grumman applauded the pentagon 's decision to keep the contract on a fast track . " we are reviewing the draft request for proposal with an eye toward ensuring that it addresses the issues raised by the gao in a way that facilitates a fair and non-political evaluation of the competing bids , " northrop vice-president randy belote said . boeing has offered to use its 767 as a basis for the refueling aircraft , while northrop-eads is using the larger a330 . us defense secretary robert gates announced in early july that he had accepted gao 's findings and planned to restage the competition in an expedited process , citing the need to quickly replace the air force 's aging fleet of tankers . attempts to find a replacement for its aging tanker fleet have run into setback after setback , beginning with a procurement scandal in 2003 that dashed its plans to lease the aircraft from boeing . boeing has been the air force 's sole supplier of air refueling aircraft , but its grip on the business slipped in february when the air force chose northrop grumman and eads to build the next generation aircraft . both companies have mounted major public relations campaigns touting the manufacturing jobs gained or lost if one bid or the other succeeded . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now a stasi-themed pub is reopening old wounds in the german capital . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bar is filled with stasi memorabilia an east german flag draped behind the bar and shredded surveillance logs are among the decorations in the firm , located on street in what used to be east berlin where the stasi headquarters was located . on one of the walls there is a porcelain plate bearing the stasi motto referring to protecting " the peasants ' and workers ' state . "
there is also a poster reading , " welcome to the capital of the german democratic republic . " for people who suffered under the former east germany 's ministry of state security the pub is no laughing matter .
one of them is theodor mittrup , a member of the union of victims organizations of communist rule , which has its offices in the former stasi headquarters .
he said playing down the stasi like this is unbelievable . " people who were sent to prison by the stasi and other victims have not received as much attention as the opening of this pub , " he added . a neighborhood watering hole ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bar 's owners say it 's just like any other neighborhood pub the firm is owned by wilfried gau and wolfgang schmelz , who used to work together in a call center .
gau , who grew up in east germany , said the bar is not a joke , it is pure satire . the pub , also known as the conspiratorial haunt , was not intended to glorify the stasi , which was often referred to as the firm by east germans , gau said .
his partner , schmelz , who hails from western germany , sees the pub solely as a business venture and not some sort of stasi hangout . " people from the neighborhood come here for a beer and to chat about soccer or women , ” schmelz said . ostalgia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a large market for nostalgia from the east , or " ostalgia " the pub is located in the suburb of lichtenfeld , where a lot of former stasi employees continue to live .
regulars can apply for an informer 's card that entitles them to a discount . the owners hope the firm will be a magnet for tourists seeking a taste of what life in communist east germany might have been like .
opponents of the bar , however , point out that patrons are free to leave whenever they choose - unlike the citizens of the former east germany . entrepreneurs have come up with several ideas to satisfy the craving for " ostalgia , " the german expression mixing the words ost -lrb- east -rrb- and " nostalgia . " traders sell east german medals and military uniforms at the former cold war crossing point of checkpoint charlie .
a hotel called ostel offers rooms with communist-style furniture and pictures of the former east german leader eric honecker on the wall .

7 , that it booked net profits of 394 million euros -lrb- $ 608 million -rrb- in the latest quarter compared to 604 million euros . this followed a 2.9 percent drop in second-quarter revenue to 15.13 billion euros with a tough round of savings helping to offset the pressure on the group 's earnings . " we made good progress during the first half of the year in achieving our strategic objectives , both in operations and in cost savings , " telekom chief rene obermann said in an attempt to put a positive light on the quarterly numbers . several factors contribute to profit drops but while fierce competition in telekom 's domestic german market led again to a fall in its fixed-line customers , the rise in the euro undercut revenue from the group 's us operations , including its mobile phone business , t-mobile usa , which has been a key driving force behind group profits . the euro hit an all-time high of more than $ 1.60 during the second quarter . revenue from t-mobile usa slipped by 0.8 percent during the first half also amid growing competition in the us mobile phone market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obermann has yet to hit the panic button at the same time , more than 650,000 german households abandoned their deutsche telekom fixed-line connection during the second quarter .
this mass exodus followed the some 120,000 fixed-line customers who left the company throughout this year 's first-quarter . obermann told deutsche welle in an interview earlier this year that such losses were to be expected in 2008 . " there 's no way around it , " he said . " the important thing is that we continue to grow with broadband and mobile connections and with innovative value-added services . " however , the company 's broadband and fixed-line unit posted a 6.4 percent drop in revenue to 5.3 billion euros in the quarter . telekom said group quarterly adjusted earnings before interest , tax , depreciation and amortization -lrb- ebitda -rrb- dropped by 1.1 percent to 4.85 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.5 billion -rrb- . however , it remained on course to hit its full-year ebitda target of about 19.3 billion euros . dpa news agency -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the un security council is considering further sanctions against tehran as the iaea continues talks . the un atomic watchdog 's number two was in tehran on thursday , aug .
7 , for two days of talks concerning iran 's nuclear program as western governments said the time had come for the security council to impose fresh sanctions . the german government saw as " unsatisfactory " tehran 's response to the offer put forward jointly by the five permanent members of the un security council plus germany in cooperation with the european union , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said on wednesday . " we underlined through this offer that we were striving for a diplomatic solution to the nuclear dispute , " steinmeier said . the major powers were sticking to the dual strategy of offering incentives to tehran while warning that the security council would take up the issue again , he said . on tuesday , iran delivered a message to eu officials in brussels to the effect that the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- could send an inspection team to tehran . an unnamed iranian official confirmed that a message was delivered through iranian ambassador ali-asghar khaji but said the message was not , as initially reported by the local media , a reply to the offer by the world powers . the offer by the five un veto powers - the us , france , britain , russia and china - plus germany is for far-reaching economic cooperation with iran , including in the field of civilian-sector nuclear power , in return for a pledge by tehran to refrain from uranium enrichment activities . specter of further sanctions looms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran remains defiant against international efforts to curtail its nuclear activities on wednesday , the us and britain said the major powers had agreed to consider further security council sanctions against iran after it failed to halt its nuclear activities . but at the united nations , russian ambassador vitaly churkin said there was no definite agreement among the six powers for a fourth round of sanctions against iran , reported the international herald tribune . a european union diplomat told the paper there would not be immediate sanctions and dialogue should continue with the iranians .
" it 's not for tomorrow , " said the diplomat . western governments accuse tehran of using a civil nuclear program to cover up work on creating nuclear weapons .
iran insists its nuclear activities are aimed at generating electricity . however , us officials maintained their warning that iran would face new sanctions if it did not accept the offer of fresh talks and incentives . such sanctions would likely take months to be enacted however , as was the case with previous measures , owing to chinese and russian resistance to the move .
it remains unclear whether sanctions could be agreed upon before the end of the bush administration 's term in jan .
2009 . " i am not going to guess how long this will take and where it may ultimately lead , " us state department spokesman gonzalo gallegos told the iht . dpa news agency -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the european aerospace consortium had originally beat out us rival boeing for the deal . the contract was initially won by the northrop grumman-eads partnership but a congressional oversight committee upheld a protest by boeing , effectively forcing the pentagon to reopen the competition bid for the $ 35 billion -lrb- 22 billion euro -rrb- contract , which could yield some $ 100 billion over the next 30 years . the pentagon has formally asked the companies to resubmit proposals to build the 179 kc-x aerial refueling planes .
a final request will take place in mid-august and the companies will be asked to submit their proposals by oct.1.
a final decision on the contract is due in the first week of january 2009 . the government accountability office -lrb- gao -rrb- , an investigative arm of the us congress , ruled in a june 18 report that the air force made critical errors in awarding the contract to northrop and eads . initial tender strewn with errors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boeing gets another chance to put its tankers forward the gao upheld a challenge by boeing , saying it found " significant errors " in the air force 's evaluation of the two bids . it agreed that the air force had conducted " unequal and misleading " discussions with boeing , leading the company to believe it had satisfied a key performance parameter , only to decide later that it had only been partially fulfilled . the gao also found that northrop had been given extra credit for offering an aircraft that carries more fuel than the kc-135 aircraft it is meant to replace , even though the solicitation said no consideration would be given for exceeding the performance parameters . " we 've tried to be meticulous in ensuring that the bidders have a very clear and unambiguous understanding of the relative order of importance of our requirements , " said shay assad , the pentagon director for acquisition . he added that the pentagon will still give " positive consideration " to aircraft that can offload more fuel than the minimum required under the contract . but it will now consider the cost of maintaining the aircraft over a 40-year life cycle , rather than a 25-year lifecycle , he said . assad told reporters that the new request was a modification of the previous one that includes gao 's recommendations . " we are addressing this in a very measured and serious way to ensure that we can execute this procurement in a manner that is fair to both parties , " said assad .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 07.08.2008 opinion : germany should talk openly about afghanistan mission großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's nina werkhaeuser says germany needs to do a better job explaining to its citizens that the mission in afghanistan is going to get worse before it gets better . when members of the federal government speak about the german mission in afghanistan , they like to tell moving stories of help and appreciation . recently german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier spoke to the german parliament about village elders in the pamir mountains .
the men undertook a trip lasting for days , steinmeier recounted , in order to ask german soldiers to help build a school . the choice of this story is very revealing .
it leads to the question of why heavily armed foreign soldiers are still needed to fulfill basic needs in afghanistan .
schools should be seen to by the afghan government , the provincial governor , or aid organizations - not nato .
the soliders of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- are there for security and stability though they can neither produce it , nor permanently guarantee it ; certainly not in the south , and only occasionally in the north . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government has been trying to pull the wool over the public ’ s eyes by only talking about the nice things that happen .
but that only works until one afghan asks a german soldier to help build a school , while another afghan attacks him with explosives . so who is a friend and who is a foe ?
it 's difficult to differentiate between the two in a mission where the military is so utterly dependent on the trust of the local population . if that trust is lost then the success stories about reconstruction quickly become passé .
soon it may just be about preventing a backslide into chaos with brute force . this fall the german government will increase the number of troops in afghanistan by 1,000 because they aren ’ t able to get by with the 3,500 soldiers stationed in northern afghanistan .
german soldiers have for years camped in the relatively calm north of the country to avoid nato 's increasing demands . these days the north isn ’ t exactly a safe model region .
even there the german army has to increasingly deal with rockets flying through the air , hidden explosives and suicide bombers around every corner . under these circumstances the german government 's reconstruction rhetoric just does n't work anymore . a lot suggests that the next american president - whoever that may be - will be blunt with european allies . he will demand more troops for afghanistan in order to once and for all destroy the taliban , who are also known to have carried out attacks on the german military . given the explosive nature of the afghanistan debate , the german government has given itself a kind of grace period : this fall they will extend the mission by 14 months instead of 12 , so that it won ’ t be a controversial issue during the 2009 parliamentary elections . however , they shouldn ’ t delude themselves into thinking that until then they will be able to peddle stories of freshly dug wells and happy school children . the entire isaf force , including german troops , are in the middle of a combat mission which will get more difficult as the months go by .
it would be better to finally talk openly about it . nina werkhäuser covers foreign , defense and security policy affairs for dw-radio . -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de german minister says afghan security worse , promises support german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said saturday , july 26 , that violence in afghanistan had worsened this year and promised more german support for the building and reform of the afghan police and military .
-lrb- 26.07.2008 -rrb- germany takes over quick reaction force in afghanistan the german army took over a rapid reaction force in northern afghanistan on monday , june 30 marking the first time the country has provided a combat unit for the nato-led international peacekeeping force .

now a stasi-themed pub is reopening old wounds in the german capital . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bar is filled with stasi memorabilia an east german flag draped behind the bar and shredded surveillance logs are among the decorations in the firm , located on street in what used to be east berlin where the stasi headquarters was located . on one of the walls there is a porcelain plate bearing the stasi motto referring to protecting " the peasants ' and workers ' state . "
there is also a poster reading , " welcome to the capital of the german democratic republic . " for people who suffered under the former east germany 's ministry of state security the pub is no laughing matter .
one of them is theodor mittrup , a member of the union of victims organizations of communist rule , which has its offices in the former stasi headquarters .
he said playing down the stasi like this is unbelievable . " people who were sent to prison by the stasi and other victims have not received as much attention as the opening of this pub , " he added . a neighborhood watering hole ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bar 's owners say it 's just like any other neighborhood pub the firm is owned by wilfried gau and wolfgang schmelz , who used to work together in a call center .
gau , who grew up in east germany , said the bar is not a joke , it is pure satire . the pub , also known as the conspiratorial haunt , was not intended to glorify the stasi , which was often referred to as the firm by east germans , gau said .
his partner , schmelz , who hails from western germany , sees the pub solely as a business venture and not some sort of stasi hangout . " people from the neighborhood come here for a beer and to chat about soccer or women , ” schmelz said . ostalgia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a large market for nostalgia from the east , or " ostalgia " the pub is located in the suburb of lichtenfeld , where a lot of former stasi employees continue to live .
regulars can apply for an informer 's card that entitles them to a discount . the owners hope the firm will be a magnet for tourists seeking a taste of what life in communist east germany might have been like .
opponents of the bar , however , point out that patrons are free to leave whenever they choose - unlike the citizens of the former east germany . entrepreneurs have come up with several ideas to satisfy the craving for " ostalgia , " the german expression mixing the words ost -lrb- east -rrb- and " nostalgia . " traders sell east german medals and military uniforms at the former cold war crossing point of checkpoint charlie .
a hotel called ostel offers rooms with communist-style furniture and pictures of the former east german leader eric honecker on the wall .

the protest was one of a series of events planned in several european cities on the eve of the prestigious olympic games to draw world attention to china 's continuing human rights violations .
protests were planned in lisbon and in porto in portugal , candle vigils were planned in several swiss cities and one in norway , while in london the free tibet campaign was to hold a protest in front of the chinese embassy on friday .

the media watchdog has challenged the ruling in court , with a decision due friday at 10:30 am , afp reported .
rsf head robert menard voiced outrage at the demo ban , saying similar rallies were allowed to go ahead in six other european countries .
" does this mean that it is the chinese embassy that decides who has the right to demonstrate in paris ? " he asked .

“ these aren ’ t the games of openness and friendship , but rather the games of repression , ” he said , adding that china was a ruled by a totalitarian regime that committed human rights abuses . china has painted the games as a celebration of three decades of economic reforms and hopes the event will showcase a rapidly modernizing country . more than 1,000 tibetans missing , groups say some 100 participants took park in the demonstration in berlin which couldn ’ t take place directly at the embassy due to police barriers .

7 , that it booked net profits of 394 million euros -lrb- $ 608 million -rrb- in the latest quarter compared to 604 million euros . this followed a 2.9 percent drop in second-quarter revenue to 15.13 billion euros with a tough round of savings helping to offset the pressure on the group 's earnings . " we made good progress during the first half of the year in achieving our strategic objectives , both in operations and in cost savings , " telekom chief rene obermann said in an attempt to put a positive light on the quarterly numbers . several factors contribute to profit drops but while fierce competition in telekom 's domestic german market led again to a fall in its fixed-line customers , the rise in the euro undercut revenue from the group 's us operations , including its mobile phone business , t-mobile usa , which has been a key driving force behind group profits . the euro hit an all-time high of more than $ 1.60 during the second quarter . revenue from t-mobile usa slipped by 0.8 percent during the first half also amid growing competition in the us mobile phone market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obermann has yet to hit the panic button at the same time , more than 650,000 german households abandoned their deutsche telekom fixed-line connection during the second quarter .
this mass exodus followed the some 120,000 fixed-line customers who left the company throughout this year 's first-quarter . obermann told deutsche welle in an interview earlier this year that such losses were to be expected in 2008 . " there 's no way around it , " he said . " the important thing is that we continue to grow with broadband and mobile connections and with innovative value-added services . " however , the company 's broadband and fixed-line unit posted a 6.4 percent drop in revenue to 5.3 billion euros in the quarter . telekom said group quarterly adjusted earnings before interest , tax , depreciation and amortization -lrb- ebitda -rrb- dropped by 1.1 percent to 4.85 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.5 billion -rrb- . however , it remained on course to hit its full-year ebitda target of about 19.3 billion euros . dpa news agency -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the un security council is considering further sanctions against tehran as the iaea continues talks . the un atomic watchdog 's number two was in tehran on thursday , aug .
7 , for two days of talks concerning iran 's nuclear program as western governments said the time had come for the security council to impose fresh sanctions . the german government saw as " unsatisfactory " tehran 's response to the offer put forward jointly by the five permanent members of the un security council plus germany in cooperation with the european union , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said on wednesday . " we underlined through this offer that we were striving for a diplomatic solution to the nuclear dispute , " steinmeier said . the major powers were sticking to the dual strategy of offering incentives to tehran while warning that the security council would take up the issue again , he said . on tuesday , iran delivered a message to eu officials in brussels to the effect that the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- could send an inspection team to tehran . an unnamed iranian official confirmed that a message was delivered through iranian ambassador ali-asghar khaji but said the message was not , as initially reported by the local media , a reply to the offer by the world powers . the offer by the five un veto powers - the us , france , britain , russia and china - plus germany is for far-reaching economic cooperation with iran , including in the field of civilian-sector nuclear power , in return for a pledge by tehran to refrain from uranium enrichment activities . specter of further sanctions looms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran remains defiant against international efforts to curtail its nuclear activities on wednesday , the us and britain said the major powers had agreed to consider further security council sanctions against iran after it failed to halt its nuclear activities . but at the united nations , russian ambassador vitaly churkin said there was no definite agreement among the six powers for a fourth round of sanctions against iran , reported the international herald tribune . a european union diplomat told the paper there would not be immediate sanctions and dialogue should continue with the iranians .
" it 's not for tomorrow , " said the diplomat . western governments accuse tehran of using a civil nuclear program to cover up work on creating nuclear weapons .
iran insists its nuclear activities are aimed at generating electricity . however , us officials maintained their warning that iran would face new sanctions if it did not accept the offer of fresh talks and incentives . such sanctions would likely take months to be enacted however , as was the case with previous measures , owing to chinese and russian resistance to the move .
it remains unclear whether sanctions could be agreed upon before the end of the bush administration 's term in jan .

the european aerospace consortium had originally beat out us rival boeing for the deal . the contract was initially won by the northrop grumman-eads partnership but a congressional oversight committee upheld a protest by boeing , effectively forcing the pentagon to reopen the competition bid for the $ 35 billion -lrb- 22 billion euro -rrb- contract , which could yield some $ 100 billion over the next 30 years . the pentagon has formally asked the companies to resubmit proposals to build the 179 kc-x aerial refueling planes .
a final request will take place in mid-august and the companies will be asked to submit their proposals by oct.1.
a final decision on the contract is due in the first week of january 2009 . the government accountability office -lrb- gao -rrb- , an investigative arm of the us congress , ruled in a june 18 report that the air force made critical errors in awarding the contract to northrop and eads . initial tender strewn with errors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boeing gets another chance to put its tankers forward the gao upheld a challenge by boeing , saying it found " significant errors " in the air force 's evaluation of the two bids . it agreed that the air force had conducted " unequal and misleading " discussions with boeing , leading the company to believe it had satisfied a key performance parameter , only to decide later that it had only been partially fulfilled . the gao also found that northrop had been given extra credit for offering an aircraft that carries more fuel than the kc-135 aircraft it is meant to replace , even though the solicitation said no consideration would be given for exceeding the performance parameters . " we 've tried to be meticulous in ensuring that the bidders have a very clear and unambiguous understanding of the relative order of importance of our requirements , " said shay assad , the pentagon director for acquisition . he added that the pentagon will still give " positive consideration " to aircraft that can offload more fuel than the minimum required under the contract . but it will now consider the cost of maintaining the aircraft over a 40-year life cycle , rather than a 25-year lifecycle , he said . assad told reporters that the new request was a modification of the previous one that includes gao 's recommendations . " we are addressing this in a very measured and serious way to ensure that we can execute this procurement in a manner that is fair to both parties , " said assad .
" most of what 's there really addresses the gao finding and that exactly what we are trying to do . " northrop-eads unfazed by gao decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : northrop-eads remain confident about a new tender northrop grumman applauded the pentagon 's decision to keep the contract on a fast track . " we are reviewing the draft request for proposal with an eye toward ensuring that it addresses the issues raised by the gao in a way that facilitates a fair and non-political evaluation of the competing bids , " northrop vice-president randy belote said . boeing has offered to use its 767 as a basis for the refueling aircraft , while northrop-eads is using the larger a330 . us defense secretary robert gates announced in early july that he had accepted gao 's findings and planned to restage the competition in an expedited process , citing the need to quickly replace the air force 's aging fleet of tankers . attempts to find a replacement for its aging tanker fleet have run into setback after setback , beginning with a procurement scandal in 2003 that dashed its plans to lease the aircraft from boeing . boeing has been the air force 's sole supplier of air refueling aircraft , but its grip on the business slipped in february when the air force chose northrop grumman and eads to build the next generation aircraft . both companies have mounted major public relations campaigns touting the manufacturing jobs gained or lost if one bid or the other succeeded . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" people from the neighborhood come here for a beer and to chat about soccer or women , ” schmelz said . ostalgia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a large market for nostalgia from the east , or " ostalgia " the pub is located in the suburb of lichtenfeld , where a lot of former stasi employees continue to live .
regulars can apply for an informer 's card that entitles them to a discount . the owners hope the firm will be a magnet for tourists seeking a taste of what life in communist east germany might have been like .
opponents of the bar , however , point out that patrons are free to leave whenever they choose - unlike the citizens of the former east germany . entrepreneurs have come up with several ideas to satisfy the craving for " ostalgia , " the german expression mixing the words ost -lrb- east -rrb- and " nostalgia . " traders sell east german medals and military uniforms at the former cold war crossing point of checkpoint charlie .

export posted an annual 7.9 percent rise in june . orders to countries outside the european union rose by an annual 12 percent with demand from nations in asia , the middle east and eastern europe helping to offset slowdown taking shape in the us and other parts of europe , such as britain and spain . german exports to its partners in the 15-member eurozone rose by an annual 4.7 percent in june and by 5.9 percent to the 27 members of the european union .
however , thursday 's data also showed the country 's imports slipped by a surprise 0.1 percent month on month in june . what ’ s more , the 0.2 percent price-and-seasonally adjusted rise in june after production was less than the 0.8 percent forecast by analysts with factory orders dropping by 2.9 percent . dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we made good progress during the first half of the year in achieving our strategic objectives , both in operations and in cost savings , " telekom chief rene obermann said in an attempt to put a positive light on the quarterly numbers . several factors contribute to profit drops but while fierce competition in telekom 's domestic german market led again to a fall in its fixed-line customers , the rise in the euro undercut revenue from the group 's us operations , including its mobile phone business , t-mobile usa , which has been a key driving force behind group profits . the euro hit an all-time high of more than $ 1.60 during the second quarter . revenue from t-mobile usa slipped by 0.8 percent during the first half also amid growing competition in the us mobile phone market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obermann has yet to hit the panic button at the same time , more than 650,000 german households abandoned their deutsche telekom fixed-line connection during the second quarter .
this mass exodus followed the some 120,000 fixed-line customers who left the company throughout this year 's first-quarter . obermann told deutsche welle in an interview earlier this year that such losses were to be expected in 2008 . " there 's no way around it , " he said . " the important thing is that we continue to grow with broadband and mobile connections and with innovative value-added services . " however , the company 's broadband and fixed-line unit posted a 6.4 percent drop in revenue to 5.3 billion euros in the quarter . telekom said group quarterly adjusted earnings before interest , tax , depreciation and amortization -lrb- ebitda -rrb- dropped by 1.1 percent to 4.85 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.5 billion -rrb- . however , it remained on course to hit its full-year ebitda target of about 19.3 billion euros . dpa news agency -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the european aerospace consortium had originally beat out us rival boeing for the deal . the contract was initially won by the northrop grumman-eads partnership but a congressional oversight committee upheld a protest by boeing , effectively forcing the pentagon to reopen the competition bid for the $ 35 billion -lrb- 22 billion euro -rrb- contract , which could yield some $ 100 billion over the next 30 years . the pentagon has formally asked the companies to resubmit proposals to build the 179 kc-x aerial refueling planes .
a final request will take place in mid-august and the companies will be asked to submit their proposals by oct.1.
a final decision on the contract is due in the first week of january 2009 . the government accountability office -lrb- gao -rrb- , an investigative arm of the us congress , ruled in a june 18 report that the air force made critical errors in awarding the contract to northrop and eads . initial tender strewn with errors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boeing gets another chance to put its tankers forward the gao upheld a challenge by boeing , saying it found " significant errors " in the air force 's evaluation of the two bids . it agreed that the air force had conducted " unequal and misleading " discussions with boeing , leading the company to believe it had satisfied a key performance parameter , only to decide later that it had only been partially fulfilled . the gao also found that northrop had been given extra credit for offering an aircraft that carries more fuel than the kc-135 aircraft it is meant to replace , even though the solicitation said no consideration would be given for exceeding the performance parameters . " we 've tried to be meticulous in ensuring that the bidders have a very clear and unambiguous understanding of the relative order of importance of our requirements , " said shay assad , the pentagon director for acquisition . he added that the pentagon will still give " positive consideration " to aircraft that can offload more fuel than the minimum required under the contract . but it will now consider the cost of maintaining the aircraft over a 40-year life cycle , rather than a 25-year lifecycle , he said . assad told reporters that the new request was a modification of the previous one that includes gao 's recommendations . " we are addressing this in a very measured and serious way to ensure that we can execute this procurement in a manner that is fair to both parties , " said assad .
" most of what 's there really addresses the gao finding and that exactly what we are trying to do . " northrop-eads unfazed by gao decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : northrop-eads remain confident about a new tender northrop grumman applauded the pentagon 's decision to keep the contract on a fast track . " we are reviewing the draft request for proposal with an eye toward ensuring that it addresses the issues raised by the gao in a way that facilitates a fair and non-political evaluation of the competing bids , " northrop vice-president randy belote said . boeing has offered to use its 767 as a basis for the refueling aircraft , while northrop-eads is using the larger a330 . us defense secretary robert gates announced in early july that he had accepted gao 's findings and planned to restage the competition in an expedited process , citing the need to quickly replace the air force 's aging fleet of tankers . attempts to find a replacement for its aging tanker fleet have run into setback after setback , beginning with a procurement scandal in 2003 that dashed its plans to lease the aircraft from boeing . boeing has been the air force 's sole supplier of air refueling aircraft , but its grip on the business slipped in february when the air force chose northrop grumman and eads to build the next generation aircraft . both companies have mounted major public relations campaigns touting the manufacturing jobs gained or lost if one bid or the other succeeded . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

“ these aren ’ t the games of openness and friendship , but rather the games of repression , ” he said , adding that china was a ruled by a totalitarian regime that committed human rights abuses . china has painted the games as a celebration of three decades of economic reforms and hopes the event will showcase a rapidly modernizing country . more than 1,000 tibetans missing , groups say some 100 participants took park in the demonstration in berlin which couldn ’ t take place directly at the embassy due to police barriers .
they held up banners with chinese characters written on them , expressing their hope for improvement of human rights . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors in berlin wanted to highlight the mass arrests and persecution of tibetan groups , uighurs and falun gong members the protestors also took lit torches , emblazoned with the olympic rings , and put them out in giant tubs of water .
with this symbolic gesture , the demonstrators wanted to make clear that beijing has failed to honor the promises made leading up to the games to better human rights in the country . according to human rights organizations , more than 1,000 tibetan were taken into custody during the unrest and mass arrests in march 2008 and are still missing . more than 1,500 uighurs have been arrested in recent weeks for political reasons , and members of the falun gong sects have been victims of torture and murder .
3,160 of them have meet grisly deaths while in the custody of the security forces , they say . germany-wide " protestival " pro-tibet groups are planning to hold germany-wide demonstrations in order to call attention to the constant violations of human rights in china . over the next 17 days , some 50 campaigns are planned to take place in 30 different cities , including berlin , munich and frankfurt . one group of tibet activists plan to hold a “ protestival ” at berlin ’ s landmark brandenburg gate to call attention to the “ ongoing bad human rights situation ” in the chinese-controlled province . germany 's human rights commissioner , guenter nooke who has been in the chinese capital since tuesday , said on thursday that the decision to let beijing host the games has failed to improve the human rights situation in the country . planning for the games has improved the mood of the city and brought new construction but the ruling party still tolerates no criticism or press freedoms , nooke told news agency ap . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the men undertook a trip lasting for days , steinmeier recounted , in order to ask german soldiers to help build a school . the choice of this story is very revealing .
it leads to the question of why heavily armed foreign soldiers are still needed to fulfill basic needs in afghanistan .
schools should be seen to by the afghan government , the provincial governor , or aid organizations - not nato .
the soliders of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- are there for security and stability though they can neither produce it , nor permanently guarantee it ; certainly not in the south , and only occasionally in the north . # b # the government has been trying to pull the wool over the public ’ s eyes by only talking about the nice things that happen .
but that only works until one afghan asks a german soldier to help build a school , while another afghan attacks him with explosives . so who is a friend and who is a foe ?
it 's difficult to differentiate between the two in a mission where the military is so utterly dependent on the trust of the local population . if that trust is lost then the success stories about reconstruction quickly become passé .
soon it may just be about preventing a backslide into chaos with brute force . this fall the german government will increase the number of troops in afghanistan by 1,000 because they aren ’ t able to get by with the 3,500 soldiers stationed in northern afghanistan .
german soldiers have for years camped in the relatively calm north of the country to avoid nato 's increasing demands . these days the north isn ’ t exactly a safe model region .
even there the german army has to increasingly deal with rockets flying through the air , hidden explosives and suicide bombers around every corner . under these circumstances the german government 's reconstruction rhetoric just does n't work anymore . a lot suggests that the next american president - whoever that may be - will be blunt with european allies . he will demand more troops for afghanistan in order to once and for all destroy the taliban , who are also known to have carried out attacks on the german military . given the explosive nature of the afghanistan debate , the german government has given itself a kind of grace period : this fall they will extend the mission by 14 months instead of 12 , so that it won ’ t be a controversial issue during the 2009 parliamentary elections . however , they shouldn ’ t delude themselves into thinking that until then they will be able to peddle stories of freshly dug wells and happy school children . the entire isaf force , including german troops , are in the middle of a combat mission which will get more difficult as the months go by .
it would be better to finally talk openly about it . nina werkhäuser covers foreign , defense and security policy affairs for dw-radio . -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

7 , that it booked net profits of 394 million euros -lrb- $ 608 million -rrb- in the latest quarter compared to 604 million euros . this followed a 2.9 percent drop in second-quarter revenue to 15.13 billion euros with a tough round of savings helping to offset the pressure on the group 's earnings . " we made good progress during the first half of the year in achieving our strategic objectives , both in operations and in cost savings , " telekom chief rene obermann said in an attempt to put a positive light on the quarterly numbers . several factors contribute to profit drops but while fierce competition in telekom 's domestic german market led again to a fall in its fixed-line customers , the rise in the euro undercut revenue from the group 's us operations , including its mobile phone business , t-mobile usa , which has been a key driving force behind group profits . the euro hit an all-time high of more than $ 1.60 during the second quarter . revenue from t-mobile usa slipped by 0.8 percent during the first half also amid growing competition in the us mobile phone market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obermann has yet to hit the panic button at the same time , more than 650,000 german households abandoned their deutsche telekom fixed-line connection during the second quarter .
this mass exodus followed the some 120,000 fixed-line customers who left the company throughout this year 's first-quarter . obermann told deutsche welle in an interview earlier this year that such losses were to be expected in 2008 . " there 's no way around it , " he said . " the important thing is that we continue to grow with broadband and mobile connections and with innovative value-added services . " however , the company 's broadband and fixed-line unit posted a 6.4 percent drop in revenue to 5.3 billion euros in the quarter . telekom said group quarterly adjusted earnings before interest , tax , depreciation and amortization -lrb- ebitda -rrb- dropped by 1.1 percent to 4.85 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.5 billion -rrb- . however , it remained on course to hit its full-year ebitda target of about 19.3 billion euros . dpa news agency -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

7 , that it booked net profits of 394 million euros -lrb- $ 608 million -rrb- in the latest quarter compared to 604 million euros . this followed a 2.9 percent drop in second-quarter revenue to 15.13 billion euros with a tough round of savings helping to offset the pressure on the group 's earnings . " we made good progress during the first half of the year in achieving our strategic objectives , both in operations and in cost savings , " telekom chief rene obermann said in an attempt to put a positive light on the quarterly numbers . several factors contribute to profit drops but while fierce competition in telekom 's domestic german market led again to a fall in its fixed-line customers , the rise in the euro undercut revenue from the group 's us operations , including its mobile phone business , t-mobile usa , which has been a key driving force behind group profits . the euro hit an all-time high of more than $ 1.60 during the second quarter . revenue from t-mobile usa slipped by 0.8 percent during the first half also amid growing competition in the us mobile phone market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obermann has yet to hit the panic button at the same time , more than 650,000 german households abandoned their deutsche telekom fixed-line connection during the second quarter .
this mass exodus followed the some 120,000 fixed-line customers who left the company throughout this year 's first-quarter . obermann told deutsche welle in an interview earlier this year that such losses were to be expected in 2008 . " there 's no way around it , " he said . " the important thing is that we continue to grow with broadband and mobile connections and with innovative value-added services . " however , the company 's broadband and fixed-line unit posted a 6.4 percent drop in revenue to 5.3 billion euros in the quarter . telekom said group quarterly adjusted earnings before interest , tax , depreciation and amortization -lrb- ebitda -rrb- dropped by 1.1 percent to 4.85 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.5 billion -rrb- . however , it remained on course to hit its full-year ebitda target of about 19.3 billion euros . dpa news agency -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

“ these aren ’ t the games of openness and friendship , but rather the games of repression , ” he said , adding that china was a ruled by a totalitarian regime that committed human rights abuses . china has painted the games as a celebration of three decades of economic reforms and hopes the event will showcase a rapidly modernizing country . more than 1,000 tibetans missing , groups say some 100 participants took park in the demonstration in berlin which couldn ’ t take place directly at the embassy due to police barriers .

" we underlined through this offer that we were striving for a diplomatic solution to the nuclear dispute , " steinmeier said . the major powers were sticking to the dual strategy of offering incentives to tehran while warning that the security council would take up the issue again , he said . on tuesday , iran delivered a message to eu officials in brussels to the effect that the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- could send an inspection team to tehran . an unnamed iranian official confirmed that a message was delivered through iranian ambassador ali-asghar khaji but said the message was not , as initially reported by the local media , a reply to the offer by the world powers . the offer by the five un veto powers - the us , france , britain , russia and china - plus germany is for far-reaching economic cooperation with iran , including in the field of civilian-sector nuclear power , in return for a pledge by tehran to refrain from uranium enrichment activities . specter of further sanctions looms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran remains defiant against international efforts to curtail its nuclear activities on wednesday , the us and britain said the major powers had agreed to consider further security council sanctions against iran after it failed to halt its nuclear activities . but at the united nations , russian ambassador vitaly churkin said there was no definite agreement among the six powers for a fourth round of sanctions against iran , reported the international herald tribune . a european union diplomat told the paper there would not be immediate sanctions and dialogue should continue with the iranians .
" it 's not for tomorrow , " said the diplomat . western governments accuse tehran of using a civil nuclear program to cover up work on creating nuclear weapons .
iran insists its nuclear activities are aimed at generating electricity . however , us officials maintained their warning that iran would face new sanctions if it did not accept the offer of fresh talks and incentives . such sanctions would likely take months to be enacted however , as was the case with previous measures , owing to chinese and russian resistance to the move .
it remains unclear whether sanctions could be agreed upon before the end of the bush administration 's term in jan .
2009 . " i am not going to guess how long this will take and where it may ultimately lead , " us state department spokesman gonzalo gallegos told the iht . dpa news agency -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the protest was one of a series of events planned in several european cities on the eve of the prestigious olympic games to draw world attention to china 's continuing human rights violations .
protests were planned in lisbon and in porto in portugal , candle vigils were planned in several swiss cities and one in norway , while in london the free tibet campaign was to hold a protest in front of the chinese embassy on friday .
france bans protests outside chinese embassy in paris , authorities banned rights groups from demonstrating outside the chinese embassy on thursday and friday .

the media watchdog has challenged the ruling in court , with a decision due friday at 10:30 am , afp reported .
rsf head robert menard voiced outrage at the demo ban , saying similar rallies were allowed to go ahead in six other european countries .
" does this mean that it is the chinese embassy that decides who has the right to demonstrate in paris ? " he asked .

“ these aren ’ t the games of openness and friendship , but rather the games of repression , ” he said , adding that china was a ruled by a totalitarian regime that committed human rights abuses . china has painted the games as a celebration of three decades of economic reforms and hopes the event will showcase a rapidly modernizing country . more than 1,000 tibetans missing , groups say some 100 participants took park in the demonstration in berlin which couldn ’ t take place directly at the embassy due to police barriers .

the european aerospace consortium had originally beat out us rival boeing for the deal . the contract was initially won by the northrop grumman-eads partnership but a congressional oversight committee upheld a protest by boeing , effectively forcing the pentagon to reopen the competition bid for the $ 35 billion -lrb- 22 billion euro -rrb- contract , which could yield some $ 100 billion over the next 30 years . the pentagon has formally asked the companies to resubmit proposals to build the 179 kc-x aerial refueling planes .
a final request will take place in mid-august and the companies will be asked to submit their proposals by oct.1.
a final decision on the contract is due in the first week of january 2009 . the government accountability office -lrb- gao -rrb- , an investigative arm of the us congress , ruled in a june 18 report that the air force made critical errors in awarding the contract to northrop and eads . initial tender strewn with errors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boeing gets another chance to put its tankers forward the gao upheld a challenge by boeing , saying it found " significant errors " in the air force 's evaluation of the two bids . it agreed that the air force had conducted " unequal and misleading " discussions with boeing , leading the company to believe it had satisfied a key performance parameter , only to decide later that it had only been partially fulfilled . the gao also found that northrop had been given extra credit for offering an aircraft that carries more fuel than the kc-135 aircraft it is meant to replace , even though the solicitation said no consideration would be given for exceeding the performance parameters . " we 've tried to be meticulous in ensuring that the bidders have a very clear and unambiguous understanding of the relative order of importance of our requirements , " said shay assad , the pentagon director for acquisition . he added that the pentagon will still give " positive consideration " to aircraft that can offload more fuel than the minimum required under the contract . but it will now consider the cost of maintaining the aircraft over a 40-year life cycle , rather than a 25-year lifecycle , he said . assad told reporters that the new request was a modification of the previous one that includes gao 's recommendations . " we are addressing this in a very measured and serious way to ensure that we can execute this procurement in a manner that is fair to both parties , " said assad .
" most of what 's there really addresses the gao finding and that exactly what we are trying to do . " northrop-eads unfazed by gao decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : northrop-eads remain confident about a new tender northrop grumman applauded the pentagon 's decision to keep the contract on a fast track .

the total amount sold has gone down 4.5 percent . despite a known trend of consumers buying less wine , german growers have been able to increase their wine sales by 54.5 percent , said dwi director , monika reule .
in mid- 2007 this figure was 52 percent . based on the amount of wine sold , the german market share rose from 46.3 percent in the first half of 2007 to 49.1 percent in 2008 .
comparatively , the three largest wine exporters , italy , france and spain , incurred double digit loses . the marketing organization for the german wine industry referred to data collected by the market research company gfk in nueremberg . the average price for wine bought in both grocery and discount stores was 11 cents higher than the standard last year . dwi said that the grocery stores have become more popular for wine sales .
in the first two quarters of this year , around 73 percent of all wine was sold in grocery stores - two percent more than last year .

the media watchdog has challenged the ruling in court , with a decision due friday at 10:30 am , afp reported .
rsf head robert menard voiced outrage at the demo ban , saying similar rallies were allowed to go ahead in six other european countries .
" does this mean that it is the chinese embassy that decides who has the right to demonstrate in paris ? " he asked .

“ these aren ’ t the games of openness and friendship , but rather the games of repression , ” he said , adding that china was a ruled by a totalitarian regime that committed human rights abuses . china has painted the games as a celebration of three decades of economic reforms and hopes the event will showcase a rapidly modernizing country . more than 1,000 tibetans missing , groups say some 100 participants took park in the demonstration in berlin which couldn ’ t take place directly at the embassy due to police barriers .

opponents of the bar , however , point out that patrons are free to leave whenever they choose - unlike the citizens of the former east germany . entrepreneurs have come up with several ideas to satisfy the craving for " ostalgia , " the german expression mixing the words ost -lrb- east -rrb- and " nostalgia . " traders sell east german medals and military uniforms at the former cold war crossing point of checkpoint charlie .

"
there is also a poster reading , " welcome to the capital of the german democratic republic . " for people who suffered under the former east germany 's ministry of state security the pub is no laughing matter .
one of them is theodor mittrup , a member of the union of victims organizations of communist rule , which has its offices in the former stasi headquarters .

gau , who grew up in east germany , said the bar is not a joke , it is pure satire . the pub , also known as the conspiratorial haunt , was not intended to glorify the stasi , which was often referred to as the firm by east germans , gau said .
his partner , schmelz , who hails from western germany , sees the pub solely as a business venture and not some sort of stasi hangout . " people from the neighborhood come here for a beer and to chat about soccer or women , ” schmelz said . ostalgia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a large market for nostalgia from the east , or " ostalgia " the pub is located in the suburb of lichtenfeld , where a lot of former stasi employees continue to live .
regulars can apply for an informer 's card that entitles them to a discount . the owners hope the firm will be a magnet for tourists seeking a taste of what life in communist east germany might have been like .
opponents of the bar , however , point out that patrons are free to leave whenever they choose - unlike the citizens of the former east germany . entrepreneurs have come up with several ideas to satisfy the craving for " ostalgia , " the german expression mixing the words ost -lrb- east -rrb- and " nostalgia . " traders sell east german medals and military uniforms at the former cold war crossing point of checkpoint charlie .
a hotel called ostel offers rooms with communist-style furniture and pictures of the former east german leader eric honecker on the wall .

" we made good progress during the first half of the year in achieving our strategic objectives , both in operations and in cost savings , " telekom chief rene obermann said in an attempt to put a positive light on the quarterly numbers . several factors contribute to profit drops but while fierce competition in telekom 's domestic german market led again to a fall in its fixed-line customers , the rise in the euro undercut revenue from the group 's us operations , including its mobile phone business , t-mobile usa , which has been a key driving force behind group profits . the euro hit an all-time high of more than $ 1.60 during the second quarter . revenue from t-mobile usa slipped by 0.8 percent during the first half also amid growing competition in the us mobile phone market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obermann has yet to hit the panic button at the same time , more than 650,000 german households abandoned their deutsche telekom fixed-line connection during the second quarter .
this mass exodus followed the some 120,000 fixed-line customers who left the company throughout this year 's first-quarter . obermann told deutsche welle in an interview earlier this year that such losses were to be expected in 2008 . " there 's no way around it , " he said . " the important thing is that we continue to grow with broadband and mobile connections and with innovative value-added services . " however , the company 's broadband and fixed-line unit posted a 6.4 percent drop in revenue to 5.3 billion euros in the quarter . telekom said group quarterly adjusted earnings before interest , tax , depreciation and amortization -lrb- ebitda -rrb- dropped by 1.1 percent to 4.85 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.5 billion -rrb- . however , it remained on course to hit its full-year ebitda target of about 19.3 billion euros . dpa news agency -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the european aerospace consortium had originally beat out us rival boeing for the deal . the contract was initially won by the northrop grumman-eads partnership but a congressional oversight committee upheld a protest by boeing , effectively forcing the pentagon to reopen the competition bid for the $ 35 billion -lrb- 22 billion euro -rrb- contract , which could yield some $ 100 billion over the next 30 years . the pentagon has formally asked the companies to resubmit proposals to build the 179 kc-x aerial refueling planes .
a final request will take place in mid-august and the companies will be asked to submit their proposals by oct.1.
a final decision on the contract is due in the first week of january 2009 . the government accountability office -lrb- gao -rrb- , an investigative arm of the us congress , ruled in a june 18 report that the air force made critical errors in awarding the contract to northrop and eads . initial tender strewn with errors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boeing gets another chance to put its tankers forward the gao upheld a challenge by boeing , saying it found " significant errors " in the air force 's evaluation of the two bids . it agreed that the air force had conducted " unequal and misleading " discussions with boeing , leading the company to believe it had satisfied a key performance parameter , only to decide later that it had only been partially fulfilled . the gao also found that northrop had been given extra credit for offering an aircraft that carries more fuel than the kc-135 aircraft it is meant to replace , even though the solicitation said no consideration would be given for exceeding the performance parameters . " we 've tried to be meticulous in ensuring that the bidders have a very clear and unambiguous understanding of the relative order of importance of our requirements , " said shay assad , the pentagon director for acquisition . he added that the pentagon will still give " positive consideration " to aircraft that can offload more fuel than the minimum required under the contract . but it will now consider the cost of maintaining the aircraft over a 40-year life cycle , rather than a 25-year lifecycle , he said . assad told reporters that the new request was a modification of the previous one that includes gao 's recommendations . " we are addressing this in a very measured and serious way to ensure that we can execute this procurement in a manner that is fair to both parties , " said assad .
" most of what 's there really addresses the gao finding and that exactly what we are trying to do . " northrop-eads unfazed by gao decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : northrop-eads remain confident about a new tender northrop grumman applauded the pentagon 's decision to keep the contract on a fast track . " we are reviewing the draft request for proposal with an eye toward ensuring that it addresses the issues raised by the gao in a way that facilitates a fair and non-political evaluation of the competing bids , " northrop vice-president randy belote said . boeing has offered to use its 767 as a basis for the refueling aircraft , while northrop-eads is using the larger a330 . us defense secretary robert gates announced in early july that he had accepted gao 's findings and planned to restage the competition in an expedited process , citing the need to quickly replace the air force 's aging fleet of tankers . attempts to find a replacement for its aging tanker fleet have run into setback after setback , beginning with a procurement scandal in 2003 that dashed its plans to lease the aircraft from boeing . boeing has been the air force 's sole supplier of air refueling aircraft , but its grip on the business slipped in february when the air force chose northrop grumman and eads to build the next generation aircraft . both companies have mounted major public relations campaigns touting the manufacturing jobs gained or lost if one bid or the other succeeded . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the protest was one of a series of events planned in several european cities on the eve of the prestigious olympic games to draw world attention to china 's continuing human rights violations .
protests were planned in lisbon and in porto in portugal , candle vigils were planned in several swiss cities and one in norway , while in london the free tibet campaign was to hold a protest in front of the chinese embassy on friday .

the media watchdog has challenged the ruling in court , with a decision due friday at 10:30 am , afp reported .
rsf head robert menard voiced outrage at the demo ban , saying similar rallies were allowed to go ahead in six other european countries .
" does this mean that it is the chinese embassy that decides who has the right to demonstrate in paris ? " he asked .
rowdy protests by activists angry at china 's crackdown in tibet seriously disrupted the olympic flame 's paris leg in april , with images of the chaotic event provoking a wave of anti-french protests in china .

according to the goettingen-based human rights group , society for threatened peoples , the diplomatic delegation would not grant an appointment , despite multiple requests . by handing over the petition the organization wanted to once against demonstrate against the increasing persecution of ethnic groups and religious communities . the society for threatened peoples ' secretary general , tilman zülch , told german news agency dpa the olympics would not be a “ games of peace ” for tibetans , uighurs , mongolians and falun gong members . “ they ’ ve already suffered too much repression in the past months for that , ” he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some have compared china 's carefully-orchestrated games to the 1936 olympics in nazi germany zülch also told news agency ddp that the olympics in china were “ comparable with the games from 1936 in berlin , ” when nazi germany hosted the sporting event .
“ these aren ’ t the games of openness and friendship , but rather the games of repression , ” he said , adding that china was a ruled by a totalitarian regime that committed human rights abuses . china has painted the games as a celebration of three decades of economic reforms and hopes the event will showcase a rapidly modernizing country . more than 1,000 tibetans missing , groups say some 100 participants took park in the demonstration in berlin which couldn ’ t take place directly at the embassy due to police barriers .

iran insists its nuclear activities are aimed at generating electricity . however , us officials maintained their warning that iran would face new sanctions if it did not accept the offer of fresh talks and incentives . such sanctions would likely take months to be enacted however , as was the case with previous measures , owing to chinese and russian resistance to the move .
it remains unclear whether sanctions could be agreed upon before the end of the bush administration 's term in jan .

the european aerospace consortium had originally beat out us rival boeing for the deal . the contract was initially won by the northrop grumman-eads partnership but a congressional oversight committee upheld a protest by boeing , effectively forcing the pentagon to reopen the competition bid for the $ 35 billion -lrb- 22 billion euro -rrb- contract , which could yield some $ 100 billion over the next 30 years . the pentagon has formally asked the companies to resubmit proposals to build the 179 kc-x aerial refueling planes .
a final request will take place in mid-august and the companies will be asked to submit their proposals by oct.1.
a final decision on the contract is due in the first week of january 2009 . the government accountability office -lrb- gao -rrb- , an investigative arm of the us congress , ruled in a june 18 report that the air force made critical errors in awarding the contract to northrop and eads . initial tender strewn with errors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boeing gets another chance to put its tankers forward the gao upheld a challenge by boeing , saying it found " significant errors " in the air force 's evaluation of the two bids . it agreed that the air force had conducted " unequal and misleading " discussions with boeing , leading the company to believe it had satisfied a key performance parameter , only to decide later that it had only been partially fulfilled . the gao also found that northrop had been given extra credit for offering an aircraft that carries more fuel than the kc-135 aircraft it is meant to replace , even though the solicitation said no consideration would be given for exceeding the performance parameters . " we 've tried to be meticulous in ensuring that the bidders have a very clear and unambiguous understanding of the relative order of importance of our requirements , " said shay assad , the pentagon director for acquisition . he added that the pentagon will still give " positive consideration " to aircraft that can offload more fuel than the minimum required under the contract . but it will now consider the cost of maintaining the aircraft over a 40-year life cycle , rather than a 25-year lifecycle , he said . assad told reporters that the new request was a modification of the previous one that includes gao 's recommendations . " we are addressing this in a very measured and serious way to ensure that we can execute this procurement in a manner that is fair to both parties , " said assad .
" most of what 's there really addresses the gao finding and that exactly what we are trying to do . " northrop-eads unfazed by gao decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : northrop-eads remain confident about a new tender northrop grumman applauded the pentagon 's decision to keep the contract on a fast track . " we are reviewing the draft request for proposal with an eye toward ensuring that it addresses the issues raised by the gao in a way that facilitates a fair and non-political evaluation of the competing bids , " northrop vice-president randy belote said . boeing has offered to use its 767 as a basis for the refueling aircraft , while northrop-eads is using the larger a330 . us defense secretary robert gates announced in early july that he had accepted gao 's findings and planned to restage the competition in an expedited process , citing the need to quickly replace the air force 's aging fleet of tankers . attempts to find a replacement for its aging tanker fleet have run into setback after setback , beginning with a procurement scandal in 2003 that dashed its plans to lease the aircraft from boeing . boeing has been the air force 's sole supplier of air refueling aircraft , but its grip on the business slipped in february when the air force chose northrop grumman and eads to build the next generation aircraft . both companies have mounted major public relations campaigns touting the manufacturing jobs gained or lost if one bid or the other succeeded . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we made good progress during the first half of the year in achieving our strategic objectives , both in operations and in cost savings , " telekom chief rene obermann said in an attempt to put a positive light on the quarterly numbers . several factors contribute to profit drops but while fierce competition in telekom 's domestic german market led again to a fall in its fixed-line customers , the rise in the euro undercut revenue from the group 's us operations , including its mobile phone business , t-mobile usa , which has been a key driving force behind group profits . the euro hit an all-time high of more than $ 1.60 during the second quarter . revenue from t-mobile usa slipped by 0.8 percent during the first half also amid growing competition in the us mobile phone market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obermann has yet to hit the panic button at the same time , more than 650,000 german households abandoned their deutsche telekom fixed-line connection during the second quarter .
this mass exodus followed the some 120,000 fixed-line customers who left the company throughout this year 's first-quarter . obermann told deutsche welle in an interview earlier this year that such losses were to be expected in 2008 . " there 's no way around it , " he said . " the important thing is that we continue to grow with broadband and mobile connections and with innovative value-added services . " however , the company 's broadband and fixed-line unit posted a 6.4 percent drop in revenue to 5.3 billion euros in the quarter . telekom said group quarterly adjusted earnings before interest , tax , depreciation and amortization -lrb- ebitda -rrb- dropped by 1.1 percent to 4.85 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.5 billion -rrb- . however , it remained on course to hit its full-year ebitda target of about 19.3 billion euros . dpa news agency -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

jewish population in hungary decimated up until world war ii , around 725,000 jews lived in hungary .

the compensation payments were being made to survivors of the budapest ghetto , since all of the jews in rural areas had been murdered , the head of mazsihisz , the association of jewish congregations , peter feldmayer , told afp news agency .
" these payments mean a historical recognition of the horrible fate of the budapest jewry during the nazi persecution , " said greg schneider , managing director of the new york office of the claims conference , in budapest .
the conference said that in order to " streamline the process and distribute the funds as quickly as possible , the claims conference has reviewed over 25,000 files to identify eligible survivors . "
" brief and simple waiver forms , " as required by the german government , were being sent to 5,790 survivors who the conference believed may be eligible .
the application deadline for compensation was aug .
6 , 2009 .
mazshisz head feldmayer welcomed the compensation deal , but said it must be only a first step in negotiations between the claims conference and the german government to secure a monthly payment to ghetto survivors .

the protest was one of a series of events planned in several european cities on the eve of the prestigious olympic games to draw world attention to china 's continuing human rights violations .
protests were planned in lisbon and in porto in portugal , candle vigils were planned in several swiss cities and one in norway , while in london the free tibet campaign was to hold a protest in front of the chinese embassy on friday .

the media watchdog has challenged the ruling in court , with a decision due friday at 10:30 am , afp reported .
rsf head robert menard voiced outrage at the demo ban , saying similar rallies were allowed to go ahead in six other european countries .
" does this mean that it is the chinese embassy that decides who has the right to demonstrate in paris ? " he asked .

according to the goettingen-based human rights group , society for threatened peoples , the diplomatic delegation would not grant an appointment , despite multiple requests . by handing over the petition the organization wanted to once against demonstrate against the increasing persecution of ethnic groups and religious communities . the society for threatened peoples ' secretary general , tilman zülch , told german news agency dpa the olympics would not be a “ games of peace ” for tibetans , uighurs , mongolians and falun gong members . “ they ’ ve already suffered too much repression in the past months for that , ” he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some have compared china 's carefully-orchestrated games to the 1936 olympics in nazi germany zülch also told news agency ddp that the olympics in china were “ comparable with the games from 1936 in berlin , ” when nazi germany hosted the sporting event .
“ these aren ’ t the games of openness and friendship , but rather the games of repression , ” he said , adding that china was a ruled by a totalitarian regime that committed human rights abuses . china has painted the games as a celebration of three decades of economic reforms and hopes the event will showcase a rapidly modernizing country . more than 1,000 tibetans missing , groups say some 100 participants took park in the demonstration in berlin which couldn ’ t take place directly at the embassy due to police barriers .

the european aerospace consortium had originally beat out us rival boeing for the deal . the contract was initially won by the northrop grumman-eads partnership but a congressional oversight committee upheld a protest by boeing , effectively forcing the pentagon to reopen the competition bid for the $ 35 billion -lrb- 22 billion euro -rrb- contract , which could yield some $ 100 billion over the next 30 years . the pentagon has formally asked the companies to resubmit proposals to build the 179 kc-x aerial refueling planes .
a final request will take place in mid-august and the companies will be asked to submit their proposals by oct.1.
a final decision on the contract is due in the first week of january 2009 . the government accountability office -lrb- gao -rrb- , an investigative arm of the us congress , ruled in a june 18 report that the air force made critical errors in awarding the contract to northrop and eads . initial tender strewn with errors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boeing gets another chance to put its tankers forward the gao upheld a challenge by boeing , saying it found " significant errors " in the air force 's evaluation of the two bids . it agreed that the air force had conducted " unequal and misleading " discussions with boeing , leading the company to believe it had satisfied a key performance parameter , only to decide later that it had only been partially fulfilled . the gao also found that northrop had been given extra credit for offering an aircraft that carries more fuel than the kc-135 aircraft it is meant to replace , even though the solicitation said no consideration would be given for exceeding the performance parameters . " we 've tried to be meticulous in ensuring that the bidders have a very clear and unambiguous understanding of the relative order of importance of our requirements , " said shay assad , the pentagon director for acquisition . he added that the pentagon will still give " positive consideration " to aircraft that can offload more fuel than the minimum required under the contract . but it will now consider the cost of maintaining the aircraft over a 40-year life cycle , rather than a 25-year lifecycle , he said . assad told reporters that the new request was a modification of the previous one that includes gao 's recommendations .

a final decision on the contract is due in the first week of january 2009 . the government accountability office -lrb- gao -rrb- , an investigative arm of the us congress , ruled in a june 18 report that the air force made critical errors in awarding the contract to northrop and eads . initial tender strewn with errors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boeing gets another chance to put its tankers forward the gao upheld a challenge by boeing , saying it found " significant errors " in the air force 's evaluation of the two bids . it agreed that the air force had conducted " unequal and misleading " discussions with boeing , leading the company to believe it had satisfied a key performance parameter , only to decide later that it had only been partially fulfilled . the gao also found that northrop had been given extra credit for offering an aircraft that carries more fuel than the kc-135 aircraft it is meant to replace , even though the solicitation said no consideration would be given for exceeding the performance parameters . " we 've tried to be meticulous in ensuring that the bidders have a very clear and unambiguous understanding of the relative order of importance of our requirements , " said shay assad , the pentagon director for acquisition . he added that the pentagon will still give " positive consideration " to aircraft that can offload more fuel than the minimum required under the contract . but it will now consider the cost of maintaining the aircraft over a 40-year life cycle , rather than a 25-year lifecycle , he said . assad told reporters that the new request was a modification of the previous one that includes gao 's recommendations . " we are addressing this in a very measured and serious way to ensure that we can execute this procurement in a manner that is fair to both parties , " said assad .
" most of what 's there really addresses the gao finding and that exactly what we are trying to do . " northrop-eads unfazed by gao decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : northrop-eads remain confident about a new tender northrop grumman applauded the pentagon 's decision to keep the contract on a fast track . " we are reviewing the draft request for proposal with an eye toward ensuring that it addresses the issues raised by the gao in a way that facilitates a fair and non-political evaluation of the competing bids , " northrop vice-president randy belote said . boeing has offered to use its 767 as a basis for the refueling aircraft , while northrop-eads is using the larger a330 . us defense secretary robert gates announced in early july that he had accepted gao 's findings and planned to restage the competition in an expedited process , citing the need to quickly replace the air force 's aging fleet of tankers . attempts to find a replacement for its aging tanker fleet have run into setback after setback , beginning with a procurement scandal in 2003 that dashed its plans to lease the aircraft from boeing . boeing has been the air force 's sole supplier of air refueling aircraft , but its grip on the business slipped in february when the air force chose northrop grumman and eads to build the next generation aircraft . both companies have mounted major public relations campaigns touting the manufacturing jobs gained or lost if one bid or the other succeeded . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this follows a 1.5 percent increase in the first quarter after the german economy bounded into 2008 as it emerged from a two- year upswing . exports increasing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : automobiles , like this bmw , are some of germany 's most famous exports the surprise increase in germany 's seasonally adjusted exports in june came after a sharp 3.4 percent fall in may as strong demand from the world 's leading emerging economies helped to boost europe 's biggest economy 's key export machine . economists had predicted that the data , which was released by germany 's statistics office , would show exports posting a more modest gain of about 1.8 percent . the june rise resulted in germany 's trade surplus widening to a record 19.7 billion euros .
export posted an annual 7.9 percent rise in june . orders to countries outside the european union rose by an annual 12 percent with demand from nations in asia , the middle east and eastern europe helping to offset slowdown taking shape in the us and other parts of europe , such as britain and spain . german exports to its partners in the 15-member eurozone rose by an annual 4.7 percent in june and by 5.9 percent to the 27 members of the european union .
however , thursday 's data also showed the country 's imports slipped by a surprise 0.1 percent month on month in june . what ’ s more , the 0.2 percent price-and-seasonally adjusted rise in june after production was less than the 0.8 percent forecast by analysts with factory orders dropping by 2.9 percent . dpa news agency -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the un security council is considering further sanctions against tehran as the iaea continues talks . the un atomic watchdog 's number two was in tehran on thursday , aug .
7 , for two days of talks concerning iran 's nuclear program as western governments said the time had come for the security council to impose fresh sanctions . the german government saw as " unsatisfactory " tehran 's response to the offer put forward jointly by the five permanent members of the un security council plus germany in cooperation with the european union , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said on wednesday . " we underlined through this offer that we were striving for a diplomatic solution to the nuclear dispute , " steinmeier said . the major powers were sticking to the dual strategy of offering incentives to tehran while warning that the security council would take up the issue again , he said . on tuesday , iran delivered a message to eu officials in brussels to the effect that the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- could send an inspection team to tehran . an unnamed iranian official confirmed that a message was delivered through iranian ambassador ali-asghar khaji but said the message was not , as initially reported by the local media , a reply to the offer by the world powers . the offer by the five un veto powers - the us , france , britain , russia and china - plus germany is for far-reaching economic cooperation with iran , including in the field of civilian-sector nuclear power , in return for a pledge by tehran to refrain from uranium enrichment activities . specter of further sanctions looms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran remains defiant against international efforts to curtail its nuclear activities on wednesday , the us and britain said the major powers had agreed to consider further security council sanctions against iran after it failed to halt its nuclear activities . but at the united nations , russian ambassador vitaly churkin said there was no definite agreement among the six powers for a fourth round of sanctions against iran , reported the international herald tribune . a european union diplomat told the paper there would not be immediate sanctions and dialogue should continue with the iranians .
" it 's not for tomorrow , " said the diplomat . western governments accuse tehran of using a civil nuclear program to cover up work on creating nuclear weapons .
iran insists its nuclear activities are aimed at generating electricity . however , us officials maintained their warning that iran would face new sanctions if it did not accept the offer of fresh talks and incentives . such sanctions would likely take months to be enacted however , as was the case with previous measures , owing to chinese and russian resistance to the move .
it remains unclear whether sanctions could be agreed upon before the end of the bush administration 's term in jan .

" this follows a 1.5 percent increase in the first quarter after the german economy bounded into 2008 as it emerged from a two- year upswing . exports increasing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : automobiles , like this bmw , are some of germany 's most famous exports the surprise increase in germany 's seasonally adjusted exports in june came after a sharp 3.4 percent fall in may as strong demand from the world 's leading emerging economies helped to boost europe 's biggest economy 's key export machine . economists had predicted that the data , which was released by germany 's statistics office , would show exports posting a more modest gain of about 1.8 percent . the june rise resulted in germany 's trade surplus widening to a record 19.7 billion euros .

the un security council is considering further sanctions against tehran as the iaea continues talks . the un atomic watchdog 's number two was in tehran on thursday , aug .
7 , for two days of talks concerning iran 's nuclear program as western governments said the time had come for the security council to impose fresh sanctions . the german government saw as " unsatisfactory " tehran 's response to the offer put forward jointly by the five permanent members of the un security council plus germany in cooperation with the european union , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said on wednesday . " we underlined through this offer that we were striving for a diplomatic solution to the nuclear dispute , " steinmeier said . the major powers were sticking to the dual strategy of offering incentives to tehran while warning that the security council would take up the issue again , he said . on tuesday , iran delivered a message to eu officials in brussels to the effect that the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- could send an inspection team to tehran . an unnamed iranian official confirmed that a message was delivered through iranian ambassador ali-asghar khaji but said the message was not , as initially reported by the local media , a reply to the offer by the world powers . the offer by the five un veto powers - the us , france , britain , russia and china - plus germany is for far-reaching economic cooperation with iran , including in the field of civilian-sector nuclear power , in return for a pledge by tehran to refrain from uranium enrichment activities . specter of further sanctions looms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran remains defiant against international efforts to curtail its nuclear activities on wednesday , the us and britain said the major powers had agreed to consider further security council sanctions against iran after it failed to halt its nuclear activities . but at the united nations , russian ambassador vitaly churkin said there was no definite agreement among the six powers for a fourth round of sanctions against iran , reported the international herald tribune . a european union diplomat told the paper there would not be immediate sanctions and dialogue should continue with the iranians .
" it 's not for tomorrow , " said the diplomat . western governments accuse tehran of using a civil nuclear program to cover up work on creating nuclear weapons .
iran insists its nuclear activities are aimed at generating electricity . however , us officials maintained their warning that iran would face new sanctions if it did not accept the offer of fresh talks and incentives . such sanctions would likely take months to be enacted however , as was the case with previous measures , owing to chinese and russian resistance to the move .
it remains unclear whether sanctions could be agreed upon before the end of the bush administration 's term in jan .

" we underlined through this offer that we were striving for a diplomatic solution to the nuclear dispute , " steinmeier said . the major powers were sticking to the dual strategy of offering incentives to tehran while warning that the security council would take up the issue again , he said . on tuesday , iran delivered a message to eu officials in brussels to the effect that the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- could send an inspection team to tehran . an unnamed iranian official confirmed that a message was delivered through iranian ambassador ali-asghar khaji but said the message was not , as initially reported by the local media , a reply to the offer by the world powers . the offer by the five un veto powers - the us , france , britain , russia and china - plus germany is for far-reaching economic cooperation with iran , including in the field of civilian-sector nuclear power , in return for a pledge by tehran to refrain from uranium enrichment activities . specter of further sanctions looms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran remains defiant against international efforts to curtail its nuclear activities on wednesday , the us and britain said the major powers had agreed to consider further security council sanctions against iran after it failed to halt its nuclear activities . but at the united nations , russian ambassador vitaly churkin said there was no definite agreement among the six powers for a fourth round of sanctions against iran , reported the international herald tribune . a european union diplomat told the paper there would not be immediate sanctions and dialogue should continue with the iranians .
" it 's not for tomorrow , " said the diplomat . western governments accuse tehran of using a civil nuclear program to cover up work on creating nuclear weapons .
iran insists its nuclear activities are aimed at generating electricity . however , us officials maintained their warning that iran would face new sanctions if it did not accept the offer of fresh talks and incentives . such sanctions would likely take months to be enacted however , as was the case with previous measures , owing to chinese and russian resistance to the move .
it remains unclear whether sanctions could be agreed upon before the end of the bush administration 's term in jan .
2009 . " i am not going to guess how long this will take and where it may ultimately lead , " us state department spokesman gonzalo gallegos told the iht . dpa news agency -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the total amount sold has gone down 4.5 percent . despite a known trend of consumers buying less wine , german growers have been able to increase their wine sales by 54.5 percent , said dwi director , monika reule .
in mid- 2007 this figure was 52 percent . based on the amount of wine sold , the german market share rose from 46.3 percent in the first half of 2007 to 49.1 percent in 2008 .
comparatively , the three largest wine exporters , italy , france and spain , incurred double digit loses . the marketing organization for the german wine industry referred to data collected by the market research company gfk in nueremberg . the average price for wine bought in both grocery and discount stores was 11 cents higher than the standard last year . dwi said that the grocery stores have become more popular for wine sales .
in the first two quarters of this year , around 73 percent of all wine was sold in grocery stores - two percent more than last year .

the men undertook a trip lasting for days , steinmeier recounted , in order to ask german soldiers to help build a school . the choice of this story is very revealing .
it leads to the question of why heavily armed foreign soldiers are still needed to fulfill basic needs in afghanistan .
schools should be seen to by the afghan government , the provincial governor , or aid organizations - not nato .
the soliders of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- are there for security and stability though they can neither produce it , nor permanently guarantee it ; certainly not in the south , and only occasionally in the north . # b # the government has been trying to pull the wool over the public ’ s eyes by only talking about the nice things that happen .
but that only works until one afghan asks a german soldier to help build a school , while another afghan attacks him with explosives . so who is a friend and who is a foe ?
it 's difficult to differentiate between the two in a mission where the military is so utterly dependent on the trust of the local population . if that trust is lost then the success stories about reconstruction quickly become passé .
soon it may just be about preventing a backslide into chaos with brute force . this fall the german government will increase the number of troops in afghanistan by 1,000 because they aren ’ t able to get by with the 3,500 soldiers stationed in northern afghanistan .
german soldiers have for years camped in the relatively calm north of the country to avoid nato 's increasing demands . these days the north isn ’ t exactly a safe model region .
even there the german army has to increasingly deal with rockets flying through the air , hidden explosives and suicide bombers around every corner . under these circumstances the german government 's reconstruction rhetoric just does n't work anymore . a lot suggests that the next american president - whoever that may be - will be blunt with european allies . he will demand more troops for afghanistan in order to once and for all destroy the taliban , who are also known to have carried out attacks on the german military . given the explosive nature of the afghanistan debate , the german government has given itself a kind of grace period : this fall they will extend the mission by 14 months instead of 12 , so that it won ’ t be a controversial issue during the 2009 parliamentary elections . however , they shouldn ’ t delude themselves into thinking that until then they will be able to peddle stories of freshly dug wells and happy school children . the entire isaf force , including german troops , are in the middle of a combat mission which will get more difficult as the months go by .
it would be better to finally talk openly about it . nina werkhäuser covers foreign , defense and security policy affairs for dw-radio . -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now a stasi-themed pub is reopening old wounds in the german capital . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bar is filled with stasi memorabilia an east german flag draped behind the bar and shredded surveillance logs are among the decorations in the firm , located on street in what used to be east berlin where the stasi headquarters was located . on one of the walls there is a porcelain plate bearing the stasi motto referring to protecting " the peasants ' and workers ' state . "
there is also a poster reading , " welcome to the capital of the german democratic republic . " for people who suffered under the former east germany 's ministry of state security the pub is no laughing matter .
one of them is theodor mittrup , a member of the union of victims organizations of communist rule , which has its offices in the former stasi headquarters .
he said playing down the stasi like this is unbelievable . " people who were sent to prison by the stasi and other victims have not received as much attention as the opening of this pub , " he added . a neighborhood watering hole ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bar 's owners say it 's just like any other neighborhood pub the firm is owned by wilfried gau and wolfgang schmelz , who used to work together in a call center .
gau , who grew up in east germany , said the bar is not a joke , it is pure satire . the pub , also known as the conspiratorial haunt , was not intended to glorify the stasi , which was often referred to as the firm by east germans , gau said .
his partner , schmelz , who hails from western germany , sees the pub solely as a business venture and not some sort of stasi hangout . " people from the neighborhood come here for a beer and to chat about soccer or women , ” schmelz said . ostalgia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is a large market for nostalgia from the east , or " ostalgia " the pub is located in the suburb of lichtenfeld , where a lot of former stasi employees continue to live .
regulars can apply for an informer 's card that entitles them to a discount . the owners hope the firm will be a magnet for tourists seeking a taste of what life in communist east germany might have been like .
opponents of the bar , however , point out that patrons are free to leave whenever they choose - unlike the citizens of the former east germany . entrepreneurs have come up with several ideas to satisfy the craving for " ostalgia , " the german expression mixing the words ost -lrb- east -rrb- and " nostalgia . " traders sell east german medals and military uniforms at the former cold war crossing point of checkpoint charlie .
a hotel called ostel offers rooms with communist-style furniture and pictures of the former east german leader eric honecker on the wall .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 07.08.2008 opinion : germany should talk openly about afghanistan mission großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw 's nina werkhaeuser says germany needs to do a better job explaining to its citizens that the mission in afghanistan is going to get worse before it gets better . when members of the federal government speak about the german mission in afghanistan , they like to tell moving stories of help and appreciation . recently german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier spoke to the german parliament about village elders in the pamir mountains .
the men undertook a trip lasting for days , steinmeier recounted , in order to ask german soldiers to help build a school . the choice of this story is very revealing .
it leads to the question of why heavily armed foreign soldiers are still needed to fulfill basic needs in afghanistan .
schools should be seen to by the afghan government , the provincial governor , or aid organizations - not nato .
the soliders of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- are there for security and stability though they can neither produce it , nor permanently guarantee it ; certainly not in the south , and only occasionally in the north . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government has been trying to pull the wool over the public ’ s eyes by only talking about the nice things that happen .
but that only works until one afghan asks a german soldier to help build a school , while another afghan attacks him with explosives . so who is a friend and who is a foe ?
it 's difficult to differentiate between the two in a mission where the military is so utterly dependent on the trust of the local population . if that trust is lost then the success stories about reconstruction quickly become passé .
soon it may just be about preventing a backslide into chaos with brute force . this fall the german government will increase the number of troops in afghanistan by 1,000 because they aren ’ t able to get by with the 3,500 soldiers stationed in northern afghanistan .
german soldiers have for years camped in the relatively calm north of the country to avoid nato 's increasing demands . these days the north isn ’ t exactly a safe model region .
even there the german army has to increasingly deal with rockets flying through the air , hidden explosives and suicide bombers around every corner . under these circumstances the german government 's reconstruction rhetoric just does n't work anymore . a lot suggests that the next american president - whoever that may be - will be blunt with european allies . he will demand more troops for afghanistan in order to once and for all destroy the taliban , who are also known to have carried out attacks on the german military . given the explosive nature of the afghanistan debate , the german government has given itself a kind of grace period : this fall they will extend the mission by 14 months instead of 12 , so that it won ’ t be a controversial issue during the 2009 parliamentary elections . however , they shouldn ’ t delude themselves into thinking that until then they will be able to peddle stories of freshly dug wells and happy school children . the entire isaf force , including german troops , are in the middle of a combat mission which will get more difficult as the months go by .
it would be better to finally talk openly about it . nina werkhäuser covers foreign , defense and security policy affairs for dw-radio . -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de german minister says afghan security worse , promises support german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said saturday , july 26 , that violence in afghanistan had worsened this year and promised more german support for the building and reform of the afghan police and military .

the men undertook a trip lasting for days , steinmeier recounted , in order to ask german soldiers to help build a school . the choice of this story is very revealing .
it leads to the question of why heavily armed foreign soldiers are still needed to fulfill basic needs in afghanistan .
schools should be seen to by the afghan government , the provincial governor , or aid organizations - not nato .
the soliders of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- are there for security and stability though they can neither produce it , nor permanently guarantee it ; certainly not in the south , and only occasionally in the north . # b # the government has been trying to pull the wool over the public ’ s eyes by only talking about the nice things that happen .
but that only works until one afghan asks a german soldier to help build a school , while another afghan attacks him with explosives . so who is a friend and who is a foe ?
it 's difficult to differentiate between the two in a mission where the military is so utterly dependent on the trust of the local population . if that trust is lost then the success stories about reconstruction quickly become passé .
soon it may just be about preventing a backslide into chaos with brute force . this fall the german government will increase the number of troops in afghanistan by 1,000 because they aren ’ t able to get by with the 3,500 soldiers stationed in northern afghanistan .
german soldiers have for years camped in the relatively calm north of the country to avoid nato 's increasing demands . these days the north isn ’ t exactly a safe model region .
even there the german army has to increasingly deal with rockets flying through the air , hidden explosives and suicide bombers around every corner . under these circumstances the german government 's reconstruction rhetoric just does n't work anymore . a lot suggests that the next american president - whoever that may be - will be blunt with european allies . he will demand more troops for afghanistan in order to once and for all destroy the taliban , who are also known to have carried out attacks on the german military . given the explosive nature of the afghanistan debate , the german government has given itself a kind of grace period : this fall they will extend the mission by 14 months instead of 12 , so that it won ’ t be a controversial issue during the 2009 parliamentary elections . however , they shouldn ’ t delude themselves into thinking that until then they will be able to peddle stories of freshly dug wells and happy school children . the entire isaf force , including german troops , are in the middle of a combat mission which will get more difficult as the months go by .
it would be better to finally talk openly about it . nina werkhäuser covers foreign , defense and security policy affairs for dw-radio . -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the un security council is considering further sanctions against tehran as the iaea continues talks . the un atomic watchdog 's number two was in tehran on thursday , aug .
7 , for two days of talks concerning iran 's nuclear program as western governments said the time had come for the security council to impose fresh sanctions . the german government saw as " unsatisfactory " tehran 's response to the offer put forward jointly by the five permanent members of the un security council plus germany in cooperation with the european union , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said on wednesday . " we underlined through this offer that we were striving for a diplomatic solution to the nuclear dispute , " steinmeier said . the major powers were sticking to the dual strategy of offering incentives to tehran while warning that the security council would take up the issue again , he said . on tuesday , iran delivered a message to eu officials in brussels to the effect that the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- could send an inspection team to tehran . an unnamed iranian official confirmed that a message was delivered through iranian ambassador ali-asghar khaji but said the message was not , as initially reported by the local media , a reply to the offer by the world powers . the offer by the five un veto powers - the us , france , britain , russia and china - plus germany is for far-reaching economic cooperation with iran , including in the field of civilian-sector nuclear power , in return for a pledge by tehran to refrain from uranium enrichment activities . specter of further sanctions looms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran remains defiant against international efforts to curtail its nuclear activities on wednesday , the us and britain said the major powers had agreed to consider further security council sanctions against iran after it failed to halt its nuclear activities . but at the united nations , russian ambassador vitaly churkin said there was no definite agreement among the six powers for a fourth round of sanctions against iran , reported the international herald tribune . a european union diplomat told the paper there would not be immediate sanctions and dialogue should continue with the iranians .
" it 's not for tomorrow , " said the diplomat . western governments accuse tehran of using a civil nuclear program to cover up work on creating nuclear weapons .
iran insists its nuclear activities are aimed at generating electricity . however , us officials maintained their warning that iran would face new sanctions if it did not accept the offer of fresh talks and incentives . such sanctions would likely take months to be enacted however , as was the case with previous measures , owing to chinese and russian resistance to the move .
it remains unclear whether sanctions could be agreed upon before the end of the bush administration 's term in jan .

the european aerospace consortium had originally beat out us rival boeing for the deal . the contract was initially won by the northrop grumman-eads partnership but a congressional oversight committee upheld a protest by boeing , effectively forcing the pentagon to reopen the competition bid for the $ 35 billion -lrb- 22 billion euro -rrb- contract , which could yield some $ 100 billion over the next 30 years . the pentagon has formally asked the companies to resubmit proposals to build the 179 kc-x aerial refueling planes .
a final request will take place in mid-august and the companies will be asked to submit their proposals by oct.1.
a final decision on the contract is due in the first week of january 2009 . the government accountability office -lrb- gao -rrb- , an investigative arm of the us congress , ruled in a june 18 report that the air force made critical errors in awarding the contract to northrop and eads . initial tender strewn with errors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boeing gets another chance to put its tankers forward the gao upheld a challenge by boeing , saying it found " significant errors " in the air force 's evaluation of the two bids . it agreed that the air force had conducted " unequal and misleading " discussions with boeing , leading the company to believe it had satisfied a key performance parameter , only to decide later that it had only been partially fulfilled . the gao also found that northrop had been given extra credit for offering an aircraft that carries more fuel than the kc-135 aircraft it is meant to replace , even though the solicitation said no consideration would be given for exceeding the performance parameters . " we 've tried to be meticulous in ensuring that the bidders have a very clear and unambiguous understanding of the relative order of importance of our requirements , " said shay assad , the pentagon director for acquisition . he added that the pentagon will still give " positive consideration " to aircraft that can offload more fuel than the minimum required under the contract . but it will now consider the cost of maintaining the aircraft over a 40-year life cycle , rather than a 25-year lifecycle , he said . assad told reporters that the new request was a modification of the previous one that includes gao 's recommendations . " we are addressing this in a very measured and serious way to ensure that we can execute this procurement in a manner that is fair to both parties , " said assad .
" most of what 's there really addresses the gao finding and that exactly what we are trying to do . " northrop-eads unfazed by gao decision bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : northrop-eads remain confident about a new tender northrop grumman applauded the pentagon 's decision to keep the contract on a fast track . " we are reviewing the draft request for proposal with an eye toward ensuring that it addresses the issues raised by the gao in a way that facilitates a fair and non-political evaluation of the competing bids , " northrop vice-president randy belote said . boeing has offered to use its 767 as a basis for the refueling aircraft , while northrop-eads is using the larger a330 . us defense secretary robert gates announced in early july that he had accepted gao 's findings and planned to restage the competition in an expedited process , citing the need to quickly replace the air force 's aging fleet of tankers . attempts to find a replacement for its aging tanker fleet have run into setback after setback , beginning with a procurement scandal in 2003 that dashed its plans to lease the aircraft from boeing . boeing has been the air force 's sole supplier of air refueling aircraft , but its grip on the business slipped in february when the air force chose northrop grumman and eads to build the next generation aircraft . both companies have mounted major public relations campaigns touting the manufacturing jobs gained or lost if one bid or the other succeeded . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now a stasi-themed pub is reopening old wounds in the german capital . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bar is filled with stasi memorabilia an east german flag draped behind the bar and shredded surveillance logs are among the decorations in the firm , located on street in what used to be east berlin where the stasi headquarters was located . on one of the walls there is a porcelain plate bearing the stasi motto referring to protecting " the peasants ' and workers ' state . "
there is also a poster reading , " welcome to the capital of the german democratic republic . " for people who suffered under the former east germany 's ministry of state security the pub is no laughing matter .
one of them is theodor mittrup , a member of the union of victims organizations of communist rule , which has its offices in the former stasi headquarters .
he said playing down the stasi like this is unbelievable . " people who were sent to prison by the stasi and other victims have not received as much attention as the opening of this pub , " he added . a neighborhood watering hole ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bar 's owners say it 's just like any other neighborhood pub the firm is owned by wilfried gau and wolfgang schmelz , who used to work together in a call center .

yvonne and jim collinson 's son , pte james collinson , 17 , from perth , was found with a single gunshot wound to his head in march 2002 .
four deaths at the base are the subject of the new fringe play .
the parents of another soldier who died , cheryl james from north wales , also saw the production on wednesday .
mrs collinson , who saw the show , deep cut , for the first time , told the bbc scotland news website the experience was overwhelming and emotional .
" i hope this will put the public eye and public pressure back on the case for a public inquiry , " she said .
the play was portrayed so well that it really got us angry again yvonne collinson " i think , watching the performance , anyone who left and did n't believe we should have a public inquiry would have been very few and far between . "
she went on : " i think the play was portrayed so well that it really got us angry again , it really gave me the wind under my wings to get going again because , as was also portrayed in the play , you do get tired , you do think , ' where else have we got to turn ' .
" i think it 's not over until it 's over and it 's not over yet . "
mr collinson added : " it 's something we need , as it brings it back to the forefront again , that the families are still here , that they are still trying to fight for justice . "
allegations of bullying and abuse at deepcut , in surrey , were made after the soldiers ' deaths , which occurred between 1995 and 2002 .
the play , by cardiff-based theatre company sherman cymru , looked at the aftermath of the deaths and , in particular , the effect on the parents of another soldier who died , pte cheryl james , 18 , from llangollen , north wales .
' intense ' story writer philip ralph spent two years writing the play , and held face-to-face interviews with family members and scoured public documents and media reports .
des james , cheryl 's father , made a moving speech near the end of the show , which had many audience members crying .
he added : " if the show only moves us a millimetre towards a public inquiry then it is a success .
there is n't any other goal .
the parents of pte cheryl james featured in the play " it is like the condensation of 13 years of your life revealed to you in one-and-a-half-hours and , even though you know the story , it 's the intensity of that , you even then start thinking , ' this is bad ' and then you remember it 's about you .
it 's weird . "
pte sean benton , 20 , from hastings , was found dead with gunshot wounds at the barracks in june 1995 , just months before pte james 's death .
in september 2001 , 17-year-old pte geoff gray , from seaham , co durham , was discovered with two gunshot wounds to his head .
six months later , pte collinson was found with a gunshot wound upwards through his chin .
inquests into the deaths recorded a verdict of suicide in pte benton 's case and open verdicts for the other three .
an independent review of the deaths , conducted by nicholas blake qc , concluded in march 2006 that the deaths were probably self-inflicted .
however , mr blake criticised army training , citing " harassment , discrimination and oppressive behaviour " .
the mod announced the closure of deepcut on 8 january as part of a review to overhaul training facilities across the uk .
deep cut is being staged at the traverse until 24 august , before heading to mold in north wales , and cardiff .

yvonne and jim collinson 's son , pte james collinson , 17 , from perth , was found with a single gunshot wound to his head in march 2002 .
four deaths at the base are the subject of the new fringe play .
the parents of another soldier who died , cheryl james from north wales , also saw the production on wednesday .
mrs collinson , who saw the show , deep cut , for the first time , told the bbc scotland news website the experience was overwhelming and emotional .
" i hope this will put the public eye and public pressure back on the case for a public inquiry , " she said .
the play was portrayed so well that it really got us angry again yvonne collinson " i think , watching the performance , anyone who left and did n't believe we should have a public inquiry would have been very few and far between . "
she went on : " i think the play was portrayed so well that it really got us angry again , it really gave me the wind under my wings to get going again because , as was also portrayed in the play , you do get tired , you do think , ' where else have we got to turn ' .
" i think it 's not over until it 's over and it 's not over yet . "
mr collinson added : " it 's something we need , as it brings it back to the forefront again , that the families are still here , that they are still trying to fight for justice . "
allegations of bullying and abuse at deepcut , in surrey , were made after the soldiers ' deaths , which occurred between 1995 and 2002 .
the play , by cardiff-based theatre company sherman cymru , looked at the aftermath of the deaths and , in particular , the effect on the parents of another soldier who died , pte cheryl james , 18 , from llangollen , north wales .
' intense ' story writer philip ralph spent two years writing the play , and held face-to-face interviews with family members and scoured public documents and media reports .
des james , cheryl 's father , made a moving speech near the end of the show , which had many audience members crying .
he added : " if the show only moves us a millimetre towards a public inquiry then it is a success .
there is n't any other goal .
the parents of pte cheryl james featured in the play " it is like the condensation of 13 years of your life revealed to you in one-and-a-half-hours and , even though you know the story , it 's the intensity of that , you even then start thinking , ' this is bad ' and then you remember it 's about you .
it 's weird . "
pte sean benton , 20 , from hastings , was found dead with gunshot wounds at the barracks in june 1995 , just months before pte james 's death .
in september 2001 , 17-year-old pte geoff gray , from seaham , co durham , was discovered with two gunshot wounds to his head .
six months later , pte collinson was found with a gunshot wound upwards through his chin .
inquests into the deaths recorded a verdict of suicide in pte benton 's case and open verdicts for the other three .
an independent review of the deaths , conducted by nicholas blake qc , concluded in march 2006 that the deaths were probably self-inflicted .
however , mr blake criticised army training , citing " harassment , discrimination and oppressive behaviour " .
the mod announced the closure of deepcut on 8 january as part of a review to overhaul training facilities across the uk .
deep cut is being staged at the traverse until 24 august , before heading to mold in north wales , and cardiff .

second home expenses - no way " suzanne phillips , rhondda cynon taff in march that group said ams ' pay should be brought more into line with that of mps to reflect the assembly 's new law making responsibilities .
the near £ 4,000 increase brought the salary of a backbench am to more than £ 50,000 a year .
currently , members may claim an allowance of up to £ 15,000 to run their office .
another allowance , up to £ 13,000 , is available to help ams who live away from the cardiff area to stay overnight or find a second home in the capital .
the panel will also examine payments for support staff , it and constituency accommodation sir roger said : " the national assembly for wales has at its core a commitment to transparent and accessible democracy . "
" i am proud to chair a panel that will report to the assembly commission on the best way of providing support to assembly members that is appropriate for wales , and that will help underpin future good governance and effective public service in wales . "
but the campaign group , the taxpayers ' alliance , said that ams should show they understand the problems faced by constituents and turn down any increases .
review group panel sir roger jones , swansea university pro-chancellor dafydd wigley , former plaid leader nigel rudd , former chief executive of the east midlands regional assembly deep sagar , chair of the nhs 24 service in scotland jackie nickson , hr manager , opagus group mark wallace , campaign director for the group said : " from our point of view , taxpayers are under a lot of pressure at the moment given the record tax take and the current economic conditions .
" people are very concerned that our elected representatives are in some cases squandering our money and at the very worse helping themselves to money they 're not entitled to .
" the best way to restore the publics faith and dispel those concerns is to make the system 100 % transparent by publishing all expenses claims and receipts for everyone to see , " he added .
public perception claire clancy , the chief executive of the assembly commission said there had been " a significant public debate " about how politicians were paid and supported for their work .
" the independent review panel has therefore been tasked to produce a set of evidence-based recommendations containing principles that will deliver a fair , equitable and transparent process for the financial support of assembly members in order to improve public knowledge and perception of these issues , " she said .
the members of the review group include dafydd wigley , the former plaid leader , but also representatives from business and the public sector outside wales .
the group is expected to report back before the end of next march to the assembly commission , the body responsible for providing property , staff and services to ams .

the west rhyl ward of the seaside resort will see funding for its communities first scheme end next year .
the welsh assembly government project is being scrapped after it claimed there was a lack of local support .
in response , denbighshire council said it was determined to secure and develop new community partnerships in rhyl .
according to the latest welsh assembly government statistics - for overall multiple deprivation - both sub-divisions of west rhyl are ranked in the 10 % most deprived in wales .
one part is ranked most deprived and the other fourth out of 1,896 areas .
in a statement , the deputy minister for regeneration , leighton andrews , said that despite " best efforts " , the programme had made little progress in west rhyl .
the project is one of two communities first schemes in the town , and both have been subjected to a review .
while progress is reported to have been made in south west rhyl , the west rhyl ward was still failing , noted the deputy minister .
this typifies the lack of engagement experienced in rhyl thus stalling efforts to rejuvenate the scheme ann jones am " the local community is no more engaged with the communities first process than it was before the review and key local service provider organisations remain disengaged , " stated mr andrews .
" the long-running situation in west rhyl bears little resemblance to practice anywhere else in the programme and does not accord with the principles set out in the communities first guidance . "
in light of the comments , mr andrews said the programmed would be scrapped in west rhyl at the end of next march .
however , it has been stressed that the town as a whole will still benefit from regeneration funding .
mr andrews added : " discussions have started across the welsh assembly government to consider how community regeneration in this area can be incorporated in a wider programme of economic and social regeneration in rhyl . "
the local assembly member , vale of clwyd am ann jones , claimed part of the blame for the schemes failure should lie with denbighshire county council .
" the job of making communities first sustainable in rhyl was made all the more difficult by denbighshire county council 's lack of commitment to its goals , " said the am .
" the authority has drastically cut the community development agency after actively instructing it to avoid communities first .
" this typifies the lack of engagement experienced in rhyl thus stalling efforts to rejuvenate the scheme . "
partnerships however , the council has hit back at the comments , insisting it is fully committed to working with partnerships to regenerate the resort .
cllr sharon frobisher , who is responsible for the communities portfolio said : " denbighshire expresses disappointment that the communities first programme for west rhyl has been unsuccessful , but we are pleased to hear that this money will not be lost to rhyl .
" regarding comments made about the reduction of posts at the denbighshire community agency , this decision was taken following the poor settlement from the welsh assembly government .
" the council is proud of its achievements in the disadvantaged communities and will continue to use its resources to the best of its abilities for the benefit of the people of denbighshire . "

the cherry tree inn 's owners say they lost trade after monmouthshire council made them remove a roadside sign pointing visitors up a lane .
the pub in tintern , momouthshire , has now been put up for sale and its long run in the ale-lovers ' bible has ended .
monmouthshire council said the sign did not comply with planning regulations .
steve pocock , who bought the cherry tree inn in 2000 with his wife jill , said he " felt dreadful " after calling time on the pub , which dates back in parts to the 17th century and had been recommended and approved for the good beer guide every year since 1972 .
next year 's edition , compiled by the campaign for real ale -lrb- camra -rrb- , has gone to press without it being listed - leaving only nine uk pubs out of 4,500 listed in the guide holding the honour of being regulars since the start . "
it all seems so silly - you see signs all over the place twinning towns with obscure places but you ca n't have a sign saying there 's a nice pub down the lane " roger protz , the good beer guide 's editor mr pocock said the business expanded after he extended the cherry tree inn around the old pub building in 2003 and introduced a grocery shop and a post office in its basement for locals after the tintern branch closed .
this in turn was shut last month as part of nationwide post office closures .
he said the pub 's trade took a turn for the worse after he lost his three-year battle with monmouthshire council , which ended up in court , to keep an a-board sign on the main a466 chepstow to monmouth road .
he said visitors and passing trade could not find the pub without the sign as it was half a mile up a small lane and he insisted it was not obstructing drivers ' views and was placed on a green and not on a footpath .
" it left us with financial problems and we had to let all our staff go , except us and one other , " said mr pocock , who suffered a stroke in 2006 but is now running the anchor hotel in tintern .
" we took out a huge loan and now just have the building .
i just feel so sad about it . "
roger protz , the good beer guide 's editor , said it was a " fantastic achievement " for a pub to be listed in every guide .
" sadly the chain has been broken now for the cherry tree , there are only nine left and i 'm devastated , " he said .
" it all seems so silly - you see signs all over the place twinning towns with obscure places but you ca n't have a sign saying there 's a nice pub down the lane . "
chris gillette , chairman of the gwent branch of camra , added : " it 's more than just a pub , it 's quite unique .
it was a post office and you could buy your groceries there .
it was very special to a lot of people . "
a spokesman for monmouthshire council 's planning department said they had worked to accommodate mr and mrs pocock and suggested they make the sign smaller to conform to planning regulations .
" mr and mrs pocock chose to ignore our advice and consequently planning consent was refused , " the officer said .
" they were asked to remove their sign , which again , they refused to do .
" we had no choice but to take them to court to get our planning regulations enforced .

it all seems so silly - you see signs all over the place twinning towns with obscure places but you ca n't have a sign saying there 's a nice pub down the lane roger protz , the good beer guide 's editor mr pocock said the business expanded after he extended the cherry tree inn around the old pub building in 2003 and introduced a grocery shop and a post office in its basement for locals after the tintern branch closed .
this in turn was shut last month as part of nationwide post office closures .
he said the pub 's trade took a turn for the worse after he lost his three-year battle with monmouthshire council , which ended up in court , to keep an a-board sign on the main a466 chepstow to monmouth road .
he said visitors and passing trade could not find the pub without the sign as it was half a mile up a small lane and he insisted it was not obstructing drivers ' views and was placed on a green and not on a footpath .
" it left us with financial problems and we had to let all our staff go , except us and one other , " said mr pocock , who suffered a stroke in 2006 but is now running the anchor hotel in tintern .
" we took out a huge loan and now just have the building .
i just feel so sad about it . "
roger protz , the good beer guide 's editor , said it was a " fantastic achievement " for a pub to be listed in every guide .
real ale lovers recommend pubs for the good beer guide " sadly the chain has been broken now for the cherry tree , there are only nine left and i 'm devastated , " he said .
" it all seems so silly - you see signs all over the place twinning towns with obscure places but you ca n't have a sign saying there 's a nice pub down the lane . "
chris gillette , chairman of the gwent branch of camra , added : " it 's more than just a pub , it 's quite unique .
it was a post office and you could buy your groceries there .
it was very special to a lot of people . "
a spokesman for monmouthshire council 's planning department said they had worked to accommodate mr and mrs pocock and suggested they make the sign smaller to conform to planning regulations .
" mr and mrs pocock chose to ignore our advice and consequently planning consent was refused , " the officer said .
" they were asked to remove their sign , which again , they refused to do .
" we had no choice but to take them to court to get our planning regulations enforced .
the court found in our favour , which is proof that we acted correctly .
" we have a duty to make sure that monmouthshire remains a beautiful county which can be enjoyed by all and is not cluttered by signs and we will continue to enforce this . "

a field event is being held at the scottish crop research institute -lrb- scri -rrb- in invergowrie , tayside , which is studying ways to improve the plant .
on friday , a conference marking the un 's international year of the potato also takes place in dundee .
delegates from china , peru , russia , new zealand and australia will discuss developments in the £ 3bn industry .
the scri is looking into a number of areas of potato development .
staff are studying genes to try to create new improved varieties which taste better .
they are also studying ways to control potato diseases and produce plants which have a resistance .
the institute 's varieties are grown in several countries including egypt , africa and india .
people want to eat potatoes , they find it very convenient , particularly in the form of chips and crisps prof peter gregory scri professor peter gregory , chief executive of the scri , said the potato was a truly global phenomenon .
" it 's moved from its origins in the andes , in particular peru and bolivia , and it 's moved across the world , " he said .
" and the reason it 's done that is because it 's adaptable and it has adapted to a wide range of climates .
" the focus is on it at the moment because , particularly in developing countries , it 's one of those crops that people can grow in the countryside and sell in the cities for cash .
" people want to eat potatoes , they find it very convenient , particularly in the form of chips and crisps and so on - snack foods . "
prof gregory added that the potato industry in scotland was worth several hundreds of millions of pounds .
the money is brought in by the varieties that people eat and also because the country produces high quality seed potatoes which sell at a good price on the international markets .

the drugs - bevacizumab , sorafenib , sunitinib and temsirolimus - do not offer value for money , according to draft guidelines for england and wales .
some experts reacted angrily to the decision , saying it left them with little option for treating patients .
more than 7,000 people are diagnosed with kidney cancer annually in the uk .

professor john wagstaff , from the south wales cancer institute , said there was " no point " in him accepting referrals for people with advanced kidney cancer as around 75 % of them " do not gain any real benefit " from interferon .

the drugs - bevacizumab , sorafenib , sunitinib and temsirolimus - do not offer value for money , according to draft guidelines for england and wales .
some experts reacted angrily to the decision , saying it left them with little option for treating patients .
more than 7,000 people are diagnosed with kidney cancer annually in the uk .
of these , around 1,700 patients will be diagnosed with advanced kidney cancer .
if these treatments were provided on the nhs , other patients would lose out on treatments that are both clinically and cost effective professor peter littlejohns , nice ' we 'd sell our house for this drug ' although there are treatments available , none of them " cure " advanced renal cell carcinoma or cancer that has spread from the initial tumour .
but they can help extend a patients ' life by around five to six months .
the drugs which also go by the names avastin -lrb- bevacizumab -rrb- , nexavar -lrb- sorafenib -rrb- , sutent -lrb- sunitinib -rrb- and torisel -lrb- temsirolimus -rrb- were found by the national institute of health and clinical excellence -lrb- nice -rrb- to provide " significant gains " in survival .
however , further analysis showed they did not meet nice criteria for " cost-effectiveness " .
the nhs in scotland has already advised against the use of three of the drugs , and an application has never been made for temsirolimus .
a decision has yet to be taken in northern ireland .
the draft guidelines for england and wales , which are subject to appeal , recommended people already on the drugs should be able to continue therapy .

pat hanlon from kidney cancer uk says the treatment provides a ' considerable benefit ' .
charities and some experts expressed outrage at the decision , saying it left patients only one treatment option - interferon - to which many do not respond .
professor john wagstaff , from the south wales cancer institute , said there was " no point " in him accepting referrals for people with advanced kidney cancer as around 75 % of them " do not gain any real benefit " from interferon .
the only other option was to make patients comfortable in their last months of life .
professor peter johnson , from cancer research uk , said the drugs had shown a small but definite improvement in an illness where there are few alternative treatments .
have your say these drugs are available to patients in europe .
why should people in the uk be denied them ?
joanna , twickenham send us your comments " this decision once again raises questions about whether nice 's system of appraisal is appropriate for all types of drugs .
" although we understand that nice often has to make difficult decisions , in this case there is a clear separation between what nice finds to be valuable treatment , and clinical and patient opinion . "
but professor peter littlejohns , clinical and public health director at nice , said nhs resources were " not limitless " and hard choices had to be made .
cost to the nhs the drugs cost between £ 20,000 to £ 35,000 a year per patient that equates to between £ 71,500 to £ 171,300 for every year of healthy life gained " nice has to decide what treatments represent best value to the patient as well as the nhs .
" although these treatments are clinically effective , regrettably , the cost to the nhs is such that they are not a cost-effective use of nhs resources . "
he said they would consider proposals from manufacturers to reduce the cost of the drugs once it had been approved by the department of health .
