fischer boel spent monday with eu agriculture ministers in brussels outlining her proposals to reform the bloc 's common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- .

britain 's finance minister , alistair darling , called for europe to fundamentally reform its agricultural policy .
britain has argued that the current food crisis shows the need to liberalize laws .
all elements that keep prices above world market levels should be phased out , darling said last week .
those measures cost eu consumers 43 billion euros -lrb- $ 67 billion -rrb- in 2006 , he said .
darling also said he wants the eu to stop direct payments to farmers , which he said cost taxpayers an additional 34 billion euros in 2006 .
" barriers and distortions in the global food market increase volatility and stifle the incentives to increase supply to match demand , " he argued .
germany wants farmers protected slovenian agriculture minister iztok jarc , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , refused to comment on britain 's position , saying only that " there are many reasons for high food prices , so i would n't make a direct connection to the cap . "
" we do n't only have a problem with food prices , we also have the problem of climate change and high energy prices .
it 's a combination of all factors , " he said .
germany and france are against liberalization .
they say the current upswing in food prices show the importance of not liberalizing too much .
germany 's agriculture minister , horst seehofer , argues that " we have to make sure that we can provide this continent with food sustainability .
this can not be done by taking away subsidies from european farmers . "

while fischer boel said she wants to see more money go towards environmental projects and less towards direct subsidy payments , she backed away from an earlier suggestion that subsidies to larger farms be capped .
that caused an outcry from germany and britain .
global food prices have nearly doubled in three years , according to the world bank .
the situation in developing countries has been of particular concern since higher costs have sparked riots and restrictions on food exports .
the cap proposals will go to eu member states and the european parliament for consideration in the second half of 2008 , during france 's eu presidency .

cost increases have a variety of causes including biofuel , trade constraints , increased demand from asia to serve changing diets , poor harvests and increasing transport costs .
if the cap reforms succeed in putting more land into production , it would be a reversal of past reform efforts , which have tried to reign in production .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 20.05.2008 landmark trial pushed germany to tackle nazi past großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defendants lived normal lives in the midst of german society for years fifty years ago , a trial against 10 members of a nazi commando in the city of ulm , changed the way west germany dealt with its fascist past and crack down on crimes committed by the nazis . from july 28 to august 29 , 1958 , 10 men from a special nazi commando , " tilsit , " went on trial in the west german city of ulm in the state of baden-wuerttemberg .
the so-called ulm einsatzgruppen trial , one of the largest in a west german court that centered on the mass murder of jews , accused the men , gestapo and ss members , of killing more than 5,000 jewish men , women and children in lithuania .
the proceedings revealed gruesome crimes and showed that many of the perpetrators continued to live normal lives in west germany for years after the war , their murderous campaign largely undetected .
the trial is considered a major break with how germany dealt with its nazi past until then .
dw-world.de spoke to dieter pohl , a historian and lecturer at the institute for contemporary history in munich , about the historic trial 50 years ago .
dw-world.de : the ulm einsatzgruppen trial is considered a turning point in how germany dealt with its nazi past .
why is that ?
dieter pohl : the bulk of the nazi war crime trials took place right after 1945 .
basically , from 1945 to 1949 , there were parallel allied tribunals and german courts .
the german courts largely dealt with crimes committed against german citizens ; the allied courts dealt with all others , which meant the majority of nazi crimes .
these proceedings petered out by the end of the 1940s and early 1950s largely because west german society suppressed the past and preferred not to talk about it .
nazi crimes hardly found mention in public discourse in the early 1950s . thus the ulm trial in 1958 marked the reopening of criminal proceedings against nazi criminals .
it was seen as a sign that the west german judicial system was taking the nazi past more seriously . but the most striking thing about the ulm trial was that it made clear that nazi atrocities were not just committed within the third reich but largely in eastern europe .
the 10 defendants in the ulm trial stood accused of murdering more than 5,000 jewish men , women and children .
who were these men ?
were they cold-blooded killers or just " ordinary men " ?
no , they certainly were n't average germans .
they were members of the gestapo in tilsit -lsb- editor 's note : the now russian town of sovetsk -rsb- on the northeastern tip of the third reich , some were even long-time ss members .
they were largely career policemen , people who usually joined the crime force and then went on to join the gestapo during the 1930s .
usually the leading personnel involved die-hard nazis - people who joined the nsdap relatively early , actively supported the nazi ideology and cracked down on the opponents of the ideology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the dock - some of the defendants in the ulm trial right after the wehrmacht 's invasion of the soviet union on june 22 , 1941 , the gestapo tilsit followed with small commandos , entered western lithuanian territory and began shooting jews .
this was where the first mass murder of jews in the so-called " final solution " took place on june 24 , 1941 , just two days after the beginning of the german campaign in the town of garsden .
the commandos largely targeted young jewish men old enough to join the army ; women and children were only killed in exceptions .
the crimes set the stage for what followed in the entire occupied soviet union over the next two years - large massacres of jewish communities with all the brutalities that went with it .
how did the ulm trial come about ? actually due to sheer coincidence .
one of the main defendants , bernhard fischer-schweder , the police chief in memel , lithuania , in 1941 and involved in the murder of thousands of jews , assumed a false name after 1945 and was appointed director of a refugee shelter near ulm in 1955 .
he was fired when his past came to light .
when he was refused another public sector job , fischer-schweder filed a lawsuit in a labor court .
a survivor of fischer-schweder 's murderous campaign in lithuania came across a newspaper article about the court case and identified him , revealing details about his past .
that provided the trigger for the trial .
unfortunately , most cases against nazi criminals at the time came into being this way .
a surviving victim usually happened to discover a perpetrator and then filed a lawsuit against him .
what kind of an atmosphere did the trial take place in ?
how was it viewed by the west germans and the justice system ?
the trial came at a time when much of the german population simply wanted to draw a line under the past .
after several years of allied rule and a constant focus on the nazi past , most people simply did n't want to hear about it anymore .
the judicial system in germany was partly shocked to see that severely incriminated perpetrators of nazi crimes had managed to get away without facing any criminal proceedings .
it was largely the then state prosecutor of baden-wuerttemberg , erwin schuele , who personally fought for the trial to take place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nuremberg war crimes trials in 1945 are well known but at the same time , germany 's judicial system in the 1950s was n't particularly interested in pursuing nazi crimes .
that had partly to do with the nazi-weary mentality of the time .
another major reason for the reluctance to crack down on nazi abuses was that there were quite a few lawyers and state prosecutors who had previously been members of the nazi party .
the presence of so many former nazis in the german judicial system gathered force in the 1950s , because many who underwent denazification and were dismissed from public service earlier reentered the system in the early 1950s .
yet ulm did command immense media attention in the federal republic of germany .
it was n't the first trial of its kind but it was certainly the most elaborate and most publicized of the time .
usually , with the exception of the big nazi war crime trials in allied tribunals , only a few regional and local papers reported about such cases .
in the 1950s especially , such trials hardly sparked any nationwide attention .
the defendants in the ulm trial were given relatively light prison sentences of between three and 15 years . why was that ?
the main problem that plagued all nazi war crime trials right up to the 1980s was the development of the so-called " accessory to murder " construct .
normally , a murderer is punished with a life sentence .
but most of the courts accepted that the main perpetrators of the mass murder of jews were the nazi leadership - hitler , himmler and others .
all the others were thus not considered murderers who killed jews out of a deep sense of personal motivation but rather simply helpers who aided in the crime .
that 's why the majority of nazi criminals were sentenced for being an accessory to murder .
it was only in cases where it could be proven that someone had committed crimes out of a sense of personal conviction that a life sentence was issued .
this strategy was strongly criticized in the 1960s and also proved to be wrong , because the courts were largely dealing with committed nazis and anti-semites .
another reason was that it was difficult to reconstruct crimes committed 10 or 12 years previously and build up cases with the help of eye witnesses that would eventually lead to court proceedings .
but the biggest problem was that the majority of the german population was simply not interested in tackling the past , and the authorities lacked the will to pursue people who committed atrocities under the nazis .
how were the sentences received in germany and abroad ?
there was certainly a resonance in the us and in israel , and i imagine there may have been some disappointments , particularly among jews .
in germany , reaction was divided because a liberal segment in society was deeply interested in the trial in the late 1950s and followed it critically .
but the majority of the german population at the time simply did n't want anything to do with it .
it 's true , the sentences in the ulm trial were very light .
there is hardly any person accused of crimes under the nazis who served out the entirety of the sentence issued in the federal republic of germany .
what effect did the ulm einsatzgruppen trial have on west germany 's efforts to bring nazi war criminals to justice ?
one of the most important and immediate political fall-outs of the ulm trial was that justice ministers in west germany , spurred on by the realization that many grave nazi crimes in eastern europe were left uninvestigated , completely reversed the existing investigation procedure .
they no longer relied on coincidences to bring nazi crimes to light but rather on systematically investigating them .
that was the immediate trigger for the establishment of a unique central authority in ludwigsburg to compile , coordinate and investigate all types of crimes committed under the nazis .
beyond that , the ulm trial was only a brief shock for the german population .
the real jolt came with the adolf eichmann arrest and trial and the auschwitz trial in frankfurt in 1963 .
the general awareness in the german population that most nazi crimes were committed in eastern europe and that the murderers live among us in society only sank in later . interview : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

how did the ulm trial come about ? actually due to sheer coincidence .
one of the main defendants , bernhard fischer-schweder , the police chief in memel , lithuania , in 1941 and involved in the murder of thousands of jews , assumed a false name after 1945 and was appointed director of a refugee shelter near ulm in 1955 .
he was fired when his past came to light .
when he was refused another public sector job , fischer-schweder filed a lawsuit in a labor court .
a survivor of fischer-schweder 's murderous campaign in lithuania came across a newspaper article about the court case and identified him , revealing details about his past .
that provided the trigger for the trial .
unfortunately , most cases against nazi criminals at the time came into being this way .
a surviving victim usually happened to discover a perpetrator and then filed a lawsuit against him .
what kind of an atmosphere did the trial take place in ?
how was it viewed by the west germans and the justice system ?
the trial came at a time when much of the german population simply wanted to draw a line under the past .
after several years of allied rule and a constant focus on the nazi past , most people simply did n't want to hear about it anymore .
the judicial system in germany was partly shocked to see that severely incriminated perpetrators of nazi crimes had managed to get away without facing any criminal proceedings .
it was largely the then state prosecutor of baden-wuerttemberg , erwin schuele , who personally fought for the trial to take place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nuremberg war crimes trials in 1945 are well known but at the same time , germany 's judicial system in the 1950s was n't particularly interested in pursuing nazi crimes .
that had partly to do with the nazi-weary mentality of the time .
another major reason for the reluctance to crack down on nazi abuses was that there were quite a few lawyers and state prosecutors who had previously been members of the nazi party .
the presence of so many former nazis in the german judicial system gathered force in the 1950s , because many who underwent denazification and were dismissed from public service earlier reentered the system in the early 1950s .
yet ulm did command immense media attention in the federal republic of germany .
it was n't the first trial of its kind but it was certainly the most elaborate and most publicized of the time .
usually , with the exception of the big nazi war crime trials in allied tribunals , only a few regional and local papers reported about such cases .
in the 1950s especially , such trials hardly sparked any nationwide attention .
the defendants in the ulm trial were given relatively light prison sentences of between three and 15 years . why was that ?
the main problem that plagued all nazi war crime trials right up to the 1980s was the development of the so-called " accessory to murder " construct .
normally , a murderer is punished with a life sentence .
but most of the courts accepted that the main perpetrators of the mass murder of jews were the nazi leadership - hitler , himmler and others .
all the others were thus not considered murderers who killed jews out of a deep sense of personal motivation but rather simply helpers who aided in the crime .
that 's why the majority of nazi criminals were sentenced for being an accessory to murder .
it was only in cases where it could be proven that someone had committed crimes out of a sense of personal conviction that a life sentence was issued .
this strategy was strongly criticized in the 1960s and also proved to be wrong , because the courts were largely dealing with committed nazis and anti-semites .
another reason was that it was difficult to reconstruct crimes committed 10 or 12 years previously and build up cases with the help of eye witnesses that would eventually lead to court proceedings .
but the biggest problem was that the majority of the german population was simply not interested in tackling the past , and the authorities lacked the will to pursue people who committed atrocities under the nazis .
how were the sentences received in germany and abroad ?
there was certainly a resonance in the us and in israel , and i imagine there may have been some disappointments , particularly among jews .
in germany , reaction was divided because a liberal segment in society was deeply interested in the trial in the late 1950s and followed it critically .
but the majority of the german population at the time simply did n't want anything to do with it .
it 's true , the sentences in the ulm trial were very light .
there is hardly any person accused of crimes under the nazis who served out the entirety of the sentence issued in the federal republic of germany .
what effect did the ulm einsatzgruppen trial have on west germany 's efforts to bring nazi war criminals to justice ?
one of the most important and immediate political fall-outs of the ulm trial was that justice ministers in west germany , spurred on by the realization that many grave nazi crimes in eastern europe were left uninvestigated , completely reversed the existing investigation procedure .
they no longer relied on coincidences to bring nazi crimes to light but rather on systematically investigating them .
that was the immediate trigger for the establishment of a unique central authority in ludwigsburg to compile , coordinate and investigate all types of crimes committed under the nazis .
beyond that , the ulm trial was only a brief shock for the german population .

the so-called ulm einsatzgruppen trial , one of the largest in a west german court that centered on the mass murder of jews , accused the men , gestapo and ss members , of killing more than 5,000 jewish men , women and children in lithuania .
the proceedings revealed gruesome crimes and showed that many of the perpetrators continued to live normal lives in west germany for years after the war , their murderous campaign largely undetected .
the trial is considered a major break with how germany dealt with its nazi past until then .
dw-world.de spoke to dieter pohl , a historian and lecturer at the institute for contemporary history in munich , about the historic trial 50 years ago .
dw-world.de : the ulm einsatzgruppen trial is considered a turning point in how germany dealt with its nazi past .
why is that ?
dieter pohl : the bulk of the nazi war crime trials took place right after 1945 .
basically , from 1945 to 1949 , there were parallel allied tribunals and german courts .
the german courts largely dealt with crimes committed against german citizens ; the allied courts dealt with all others , which meant the majority of nazi crimes .
these proceedings petered out by the end of the 1940s and early 1950s largely because west german society suppressed the past and preferred not to talk about it .
nazi crimes hardly found mention in public discourse in the early 1950s . thus the ulm trial in 1958 marked the reopening of criminal proceedings against nazi criminals .
it was seen as a sign that the west german judicial system was taking the nazi past more seriously . but the most striking thing about the ulm trial was that it made clear that nazi atrocities were not just committed within the third reich but largely in eastern europe .
the 10 defendants in the ulm trial stood accused of murdering more than 5,000 jewish men , women and children .
who were these men ?
were they cold-blooded killers or just " ordinary men " ?
no , they certainly were n't average germans .
they were members of the gestapo in tilsit -lsb- editor 's note : the now russian town of sovetsk -rsb- on the northeastern tip of the third reich , some were even long-time ss members .
they were largely career policemen , people who usually joined the crime force and then went on to join the gestapo during the 1930s .
usually the leading personnel involved die-hard nazis - people who joined the nsdap relatively early , actively supported the nazi ideology and cracked down on the opponents of the ideology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the dock - some of the defendants in the ulm trial right after the wehrmacht 's invasion of the soviet union on june 22 , 1941 , the gestapo tilsit followed with small commandos , entered western lithuanian territory and began shooting jews .
this was where the first mass murder of jews in the so-called " final solution " took place on june 24 , 1941 , just two days after the beginning of the german campaign in the town of garsden .
the commandos largely targeted young jewish men old enough to join the army ; women and children were only killed in exceptions .
the crimes set the stage for what followed in the entire occupied soviet union over the next two years - large massacres of jewish communities with all the brutalities that went with it .
how did the ulm trial come about ? actually due to sheer coincidence .

the so-called ulm einsatzgruppen trial , one of the largest in a west german court that centered on the mass murder of jews , accused the men , gestapo and ss members , of killing more than 5,000 jewish men , women and children in lithuania .
the proceedings revealed gruesome crimes and showed that many of the perpetrators continued to live normal lives in west germany for years after the war , their murderous campaign largely undetected .
the trial is considered a major break with how germany dealt with its nazi past until then .
dw-world.de spoke to dieter pohl , a historian and lecturer at the institute for contemporary history in munich , about the historic trial 50 years ago .
dw-world.de : the ulm einsatzgruppen trial is considered a turning point in how germany dealt with its nazi past .
why is that ?
dieter pohl : the bulk of the nazi war crime trials took place right after 1945 .
basically , from 1945 to 1949 , there were parallel allied tribunals and german courts .
the german courts largely dealt with crimes committed against german citizens ; the allied courts dealt with all others , which meant the majority of nazi crimes .
these proceedings petered out by the end of the 1940s and early 1950s largely because west german society suppressed the past and preferred not to talk about it .
nazi crimes hardly found mention in public discourse in the early 1950s . thus the ulm trial in 1958 marked the reopening of criminal proceedings against nazi criminals .
it was seen as a sign that the west german judicial system was taking the nazi past more seriously . but the most striking thing about the ulm trial was that it made clear that nazi atrocities were not just committed within the third reich but largely in eastern europe .
the 10 defendants in the ulm trial stood accused of murdering more than 5,000 jewish men , women and children .
who were these men ?
were they cold-blooded killers or just " ordinary men " ?
no , they certainly were n't average germans .
they were members of the gestapo in tilsit -lsb- editor 's note : the now russian town of sovetsk -rsb- on the northeastern tip of the third reich , some were even long-time ss members .
they were largely career policemen , people who usually joined the crime force and then went on to join the gestapo during the 1930s .
usually the leading personnel involved die-hard nazis - people who joined the nsdap relatively early , actively supported the nazi ideology and cracked down on the opponents of the ideology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the dock - some of the defendants in the ulm trial right after the wehrmacht 's invasion of the soviet union on june 22 , 1941 , the gestapo tilsit followed with small commandos , entered western lithuanian territory and began shooting jews .
this was where the first mass murder of jews in the so-called " final solution " took place on june 24 , 1941 , just two days after the beginning of the german campaign in the town of garsden .
the commandos largely targeted young jewish men old enough to join the army ; women and children were only killed in exceptions .
the crimes set the stage for what followed in the entire occupied soviet union over the next two years - large massacres of jewish communities with all the brutalities that went with it .
how did the ulm trial come about ? actually due to sheer coincidence .
one of the main defendants , bernhard fischer-schweder , the police chief in memel , lithuania , in 1941 and involved in the murder of thousands of jews , assumed a false name after 1945 and was appointed director of a refugee shelter near ulm in 1955 .
he was fired when his past came to light .
when he was refused another public sector job , fischer-schweder filed a lawsuit in a labor court .
a survivor of fischer-schweder 's murderous campaign in lithuania came across a newspaper article about the court case and identified him , revealing details about his past .
that provided the trigger for the trial .
unfortunately , most cases against nazi criminals at the time came into being this way .
a surviving victim usually happened to discover a perpetrator and then filed a lawsuit against him .
what kind of an atmosphere did the trial take place in ?
how was it viewed by the west germans and the justice system ?
the trial came at a time when much of the german population simply wanted to draw a line under the past .
after several years of allied rule and a constant focus on the nazi past , most people simply did n't want to hear about it anymore .
the judicial system in germany was partly shocked to see that severely incriminated perpetrators of nazi crimes had managed to get away without facing any criminal proceedings .
it was largely the then state prosecutor of baden-wuerttemberg , erwin schuele , who personally fought for the trial to take place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nuremberg war crimes trials in 1945 are well known but at the same time , germany 's judicial system in the 1950s was n't particularly interested in pursuing nazi crimes .
that had partly to do with the nazi-weary mentality of the time .
another major reason for the reluctance to crack down on nazi abuses was that there were quite a few lawyers and state prosecutors who had previously been members of the nazi party .
the presence of so many former nazis in the german judicial system gathered force in the 1950s , because many who underwent denazification and were dismissed from public service earlier reentered the system in the early 1950s .
yet ulm did command immense media attention in the federal republic of germany .
it was n't the first trial of its kind but it was certainly the most elaborate and most publicized of the time .
usually , with the exception of the big nazi war crime trials in allied tribunals , only a few regional and local papers reported about such cases .
in the 1950s especially , such trials hardly sparked any nationwide attention .
the defendants in the ulm trial were given relatively light prison sentences of between three and 15 years . why was that ?
the main problem that plagued all nazi war crime trials right up to the 1980s was the development of the so-called " accessory to murder " construct .
normally , a murderer is punished with a life sentence .
but most of the courts accepted that the main perpetrators of the mass murder of jews were the nazi leadership - hitler , himmler and others .
all the others were thus not considered murderers who killed jews out of a deep sense of personal motivation but rather simply helpers who aided in the crime .
that 's why the majority of nazi criminals were sentenced for being an accessory to murder .
it was only in cases where it could be proven that someone had committed crimes out of a sense of personal conviction that a life sentence was issued .
this strategy was strongly criticized in the 1960s and also proved to be wrong , because the courts were largely dealing with committed nazis and anti-semites .
another reason was that it was difficult to reconstruct crimes committed 10 or 12 years previously and build up cases with the help of eye witnesses that would eventually lead to court proceedings .
but the biggest problem was that the majority of the german population was simply not interested in tackling the past , and the authorities lacked the will to pursue people who committed atrocities under the nazis .
how were the sentences received in germany and abroad ?
there was certainly a resonance in the us and in israel , and i imagine there may have been some disappointments , particularly among jews .
in germany , reaction was divided because a liberal segment in society was deeply interested in the trial in the late 1950s and followed it critically .
but the majority of the german population at the time simply did n't want anything to do with it .
it 's true , the sentences in the ulm trial were very light .
there is hardly any person accused of crimes under the nazis who served out the entirety of the sentence issued in the federal republic of germany .
what effect did the ulm einsatzgruppen trial have on west germany 's efforts to bring nazi war criminals to justice ?
one of the most important and immediate political fall-outs of the ulm trial was that justice ministers in west germany , spurred on by the realization that many grave nazi crimes in eastern europe were left uninvestigated , completely reversed the existing investigation procedure .
they no longer relied on coincidences to bring nazi crimes to light but rather on systematically investigating them .
that was the immediate trigger for the establishment of a unique central authority in ludwigsburg to compile , coordinate and investigate all types of crimes committed under the nazis .
beyond that , the ulm trial was only a brief shock for the german population .
the real jolt came with the adolf eichmann arrest and trial and the auschwitz trial in frankfurt in 1963 .
the general awareness in the german population that most nazi crimes were committed in eastern europe and that the murderers live among us in society only sank in later . interview : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but most of the courts accepted that the main perpetrators of the mass murder of jews were the nazi leadership - hitler , himmler and others .
all the others were thus not considered murderers who killed jews out of a deep sense of personal motivation but rather simply helpers who aided in the crime .
that 's why the majority of nazi criminals were sentenced for being an accessory to murder .
it was only in cases where it could be proven that someone had committed crimes out of a sense of personal conviction that a life sentence was issued .
this strategy was strongly criticized in the 1960s and also proved to be wrong , because the courts were largely dealing with committed nazis and anti-semites .
another reason was that it was difficult to reconstruct crimes committed 10 or 12 years previously and build up cases with the help of eye witnesses that would eventually lead to court proceedings .
but the biggest problem was that the majority of the german population was simply not interested in tackling the past , and the authorities lacked the will to pursue people who committed atrocities under the nazis .
how were the sentences received in germany and abroad ?
there was certainly a resonance in the us and in israel , and i imagine there may have been some disappointments , particularly among jews .
in germany , reaction was divided because a liberal segment in society was deeply interested in the trial in the late 1950s and followed it critically .
but the majority of the german population at the time simply did n't want anything to do with it .
it 's true , the sentences in the ulm trial were very light .
there is hardly any person accused of crimes under the nazis who served out the entirety of the sentence issued in the federal republic of germany .
what effect did the ulm einsatzgruppen trial have on west germany 's efforts to bring nazi war criminals to justice ?
one of the most important and immediate political fall-outs of the ulm trial was that justice ministers in west germany , spurred on by the realization that many grave nazi crimes in eastern europe were left uninvestigated , completely reversed the existing investigation procedure .
they no longer relied on coincidences to bring nazi crimes to light but rather on systematically investigating them .
that was the immediate trigger for the establishment of a unique central authority in ludwigsburg to compile , coordinate and investigate all types of crimes committed under the nazis .
beyond that , the ulm trial was only a brief shock for the german population .
the real jolt came with the adolf eichmann arrest and trial and the auschwitz trial in frankfurt in 1963 .
the general awareness in the german population that most nazi crimes were committed in eastern europe and that the murderers live among us in society only sank in later . interview : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it falls short of what sponsor france originally wanted . the european commission laid out its views in strasbourg on tuesday , may 20 . the project is open to all eu member states as well as countries from north africa , the middle east and the balkans and includes the palestinian authorities . this is an initiative to reinforce , to reinvigorate our relationship , " eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said at a press conference .
" the more we can develop the region in the south , the less illegal migration there will be … the more prosperity we can give , the less terrorism , the less criminality will be there . " potential tasks for the new union will be to open new sea traffic routes , clean up mediterranean waters , improve maritime security and exploit solar power in northern africa to help meet europe 's energy needs . slight to sarkozy ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new union could help better regulate mediterranean waters but the association described by the eu falls short of what france - and in particular french president nicolas sarkozy - had envisioned . sarkozy had hoped for a much more tightly knit alliance restricted to territories with mediterranean shores .
he had touted his vision as a potential avenue for peace between israel and the palestinians and had hinted it might be offered to turkey as an alternative to eu membership . but those plans were scaled back after objections by powerful eu states not actually bordering the mediterranean , including germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy was unable to win over the rest of the eu turkey also only agreed to participate , if offered assurances that the union was not being put forward as an alternative to joining the eu - something the commission explicitly stated on tuesday . " this project is not directed against turkey , " ferrero-waldner said . the eu also scaled back the bureaucracy for the union and the frequency with which it will meet , making it essentially a new umbrella organization for an already existing euro-mediterranean partnership known as the barcelona process . the inaugural summit for the new bloc is scheduled for mid-july in paris . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we can do many things wrong here -lsb- in latin america -rsb- if we do not pay attention to it , " merkel said .
" however , we can do many things right , and secure many jobs in germany , if we build long-term partnerships . "
no concrete details of the agreement were made public , although merkel said the first step would be an analysis of how the rising living standards in emerging countries are influencing the situation regarding foodstuffs .
mexico says production boost needed in a joint press conference with merkel , calderon called for a massive increase in food production around the world .
he stressed that a " very aggressive production boost " is needed and blamed the food scarcity on stronger demand in china and india but also on the massive use of corn by the united states to boost its ethanol production .
the rise in the price of corn , a staple in the mexican diet across all sectors of society , has caused particular worry in mexico in recent months .
neighboring countries like haiti and honduras have even seen violent riots in a reaction to rising food prices - as have other countries round the world .
merkel , who arrived in mexico late sunday , was given an official welcome at the central courtyard of the national palace , prior to a mexico and germany economic forum .
calderon attended last year 's g8 summit in heiligendamm , germany , alongside the leaders of a group of emerging countries such as brazil , india , south africa and china .
according to figures made public by the mexican-german chamber of commerce and industry , over 1,000 german firms are currently active in mexico , and the volume of trade between the two countries is almost $ 14 billion -lrb- 8.9 billion euros -rrb- a year . dpa news agency -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we can do many things wrong here -lsb- in latin america -rsb- if we do not pay attention to it , " merkel said .
" however , we can do many things right , and secure many jobs in germany , if we build long-term partnerships . "
no concrete details of the agreement were made public , although merkel said the first step would be an analysis of how the rising living standards in emerging countries are influencing the situation regarding foodstuffs .
mexico says production boost needed in a joint press conference with merkel , calderon called for a massive increase in food production around the world .
he stressed that a " very aggressive production boost " is needed and blamed the food scarcity on stronger demand in china and india but also on the massive use of corn by the united states to boost its ethanol production .
the rise in the price of corn , a staple in the mexican diet across all sectors of society , has caused particular worry in mexico in recent months .
neighboring countries like haiti and honduras have even seen violent riots in a reaction to rising food prices - as have other countries round the world .
merkel , who arrived in mexico late sunday , was given an official welcome at the central courtyard of the national palace , prior to a mexico and germany economic forum .
calderon attended last year 's g8 summit in heiligendamm , germany , alongside the leaders of a group of emerging countries such as brazil , india , south africa and china .
according to figures made public by the mexican-german chamber of commerce and industry , over 1,000 german firms are currently active in mexico , and the volume of trade between the two countries is almost $ 14 billion -lrb- 8.9 billion euros -rrb- a year . dpa news agency -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

by agreeing on general principles to create a coalition last thursday , may 15 , they could even form the country 's next government - despite the fact that the pro-european party of serbian president boris tadic actually won early parliamentary elections on may 11 .

belgrade , with its two million residents and a very active nightlife , provides a suitable background for the event .

by agreeing on general principles to create a coalition last thursday , may 15 , they could even form the country 's next government - despite the fact that the pro-european party of serbian president boris tadic actually won early parliamentary elections on may 11 .
but tadic 's party has failed to find a coalition partner so far . amid this tense and anti-european political situation , serbia 's getting ready to host a truly european event - the eurovision song contest . the event 's organizers do n't want to let the situation spoil the mood and have been trying to ban political debate from the show .

" participants represent their countries , not their governments , " said sandra susa , who 's responsible for organizing the contest .
" we 're calling on serbian and foreign media to set politics aside .
we 're here to have fun , because belgrade 's the only place to have that much fun . " friendly ambassadors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serifovic -lrb- left -rrb- has supported ultra-nationalist tomislav nikolic -lrb- right -rrb- in elections the eurovision song contest , which will have 43 participating countries this year , is coming to the serbian capital for the first time .
that 's because serbia 's marija serifovic won the competition last year with her song " molitva " -lrb- prayer -rrb- in helsinki , finland . incidentally , serifovic herself also raised some eyebrows earlier this year when she appeared at election rallies for serbia 's ultra-nationalist radical party - despite being appointed a european ambassador for intercultural dialogue by the european commission . be that as it may , the serbs want to make a good impression and be good hosts to their visitors .
belgrade , with its two million residents and a very active nightlife , provides a suitable background for the event .
but susa 's not just focusing on showing belgrade to the tourists . " the song contest gives belgrade , serbia and all of us a great opportunity to show our organizational talents and our hospitality , " she said .
" it could change serbia 's image in the world . " european onslaught everything 's meant to be perfect at belgrade 's arena , one of europe 's largest concert and sports venues .
the final on may 24 as well as the two semi-finals on may 20 and may 22 are being rehearsed down to the last detail .
tickets for the shows have been sold out , thanks to low prices : the most expensive ones cost 60 euros -lrb- $ 93 -rrb- . bildunterschrift : belgrade 's ready for europe - at least this week but even those fans who did n't manage to get tickets will be able to participate in the communal excitement as public viewing screens have been set up at belgrade 's large city hall square . the city is preparing for a major onslaught : some 1,500 participants , more than 3,500 journalists and about 15,000 visitors from all over europe are expected .
hotels are fully booked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german group " no angels " hopes to break the spell this year and bring home the trophy " we 'll party a lot , " said jelena tomasevic , who will represent her country with " oro , " a favorite among eurovision internet forums . before that , she 'll first hope to hear those magic words that every eurovision contestant dreams about : " twelve points go to … " it 's the highest score each country can hand out and helps to decide the winner . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the hard part will be deciding how to best reform the system . current european union agricultural policy encourages farmers to keep land fallow , a practice that seems to contradict the rising global demand for food .
the eu seems likely to acknowledge it needs to put more land into production when it announces agricultural reforms on tuesday , may 20 .

" i think it 's important that we continue to increase production in europe as much as we can within the natural limits , also taking into account environmental care , " agriculture and rural development commissioner mariann fischer boel told the dpa news agency .
fischer boel spent monday with eu agriculture ministers in brussels outlining her proposals to reform the bloc 's common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- .
yet the road to reforming the cap is likely to be long and riddled with obstacles .
even the relatively modest changes boel has proposed to direct farm subsidies are likely to be met with fierce resistance , particularly from france , which is the biggest recipient of agricultural aid .
britain calls for liberalization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer boel wants to increase production of some crops britain and some other member states would like to see the eu go even further in reforming its subsidies .
britain 's finance minister , alistair darling , called for europe to fundamentally reform its agricultural policy .
britain has argued that the current food crisis shows the need to liberalize laws .
all elements that keep prices above world market levels should be phased out , darling said last week .
those measures cost eu consumers 43 billion euros -lrb- $ 67 billion -rrb- in 2006 , he said .
darling also said he wants the eu to stop direct payments to farmers , which he said cost taxpayers an additional 34 billion euros in 2006 .
" barriers and distortions in the global food market increase volatility and stifle the incentives to increase supply to match demand , " he argued .
germany wants farmers protected slovenian agriculture minister iztok jarc , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , refused to comment on britain 's position , saying only that " there are many reasons for high food prices , so i would n't make a direct connection to the cap . "
" we do n't only have a problem with food prices , we also have the problem of climate change and high energy prices .
it 's a combination of all factors , " he said .
germany and france are against liberalization .
they say the current upswing in food prices show the importance of not liberalizing too much .
germany 's agriculture minister , horst seehofer , argues that " we have to make sure that we can provide this continent with food sustainability .
this can not be done by taking away subsidies from european farmers . "
long road ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposed changes could bring protests from farmers besides no longer paying farmers to leave land fallow , the eu proposals also call for phasing out quotas on milk production .
some observers have also guessed the eu will propose ending the extra bonuses given to farmers who grow crops which can be converted into fuel .
while fischer boel said she wants to see more money go towards environmental projects and less towards direct subsidy payments , she backed away from an earlier suggestion that subsidies to larger farms be capped .
that caused an outcry from germany and britain .
global food prices have nearly doubled in three years , according to the world bank .
the situation in developing countries has been of particular concern since higher costs have sparked riots and restrictions on food exports .
the cap proposals will go to eu member states and the european parliament for consideration in the second half of 2008 , during france 's eu presidency .
massive subsidies remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france is the biggest recipient of agricultural subsidies although food prices have eased somewhat in recent weeks , they remain at near record levels , with wheat up 84 percent over one year ago , corn up 21 percent , butter up 21 percent and eggs up 17 percent .
cost increases have a variety of causes including biofuel , trade constraints , increased demand from asia to serve changing diets , poor harvests and increasing transport costs .
if the cap reforms succeed in putting more land into production , it would be a reversal of past reform efforts , which have tried to reign in production .
in 2003 , the eu tried to discourage overproduction by " decoupling " subsidies from production .

the hard part will be deciding how to best reform the system . current european union agricultural policy encourages farmers to keep land fallow , a practice that seems to contradict the rising global demand for food .
the eu seems likely to acknowledge it needs to put more land into production when it announces agricultural reforms on tuesday , may 20 .
one solution would be for the eu to phase out its program of paying farmers to keep farmland out of production , hoping that it will help stabilize food prices .
" i think it 's important that we continue to increase production in europe as much as we can within the natural limits , also taking into account environmental care , " agriculture and rural development commissioner mariann fischer boel told the dpa news agency .
fischer boel spent monday with eu agriculture ministers in brussels outlining her proposals to reform the bloc 's common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- .
yet the road to reforming the cap is likely to be long and riddled with obstacles .
even the relatively modest changes boel has proposed to direct farm subsidies are likely to be met with fierce resistance , particularly from france , which is the biggest recipient of agricultural aid .
britain calls for liberalization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer boel wants to increase production of some crops britain and some other member states would like to see the eu go even further in reforming its subsidies .
britain 's finance minister , alistair darling , called for europe to fundamentally reform its agricultural policy .
britain has argued that the current food crisis shows the need to liberalize laws .
all elements that keep prices above world market levels should be phased out , darling said last week .
those measures cost eu consumers 43 billion euros -lrb- $ 67 billion -rrb- in 2006 , he said .
darling also said he wants the eu to stop direct payments to farmers , which he said cost taxpayers an additional 34 billion euros in 2006 .
" barriers and distortions in the global food market increase volatility and stifle the incentives to increase supply to match demand , " he argued .
germany wants farmers protected slovenian agriculture minister iztok jarc , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , refused to comment on britain 's position , saying only that " there are many reasons for high food prices , so i would n't make a direct connection to the cap . "

" we can do many things wrong here -lsb- in latin america -rsb- if we do not pay attention to it , " merkel said .
" however , we can do many things right , and secure many jobs in germany , if we build long-term partnerships . "
no concrete details of the agreement were made public , although merkel said the first step would be an analysis of how the rising living standards in emerging countries are influencing the situation regarding foodstuffs .
mexico says production boost needed in a joint press conference with merkel , calderon called for a massive increase in food production around the world .
he stressed that a " very aggressive production boost " is needed and blamed the food scarcity on stronger demand in china and india but also on the massive use of corn by the united states to boost its ethanol production .
the rise in the price of corn , a staple in the mexican diet across all sectors of society , has caused particular worry in mexico in recent months .
neighboring countries like haiti and honduras have even seen violent riots in a reaction to rising food prices - as have other countries round the world .
merkel , who arrived in mexico late sunday , was given an official welcome at the central courtyard of the national palace , prior to a mexico and germany economic forum .
calderon attended last year 's g8 summit in heiligendamm , germany , alongside the leaders of a group of emerging countries such as brazil , india , south africa and china .
according to figures made public by the mexican-german chamber of commerce and industry , over 1,000 german firms are currently active in mexico , and the volume of trade between the two countries is almost $ 14 billion -lrb- 8.9 billion euros -rrb- a year . dpa news agency -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on dsl , voice traffic is more or less an afterthought . the wired arcor network was established in the 1990s using the german railway system 's own telecommunications lines as a backbone . vodafone chief executive friedrich joussen said vodafone and arcor were currently providing 13 percent of german dsl connections , but the joint company aimed to raise that market share to 20 percent . dpa news agency -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but this week , all serbs will be europe 's biggest fans as the continent 's largest song contest comes to belgrade . serbia 's three anti-european political parties want to move their country away from the european union and towards russia .
by agreeing on general principles to create a coalition last thursday , may 15 , they could even form the country 's next government - despite the fact that the pro-european party of serbian president boris tadic actually won early parliamentary elections on may 11 .
but tadic 's party has failed to find a coalition partner so far . amid this tense and anti-european political situation , serbia 's getting ready to host a truly european event - the eurovision song contest . the event 's organizers do n't want to let the situation spoil the mood and have been trying to ban political debate from the show . " participants represent their countries , not their governments , " said sandra susa , who 's responsible for organizing the contest .

belgrade , with its two million residents and a very active nightlife , provides a suitable background for the event .

on dsl , voice traffic is more or less an afterthought . the wired arcor network was established in the 1990s using the german railway system 's own telecommunications lines as a backbone . vodafone chief executive friedrich joussen said vodafone and arcor were currently providing 13 percent of german dsl connections , but the joint company aimed to raise that market share to 20 percent . dpa news agency -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the hard part will be deciding how to best reform the system . current european union agricultural policy encourages farmers to keep land fallow , a practice that seems to contradict the rising global demand for food .
the eu seems likely to acknowledge it needs to put more land into production when it announces agricultural reforms on tuesday , may 20 .
one solution would be for the eu to phase out its program of paying farmers to keep farmland out of production , hoping that it will help stabilize food prices .
" i think it 's important that we continue to increase production in europe as much as we can within the natural limits , also taking into account environmental care , " agriculture and rural development commissioner mariann fischer boel told the dpa news agency .
fischer boel spent monday with eu agriculture ministers in brussels outlining her proposals to reform the bloc 's common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- .
yet the road to reforming the cap is likely to be long and riddled with obstacles .
even the relatively modest changes boel has proposed to direct farm subsidies are likely to be met with fierce resistance , particularly from france , which is the biggest recipient of agricultural aid .
britain calls for liberalization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer boel wants to increase production of some crops britain and some other member states would like to see the eu go even further in reforming its subsidies .
britain 's finance minister , alistair darling , called for europe to fundamentally reform its agricultural policy .
britain has argued that the current food crisis shows the need to liberalize laws .
all elements that keep prices above world market levels should be phased out , darling said last week .
those measures cost eu consumers 43 billion euros -lrb- $ 67 billion -rrb- in 2006 , he said .
darling also said he wants the eu to stop direct payments to farmers , which he said cost taxpayers an additional 34 billion euros in 2006 .
" barriers and distortions in the global food market increase volatility and stifle the incentives to increase supply to match demand , " he argued .
germany wants farmers protected slovenian agriculture minister iztok jarc , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , refused to comment on britain 's position , saying only that " there are many reasons for high food prices , so i would n't make a direct connection to the cap . "
" we do n't only have a problem with food prices , we also have the problem of climate change and high energy prices .
it 's a combination of all factors , " he said .
germany and france are against liberalization .
they say the current upswing in food prices show the importance of not liberalizing too much .
germany 's agriculture minister , horst seehofer , argues that " we have to make sure that we can provide this continent with food sustainability .
this can not be done by taking away subsidies from european farmers . "
long road ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposed changes could bring protests from farmers besides no longer paying farmers to leave land fallow , the eu proposals also call for phasing out quotas on milk production .
some observers have also guessed the eu will propose ending the extra bonuses given to farmers who grow crops which can be converted into fuel .
while fischer boel said she wants to see more money go towards environmental projects and less towards direct subsidy payments , she backed away from an earlier suggestion that subsidies to larger farms be capped .
that caused an outcry from germany and britain .
global food prices have nearly doubled in three years , according to the world bank .
the situation in developing countries has been of particular concern since higher costs have sparked riots and restrictions on food exports .
the cap proposals will go to eu member states and the european parliament for consideration in the second half of 2008 , during france 's eu presidency .
massive subsidies remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france is the biggest recipient of agricultural subsidies although food prices have eased somewhat in recent weeks , they remain at near record levels , with wheat up 84 percent over one year ago , corn up 21 percent , butter up 21 percent and eggs up 17 percent .
cost increases have a variety of causes including biofuel , trade constraints , increased demand from asia to serve changing diets , poor harvests and increasing transport costs .
if the cap reforms succeed in putting more land into production , it would be a reversal of past reform efforts , which have tried to reign in production .
in 2003 , the eu tried to discourage overproduction by " decoupling " subsidies from production .
despite reforms , farm hand-outs still make up 40 percent of the eu budget , by far the bloc 's biggest spending item . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

britain 's finance minister , alistair darling , called for europe to fundamentally reform its agricultural policy .
britain has argued that the current food crisis shows the need to liberalize laws .
all elements that keep prices above world market levels should be phased out , darling said last week .
those measures cost eu consumers 43 billion euros -lrb- $ 67 billion -rrb- in 2006 , he said .
darling also said he wants the eu to stop direct payments to farmers , which he said cost taxpayers an additional 34 billion euros in 2006 .
" barriers and distortions in the global food market increase volatility and stifle the incentives to increase supply to match demand , " he argued .
germany wants farmers protected slovenian agriculture minister iztok jarc , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , refused to comment on britain 's position , saying only that " there are many reasons for high food prices , so i would n't make a direct connection to the cap . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 20.05.2008 landmark trial pushed germany to tackle nazi past großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defendants lived normal lives in the midst of german society for years fifty years ago , a trial against 10 members of a nazi commando in the city of ulm , changed the way west germany dealt with its fascist past and crack down on crimes committed by the nazis . from july 28 to august 29 , 1958 , 10 men from a special nazi commando , " tilsit , " went on trial in the west german city of ulm in the state of baden-wuerttemberg .
the so-called ulm einsatzgruppen trial , one of the largest in a west german court that centered on the mass murder of jews , accused the men , gestapo and ss members , of killing more than 5,000 jewish men , women and children in lithuania .
the proceedings revealed gruesome crimes and showed that many of the perpetrators continued to live normal lives in west germany for years after the war , their murderous campaign largely undetected .
the trial is considered a major break with how germany dealt with its nazi past until then .
dw-world.de spoke to dieter pohl , a historian and lecturer at the institute for contemporary history in munich , about the historic trial 50 years ago .
dw-world.de : the ulm einsatzgruppen trial is considered a turning point in how germany dealt with its nazi past .
why is that ?
dieter pohl : the bulk of the nazi war crime trials took place right after 1945 .
basically , from 1945 to 1949 , there were parallel allied tribunals and german courts .
the german courts largely dealt with crimes committed against german citizens ; the allied courts dealt with all others , which meant the majority of nazi crimes .
these proceedings petered out by the end of the 1940s and early 1950s largely because west german society suppressed the past and preferred not to talk about it .
nazi crimes hardly found mention in public discourse in the early 1950s . thus the ulm trial in 1958 marked the reopening of criminal proceedings against nazi criminals .
it was seen as a sign that the west german judicial system was taking the nazi past more seriously . but the most striking thing about the ulm trial was that it made clear that nazi atrocities were not just committed within the third reich but largely in eastern europe .
the 10 defendants in the ulm trial stood accused of murdering more than 5,000 jewish men , women and children .
who were these men ?
were they cold-blooded killers or just " ordinary men " ?
no , they certainly were n't average germans .
they were members of the gestapo in tilsit -lsb- editor 's note : the now russian town of sovetsk -rsb- on the northeastern tip of the third reich , some were even long-time ss members .
they were largely career policemen , people who usually joined the crime force and then went on to join the gestapo during the 1930s .
usually the leading personnel involved die-hard nazis - people who joined the nsdap relatively early , actively supported the nazi ideology and cracked down on the opponents of the ideology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the dock - some of the defendants in the ulm trial right after the wehrmacht 's invasion of the soviet union on june 22 , 1941 , the gestapo tilsit followed with small commandos , entered western lithuanian territory and began shooting jews .
this was where the first mass murder of jews in the so-called " final solution " took place on june 24 , 1941 , just two days after the beginning of the german campaign in the town of garsden .
the commandos largely targeted young jewish men old enough to join the army ; women and children were only killed in exceptions .
the crimes set the stage for what followed in the entire occupied soviet union over the next two years - large massacres of jewish communities with all the brutalities that went with it .
how did the ulm trial come about ? actually due to sheer coincidence .
one of the main defendants , bernhard fischer-schweder , the police chief in memel , lithuania , in 1941 and involved in the murder of thousands of jews , assumed a false name after 1945 and was appointed director of a refugee shelter near ulm in 1955 .
he was fired when his past came to light .
when he was refused another public sector job , fischer-schweder filed a lawsuit in a labor court .
a survivor of fischer-schweder 's murderous campaign in lithuania came across a newspaper article about the court case and identified him , revealing details about his past .
that provided the trigger for the trial .
unfortunately , most cases against nazi criminals at the time came into being this way .
a surviving victim usually happened to discover a perpetrator and then filed a lawsuit against him .
what kind of an atmosphere did the trial take place in ?
how was it viewed by the west germans and the justice system ?
the trial came at a time when much of the german population simply wanted to draw a line under the past .
after several years of allied rule and a constant focus on the nazi past , most people simply did n't want to hear about it anymore .
the judicial system in germany was partly shocked to see that severely incriminated perpetrators of nazi crimes had managed to get away without facing any criminal proceedings .
it was largely the then state prosecutor of baden-wuerttemberg , erwin schuele , who personally fought for the trial to take place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nuremberg war crimes trials in 1945 are well known but at the same time , germany 's judicial system in the 1950s was n't particularly interested in pursuing nazi crimes .
that had partly to do with the nazi-weary mentality of the time .
another major reason for the reluctance to crack down on nazi abuses was that there were quite a few lawyers and state prosecutors who had previously been members of the nazi party .
the presence of so many former nazis in the german judicial system gathered force in the 1950s , because many who underwent denazification and were dismissed from public service earlier reentered the system in the early 1950s .
yet ulm did command immense media attention in the federal republic of germany .
it was n't the first trial of its kind but it was certainly the most elaborate and most publicized of the time .
usually , with the exception of the big nazi war crime trials in allied tribunals , only a few regional and local papers reported about such cases .
in the 1950s especially , such trials hardly sparked any nationwide attention .
the defendants in the ulm trial were given relatively light prison sentences of between three and 15 years . why was that ?
the main problem that plagued all nazi war crime trials right up to the 1980s was the development of the so-called " accessory to murder " construct .
normally , a murderer is punished with a life sentence .
but most of the courts accepted that the main perpetrators of the mass murder of jews were the nazi leadership - hitler , himmler and others .
all the others were thus not considered murderers who killed jews out of a deep sense of personal motivation but rather simply helpers who aided in the crime .
that 's why the majority of nazi criminals were sentenced for being an accessory to murder .
it was only in cases where it could be proven that someone had committed crimes out of a sense of personal conviction that a life sentence was issued .
this strategy was strongly criticized in the 1960s and also proved to be wrong , because the courts were largely dealing with committed nazis and anti-semites .
another reason was that it was difficult to reconstruct crimes committed 10 or 12 years previously and build up cases with the help of eye witnesses that would eventually lead to court proceedings .
but the biggest problem was that the majority of the german population was simply not interested in tackling the past , and the authorities lacked the will to pursue people who committed atrocities under the nazis .
how were the sentences received in germany and abroad ?
there was certainly a resonance in the us and in israel , and i imagine there may have been some disappointments , particularly among jews .
in germany , reaction was divided because a liberal segment in society was deeply interested in the trial in the late 1950s and followed it critically .
but the majority of the german population at the time simply did n't want anything to do with it .
it 's true , the sentences in the ulm trial were very light .
there is hardly any person accused of crimes under the nazis who served out the entirety of the sentence issued in the federal republic of germany .
what effect did the ulm einsatzgruppen trial have on west germany 's efforts to bring nazi war criminals to justice ?
one of the most important and immediate political fall-outs of the ulm trial was that justice ministers in west germany , spurred on by the realization that many grave nazi crimes in eastern europe were left uninvestigated , completely reversed the existing investigation procedure .
they no longer relied on coincidences to bring nazi crimes to light but rather on systematically investigating them .
that was the immediate trigger for the establishment of a unique central authority in ludwigsburg to compile , coordinate and investigate all types of crimes committed under the nazis .
beyond that , the ulm trial was only a brief shock for the german population .
the real jolt came with the adolf eichmann arrest and trial and the auschwitz trial in frankfurt in 1963 .

the so-called ulm einsatzgruppen trial , one of the largest in a west german court that centered on the mass murder of jews , accused the men , gestapo and ss members , of killing more than 5,000 jewish men , women and children in lithuania .
the proceedings revealed gruesome crimes and showed that many of the perpetrators continued to live normal lives in west germany for years after the war , their murderous campaign largely undetected .
the trial is considered a major break with how germany dealt with its nazi past until then .
dw-world.de spoke to dieter pohl , a historian and lecturer at the institute for contemporary history in munich , about the historic trial 50 years ago .
dw-world.de : the ulm einsatzgruppen trial is considered a turning point in how germany dealt with its nazi past .
why is that ?
dieter pohl : the bulk of the nazi war crime trials took place right after 1945 .
basically , from 1945 to 1949 , there were parallel allied tribunals and german courts .
the german courts largely dealt with crimes committed against german citizens ; the allied courts dealt with all others , which meant the majority of nazi crimes .
these proceedings petered out by the end of the 1940s and early 1950s largely because west german society suppressed the past and preferred not to talk about it .
nazi crimes hardly found mention in public discourse in the early 1950s . thus the ulm trial in 1958 marked the reopening of criminal proceedings against nazi criminals .
it was seen as a sign that the west german judicial system was taking the nazi past more seriously . but the most striking thing about the ulm trial was that it made clear that nazi atrocities were not just committed within the third reich but largely in eastern europe .
the 10 defendants in the ulm trial stood accused of murdering more than 5,000 jewish men , women and children .
who were these men ?
were they cold-blooded killers or just " ordinary men " ?
no , they certainly were n't average germans .
they were members of the gestapo in tilsit -lsb- editor 's note : the now russian town of sovetsk -rsb- on the northeastern tip of the third reich , some were even long-time ss members .
they were largely career policemen , people who usually joined the crime force and then went on to join the gestapo during the 1930s .
usually the leading personnel involved die-hard nazis - people who joined the nsdap relatively early , actively supported the nazi ideology and cracked down on the opponents of the ideology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the dock - some of the defendants in the ulm trial right after the wehrmacht 's invasion of the soviet union on june 22 , 1941 , the gestapo tilsit followed with small commandos , entered western lithuanian territory and began shooting jews .
this was where the first mass murder of jews in the so-called " final solution " took place on june 24 , 1941 , just two days after the beginning of the german campaign in the town of garsden .
the commandos largely targeted young jewish men old enough to join the army ; women and children were only killed in exceptions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 20.05.2008 landmark trial pushed germany to tackle nazi past großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defendants lived normal lives in the midst of german society for years fifty years ago , a trial against 10 members of a nazi commando in the city of ulm , changed the way west germany dealt with its fascist past and crack down on crimes committed by the nazis . from july 28 to august 29 , 1958 , 10 men from a special nazi commando , " tilsit , " went on trial in the west german city of ulm in the state of baden-wuerttemberg .
the so-called ulm einsatzgruppen trial , one of the largest in a west german court that centered on the mass murder of jews , accused the men , gestapo and ss members , of killing more than 5,000 jewish men , women and children in lithuania .
the proceedings revealed gruesome crimes and showed that many of the perpetrators continued to live normal lives in west germany for years after the war , their murderous campaign largely undetected .
the trial is considered a major break with how germany dealt with its nazi past until then .
dw-world.de spoke to dieter pohl , a historian and lecturer at the institute for contemporary history in munich , about the historic trial 50 years ago .
dw-world.de : the ulm einsatzgruppen trial is considered a turning point in how germany dealt with its nazi past .
why is that ?
dieter pohl : the bulk of the nazi war crime trials took place right after 1945 .
basically , from 1945 to 1949 , there were parallel allied tribunals and german courts .
the german courts largely dealt with crimes committed against german citizens ; the allied courts dealt with all others , which meant the majority of nazi crimes .
these proceedings petered out by the end of the 1940s and early 1950s largely because west german society suppressed the past and preferred not to talk about it .
nazi crimes hardly found mention in public discourse in the early 1950s . thus the ulm trial in 1958 marked the reopening of criminal proceedings against nazi criminals .
it was seen as a sign that the west german judicial system was taking the nazi past more seriously . but the most striking thing about the ulm trial was that it made clear that nazi atrocities were not just committed within the third reich but largely in eastern europe .
the 10 defendants in the ulm trial stood accused of murdering more than 5,000 jewish men , women and children .
who were these men ?
were they cold-blooded killers or just " ordinary men " ?
no , they certainly were n't average germans .
they were members of the gestapo in tilsit -lsb- editor 's note : the now russian town of sovetsk -rsb- on the northeastern tip of the third reich , some were even long-time ss members .
they were largely career policemen , people who usually joined the crime force and then went on to join the gestapo during the 1930s .
usually the leading personnel involved die-hard nazis - people who joined the nsdap relatively early , actively supported the nazi ideology and cracked down on the opponents of the ideology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the dock - some of the defendants in the ulm trial right after the wehrmacht 's invasion of the soviet union on june 22 , 1941 , the gestapo tilsit followed with small commandos , entered western lithuanian territory and began shooting jews .
this was where the first mass murder of jews in the so-called " final solution " took place on june 24 , 1941 , just two days after the beginning of the german campaign in the town of garsden .
the commandos largely targeted young jewish men old enough to join the army ; women and children were only killed in exceptions .
the crimes set the stage for what followed in the entire occupied soviet union over the next two years - large massacres of jewish communities with all the brutalities that went with it .
how did the ulm trial come about ? actually due to sheer coincidence .
one of the main defendants , bernhard fischer-schweder , the police chief in memel , lithuania , in 1941 and involved in the murder of thousands of jews , assumed a false name after 1945 and was appointed director of a refugee shelter near ulm in 1955 .
he was fired when his past came to light .
when he was refused another public sector job , fischer-schweder filed a lawsuit in a labor court .
a survivor of fischer-schweder 's murderous campaign in lithuania came across a newspaper article about the court case and identified him , revealing details about his past .
that provided the trigger for the trial .
unfortunately , most cases against nazi criminals at the time came into being this way .
a surviving victim usually happened to discover a perpetrator and then filed a lawsuit against him .
what kind of an atmosphere did the trial take place in ?
how was it viewed by the west germans and the justice system ?
the trial came at a time when much of the german population simply wanted to draw a line under the past .
after several years of allied rule and a constant focus on the nazi past , most people simply did n't want to hear about it anymore .
the judicial system in germany was partly shocked to see that severely incriminated perpetrators of nazi crimes had managed to get away without facing any criminal proceedings .
it was largely the then state prosecutor of baden-wuerttemberg , erwin schuele , who personally fought for the trial to take place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nuremberg war crimes trials in 1945 are well known but at the same time , germany 's judicial system in the 1950s was n't particularly interested in pursuing nazi crimes .
that had partly to do with the nazi-weary mentality of the time .
another major reason for the reluctance to crack down on nazi abuses was that there were quite a few lawyers and state prosecutors who had previously been members of the nazi party .
the presence of so many former nazis in the german judicial system gathered force in the 1950s , because many who underwent denazification and were dismissed from public service earlier reentered the system in the early 1950s .
yet ulm did command immense media attention in the federal republic of germany .
it was n't the first trial of its kind but it was certainly the most elaborate and most publicized of the time .
usually , with the exception of the big nazi war crime trials in allied tribunals , only a few regional and local papers reported about such cases .
in the 1950s especially , such trials hardly sparked any nationwide attention .
the defendants in the ulm trial were given relatively light prison sentences of between three and 15 years . why was that ?
the main problem that plagued all nazi war crime trials right up to the 1980s was the development of the so-called " accessory to murder " construct .
normally , a murderer is punished with a life sentence .
but most of the courts accepted that the main perpetrators of the mass murder of jews were the nazi leadership - hitler , himmler and others .
all the others were thus not considered murderers who killed jews out of a deep sense of personal motivation but rather simply helpers who aided in the crime .
that 's why the majority of nazi criminals were sentenced for being an accessory to murder .
it was only in cases where it could be proven that someone had committed crimes out of a sense of personal conviction that a life sentence was issued .
this strategy was strongly criticized in the 1960s and also proved to be wrong , because the courts were largely dealing with committed nazis and anti-semites .
another reason was that it was difficult to reconstruct crimes committed 10 or 12 years previously and build up cases with the help of eye witnesses that would eventually lead to court proceedings .
but the biggest problem was that the majority of the german population was simply not interested in tackling the past , and the authorities lacked the will to pursue people who committed atrocities under the nazis .
how were the sentences received in germany and abroad ?
there was certainly a resonance in the us and in israel , and i imagine there may have been some disappointments , particularly among jews .
in germany , reaction was divided because a liberal segment in society was deeply interested in the trial in the late 1950s and followed it critically .
but the majority of the german population at the time simply did n't want anything to do with it .
it 's true , the sentences in the ulm trial were very light .
there is hardly any person accused of crimes under the nazis who served out the entirety of the sentence issued in the federal republic of germany .
what effect did the ulm einsatzgruppen trial have on west germany 's efforts to bring nazi war criminals to justice ?
one of the most important and immediate political fall-outs of the ulm trial was that justice ministers in west germany , spurred on by the realization that many grave nazi crimes in eastern europe were left uninvestigated , completely reversed the existing investigation procedure .
they no longer relied on coincidences to bring nazi crimes to light but rather on systematically investigating them .
that was the immediate trigger for the establishment of a unique central authority in ludwigsburg to compile , coordinate and investigate all types of crimes committed under the nazis .
beyond that , the ulm trial was only a brief shock for the german population .
the real jolt came with the adolf eichmann arrest and trial and the auschwitz trial in frankfurt in 1963 .
the general awareness in the german population that most nazi crimes were committed in eastern europe and that the murderers live among us in society only sank in later . interview : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 20.05.2008 landmark trial pushed germany to tackle nazi past großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defendants lived normal lives in the midst of german society for years fifty years ago , a trial against 10 members of a nazi commando in the city of ulm , changed the way west germany dealt with its fascist past and crack down on crimes committed by the nazis . from july 28 to august 29 , 1958 , 10 men from a special nazi commando , " tilsit , " went on trial in the west german city of ulm in the state of baden-wuerttemberg .
the so-called ulm einsatzgruppen trial , one of the largest in a west german court that centered on the mass murder of jews , accused the men , gestapo and ss members , of killing more than 5,000 jewish men , women and children in lithuania .
the proceedings revealed gruesome crimes and showed that many of the perpetrators continued to live normal lives in west germany for years after the war , their murderous campaign largely undetected .
the trial is considered a major break with how germany dealt with its nazi past until then .
dw-world.de spoke to dieter pohl , a historian and lecturer at the institute for contemporary history in munich , about the historic trial 50 years ago .
dw-world.de : the ulm einsatzgruppen trial is considered a turning point in how germany dealt with its nazi past .
why is that ?
dieter pohl : the bulk of the nazi war crime trials took place right after 1945 .
basically , from 1945 to 1949 , there were parallel allied tribunals and german courts .
the german courts largely dealt with crimes committed against german citizens ; the allied courts dealt with all others , which meant the majority of nazi crimes .
these proceedings petered out by the end of the 1940s and early 1950s largely because west german society suppressed the past and preferred not to talk about it .
nazi crimes hardly found mention in public discourse in the early 1950s . thus the ulm trial in 1958 marked the reopening of criminal proceedings against nazi criminals .
it was seen as a sign that the west german judicial system was taking the nazi past more seriously . but the most striking thing about the ulm trial was that it made clear that nazi atrocities were not just committed within the third reich but largely in eastern europe .
the 10 defendants in the ulm trial stood accused of murdering more than 5,000 jewish men , women and children .
who were these men ?
were they cold-blooded killers or just " ordinary men " ?
no , they certainly were n't average germans .
they were members of the gestapo in tilsit -lsb- editor 's note : the now russian town of sovetsk -rsb- on the northeastern tip of the third reich , some were even long-time ss members .
they were largely career policemen , people who usually joined the crime force and then went on to join the gestapo during the 1930s .
usually the leading personnel involved die-hard nazis - people who joined the nsdap relatively early , actively supported the nazi ideology and cracked down on the opponents of the ideology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the dock - some of the defendants in the ulm trial right after the wehrmacht 's invasion of the soviet union on june 22 , 1941 , the gestapo tilsit followed with small commandos , entered western lithuanian territory and began shooting jews .
this was where the first mass murder of jews in the so-called " final solution " took place on june 24 , 1941 , just two days after the beginning of the german campaign in the town of garsden .
the commandos largely targeted young jewish men old enough to join the army ; women and children were only killed in exceptions .
the crimes set the stage for what followed in the entire occupied soviet union over the next two years - large massacres of jewish communities with all the brutalities that went with it .
how did the ulm trial come about ? actually due to sheer coincidence .
one of the main defendants , bernhard fischer-schweder , the police chief in memel , lithuania , in 1941 and involved in the murder of thousands of jews , assumed a false name after 1945 and was appointed director of a refugee shelter near ulm in 1955 .
he was fired when his past came to light .
when he was refused another public sector job , fischer-schweder filed a lawsuit in a labor court .
a survivor of fischer-schweder 's murderous campaign in lithuania came across a newspaper article about the court case and identified him , revealing details about his past .
that provided the trigger for the trial .
unfortunately , most cases against nazi criminals at the time came into being this way .
a surviving victim usually happened to discover a perpetrator and then filed a lawsuit against him .
what kind of an atmosphere did the trial take place in ?
how was it viewed by the west germans and the justice system ?
the trial came at a time when much of the german population simply wanted to draw a line under the past .
after several years of allied rule and a constant focus on the nazi past , most people simply did n't want to hear about it anymore .
the judicial system in germany was partly shocked to see that severely incriminated perpetrators of nazi crimes had managed to get away without facing any criminal proceedings .
it was largely the then state prosecutor of baden-wuerttemberg , erwin schuele , who personally fought for the trial to take place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nuremberg war crimes trials in 1945 are well known but at the same time , germany 's judicial system in the 1950s was n't particularly interested in pursuing nazi crimes .
that had partly to do with the nazi-weary mentality of the time .
another major reason for the reluctance to crack down on nazi abuses was that there were quite a few lawyers and state prosecutors who had previously been members of the nazi party .
the presence of so many former nazis in the german judicial system gathered force in the 1950s , because many who underwent denazification and were dismissed from public service earlier reentered the system in the early 1950s .
yet ulm did command immense media attention in the federal republic of germany .
it was n't the first trial of its kind but it was certainly the most elaborate and most publicized of the time .
usually , with the exception of the big nazi war crime trials in allied tribunals , only a few regional and local papers reported about such cases .
in the 1950s especially , such trials hardly sparked any nationwide attention .
the defendants in the ulm trial were given relatively light prison sentences of between three and 15 years . why was that ?
the main problem that plagued all nazi war crime trials right up to the 1980s was the development of the so-called " accessory to murder " construct .
normally , a murderer is punished with a life sentence .
but most of the courts accepted that the main perpetrators of the mass murder of jews were the nazi leadership - hitler , himmler and others .
all the others were thus not considered murderers who killed jews out of a deep sense of personal motivation but rather simply helpers who aided in the crime .
that 's why the majority of nazi criminals were sentenced for being an accessory to murder .
it was only in cases where it could be proven that someone had committed crimes out of a sense of personal conviction that a life sentence was issued .
this strategy was strongly criticized in the 1960s and also proved to be wrong , because the courts were largely dealing with committed nazis and anti-semites .
another reason was that it was difficult to reconstruct crimes committed 10 or 12 years previously and build up cases with the help of eye witnesses that would eventually lead to court proceedings .
but the biggest problem was that the majority of the german population was simply not interested in tackling the past , and the authorities lacked the will to pursue people who committed atrocities under the nazis .
how were the sentences received in germany and abroad ?
there was certainly a resonance in the us and in israel , and i imagine there may have been some disappointments , particularly among jews .
in germany , reaction was divided because a liberal segment in society was deeply interested in the trial in the late 1950s and followed it critically .
but the majority of the german population at the time simply did n't want anything to do with it .
it 's true , the sentences in the ulm trial were very light .
there is hardly any person accused of crimes under the nazis who served out the entirety of the sentence issued in the federal republic of germany .
what effect did the ulm einsatzgruppen trial have on west germany 's efforts to bring nazi war criminals to justice ?
one of the most important and immediate political fall-outs of the ulm trial was that justice ministers in west germany , spurred on by the realization that many grave nazi crimes in eastern europe were left uninvestigated , completely reversed the existing investigation procedure .
they no longer relied on coincidences to bring nazi crimes to light but rather on systematically investigating them .
that was the immediate trigger for the establishment of a unique central authority in ludwigsburg to compile , coordinate and investigate all types of crimes committed under the nazis .
beyond that , the ulm trial was only a brief shock for the german population .
the real jolt came with the adolf eichmann arrest and trial and the auschwitz trial in frankfurt in 1963 .
the general awareness in the german population that most nazi crimes were committed in eastern europe and that the murderers live among us in society only sank in later . interview : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

iceland is number one for peace the second annual global peace index , a survey on the harmoniousness of the world 's nations , has been released .
iceland has been named the world 's most peaceful country - and iraq its least . if you do n't like conflict , than maybe you should consider moving to reykjavik - that 's the message from the global peace index .
iceland headed the rankings of the survey , which is drawn up by a non-governmental initiative called vision of humanity .
it evaluates 140 nations with respect to 24 criteria , including numbers of deaths from organized conflict , levels of violent crime and proportions of gdp used for military expenditures .
denmark was deemed the world 's second most peaceful country , followed by norway , new zealand and japan .
" the world appears to be a marginally more peaceful place this year , " index founder and australian philanthropist steve killelea said in a statement .
" this is encouraging , but it takes small steps by individual countries for the world to make greater strides on the road to peace . "
confirming the obvious bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : five years of war have made iraq the world 's most dangerous place at the other end of the index , war-torn iraq was adjudged to be the most violent country on the globe .
it was followed by other perennial hotspots of conflict - sudan , afghanistan , israel and chad .
somewhat more surprisingly , russia ranks very low on the list in 131rd spot .
the united states is also in the bottom half of the table in position 97 .
meanwhile , china ranks 67 , and germany a respectable 14 .
the nations that made the biggest jumps in the table were angola , indonesia , india and uzbekistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kenya dropped dramatically on the global peace index meanwhile , owing to violence following last december 's presidential election , kenya suffered the steepest decline .
the index is pitched at governments as a means of self-evaluation and at commerce .
" you ultimately ca n't have business where you have conflict , " said nobel peace laureate archbishop desmond tutu of south africa , a major supporter of the survey .

iceland is number one for peace the second annual global peace index , a survey on the harmoniousness of the world 's nations , has been released .
iceland has been named the world 's most peaceful country - and iraq its least . if you do n't like conflict , than maybe you should consider moving to reykjavik - that 's the message from the global peace index .
iceland headed the rankings of the survey , which is drawn up by a non-governmental initiative called vision of humanity .
it evaluates 140 nations with respect to 24 criteria , including numbers of deaths from organized conflict , levels of violent crime and proportions of gdp used for military expenditures .
denmark was deemed the world 's second most peaceful country , followed by norway , new zealand and japan .
" the world appears to be a marginally more peaceful place this year , " index founder and australian philanthropist steve killelea said in a statement .
" this is encouraging , but it takes small steps by individual countries for the world to make greater strides on the road to peace . "
confirming the obvious bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : five years of war have made iraq the world 's most dangerous place at the other end of the index , war-torn iraq was adjudged to be the most violent country on the globe .
it was followed by other perennial hotspots of conflict - sudan , afghanistan , israel and chad .
somewhat more surprisingly , russia ranks very low on the list in 131rd spot .
the united states is also in the bottom half of the table in position 97 .
meanwhile , china ranks 67 , and germany a respectable 14 .
the nations that made the biggest jumps in the table were angola , indonesia , india and uzbekistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kenya dropped dramatically on the global peace index meanwhile , owing to violence following last december 's presidential election , kenya suffered the steepest decline .
the index is pitched at governments as a means of self-evaluation and at commerce .
" you ultimately ca n't have business where you have conflict , " said nobel peace laureate archbishop desmond tutu of south africa , a major supporter of the survey .

they managed to get it under control by sunset . a fire which broke out tuesday afternoon at berlin 's philharmonie , the concert hall that is home to the berlin philharmonic , was under control before sunset , berlin fire chief wilfried graefling said . the fire was , however , still smouldering , and the damage was considerable , he told berlin 's regional public broadcaster rbb . graefling said the fire had broken out in the iconic golden building at around 2 p.m. while repairs to the roof were being carried out .
a police spokeswoman said a probe into the cause was underway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firemen battled the blaze all afternoon by mid-afternoon , a pall of brown smoke hung over the area close to berlin 's central tiergarten park . fire crews were expected to work into the night to douse the fire completely . " but things will not deteriorate , " graefling said .
he added that the concrete roof of the 45-year-old building had held , and that damage from the water used to douse the fire was thus limited . musicians evacuated expensive instruments from the building , which also houses a musical instrument museum . the fire alert began only an hour before the famous orchestra , an adult choir and 400 children were to have begun a joint rehearsal for a concert to take place friday night .
the building was cleared , and nobody was injured .
bildunterschrift : an aerial view showed the extent of the fire firefighters spent hours ripping off parts of the golden sheet-metal roof to gain access to burning insulation . the hall 's chief executive , pamela rosenberg , said claudio abbado , who retired as conductor of the orchestra in 2002 , had been in the building at the time the blaze began , preparing for a comeback program from friday to sunday . sir simon rattle , the orchestra 's regular conductor , was in france , she added . the 2,200-seat building , designed by hans scharoun , opened in 1963 on the west berlin side of the berlin wall . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we can do many things wrong here -lsb- in latin america -rsb- if we do not pay attention to it , " merkel said .
" however , we can do many things right , and secure many jobs in germany , if we build long-term partnerships . "
no concrete details of the agreement were made public , although merkel said the first step would be an analysis of how the rising living standards in emerging countries are influencing the situation regarding foodstuffs .
mexico says production boost needed in a joint press conference with merkel , calderon called for a massive increase in food production around the world .
he stressed that a " very aggressive production boost " is needed and blamed the food scarcity on stronger demand in china and india but also on the massive use of corn by the united states to boost its ethanol production .
the rise in the price of corn , a staple in the mexican diet across all sectors of society , has caused particular worry in mexico in recent months .

on may 8 , the date commemorating the unconditional surrender of nazi germany to the allies - or ve day - a government appeals committee that deals with matters pertaining to the holocaust victims ' law and decided to grant jews who lived under curfew during world war ii the same compensation rights as other holocaust victims .
according to the holocaust victim 's law , those who lived under nazi rule and were " deprived of their freedom " are entitled to receive remuneration from the german government .
three years ago , the supreme court ruled that bulgarian jews who were expelled from their homes would be entitled to compensation , but those who rather lived under military-imposed curfews were deemed ineligible for this benefit .
the committee , after receiving a petition submitted from 109 bulgarian and romanian holocaust victims who were forced to live in restricted conditions but were not expelled from their homes , reversed the previous decision , thereby rendering the victims eligible .
in 1941 in bulgaria the " national defense law " was enacted , containing various provisions which restricted the freedom of movement of jews .

according to the holocaust victim 's law , those who lived under nazi rule and were " deprived of their freedom " are entitled to receive remuneration from the german government .
three years ago , the supreme court ruled that bulgarian jews who were expelled from their homes would be entitled to compensation , but those who rather lived under military-imposed curfews were deemed ineligible for this benefit .

but this week , all serbs will be europe 's biggest fans as the continent 's largest song contest comes to belgrade . serbia 's three anti-european political parties want to move their country away from the european union and towards russia .
by agreeing on general principles to create a coalition last thursday , may 15 , they could even form the country 's next government - despite the fact that the pro-european party of serbian president boris tadic actually won early parliamentary elections on may 11 .
but tadic 's party has failed to find a coalition partner so far . amid this tense and anti-european political situation , serbia 's getting ready to host a truly european event - the eurovision song contest . the event 's organizers do n't want to let the situation spoil the mood and have been trying to ban political debate from the show . " participants represent their countries , not their governments , " said sandra susa , who 's responsible for organizing the contest .
" we 're calling on serbian and foreign media to set politics aside .
we 're here to have fun , because belgrade 's the only place to have that much fun . " friendly ambassadors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serifovic -lrb- left -rrb- has supported ultra-nationalist tomislav nikolic -lrb- right -rrb- in elections the eurovision song contest , which will have 43 participating countries this year , is coming to the serbian capital for the first time .
that 's because serbia 's marija serifovic won the competition last year with her song " molitva " -lrb- prayer -rrb- in helsinki , finland . incidentally , serifovic herself also raised some eyebrows earlier this year when she appeared at election rallies for serbia 's ultra-nationalist radical party - despite being appointed a european ambassador for intercultural dialogue by the european commission . be that as it may , the serbs want to make a good impression and be good hosts to their visitors .
belgrade , with its two million residents and a very active nightlife , provides a suitable background for the event .
but susa 's not just focusing on showing belgrade to the tourists . " the song contest gives belgrade , serbia and all of us a great opportunity to show our organizational talents and our hospitality , " she said .
" it could change serbia 's image in the world . " european onslaught everything 's meant to be perfect at belgrade 's arena , one of europe 's largest concert and sports venues .
the final on may 24 as well as the two semi-finals on may 20 and may 22 are being rehearsed down to the last detail .
tickets for the shows have been sold out , thanks to low prices : the most expensive ones cost 60 euros -lrb- $ 93 -rrb- . bildunterschrift : belgrade 's ready for europe - at least this week but even those fans who did n't manage to get tickets will be able to participate in the communal excitement as public viewing screens have been set up at belgrade 's large city hall square . the city is preparing for a major onslaught : some 1,500 participants , more than 3,500 journalists and about 15,000 visitors from all over europe are expected .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 20.05.2008 landmark trial pushed germany to tackle nazi past großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defendants lived normal lives in the midst of german society for years fifty years ago , a trial against 10 members of a nazi commando in the city of ulm , changed the way west germany dealt with its fascist past and crack down on crimes committed by the nazis . from july 28 to august 29 , 1958 , 10 men from a special nazi commando , " tilsit , " went on trial in the west german city of ulm in the state of baden-wuerttemberg .
the so-called ulm einsatzgruppen trial , one of the largest in a west german court that centered on the mass murder of jews , accused the men , gestapo and ss members , of killing more than 5,000 jewish men , women and children in lithuania .
the proceedings revealed gruesome crimes and showed that many of the perpetrators continued to live normal lives in west germany for years after the war , their murderous campaign largely undetected .
the trial is considered a major break with how germany dealt with its nazi past until then .
dw-world.de spoke to dieter pohl , a historian and lecturer at the institute for contemporary history in munich , about the historic trial 50 years ago .
dw-world.de : the ulm einsatzgruppen trial is considered a turning point in how germany dealt with its nazi past .
why is that ?
dieter pohl : the bulk of the nazi war crime trials took place right after 1945 .
basically , from 1945 to 1949 , there were parallel allied tribunals and german courts .
the german courts largely dealt with crimes committed against german citizens ; the allied courts dealt with all others , which meant the majority of nazi crimes .
these proceedings petered out by the end of the 1940s and early 1950s largely because west german society suppressed the past and preferred not to talk about it .
nazi crimes hardly found mention in public discourse in the early 1950s . thus the ulm trial in 1958 marked the reopening of criminal proceedings against nazi criminals .
it was seen as a sign that the west german judicial system was taking the nazi past more seriously . but the most striking thing about the ulm trial was that it made clear that nazi atrocities were not just committed within the third reich but largely in eastern europe .
the 10 defendants in the ulm trial stood accused of murdering more than 5,000 jewish men , women and children .
who were these men ?
were they cold-blooded killers or just " ordinary men " ?
no , they certainly were n't average germans .
they were members of the gestapo in tilsit -lsb- editor 's note : the now russian town of sovetsk -rsb- on the northeastern tip of the third reich , some were even long-time ss members .
they were largely career policemen , people who usually joined the crime force and then went on to join the gestapo during the 1930s .
usually the leading personnel involved die-hard nazis - people who joined the nsdap relatively early , actively supported the nazi ideology and cracked down on the opponents of the ideology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the dock - some of the defendants in the ulm trial right after the wehrmacht 's invasion of the soviet union on june 22 , 1941 , the gestapo tilsit followed with small commandos , entered western lithuanian territory and began shooting jews .
this was where the first mass murder of jews in the so-called " final solution " took place on june 24 , 1941 , just two days after the beginning of the german campaign in the town of garsden .
the commandos largely targeted young jewish men old enough to join the army ; women and children were only killed in exceptions .
the crimes set the stage for what followed in the entire occupied soviet union over the next two years - large massacres of jewish communities with all the brutalities that went with it .
how did the ulm trial come about ? actually due to sheer coincidence .
one of the main defendants , bernhard fischer-schweder , the police chief in memel , lithuania , in 1941 and involved in the murder of thousands of jews , assumed a false name after 1945 and was appointed director of a refugee shelter near ulm in 1955 .
he was fired when his past came to light .
when he was refused another public sector job , fischer-schweder filed a lawsuit in a labor court .
a survivor of fischer-schweder 's murderous campaign in lithuania came across a newspaper article about the court case and identified him , revealing details about his past .
that provided the trigger for the trial .
unfortunately , most cases against nazi criminals at the time came into being this way .
a surviving victim usually happened to discover a perpetrator and then filed a lawsuit against him .
what kind of an atmosphere did the trial take place in ?
how was it viewed by the west germans and the justice system ?
the trial came at a time when much of the german population simply wanted to draw a line under the past .
after several years of allied rule and a constant focus on the nazi past , most people simply did n't want to hear about it anymore .
the judicial system in germany was partly shocked to see that severely incriminated perpetrators of nazi crimes had managed to get away without facing any criminal proceedings .
it was largely the then state prosecutor of baden-wuerttemberg , erwin schuele , who personally fought for the trial to take place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nuremberg war crimes trials in 1945 are well known but at the same time , germany 's judicial system in the 1950s was n't particularly interested in pursuing nazi crimes .
that had partly to do with the nazi-weary mentality of the time .
another major reason for the reluctance to crack down on nazi abuses was that there were quite a few lawyers and state prosecutors who had previously been members of the nazi party .
the presence of so many former nazis in the german judicial system gathered force in the 1950s , because many who underwent denazification and were dismissed from public service earlier reentered the system in the early 1950s .
yet ulm did command immense media attention in the federal republic of germany .
it was n't the first trial of its kind but it was certainly the most elaborate and most publicized of the time .
usually , with the exception of the big nazi war crime trials in allied tribunals , only a few regional and local papers reported about such cases .
in the 1950s especially , such trials hardly sparked any nationwide attention .
the defendants in the ulm trial were given relatively light prison sentences of between three and 15 years . why was that ?
the main problem that plagued all nazi war crime trials right up to the 1980s was the development of the so-called " accessory to murder " construct .
normally , a murderer is punished with a life sentence .
but most of the courts accepted that the main perpetrators of the mass murder of jews were the nazi leadership - hitler , himmler and others .
all the others were thus not considered murderers who killed jews out of a deep sense of personal motivation but rather simply helpers who aided in the crime .
that 's why the majority of nazi criminals were sentenced for being an accessory to murder .
it was only in cases where it could be proven that someone had committed crimes out of a sense of personal conviction that a life sentence was issued .
this strategy was strongly criticized in the 1960s and also proved to be wrong , because the courts were largely dealing with committed nazis and anti-semites .
another reason was that it was difficult to reconstruct crimes committed 10 or 12 years previously and build up cases with the help of eye witnesses that would eventually lead to court proceedings .
but the biggest problem was that the majority of the german population was simply not interested in tackling the past , and the authorities lacked the will to pursue people who committed atrocities under the nazis .
how were the sentences received in germany and abroad ?
there was certainly a resonance in the us and in israel , and i imagine there may have been some disappointments , particularly among jews .
in germany , reaction was divided because a liberal segment in society was deeply interested in the trial in the late 1950s and followed it critically .
but the majority of the german population at the time simply did n't want anything to do with it .
it 's true , the sentences in the ulm trial were very light .
there is hardly any person accused of crimes under the nazis who served out the entirety of the sentence issued in the federal republic of germany .
what effect did the ulm einsatzgruppen trial have on west germany 's efforts to bring nazi war criminals to justice ?
one of the most important and immediate political fall-outs of the ulm trial was that justice ministers in west germany , spurred on by the realization that many grave nazi crimes in eastern europe were left uninvestigated , completely reversed the existing investigation procedure .
they no longer relied on coincidences to bring nazi crimes to light but rather on systematically investigating them .
that was the immediate trigger for the establishment of a unique central authority in ludwigsburg to compile , coordinate and investigate all types of crimes committed under the nazis .
beyond that , the ulm trial was only a brief shock for the german population .
the real jolt came with the adolf eichmann arrest and trial and the auschwitz trial in frankfurt in 1963 .
the general awareness in the german population that most nazi crimes were committed in eastern europe and that the murderers live among us in society only sank in later . interview : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 20.05.2008 landmark trial pushed germany to tackle nazi past großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defendants lived normal lives in the midst of german society for years fifty years ago , a trial against 10 members of a nazi commando in the city of ulm , changed the way west germany dealt with its fascist past and crack down on crimes committed by the nazis . from july 28 to august 29 , 1958 , 10 men from a special nazi commando , " tilsit , " went on trial in the west german city of ulm in the state of baden-wuerttemberg .
the so-called ulm einsatzgruppen trial , one of the largest in a west german court that centered on the mass murder of jews , accused the men , gestapo and ss members , of killing more than 5,000 jewish men , women and children in lithuania .
the proceedings revealed gruesome crimes and showed that many of the perpetrators continued to live normal lives in west germany for years after the war , their murderous campaign largely undetected .
the trial is considered a major break with how germany dealt with its nazi past until then .
dw-world.de spoke to dieter pohl , a historian and lecturer at the institute for contemporary history in munich , about the historic trial 50 years ago .
dw-world.de : the ulm einsatzgruppen trial is considered a turning point in how germany dealt with its nazi past .
why is that ?
dieter pohl : the bulk of the nazi war crime trials took place right after 1945 .
basically , from 1945 to 1949 , there were parallel allied tribunals and german courts .
the german courts largely dealt with crimes committed against german citizens ; the allied courts dealt with all others , which meant the majority of nazi crimes .
these proceedings petered out by the end of the 1940s and early 1950s largely because west german society suppressed the past and preferred not to talk about it .
nazi crimes hardly found mention in public discourse in the early 1950s . thus the ulm trial in 1958 marked the reopening of criminal proceedings against nazi criminals .
it was seen as a sign that the west german judicial system was taking the nazi past more seriously . but the most striking thing about the ulm trial was that it made clear that nazi atrocities were not just committed within the third reich but largely in eastern europe .
the 10 defendants in the ulm trial stood accused of murdering more than 5,000 jewish men , women and children .
who were these men ?
were they cold-blooded killers or just " ordinary men " ?
no , they certainly were n't average germans .
they were members of the gestapo in tilsit -lsb- editor 's note : the now russian town of sovetsk -rsb- on the northeastern tip of the third reich , some were even long-time ss members .
they were largely career policemen , people who usually joined the crime force and then went on to join the gestapo during the 1930s .
usually the leading personnel involved die-hard nazis - people who joined the nsdap relatively early , actively supported the nazi ideology and cracked down on the opponents of the ideology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the dock - some of the defendants in the ulm trial right after the wehrmacht 's invasion of the soviet union on june 22 , 1941 , the gestapo tilsit followed with small commandos , entered western lithuanian territory and began shooting jews .
this was where the first mass murder of jews in the so-called " final solution " took place on june 24 , 1941 , just two days after the beginning of the german campaign in the town of garsden .
the commandos largely targeted young jewish men old enough to join the army ; women and children were only killed in exceptions .
the crimes set the stage for what followed in the entire occupied soviet union over the next two years - large massacres of jewish communities with all the brutalities that went with it .
how did the ulm trial come about ? actually due to sheer coincidence .
one of the main defendants , bernhard fischer-schweder , the police chief in memel , lithuania , in 1941 and involved in the murder of thousands of jews , assumed a false name after 1945 and was appointed director of a refugee shelter near ulm in 1955 .
he was fired when his past came to light .
when he was refused another public sector job , fischer-schweder filed a lawsuit in a labor court .
a survivor of fischer-schweder 's murderous campaign in lithuania came across a newspaper article about the court case and identified him , revealing details about his past .
that provided the trigger for the trial .
unfortunately , most cases against nazi criminals at the time came into being this way .
a surviving victim usually happened to discover a perpetrator and then filed a lawsuit against him .
what kind of an atmosphere did the trial take place in ?
how was it viewed by the west germans and the justice system ?
the trial came at a time when much of the german population simply wanted to draw a line under the past .
after several years of allied rule and a constant focus on the nazi past , most people simply did n't want to hear about it anymore .
the judicial system in germany was partly shocked to see that severely incriminated perpetrators of nazi crimes had managed to get away without facing any criminal proceedings .
it was largely the then state prosecutor of baden-wuerttemberg , erwin schuele , who personally fought for the trial to take place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nuremberg war crimes trials in 1945 are well known but at the same time , germany 's judicial system in the 1950s was n't particularly interested in pursuing nazi crimes .
that had partly to do with the nazi-weary mentality of the time .
another major reason for the reluctance to crack down on nazi abuses was that there were quite a few lawyers and state prosecutors who had previously been members of the nazi party .
the presence of so many former nazis in the german judicial system gathered force in the 1950s , because many who underwent denazification and were dismissed from public service earlier reentered the system in the early 1950s .
yet ulm did command immense media attention in the federal republic of germany .
it was n't the first trial of its kind but it was certainly the most elaborate and most publicized of the time .
usually , with the exception of the big nazi war crime trials in allied tribunals , only a few regional and local papers reported about such cases .
in the 1950s especially , such trials hardly sparked any nationwide attention .
the defendants in the ulm trial were given relatively light prison sentences of between three and 15 years . why was that ?
the main problem that plagued all nazi war crime trials right up to the 1980s was the development of the so-called " accessory to murder " construct .
normally , a murderer is punished with a life sentence .
but most of the courts accepted that the main perpetrators of the mass murder of jews were the nazi leadership - hitler , himmler and others .
all the others were thus not considered murderers who killed jews out of a deep sense of personal motivation but rather simply helpers who aided in the crime .
that 's why the majority of nazi criminals were sentenced for being an accessory to murder .
it was only in cases where it could be proven that someone had committed crimes out of a sense of personal conviction that a life sentence was issued .
this strategy was strongly criticized in the 1960s and also proved to be wrong , because the courts were largely dealing with committed nazis and anti-semites .
another reason was that it was difficult to reconstruct crimes committed 10 or 12 years previously and build up cases with the help of eye witnesses that would eventually lead to court proceedings .
but the biggest problem was that the majority of the german population was simply not interested in tackling the past , and the authorities lacked the will to pursue people who committed atrocities under the nazis .
how were the sentences received in germany and abroad ?
there was certainly a resonance in the us and in israel , and i imagine there may have been some disappointments , particularly among jews .
in germany , reaction was divided because a liberal segment in society was deeply interested in the trial in the late 1950s and followed it critically .
but the majority of the german population at the time simply did n't want anything to do with it .
it 's true , the sentences in the ulm trial were very light .
there is hardly any person accused of crimes under the nazis who served out the entirety of the sentence issued in the federal republic of germany .
what effect did the ulm einsatzgruppen trial have on west germany 's efforts to bring nazi war criminals to justice ?
one of the most important and immediate political fall-outs of the ulm trial was that justice ministers in west germany , spurred on by the realization that many grave nazi crimes in eastern europe were left uninvestigated , completely reversed the existing investigation procedure .
they no longer relied on coincidences to bring nazi crimes to light but rather on systematically investigating them .
that was the immediate trigger for the establishment of a unique central authority in ludwigsburg to compile , coordinate and investigate all types of crimes committed under the nazis .
beyond that , the ulm trial was only a brief shock for the german population .
the real jolt came with the adolf eichmann arrest and trial and the auschwitz trial in frankfurt in 1963 .
the general awareness in the german population that most nazi crimes were committed in eastern europe and that the murderers live among us in society only sank in later . interview : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it falls short of what sponsor france originally wanted . the european commission laid out its views in strasbourg on tuesday , may 20 . the project is open to all eu member states as well as countries from north africa , the middle east and the balkans and includes the palestinian authorities . this is an initiative to reinforce , to reinvigorate our relationship , " eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said at a press conference .
" the more we can develop the region in the south , the less illegal migration there will be … the more prosperity we can give , the less terrorism , the less criminality will be there . " potential tasks for the new union will be to open new sea traffic routes , clean up mediterranean waters , improve maritime security and exploit solar power in northern africa to help meet europe 's energy needs . slight to sarkozy ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new union could help better regulate mediterranean waters but the association described by the eu falls short of what france - and in particular french president nicolas sarkozy - had envisioned . sarkozy had hoped for a much more tightly knit alliance restricted to territories with mediterranean shores .
he had touted his vision as a potential avenue for peace between israel and the palestinians and had hinted it might be offered to turkey as an alternative to eu membership . but those plans were scaled back after objections by powerful eu states not actually bordering the mediterranean , including germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy was unable to win over the rest of the eu turkey also only agreed to participate , if offered assurances that the union was not being put forward as an alternative to joining the eu - something the commission explicitly stated on tuesday . " this project is not directed against turkey , " ferrero-waldner said . the eu also scaled back the bureaucracy for the union and the frequency with which it will meet , making it essentially a new umbrella organization for an already existing euro-mediterranean partnership known as the barcelona process . the inaugural summit for the new bloc is scheduled for mid-july in paris . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we can do many things wrong here -lsb- in latin america -rsb- if we do not pay attention to it , " merkel said .
" however , we can do many things right , and secure many jobs in germany , if we build long-term partnerships . "
no concrete details of the agreement were made public , although merkel said the first step would be an analysis of how the rising living standards in emerging countries are influencing the situation regarding foodstuffs .
mexico says production boost needed in a joint press conference with merkel , calderon called for a massive increase in food production around the world .
he stressed that a " very aggressive production boost " is needed and blamed the food scarcity on stronger demand in china and india but also on the massive use of corn by the united states to boost its ethanol production .
the rise in the price of corn , a staple in the mexican diet across all sectors of society , has caused particular worry in mexico in recent months .
neighboring countries like haiti and honduras have even seen violent riots in a reaction to rising food prices - as have other countries round the world .
merkel , who arrived in mexico late sunday , was given an official welcome at the central courtyard of the national palace , prior to a mexico and germany economic forum .
calderon attended last year 's g8 summit in heiligendamm , germany , alongside the leaders of a group of emerging countries such as brazil , india , south africa and china .
according to figures made public by the mexican-german chamber of commerce and industry , over 1,000 german firms are currently active in mexico , and the volume of trade between the two countries is almost $ 14 billion -lrb- 8.9 billion euros -rrb- a year . dpa news agency -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the hard part will be deciding how to best reform the system . current european union agricultural policy encourages farmers to keep land fallow , a practice that seems to contradict the rising global demand for food .
the eu seems likely to acknowledge it needs to put more land into production when it announces agricultural reforms on tuesday , may 20 .
one solution would be for the eu to phase out its program of paying farmers to keep farmland out of production , hoping that it will help stabilize food prices .
" i think it 's important that we continue to increase production in europe as much as we can within the natural limits , also taking into account environmental care , " agriculture and rural development commissioner mariann fischer boel told the dpa news agency .
fischer boel spent monday with eu agriculture ministers in brussels outlining her proposals to reform the bloc 's common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- .
yet the road to reforming the cap is likely to be long and riddled with obstacles .
even the relatively modest changes boel has proposed to direct farm subsidies are likely to be met with fierce resistance , particularly from france , which is the biggest recipient of agricultural aid .
britain calls for liberalization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer boel wants to increase production of some crops britain and some other member states would like to see the eu go even further in reforming its subsidies .
britain 's finance minister , alistair darling , called for europe to fundamentally reform its agricultural policy .
britain has argued that the current food crisis shows the need to liberalize laws .
all elements that keep prices above world market levels should be phased out , darling said last week .
those measures cost eu consumers 43 billion euros -lrb- $ 67 billion -rrb- in 2006 , he said .
darling also said he wants the eu to stop direct payments to farmers , which he said cost taxpayers an additional 34 billion euros in 2006 .
" barriers and distortions in the global food market increase volatility and stifle the incentives to increase supply to match demand , " he argued .
germany wants farmers protected slovenian agriculture minister iztok jarc , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , refused to comment on britain 's position , saying only that " there are many reasons for high food prices , so i would n't make a direct connection to the cap . "
" we do n't only have a problem with food prices , we also have the problem of climate change and high energy prices .
it 's a combination of all factors , " he said .
germany and france are against liberalization .
they say the current upswing in food prices show the importance of not liberalizing too much .
germany 's agriculture minister , horst seehofer , argues that " we have to make sure that we can provide this continent with food sustainability .
this can not be done by taking away subsidies from european farmers . "
long road ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposed changes could bring protests from farmers besides no longer paying farmers to leave land fallow , the eu proposals also call for phasing out quotas on milk production .
some observers have also guessed the eu will propose ending the extra bonuses given to farmers who grow crops which can be converted into fuel .
while fischer boel said she wants to see more money go towards environmental projects and less towards direct subsidy payments , she backed away from an earlier suggestion that subsidies to larger farms be capped .
that caused an outcry from germany and britain .
global food prices have nearly doubled in three years , according to the world bank .
the situation in developing countries has been of particular concern since higher costs have sparked riots and restrictions on food exports .
the cap proposals will go to eu member states and the european parliament for consideration in the second half of 2008 , during france 's eu presidency .
massive subsidies remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france is the biggest recipient of agricultural subsidies although food prices have eased somewhat in recent weeks , they remain at near record levels , with wheat up 84 percent over one year ago , corn up 21 percent , butter up 21 percent and eggs up 17 percent .
cost increases have a variety of causes including biofuel , trade constraints , increased demand from asia to serve changing diets , poor harvests and increasing transport costs .
if the cap reforms succeed in putting more land into production , it would be a reversal of past reform efforts , which have tried to reign in production .
in 2003 , the eu tried to discourage overproduction by " decoupling " subsidies from production .
despite reforms , farm hand-outs still make up 40 percent of the eu budget , by far the bloc 's biggest spending item . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on may 8 , the date commemorating the unconditional surrender of nazi germany to the allies - or ve day - a government appeals committee that deals with matters pertaining to the holocaust victims ' law and decided to grant jews who lived under curfew during world war ii the same compensation rights as other holocaust victims .
according to the holocaust victim 's law , those who lived under nazi rule and were " deprived of their freedom " are entitled to receive remuneration from the german government .
three years ago , the supreme court ruled that bulgarian jews who were expelled from their homes would be entitled to compensation , but those who rather lived under military-imposed curfews were deemed ineligible for this benefit .
the committee , after receiving a petition submitted from 109 bulgarian and romanian holocaust victims who were forced to live in restricted conditions but were not expelled from their homes , reversed the previous decision , thereby rendering the victims eligible .
in 1941 in bulgaria the " national defense law " was enacted , containing various provisions which restricted the freedom of movement of jews .
under the law , jews who remained were obligated to change their place of residence , and were concentrated into special quarters in cities and forbidden from leaving their homes .
the restrictions lasted for two years .

but this week , all serbs will be europe 's biggest fans as the continent 's largest song contest comes to belgrade . serbia 's three anti-european political parties want to move their country away from the european union and towards russia .
by agreeing on general principles to create a coalition last thursday , may 15 , they could even form the country 's next government - despite the fact that the pro-european party of serbian president boris tadic actually won early parliamentary elections on may 11 .
but tadic 's party has failed to find a coalition partner so far . amid this tense and anti-european political situation , serbia 's getting ready to host a truly european event - the eurovision song contest . the event 's organizers do n't want to let the situation spoil the mood and have been trying to ban political debate from the show . " participants represent their countries , not their governments , " said sandra susa , who 's responsible for organizing the contest .
" we 're calling on serbian and foreign media to set politics aside .
we 're here to have fun , because belgrade 's the only place to have that much fun . " friendly ambassadors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serifovic -lrb- left -rrb- has supported ultra-nationalist tomislav nikolic -lrb- right -rrb- in elections the eurovision song contest , which will have 43 participating countries this year , is coming to the serbian capital for the first time .
that 's because serbia 's marija serifovic won the competition last year with her song " molitva " -lrb- prayer -rrb- in helsinki , finland . incidentally , serifovic herself also raised some eyebrows earlier this year when she appeared at election rallies for serbia 's ultra-nationalist radical party - despite being appointed a european ambassador for intercultural dialogue by the european commission . be that as it may , the serbs want to make a good impression and be good hosts to their visitors .
belgrade , with its two million residents and a very active nightlife , provides a suitable background for the event .
but susa 's not just focusing on showing belgrade to the tourists . " the song contest gives belgrade , serbia and all of us a great opportunity to show our organizational talents and our hospitality , " she said .
" it could change serbia 's image in the world . " european onslaught everything 's meant to be perfect at belgrade 's arena , one of europe 's largest concert and sports venues .
the final on may 24 as well as the two semi-finals on may 20 and may 22 are being rehearsed down to the last detail .
tickets for the shows have been sold out , thanks to low prices : the most expensive ones cost 60 euros -lrb- $ 93 -rrb- . bildunterschrift : belgrade 's ready for europe - at least this week but even those fans who did n't manage to get tickets will be able to participate in the communal excitement as public viewing screens have been set up at belgrade 's large city hall square . the city is preparing for a major onslaught : some 1,500 participants , more than 3,500 journalists and about 15,000 visitors from all over europe are expected .
hotels are fully booked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german group " no angels " hopes to break the spell this year and bring home the trophy " we 'll party a lot , " said jelena tomasevic , who will represent her country with " oro , " a favorite among eurovision internet forums . before that , she 'll first hope to hear those magic words that every eurovision contestant dreams about : " twelve points go to … " it 's the highest score each country can hand out and helps to decide the winner . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the restrictions lasted for two years .

on may 8 , the date commemorating the unconditional surrender of nazi germany to the allies - or ve day - a government appeals committee that deals with matters pertaining to the holocaust victims ' law and decided to grant jews who lived under curfew during world war ii the same compensation rights as other holocaust victims .
according to the holocaust victim 's law , those who lived under nazi rule and were " deprived of their freedom " are entitled to receive remuneration from the german government .
three years ago , the supreme court ruled that bulgarian jews who were expelled from their homes would be entitled to compensation , but those who rather lived under military-imposed curfews were deemed ineligible for this benefit .
the committee , after receiving a petition submitted from 109 bulgarian and romanian holocaust victims who were forced to live in restricted conditions but were not expelled from their homes , reversed the previous decision , thereby rendering the victims eligible .
in 1941 in bulgaria the " national defense law " was enacted , containing various provisions which restricted the freedom of movement of jews .
under the law , jews who remained were obligated to change their place of residence , and were concentrated into special quarters in cities and forbidden from leaving their homes .
the restrictions lasted for two years .

on may 8 , the date commemorating the unconditional surrender of nazi germany to the allies - or ve day - a government appeals committee that deals with matters pertaining to the holocaust victims ' law and decided to grant jews who lived under curfew during world war ii the same compensation rights as other holocaust victims .
according to the holocaust victim 's law , those who lived under nazi rule and were " deprived of their freedom " are entitled to receive remuneration from the german government .
three years ago , the supreme court ruled that bulgarian jews who were expelled from their homes would be entitled to compensation , but those who rather lived under military-imposed curfews were deemed ineligible for this benefit .
the committee , after receiving a petition submitted from 109 bulgarian and romanian holocaust victims who were forced to live in restricted conditions but were not expelled from their homes , reversed the previous decision , thereby rendering the victims eligible .
in 1941 in bulgaria the " national defense law " was enacted , containing various provisions which restricted the freedom of movement of jews .
under the law , jews who remained were obligated to change their place of residence , and were concentrated into special quarters in cities and forbidden from leaving their homes .
the restrictions lasted for two years .

iceland is number one for peace the second annual global peace index , a survey on the harmoniousness of the world 's nations , has been released .
iceland has been named the world 's most peaceful country - and iraq its least . if you do n't like conflict , than maybe you should consider moving to reykjavik - that 's the message from the global peace index .
iceland headed the rankings of the survey , which is drawn up by a non-governmental initiative called vision of humanity .

" we can do many things wrong here -lsb- in latin america -rsb- if we do not pay attention to it , " merkel said .
" however , we can do many things right , and secure many jobs in germany , if we build long-term partnerships . "
no concrete details of the agreement were made public , although merkel said the first step would be an analysis of how the rising living standards in emerging countries are influencing the situation regarding foodstuffs .
mexico says production boost needed in a joint press conference with merkel , calderon called for a massive increase in food production around the world .
he stressed that a " very aggressive production boost " is needed and blamed the food scarcity on stronger demand in china and india but also on the massive use of corn by the united states to boost its ethanol production .
the rise in the price of corn , a staple in the mexican diet across all sectors of society , has caused particular worry in mexico in recent months .

" we can do many things wrong here -lsb- in latin america -rsb- if we do not pay attention to it , " merkel said .
" however , we can do many things right , and secure many jobs in germany , if we build long-term partnerships . "

but this week , all serbs will be europe 's biggest fans as the continent 's largest song contest comes to belgrade . serbia 's three anti-european political parties want to move their country away from the european union and towards russia .
by agreeing on general principles to create a coalition last thursday , may 15 , they could even form the country 's next government - despite the fact that the pro-european party of serbian president boris tadic actually won early parliamentary elections on may 11 .
but tadic 's party has failed to find a coalition partner so far . amid this tense and anti-european political situation , serbia 's getting ready to host a truly european event - the eurovision song contest . the event 's organizers do n't want to let the situation spoil the mood and have been trying to ban political debate from the show .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 20.05.2008 landmark trial pushed germany to tackle nazi past großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defendants lived normal lives in the midst of german society for years fifty years ago , a trial against 10 members of a nazi commando in the city of ulm , changed the way west germany dealt with its fascist past and crack down on crimes committed by the nazis . from july 28 to august 29 , 1958 , 10 men from a special nazi commando , " tilsit , " went on trial in the west german city of ulm in the state of baden-wuerttemberg .
the so-called ulm einsatzgruppen trial , one of the largest in a west german court that centered on the mass murder of jews , accused the men , gestapo and ss members , of killing more than 5,000 jewish men , women and children in lithuania .
the proceedings revealed gruesome crimes and showed that many of the perpetrators continued to live normal lives in west germany for years after the war , their murderous campaign largely undetected .
the trial is considered a major break with how germany dealt with its nazi past until then .
dw-world.de spoke to dieter pohl , a historian and lecturer at the institute for contemporary history in munich , about the historic trial 50 years ago .
dw-world.de : the ulm einsatzgruppen trial is considered a turning point in how germany dealt with its nazi past .
why is that ?
dieter pohl : the bulk of the nazi war crime trials took place right after 1945 .
basically , from 1945 to 1949 , there were parallel allied tribunals and german courts .
the german courts largely dealt with crimes committed against german citizens ; the allied courts dealt with all others , which meant the majority of nazi crimes .
these proceedings petered out by the end of the 1940s and early 1950s largely because west german society suppressed the past and preferred not to talk about it .
nazi crimes hardly found mention in public discourse in the early 1950s . thus the ulm trial in 1958 marked the reopening of criminal proceedings against nazi criminals .
it was seen as a sign that the west german judicial system was taking the nazi past more seriously . but the most striking thing about the ulm trial was that it made clear that nazi atrocities were not just committed within the third reich but largely in eastern europe .
the 10 defendants in the ulm trial stood accused of murdering more than 5,000 jewish men , women and children .
who were these men ?
were they cold-blooded killers or just " ordinary men " ?
no , they certainly were n't average germans .
they were members of the gestapo in tilsit -lsb- editor 's note : the now russian town of sovetsk -rsb- on the northeastern tip of the third reich , some were even long-time ss members .
they were largely career policemen , people who usually joined the crime force and then went on to join the gestapo during the 1930s .
usually the leading personnel involved die-hard nazis - people who joined the nsdap relatively early , actively supported the nazi ideology and cracked down on the opponents of the ideology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the dock - some of the defendants in the ulm trial right after the wehrmacht 's invasion of the soviet union on june 22 , 1941 , the gestapo tilsit followed with small commandos , entered western lithuanian territory and began shooting jews .
this was where the first mass murder of jews in the so-called " final solution " took place on june 24 , 1941 , just two days after the beginning of the german campaign in the town of garsden .
the commandos largely targeted young jewish men old enough to join the army ; women and children were only killed in exceptions .
the crimes set the stage for what followed in the entire occupied soviet union over the next two years - large massacres of jewish communities with all the brutalities that went with it .
how did the ulm trial come about ? actually due to sheer coincidence .
one of the main defendants , bernhard fischer-schweder , the police chief in memel , lithuania , in 1941 and involved in the murder of thousands of jews , assumed a false name after 1945 and was appointed director of a refugee shelter near ulm in 1955 .
he was fired when his past came to light .
when he was refused another public sector job , fischer-schweder filed a lawsuit in a labor court .
a survivor of fischer-schweder 's murderous campaign in lithuania came across a newspaper article about the court case and identified him , revealing details about his past .
that provided the trigger for the trial .
unfortunately , most cases against nazi criminals at the time came into being this way .
a surviving victim usually happened to discover a perpetrator and then filed a lawsuit against him .
what kind of an atmosphere did the trial take place in ?
how was it viewed by the west germans and the justice system ?
the trial came at a time when much of the german population simply wanted to draw a line under the past .
after several years of allied rule and a constant focus on the nazi past , most people simply did n't want to hear about it anymore .
the judicial system in germany was partly shocked to see that severely incriminated perpetrators of nazi crimes had managed to get away without facing any criminal proceedings .
it was largely the then state prosecutor of baden-wuerttemberg , erwin schuele , who personally fought for the trial to take place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nuremberg war crimes trials in 1945 are well known but at the same time , germany 's judicial system in the 1950s was n't particularly interested in pursuing nazi crimes .
that had partly to do with the nazi-weary mentality of the time .
another major reason for the reluctance to crack down on nazi abuses was that there were quite a few lawyers and state prosecutors who had previously been members of the nazi party .
the presence of so many former nazis in the german judicial system gathered force in the 1950s , because many who underwent denazification and were dismissed from public service earlier reentered the system in the early 1950s .
yet ulm did command immense media attention in the federal republic of germany .
it was n't the first trial of its kind but it was certainly the most elaborate and most publicized of the time .
usually , with the exception of the big nazi war crime trials in allied tribunals , only a few regional and local papers reported about such cases .
in the 1950s especially , such trials hardly sparked any nationwide attention .
the defendants in the ulm trial were given relatively light prison sentences of between three and 15 years . why was that ?
the main problem that plagued all nazi war crime trials right up to the 1980s was the development of the so-called " accessory to murder " construct .
normally , a murderer is punished with a life sentence .
but most of the courts accepted that the main perpetrators of the mass murder of jews were the nazi leadership - hitler , himmler and others .
all the others were thus not considered murderers who killed jews out of a deep sense of personal motivation but rather simply helpers who aided in the crime .
that 's why the majority of nazi criminals were sentenced for being an accessory to murder .
it was only in cases where it could be proven that someone had committed crimes out of a sense of personal conviction that a life sentence was issued .
this strategy was strongly criticized in the 1960s and also proved to be wrong , because the courts were largely dealing with committed nazis and anti-semites .
another reason was that it was difficult to reconstruct crimes committed 10 or 12 years previously and build up cases with the help of eye witnesses that would eventually lead to court proceedings .
but the biggest problem was that the majority of the german population was simply not interested in tackling the past , and the authorities lacked the will to pursue people who committed atrocities under the nazis .
how were the sentences received in germany and abroad ?
there was certainly a resonance in the us and in israel , and i imagine there may have been some disappointments , particularly among jews .
in germany , reaction was divided because a liberal segment in society was deeply interested in the trial in the late 1950s and followed it critically .
but the majority of the german population at the time simply did n't want anything to do with it .
it 's true , the sentences in the ulm trial were very light .
there is hardly any person accused of crimes under the nazis who served out the entirety of the sentence issued in the federal republic of germany .
what effect did the ulm einsatzgruppen trial have on west germany 's efforts to bring nazi war criminals to justice ?
one of the most important and immediate political fall-outs of the ulm trial was that justice ministers in west germany , spurred on by the realization that many grave nazi crimes in eastern europe were left uninvestigated , completely reversed the existing investigation procedure .
they no longer relied on coincidences to bring nazi crimes to light but rather on systematically investigating them .
that was the immediate trigger for the establishment of a unique central authority in ludwigsburg to compile , coordinate and investigate all types of crimes committed under the nazis .
beyond that , the ulm trial was only a brief shock for the german population .
the real jolt came with the adolf eichmann arrest and trial and the auschwitz trial in frankfurt in 1963 .
the general awareness in the german population that most nazi crimes were committed in eastern europe and that the murderers live among us in society only sank in later . interview : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the so-called ulm einsatzgruppen trial , one of the largest in a west german court that centered on the mass murder of jews , accused the men , gestapo and ss members , of killing more than 5,000 jewish men , women and children in lithuania .
the proceedings revealed gruesome crimes and showed that many of the perpetrators continued to live normal lives in west germany for years after the war , their murderous campaign largely undetected .
the trial is considered a major break with how germany dealt with its nazi past until then .
dw-world.de spoke to dieter pohl , a historian and lecturer at the institute for contemporary history in munich , about the historic trial 50 years ago .
dw-world.de : the ulm einsatzgruppen trial is considered a turning point in how germany dealt with its nazi past .
why is that ?
dieter pohl : the bulk of the nazi war crime trials took place right after 1945 .
basically , from 1945 to 1949 , there were parallel allied tribunals and german courts .
the german courts largely dealt with crimes committed against german citizens ; the allied courts dealt with all others , which meant the majority of nazi crimes .
these proceedings petered out by the end of the 1940s and early 1950s largely because west german society suppressed the past and preferred not to talk about it .
nazi crimes hardly found mention in public discourse in the early 1950s . thus the ulm trial in 1958 marked the reopening of criminal proceedings against nazi criminals .
it was seen as a sign that the west german judicial system was taking the nazi past more seriously . but the most striking thing about the ulm trial was that it made clear that nazi atrocities were not just committed within the third reich but largely in eastern europe .
the 10 defendants in the ulm trial stood accused of murdering more than 5,000 jewish men , women and children .
who were these men ?
were they cold-blooded killers or just " ordinary men " ?
no , they certainly were n't average germans .
they were members of the gestapo in tilsit -lsb- editor 's note : the now russian town of sovetsk -rsb- on the northeastern tip of the third reich , some were even long-time ss members .
they were largely career policemen , people who usually joined the crime force and then went on to join the gestapo during the 1930s .
usually the leading personnel involved die-hard nazis - people who joined the nsdap relatively early , actively supported the nazi ideology and cracked down on the opponents of the ideology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the dock - some of the defendants in the ulm trial right after the wehrmacht 's invasion of the soviet union on june 22 , 1941 , the gestapo tilsit followed with small commandos , entered western lithuanian territory and began shooting jews .
this was where the first mass murder of jews in the so-called " final solution " took place on june 24 , 1941 , just two days after the beginning of the german campaign in the town of garsden .
the commandos largely targeted young jewish men old enough to join the army ; women and children were only killed in exceptions .
the crimes set the stage for what followed in the entire occupied soviet union over the next two years - large massacres of jewish communities with all the brutalities that went with it .
how did the ulm trial come about ? actually due to sheer coincidence .
one of the main defendants , bernhard fischer-schweder , the police chief in memel , lithuania , in 1941 and involved in the murder of thousands of jews , assumed a false name after 1945 and was appointed director of a refugee shelter near ulm in 1955 .
he was fired when his past came to light .
when he was refused another public sector job , fischer-schweder filed a lawsuit in a labor court .
a survivor of fischer-schweder 's murderous campaign in lithuania came across a newspaper article about the court case and identified him , revealing details about his past .
that provided the trigger for the trial .
unfortunately , most cases against nazi criminals at the time came into being this way .
a surviving victim usually happened to discover a perpetrator and then filed a lawsuit against him .
what kind of an atmosphere did the trial take place in ?
how was it viewed by the west germans and the justice system ?
the trial came at a time when much of the german population simply wanted to draw a line under the past .
after several years of allied rule and a constant focus on the nazi past , most people simply did n't want to hear about it anymore .
the judicial system in germany was partly shocked to see that severely incriminated perpetrators of nazi crimes had managed to get away without facing any criminal proceedings .
it was largely the then state prosecutor of baden-wuerttemberg , erwin schuele , who personally fought for the trial to take place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nuremberg war crimes trials in 1945 are well known but at the same time , germany 's judicial system in the 1950s was n't particularly interested in pursuing nazi crimes .
that had partly to do with the nazi-weary mentality of the time .
another major reason for the reluctance to crack down on nazi abuses was that there were quite a few lawyers and state prosecutors who had previously been members of the nazi party .
the presence of so many former nazis in the german judicial system gathered force in the 1950s , because many who underwent denazification and were dismissed from public service earlier reentered the system in the early 1950s .
yet ulm did command immense media attention in the federal republic of germany .
it was n't the first trial of its kind but it was certainly the most elaborate and most publicized of the time .
usually , with the exception of the big nazi war crime trials in allied tribunals , only a few regional and local papers reported about such cases .
in the 1950s especially , such trials hardly sparked any nationwide attention .
the defendants in the ulm trial were given relatively light prison sentences of between three and 15 years . why was that ?
the main problem that plagued all nazi war crime trials right up to the 1980s was the development of the so-called " accessory to murder " construct .
normally , a murderer is punished with a life sentence .
but most of the courts accepted that the main perpetrators of the mass murder of jews were the nazi leadership - hitler , himmler and others .
all the others were thus not considered murderers who killed jews out of a deep sense of personal motivation but rather simply helpers who aided in the crime .
that 's why the majority of nazi criminals were sentenced for being an accessory to murder .
it was only in cases where it could be proven that someone had committed crimes out of a sense of personal conviction that a life sentence was issued .
this strategy was strongly criticized in the 1960s and also proved to be wrong , because the courts were largely dealing with committed nazis and anti-semites .

how were the sentences received in germany and abroad ?
there was certainly a resonance in the us and in israel , and i imagine there may have been some disappointments , particularly among jews .

it was seen as a sign that the west german judicial system was taking the nazi past more seriously . but the most striking thing about the ulm trial was that it made clear that nazi atrocities were not just committed within the third reich but largely in eastern europe .
the 10 defendants in the ulm trial stood accused of murdering more than 5,000 jewish men , women and children .
who were these men ?
were they cold-blooded killers or just " ordinary men " ?
no , they certainly were n't average germans .
they were members of the gestapo in tilsit -lsb- editor 's note : the now russian town of sovetsk -rsb- on the northeastern tip of the third reich , some were even long-time ss members .
they were largely career policemen , people who usually joined the crime force and then went on to join the gestapo during the 1930s .
usually the leading personnel involved die-hard nazis - people who joined the nsdap relatively early , actively supported the nazi ideology and cracked down on the opponents of the ideology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the dock - some of the defendants in the ulm trial right after the wehrmacht 's invasion of the soviet union on june 22 , 1941 , the gestapo tilsit followed with small commandos , entered western lithuanian territory and began shooting jews .
this was where the first mass murder of jews in the so-called " final solution " took place on june 24 , 1941 , just two days after the beginning of the german campaign in the town of garsden .
the commandos largely targeted young jewish men old enough to join the army ; women and children were only killed in exceptions .
the crimes set the stage for what followed in the entire occupied soviet union over the next two years - large massacres of jewish communities with all the brutalities that went with it .
how did the ulm trial come about ? actually due to sheer coincidence .
one of the main defendants , bernhard fischer-schweder , the police chief in memel , lithuania , in 1941 and involved in the murder of thousands of jews , assumed a false name after 1945 and was appointed director of a refugee shelter near ulm in 1955 .
he was fired when his past came to light .
when he was refused another public sector job , fischer-schweder filed a lawsuit in a labor court .
a survivor of fischer-schweder 's murderous campaign in lithuania came across a newspaper article about the court case and identified him , revealing details about his past .
that provided the trigger for the trial .
unfortunately , most cases against nazi criminals at the time came into being this way .
a surviving victim usually happened to discover a perpetrator and then filed a lawsuit against him .
what kind of an atmosphere did the trial take place in ?
how was it viewed by the west germans and the justice system ?
the trial came at a time when much of the german population simply wanted to draw a line under the past .
after several years of allied rule and a constant focus on the nazi past , most people simply did n't want to hear about it anymore .
the judicial system in germany was partly shocked to see that severely incriminated perpetrators of nazi crimes had managed to get away without facing any criminal proceedings .
it was largely the then state prosecutor of baden-wuerttemberg , erwin schuele , who personally fought for the trial to take place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nuremberg war crimes trials in 1945 are well known but at the same time , germany 's judicial system in the 1950s was n't particularly interested in pursuing nazi crimes .
that had partly to do with the nazi-weary mentality of the time .
another major reason for the reluctance to crack down on nazi abuses was that there were quite a few lawyers and state prosecutors who had previously been members of the nazi party .
the presence of so many former nazis in the german judicial system gathered force in the 1950s , because many who underwent denazification and were dismissed from public service earlier reentered the system in the early 1950s .
yet ulm did command immense media attention in the federal republic of germany .
it was n't the first trial of its kind but it was certainly the most elaborate and most publicized of the time .
usually , with the exception of the big nazi war crime trials in allied tribunals , only a few regional and local papers reported about such cases .
in the 1950s especially , such trials hardly sparked any nationwide attention .
the defendants in the ulm trial were given relatively light prison sentences of between three and 15 years . why was that ?
the main problem that plagued all nazi war crime trials right up to the 1980s was the development of the so-called " accessory to murder " construct .
normally , a murderer is punished with a life sentence .
but most of the courts accepted that the main perpetrators of the mass murder of jews were the nazi leadership - hitler , himmler and others .
all the others were thus not considered murderers who killed jews out of a deep sense of personal motivation but rather simply helpers who aided in the crime .
that 's why the majority of nazi criminals were sentenced for being an accessory to murder .
it was only in cases where it could be proven that someone had committed crimes out of a sense of personal conviction that a life sentence was issued .
this strategy was strongly criticized in the 1960s and also proved to be wrong , because the courts were largely dealing with committed nazis and anti-semites .
another reason was that it was difficult to reconstruct crimes committed 10 or 12 years previously and build up cases with the help of eye witnesses that would eventually lead to court proceedings .
but the biggest problem was that the majority of the german population was simply not interested in tackling the past , and the authorities lacked the will to pursue people who committed atrocities under the nazis .
how were the sentences received in germany and abroad ?
there was certainly a resonance in the us and in israel , and i imagine there may have been some disappointments , particularly among jews .
in germany , reaction was divided because a liberal segment in society was deeply interested in the trial in the late 1950s and followed it critically .
but the majority of the german population at the time simply did n't want anything to do with it .
it 's true , the sentences in the ulm trial were very light .
there is hardly any person accused of crimes under the nazis who served out the entirety of the sentence issued in the federal republic of germany .
what effect did the ulm einsatzgruppen trial have on west germany 's efforts to bring nazi war criminals to justice ?
one of the most important and immediate political fall-outs of the ulm trial was that justice ministers in west germany , spurred on by the realization that many grave nazi crimes in eastern europe were left uninvestigated , completely reversed the existing investigation procedure .
they no longer relied on coincidences to bring nazi crimes to light but rather on systematically investigating them .
that was the immediate trigger for the establishment of a unique central authority in ludwigsburg to compile , coordinate and investigate all types of crimes committed under the nazis .
beyond that , the ulm trial was only a brief shock for the german population .
the real jolt came with the adolf eichmann arrest and trial and the auschwitz trial in frankfurt in 1963 .
the general awareness in the german population that most nazi crimes were committed in eastern europe and that the murderers live among us in society only sank in later . interview : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the so-called ulm einsatzgruppen trial , one of the largest in a west german court that centered on the mass murder of jews , accused the men , gestapo and ss members , of killing more than 5,000 jewish men , women and children in lithuania .
the proceedings revealed gruesome crimes and showed that many of the perpetrators continued to live normal lives in west germany for years after the war , their murderous campaign largely undetected .
the trial is considered a major break with how germany dealt with its nazi past until then .
dw-world.de spoke to dieter pohl , a historian and lecturer at the institute for contemporary history in munich , about the historic trial 50 years ago .
dw-world.de : the ulm einsatzgruppen trial is considered a turning point in how germany dealt with its nazi past .
why is that ?
dieter pohl : the bulk of the nazi war crime trials took place right after 1945 .
basically , from 1945 to 1949 , there were parallel allied tribunals and german courts .
the german courts largely dealt with crimes committed against german citizens ; the allied courts dealt with all others , which meant the majority of nazi crimes .
these proceedings petered out by the end of the 1940s and early 1950s largely because west german society suppressed the past and preferred not to talk about it .
nazi crimes hardly found mention in public discourse in the early 1950s . thus the ulm trial in 1958 marked the reopening of criminal proceedings against nazi criminals .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 20.05.2008 europe readies for nasty food fight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the farm lobby is strong in germany stabilizing food prices across europe needs to be a top priority , europe 's agriculture ministers agree .
the hard part will be deciding how to best reform the system . current european union agricultural policy encourages farmers to keep land fallow , a practice that seems to contradict the rising global demand for food .
the eu seems likely to acknowledge it needs to put more land into production when it announces agricultural reforms on tuesday , may 20 .
one solution would be for the eu to phase out its program of paying farmers to keep farmland out of production , hoping that it will help stabilize food prices .
" i think it 's important that we continue to increase production in europe as much as we can within the natural limits , also taking into account environmental care , " agriculture and rural development commissioner mariann fischer boel told the dpa news agency .
fischer boel spent monday with eu agriculture ministers in brussels outlining her proposals to reform the bloc 's common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- .
yet the road to reforming the cap is likely to be long and riddled with obstacles .
even the relatively modest changes boel has proposed to direct farm subsidies are likely to be met with fierce resistance , particularly from france , which is the biggest recipient of agricultural aid .
britain calls for liberalization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer boel wants to increase production of some crops britain and some other member states would like to see the eu go even further in reforming its subsidies .
britain 's finance minister , alistair darling , called for europe to fundamentally reform its agricultural policy .
britain has argued that the current food crisis shows the need to liberalize laws .
all elements that keep prices above world market levels should be phased out , darling said last week .
those measures cost eu consumers 43 billion euros -lrb- $ 67 billion -rrb- in 2006 , he said .
darling also said he wants the eu to stop direct payments to farmers , which he said cost taxpayers an additional 34 billion euros in 2006 .
" barriers and distortions in the global food market increase volatility and stifle the incentives to increase supply to match demand , " he argued .
germany wants farmers protected slovenian agriculture minister iztok jarc , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , refused to comment on britain 's position , saying only that " there are many reasons for high food prices , so i would n't make a direct connection to the cap . "
" we do n't only have a problem with food prices , we also have the problem of climate change and high energy prices .
it 's a combination of all factors , " he said .
germany and france are against liberalization .
they say the current upswing in food prices show the importance of not liberalizing too much .
germany 's agriculture minister , horst seehofer , argues that " we have to make sure that we can provide this continent with food sustainability .
this can not be done by taking away subsidies from european farmers . "
long road ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposed changes could bring protests from farmers besides no longer paying farmers to leave land fallow , the eu proposals also call for phasing out quotas on milk production .
some observers have also guessed the eu will propose ending the extra bonuses given to farmers who grow crops which can be converted into fuel .
while fischer boel said she wants to see more money go towards environmental projects and less towards direct subsidy payments , she backed away from an earlier suggestion that subsidies to larger farms be capped .
that caused an outcry from germany and britain .
global food prices have nearly doubled in three years , according to the world bank .
the situation in developing countries has been of particular concern since higher costs have sparked riots and restrictions on food exports .
the cap proposals will go to eu member states and the european parliament for consideration in the second half of 2008 , during france 's eu presidency .
massive subsidies remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france is the biggest recipient of agricultural subsidies although food prices have eased somewhat in recent weeks , they remain at near record levels , with wheat up 84 percent over one year ago , corn up 21 percent , butter up 21 percent and eggs up 17 percent .
cost increases have a variety of causes including biofuel , trade constraints , increased demand from asia to serve changing diets , poor harvests and increasing transport costs .
if the cap reforms succeed in putting more land into production , it would be a reversal of past reform efforts , which have tried to reign in production .
in 2003 , the eu tried to discourage overproduction by " decoupling " subsidies from production .
despite reforms , farm hand-outs still make up 40 percent of the eu budget , by far the bloc 's biggest spending item . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet the road to reforming the cap is likely to be long and riddled with obstacles .
even the relatively modest changes boel has proposed to direct farm subsidies are likely to be met with fierce resistance , particularly from france , which is the biggest recipient of agricultural aid .
britain calls for liberalization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer boel wants to increase production of some crops britain and some other member states would like to see the eu go even further in reforming its subsidies .
britain 's finance minister , alistair darling , called for europe to fundamentally reform its agricultural policy .
britain has argued that the current food crisis shows the need to liberalize laws .
all elements that keep prices above world market levels should be phased out , darling said last week .
those measures cost eu consumers 43 billion euros -lrb- $ 67 billion -rrb- in 2006 , he said .
darling also said he wants the eu to stop direct payments to farmers , which he said cost taxpayers an additional 34 billion euros in 2006 .
" barriers and distortions in the global food market increase volatility and stifle the incentives to increase supply to match demand , " he argued .
germany wants farmers protected slovenian agriculture minister iztok jarc , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , refused to comment on britain 's position , saying only that " there are many reasons for high food prices , so i would n't make a direct connection to the cap . "
" we do n't only have a problem with food prices , we also have the problem of climate change and high energy prices .
it 's a combination of all factors , " he said .
germany and france are against liberalization .
they say the current upswing in food prices show the importance of not liberalizing too much .
germany 's agriculture minister , horst seehofer , argues that " we have to make sure that we can provide this continent with food sustainability .
this can not be done by taking away subsidies from european farmers . "
long road ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposed changes could bring protests from farmers besides no longer paying farmers to leave land fallow , the eu proposals also call for phasing out quotas on milk production .
some observers have also guessed the eu will propose ending the extra bonuses given to farmers who grow crops which can be converted into fuel .
while fischer boel said she wants to see more money go towards environmental projects and less towards direct subsidy payments , she backed away from an earlier suggestion that subsidies to larger farms be capped .
that caused an outcry from germany and britain .
global food prices have nearly doubled in three years , according to the world bank .
the situation in developing countries has been of particular concern since higher costs have sparked riots and restrictions on food exports .
the cap proposals will go to eu member states and the european parliament for consideration in the second half of 2008 , during france 's eu presidency .
massive subsidies remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france is the biggest recipient of agricultural subsidies although food prices have eased somewhat in recent weeks , they remain at near record levels , with wheat up 84 percent over one year ago , corn up 21 percent , butter up 21 percent and eggs up 17 percent .
cost increases have a variety of causes including biofuel , trade constraints , increased demand from asia to serve changing diets , poor harvests and increasing transport costs .
if the cap reforms succeed in putting more land into production , it would be a reversal of past reform efforts , which have tried to reign in production .
in 2003 , the eu tried to discourage overproduction by " decoupling " subsidies from production .

those measures cost eu consumers 43 billion euros -lrb- $ 67 billion -rrb- in 2006 , he said .
darling also said he wants the eu to stop direct payments to farmers , which he said cost taxpayers an additional 34 billion euros in 2006 .
" barriers and distortions in the global food market increase volatility and stifle the incentives to increase supply to match demand , " he argued .
germany wants farmers protected slovenian agriculture minister iztok jarc , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , refused to comment on britain 's position , saying only that " there are many reasons for high food prices , so i would n't make a direct connection to the cap . "
" we do n't only have a problem with food prices , we also have the problem of climate change and high energy prices .
it 's a combination of all factors , " he said .
germany and france are against liberalization .
they say the current upswing in food prices show the importance of not liberalizing too much .
germany 's agriculture minister , horst seehofer , argues that " we have to make sure that we can provide this continent with food sustainability .
this can not be done by taking away subsidies from european farmers . "
long road ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposed changes could bring protests from farmers besides no longer paying farmers to leave land fallow , the eu proposals also call for phasing out quotas on milk production .
some observers have also guessed the eu will propose ending the extra bonuses given to farmers who grow crops which can be converted into fuel .
while fischer boel said she wants to see more money go towards environmental projects and less towards direct subsidy payments , she backed away from an earlier suggestion that subsidies to larger farms be capped .
that caused an outcry from germany and britain .
global food prices have nearly doubled in three years , according to the world bank .
the situation in developing countries has been of particular concern since higher costs have sparked riots and restrictions on food exports .
the cap proposals will go to eu member states and the european parliament for consideration in the second half of 2008 , during france 's eu presidency .
massive subsidies remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france is the biggest recipient of agricultural subsidies although food prices have eased somewhat in recent weeks , they remain at near record levels , with wheat up 84 percent over one year ago , corn up 21 percent , butter up 21 percent and eggs up 17 percent .
cost increases have a variety of causes including biofuel , trade constraints , increased demand from asia to serve changing diets , poor harvests and increasing transport costs .
if the cap reforms succeed in putting more land into production , it would be a reversal of past reform efforts , which have tried to reign in production .
in 2003 , the eu tried to discourage overproduction by " decoupling " subsidies from production .
despite reforms , farm hand-outs still make up 40 percent of the eu budget , by far the bloc 's biggest spending item . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but this week , all serbs will be europe 's biggest fans as the continent 's largest song contest comes to belgrade . serbia 's three anti-european political parties want to move their country away from the european union and towards russia .
by agreeing on general principles to create a coalition last thursday , may 15 , they could even form the country 's next government - despite the fact that the pro-european party of serbian president boris tadic actually won early parliamentary elections on may 11 .
but tadic 's party has failed to find a coalition partner so far . amid this tense and anti-european political situation , serbia 's getting ready to host a truly european event - the eurovision song contest . the event 's organizers do n't want to let the situation spoil the mood and have been trying to ban political debate from the show . " participants represent their countries , not their governments , " said sandra susa , who 's responsible for organizing the contest .
" we 're calling on serbian and foreign media to set politics aside .
we 're here to have fun , because belgrade 's the only place to have that much fun . " friendly ambassadors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serifovic -lrb- left -rrb- has supported ultra-nationalist tomislav nikolic -lrb- right -rrb- in elections the eurovision song contest , which will have 43 participating countries this year , is coming to the serbian capital for the first time .
that 's because serbia 's marija serifovic won the competition last year with her song " molitva " -lrb- prayer -rrb- in helsinki , finland . incidentally , serifovic herself also raised some eyebrows earlier this year when she appeared at election rallies for serbia 's ultra-nationalist radical party - despite being appointed a european ambassador for intercultural dialogue by the european commission . be that as it may , the serbs want to make a good impression and be good hosts to their visitors .
belgrade , with its two million residents and a very active nightlife , provides a suitable background for the event .
but susa 's not just focusing on showing belgrade to the tourists . " the song contest gives belgrade , serbia and all of us a great opportunity to show our organizational talents and our hospitality , " she said .
" it could change serbia 's image in the world . " european onslaught everything 's meant to be perfect at belgrade 's arena , one of europe 's largest concert and sports venues .
the final on may 24 as well as the two semi-finals on may 20 and may 22 are being rehearsed down to the last detail .
tickets for the shows have been sold out , thanks to low prices : the most expensive ones cost 60 euros -lrb- $ 93 -rrb- . bildunterschrift : belgrade 's ready for europe - at least this week but even those fans who did n't manage to get tickets will be able to participate in the communal excitement as public viewing screens have been set up at belgrade 's large city hall square . the city is preparing for a major onslaught : some 1,500 participants , more than 3,500 journalists and about 15,000 visitors from all over europe are expected .
hotels are fully booked . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german group " no angels " hopes to break the spell this year and bring home the trophy " we 'll party a lot , " said jelena tomasevic , who will represent her country with " oro , " a favorite among eurovision internet forums . before that , she 'll first hope to hear those magic words that every eurovision contestant dreams about : " twelve points go to … " it 's the highest score each country can hand out and helps to decide the winner . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 20.05.2008 landmark trial pushed germany to tackle nazi past großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defendants lived normal lives in the midst of german society for years fifty years ago , a trial against 10 members of a nazi commando in the city of ulm , changed the way west germany dealt with its fascist past and crack down on crimes committed by the nazis . from july 28 to august 29 , 1958 , 10 men from a special nazi commando , " tilsit , " went on trial in the west german city of ulm in the state of baden-wuerttemberg .
the so-called ulm einsatzgruppen trial , one of the largest in a west german court that centered on the mass murder of jews , accused the men , gestapo and ss members , of killing more than 5,000 jewish men , women and children in lithuania .
the proceedings revealed gruesome crimes and showed that many of the perpetrators continued to live normal lives in west germany for years after the war , their murderous campaign largely undetected .
the trial is considered a major break with how germany dealt with its nazi past until then .
dw-world.de spoke to dieter pohl , a historian and lecturer at the institute for contemporary history in munich , about the historic trial 50 years ago .
dw-world.de : the ulm einsatzgruppen trial is considered a turning point in how germany dealt with its nazi past .
why is that ?
dieter pohl : the bulk of the nazi war crime trials took place right after 1945 .
basically , from 1945 to 1949 , there were parallel allied tribunals and german courts .
the german courts largely dealt with crimes committed against german citizens ; the allied courts dealt with all others , which meant the majority of nazi crimes .
these proceedings petered out by the end of the 1940s and early 1950s largely because west german society suppressed the past and preferred not to talk about it .
nazi crimes hardly found mention in public discourse in the early 1950s . thus the ulm trial in 1958 marked the reopening of criminal proceedings against nazi criminals .
it was seen as a sign that the west german judicial system was taking the nazi past more seriously . but the most striking thing about the ulm trial was that it made clear that nazi atrocities were not just committed within the third reich but largely in eastern europe .
the 10 defendants in the ulm trial stood accused of murdering more than 5,000 jewish men , women and children .
who were these men ?
were they cold-blooded killers or just " ordinary men " ?
no , they certainly were n't average germans .
they were members of the gestapo in tilsit -lsb- editor 's note : the now russian town of sovetsk -rsb- on the northeastern tip of the third reich , some were even long-time ss members .
they were largely career policemen , people who usually joined the crime force and then went on to join the gestapo during the 1930s .
usually the leading personnel involved die-hard nazis - people who joined the nsdap relatively early , actively supported the nazi ideology and cracked down on the opponents of the ideology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the dock - some of the defendants in the ulm trial right after the wehrmacht 's invasion of the soviet union on june 22 , 1941 , the gestapo tilsit followed with small commandos , entered western lithuanian territory and began shooting jews .
this was where the first mass murder of jews in the so-called " final solution " took place on june 24 , 1941 , just two days after the beginning of the german campaign in the town of garsden .
the commandos largely targeted young jewish men old enough to join the army ; women and children were only killed in exceptions .
the crimes set the stage for what followed in the entire occupied soviet union over the next two years - large massacres of jewish communities with all the brutalities that went with it .
how did the ulm trial come about ? actually due to sheer coincidence .
one of the main defendants , bernhard fischer-schweder , the police chief in memel , lithuania , in 1941 and involved in the murder of thousands of jews , assumed a false name after 1945 and was appointed director of a refugee shelter near ulm in 1955 .
he was fired when his past came to light .
when he was refused another public sector job , fischer-schweder filed a lawsuit in a labor court .
a survivor of fischer-schweder 's murderous campaign in lithuania came across a newspaper article about the court case and identified him , revealing details about his past .
that provided the trigger for the trial .
unfortunately , most cases against nazi criminals at the time came into being this way .
a surviving victim usually happened to discover a perpetrator and then filed a lawsuit against him .
what kind of an atmosphere did the trial take place in ?
how was it viewed by the west germans and the justice system ?
the trial came at a time when much of the german population simply wanted to draw a line under the past .
after several years of allied rule and a constant focus on the nazi past , most people simply did n't want to hear about it anymore .
the judicial system in germany was partly shocked to see that severely incriminated perpetrators of nazi crimes had managed to get away without facing any criminal proceedings .
it was largely the then state prosecutor of baden-wuerttemberg , erwin schuele , who personally fought for the trial to take place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nuremberg war crimes trials in 1945 are well known but at the same time , germany 's judicial system in the 1950s was n't particularly interested in pursuing nazi crimes .
that had partly to do with the nazi-weary mentality of the time .
another major reason for the reluctance to crack down on nazi abuses was that there were quite a few lawyers and state prosecutors who had previously been members of the nazi party .
the presence of so many former nazis in the german judicial system gathered force in the 1950s , because many who underwent denazification and were dismissed from public service earlier reentered the system in the early 1950s .
yet ulm did command immense media attention in the federal republic of germany .
it was n't the first trial of its kind but it was certainly the most elaborate and most publicized of the time .
usually , with the exception of the big nazi war crime trials in allied tribunals , only a few regional and local papers reported about such cases .
in the 1950s especially , such trials hardly sparked any nationwide attention .
the defendants in the ulm trial were given relatively light prison sentences of between three and 15 years . why was that ?
the main problem that plagued all nazi war crime trials right up to the 1980s was the development of the so-called " accessory to murder " construct .
normally , a murderer is punished with a life sentence .
but most of the courts accepted that the main perpetrators of the mass murder of jews were the nazi leadership - hitler , himmler and others .
all the others were thus not considered murderers who killed jews out of a deep sense of personal motivation but rather simply helpers who aided in the crime .
that 's why the majority of nazi criminals were sentenced for being an accessory to murder .
it was only in cases where it could be proven that someone had committed crimes out of a sense of personal conviction that a life sentence was issued .
this strategy was strongly criticized in the 1960s and also proved to be wrong , because the courts were largely dealing with committed nazis and anti-semites .
another reason was that it was difficult to reconstruct crimes committed 10 or 12 years previously and build up cases with the help of eye witnesses that would eventually lead to court proceedings .
but the biggest problem was that the majority of the german population was simply not interested in tackling the past , and the authorities lacked the will to pursue people who committed atrocities under the nazis .
how were the sentences received in germany and abroad ?
there was certainly a resonance in the us and in israel , and i imagine there may have been some disappointments , particularly among jews .
in germany , reaction was divided because a liberal segment in society was deeply interested in the trial in the late 1950s and followed it critically .
but the majority of the german population at the time simply did n't want anything to do with it .
it 's true , the sentences in the ulm trial were very light .
there is hardly any person accused of crimes under the nazis who served out the entirety of the sentence issued in the federal republic of germany .
what effect did the ulm einsatzgruppen trial have on west germany 's efforts to bring nazi war criminals to justice ?
one of the most important and immediate political fall-outs of the ulm trial was that justice ministers in west germany , spurred on by the realization that many grave nazi crimes in eastern europe were left uninvestigated , completely reversed the existing investigation procedure .
they no longer relied on coincidences to bring nazi crimes to light but rather on systematically investigating them .
that was the immediate trigger for the establishment of a unique central authority in ludwigsburg to compile , coordinate and investigate all types of crimes committed under the nazis .
beyond that , the ulm trial was only a brief shock for the german population .
the real jolt came with the adolf eichmann arrest and trial and the auschwitz trial in frankfurt in 1963 .
the general awareness in the german population that most nazi crimes were committed in eastern europe and that the murderers live among us in society only sank in later . interview : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but this week , all serbs will be europe 's biggest fans as the continent 's largest song contest comes to belgrade . serbia 's three anti-european political parties want to move their country away from the european union and towards russia .
by agreeing on general principles to create a coalition last thursday , may 15 , they could even form the country 's next government - despite the fact that the pro-european party of serbian president boris tadic actually won early parliamentary elections on may 11 .
but tadic 's party has failed to find a coalition partner so far . amid this tense and anti-european political situation , serbia 's getting ready to host a truly european event - the eurovision song contest . the event 's organizers do n't want to let the situation spoil the mood and have been trying to ban political debate from the show . " participants represent their countries , not their governments , " said sandra susa , who 's responsible for organizing the contest .
" we 're calling on serbian and foreign media to set politics aside .
we 're here to have fun , because belgrade 's the only place to have that much fun .

that 's because serbia 's marija serifovic won the competition last year with her song " molitva " -lrb- prayer -rrb- in helsinki , finland . incidentally , serifovic herself also raised some eyebrows earlier this year when she appeared at election rallies for serbia 's ultra-nationalist radical party - despite being appointed a european ambassador for intercultural dialogue by the european commission . be that as it may , the serbs want to make a good impression and be good hosts to their visitors .
belgrade , with its two million residents and a very active nightlife , provides a suitable background for the event .
but susa 's not just focusing on showing belgrade to the tourists . " the song contest gives belgrade , serbia and all of us a great opportunity to show our organizational talents and our hospitality , " she said .
" it could change serbia 's image in the world . " european onslaught everything 's meant to be perfect at belgrade 's arena , one of europe 's largest concert and sports venues .
the final on may 24 as well as the two semi-finals on may 20 and may 22 are being rehearsed down to the last detail .
tickets for the shows have been sold out , thanks to low prices : the most expensive ones cost 60 euros -lrb- $ 93 -rrb- . bildunterschrift : belgrade 's ready for europe - at least this week but even those fans who did n't manage to get tickets will be able to participate in the communal excitement as public viewing screens have been set up at belgrade 's large city hall square . the city is preparing for a major onslaught : some 1,500 participants , more than 3,500 journalists and about 15,000 visitors from all over europe are expected .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 20.05.2008 europe readies for nasty food fight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the farm lobby is strong in germany stabilizing food prices across europe needs to be a top priority , europe 's agriculture ministers agree .
the hard part will be deciding how to best reform the system . current european union agricultural policy encourages farmers to keep land fallow , a practice that seems to contradict the rising global demand for food .
the eu seems likely to acknowledge it needs to put more land into production when it announces agricultural reforms on tuesday , may 20 .
one solution would be for the eu to phase out its program of paying farmers to keep farmland out of production , hoping that it will help stabilize food prices .
" i think it 's important that we continue to increase production in europe as much as we can within the natural limits , also taking into account environmental care , " agriculture and rural development commissioner mariann fischer boel told the dpa news agency .
fischer boel spent monday with eu agriculture ministers in brussels outlining her proposals to reform the bloc 's common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- .
yet the road to reforming the cap is likely to be long and riddled with obstacles .
even the relatively modest changes boel has proposed to direct farm subsidies are likely to be met with fierce resistance , particularly from france , which is the biggest recipient of agricultural aid .
britain calls for liberalization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer boel wants to increase production of some crops britain and some other member states would like to see the eu go even further in reforming its subsidies .
britain 's finance minister , alistair darling , called for europe to fundamentally reform its agricultural policy .
britain has argued that the current food crisis shows the need to liberalize laws .
all elements that keep prices above world market levels should be phased out , darling said last week .
those measures cost eu consumers 43 billion euros -lrb- $ 67 billion -rrb- in 2006 , he said .
darling also said he wants the eu to stop direct payments to farmers , which he said cost taxpayers an additional 34 billion euros in 2006 .
" barriers and distortions in the global food market increase volatility and stifle the incentives to increase supply to match demand , " he argued .
germany wants farmers protected slovenian agriculture minister iztok jarc , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , refused to comment on britain 's position , saying only that " there are many reasons for high food prices , so i would n't make a direct connection to the cap . "
" we do n't only have a problem with food prices , we also have the problem of climate change and high energy prices .
it 's a combination of all factors , " he said .
germany and france are against liberalization .
they say the current upswing in food prices show the importance of not liberalizing too much .
germany 's agriculture minister , horst seehofer , argues that " we have to make sure that we can provide this continent with food sustainability .
this can not be done by taking away subsidies from european farmers . "
long road ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposed changes could bring protests from farmers besides no longer paying farmers to leave land fallow , the eu proposals also call for phasing out quotas on milk production .
some observers have also guessed the eu will propose ending the extra bonuses given to farmers who grow crops which can be converted into fuel .
while fischer boel said she wants to see more money go towards environmental projects and less towards direct subsidy payments , she backed away from an earlier suggestion that subsidies to larger farms be capped .
that caused an outcry from germany and britain .
global food prices have nearly doubled in three years , according to the world bank .
the situation in developing countries has been of particular concern since higher costs have sparked riots and restrictions on food exports .
the cap proposals will go to eu member states and the european parliament for consideration in the second half of 2008 , during france 's eu presidency .
massive subsidies remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france is the biggest recipient of agricultural subsidies although food prices have eased somewhat in recent weeks , they remain at near record levels , with wheat up 84 percent over one year ago , corn up 21 percent , butter up 21 percent and eggs up 17 percent .
cost increases have a variety of causes including biofuel , trade constraints , increased demand from asia to serve changing diets , poor harvests and increasing transport costs .
if the cap reforms succeed in putting more land into production , it would be a reversal of past reform efforts , which have tried to reign in production .
in 2003 , the eu tried to discourage overproduction by " decoupling " subsidies from production .
despite reforms , farm hand-outs still make up 40 percent of the eu budget , by far the bloc 's biggest spending item . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 20.05.2008 landmark trial pushed germany to tackle nazi past großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defendants lived normal lives in the midst of german society for years fifty years ago , a trial against 10 members of a nazi commando in the city of ulm , changed the way west germany dealt with its fascist past and crack down on crimes committed by the nazis . from july 28 to august 29 , 1958 , 10 men from a special nazi commando , " tilsit , " went on trial in the west german city of ulm in the state of baden-wuerttemberg .
the so-called ulm einsatzgruppen trial , one of the largest in a west german court that centered on the mass murder of jews , accused the men , gestapo and ss members , of killing more than 5,000 jewish men , women and children in lithuania .
the proceedings revealed gruesome crimes and showed that many of the perpetrators continued to live normal lives in west germany for years after the war , their murderous campaign largely undetected .
the trial is considered a major break with how germany dealt with its nazi past until then .
dw-world.de spoke to dieter pohl , a historian and lecturer at the institute for contemporary history in munich , about the historic trial 50 years ago .
dw-world.de : the ulm einsatzgruppen trial is considered a turning point in how germany dealt with its nazi past .
why is that ?
dieter pohl : the bulk of the nazi war crime trials took place right after 1945 .
basically , from 1945 to 1949 , there were parallel allied tribunals and german courts .
the german courts largely dealt with crimes committed against german citizens ; the allied courts dealt with all others , which meant the majority of nazi crimes .
these proceedings petered out by the end of the 1940s and early 1950s largely because west german society suppressed the past and preferred not to talk about it .
nazi crimes hardly found mention in public discourse in the early 1950s . thus the ulm trial in 1958 marked the reopening of criminal proceedings against nazi criminals .
it was seen as a sign that the west german judicial system was taking the nazi past more seriously . but the most striking thing about the ulm trial was that it made clear that nazi atrocities were not just committed within the third reich but largely in eastern europe .
the 10 defendants in the ulm trial stood accused of murdering more than 5,000 jewish men , women and children .
who were these men ?
were they cold-blooded killers or just " ordinary men " ?
no , they certainly were n't average germans .
they were members of the gestapo in tilsit -lsb- editor 's note : the now russian town of sovetsk -rsb- on the northeastern tip of the third reich , some were even long-time ss members .
they were largely career policemen , people who usually joined the crime force and then went on to join the gestapo during the 1930s .
usually the leading personnel involved die-hard nazis - people who joined the nsdap relatively early , actively supported the nazi ideology and cracked down on the opponents of the ideology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the dock - some of the defendants in the ulm trial right after the wehrmacht 's invasion of the soviet union on june 22 , 1941 , the gestapo tilsit followed with small commandos , entered western lithuanian territory and began shooting jews .
this was where the first mass murder of jews in the so-called " final solution " took place on june 24 , 1941 , just two days after the beginning of the german campaign in the town of garsden .
the commandos largely targeted young jewish men old enough to join the army ; women and children were only killed in exceptions .
the crimes set the stage for what followed in the entire occupied soviet union over the next two years - large massacres of jewish communities with all the brutalities that went with it .
how did the ulm trial come about ? actually due to sheer coincidence .
one of the main defendants , bernhard fischer-schweder , the police chief in memel , lithuania , in 1941 and involved in the murder of thousands of jews , assumed a false name after 1945 and was appointed director of a refugee shelter near ulm in 1955 .
he was fired when his past came to light .
when he was refused another public sector job , fischer-schweder filed a lawsuit in a labor court .
a survivor of fischer-schweder 's murderous campaign in lithuania came across a newspaper article about the court case and identified him , revealing details about his past .
that provided the trigger for the trial .
unfortunately , most cases against nazi criminals at the time came into being this way .
a surviving victim usually happened to discover a perpetrator and then filed a lawsuit against him .
what kind of an atmosphere did the trial take place in ?
how was it viewed by the west germans and the justice system ?
the trial came at a time when much of the german population simply wanted to draw a line under the past .
after several years of allied rule and a constant focus on the nazi past , most people simply did n't want to hear about it anymore .
the judicial system in germany was partly shocked to see that severely incriminated perpetrators of nazi crimes had managed to get away without facing any criminal proceedings .
it was largely the then state prosecutor of baden-wuerttemberg , erwin schuele , who personally fought for the trial to take place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nuremberg war crimes trials in 1945 are well known but at the same time , germany 's judicial system in the 1950s was n't particularly interested in pursuing nazi crimes .
that had partly to do with the nazi-weary mentality of the time .
another major reason for the reluctance to crack down on nazi abuses was that there were quite a few lawyers and state prosecutors who had previously been members of the nazi party .
the presence of so many former nazis in the german judicial system gathered force in the 1950s , because many who underwent denazification and were dismissed from public service earlier reentered the system in the early 1950s .
yet ulm did command immense media attention in the federal republic of germany .
it was n't the first trial of its kind but it was certainly the most elaborate and most publicized of the time .
usually , with the exception of the big nazi war crime trials in allied tribunals , only a few regional and local papers reported about such cases .
in the 1950s especially , such trials hardly sparked any nationwide attention .
the defendants in the ulm trial were given relatively light prison sentences of between three and 15 years . why was that ?
the main problem that plagued all nazi war crime trials right up to the 1980s was the development of the so-called " accessory to murder " construct .
normally , a murderer is punished with a life sentence .
but most of the courts accepted that the main perpetrators of the mass murder of jews were the nazi leadership - hitler , himmler and others .
all the others were thus not considered murderers who killed jews out of a deep sense of personal motivation but rather simply helpers who aided in the crime .
that 's why the majority of nazi criminals were sentenced for being an accessory to murder .
it was only in cases where it could be proven that someone had committed crimes out of a sense of personal conviction that a life sentence was issued .
this strategy was strongly criticized in the 1960s and also proved to be wrong , because the courts were largely dealing with committed nazis and anti-semites .
another reason was that it was difficult to reconstruct crimes committed 10 or 12 years previously and build up cases with the help of eye witnesses that would eventually lead to court proceedings .
but the biggest problem was that the majority of the german population was simply not interested in tackling the past , and the authorities lacked the will to pursue people who committed atrocities under the nazis .
how were the sentences received in germany and abroad ?
there was certainly a resonance in the us and in israel , and i imagine there may have been some disappointments , particularly among jews .
in germany , reaction was divided because a liberal segment in society was deeply interested in the trial in the late 1950s and followed it critically .
but the majority of the german population at the time simply did n't want anything to do with it .
it 's true , the sentences in the ulm trial were very light .
there is hardly any person accused of crimes under the nazis who served out the entirety of the sentence issued in the federal republic of germany .
what effect did the ulm einsatzgruppen trial have on west germany 's efforts to bring nazi war criminals to justice ?
one of the most important and immediate political fall-outs of the ulm trial was that justice ministers in west germany , spurred on by the realization that many grave nazi crimes in eastern europe were left uninvestigated , completely reversed the existing investigation procedure .
they no longer relied on coincidences to bring nazi crimes to light but rather on systematically investigating them .
that was the immediate trigger for the establishment of a unique central authority in ludwigsburg to compile , coordinate and investigate all types of crimes committed under the nazis .
beyond that , the ulm trial was only a brief shock for the german population .
the real jolt came with the adolf eichmann arrest and trial and the auschwitz trial in frankfurt in 1963 .
the general awareness in the german population that most nazi crimes were committed in eastern europe and that the murderers live among us in society only sank in later . interview : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they managed to get it under control by sunset . a fire which broke out tuesday afternoon at berlin 's philharmonie , the concert hall that is home to the berlin philharmonic , was under control before sunset , berlin fire chief wilfried graefling said . the fire was , however , still smouldering , and the damage was considerable , he told berlin 's regional public broadcaster rbb . graefling said the fire had broken out in the iconic golden building at around 2 p.m. while repairs to the roof were being carried out .
a police spokeswoman said a probe into the cause was underway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firemen battled the blaze all afternoon by mid-afternoon , a pall of brown smoke hung over the area close to berlin 's central tiergarten park . fire crews were expected to work into the night to douse the fire completely . " but things will not deteriorate , " graefling said .
he added that the concrete roof of the 45-year-old building had held , and that damage from the water used to douse the fire was thus limited . musicians evacuated expensive instruments from the building , which also houses a musical instrument museum . the fire alert began only an hour before the famous orchestra , an adult choir and 400 children were to have begun a joint rehearsal for a concert to take place friday night .
the building was cleared , and nobody was injured .
bildunterschrift : an aerial view showed the extent of the fire firefighters spent hours ripping off parts of the golden sheet-metal roof to gain access to burning insulation . the hall 's chief executive , pamela rosenberg , said claudio abbado , who retired as conductor of the orchestra in 2002 , had been in the building at the time the blaze began , preparing for a comeback program from friday to sunday . sir simon rattle , the orchestra 's regular conductor , was in france , she added . the 2,200-seat building , designed by hans scharoun , opened in 1963 on the west berlin side of the berlin wall . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we can do many things wrong here -lsb- in latin america -rsb- if we do not pay attention to it , " merkel said .
" however , we can do many things right , and secure many jobs in germany , if we build long-term partnerships . "
no concrete details of the agreement were made public , although merkel said the first step would be an analysis of how the rising living standards in emerging countries are influencing the situation regarding foodstuffs .
mexico says production boost needed in a joint press conference with merkel , calderon called for a massive increase in food production around the world .
he stressed that a " very aggressive production boost " is needed and blamed the food scarcity on stronger demand in china and india but also on the massive use of corn by the united states to boost its ethanol production .
the rise in the price of corn , a staple in the mexican diet across all sectors of society , has caused particular worry in mexico in recent months .
neighboring countries like haiti and honduras have even seen violent riots in a reaction to rising food prices - as have other countries round the world .
merkel , who arrived in mexico late sunday , was given an official welcome at the central courtyard of the national palace , prior to a mexico and germany economic forum .
calderon attended last year 's g8 summit in heiligendamm , germany , alongside the leaders of a group of emerging countries such as brazil , india , south africa and china .
according to figures made public by the mexican-german chamber of commerce and industry , over 1,000 german firms are currently active in mexico , and the volume of trade between the two countries is almost $ 14 billion -lrb- 8.9 billion euros -rrb- a year . dpa news agency -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it falls short of what sponsor france originally wanted . the european commission laid out its views in strasbourg on tuesday , may 20 . the project is open to all eu member states as well as countries from north africa , the middle east and the balkans and includes the palestinian authorities . this is an initiative to reinforce , to reinvigorate our relationship , " eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said at a press conference .
" the more we can develop the region in the south , the less illegal migration there will be … the more prosperity we can give , the less terrorism , the less criminality will be there . " potential tasks for the new union will be to open new sea traffic routes , clean up mediterranean waters , improve maritime security and exploit solar power in northern africa to help meet europe 's energy needs . slight to sarkozy ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new union could help better regulate mediterranean waters but the association described by the eu falls short of what france - and in particular french president nicolas sarkozy - had envisioned . sarkozy had hoped for a much more tightly knit alliance restricted to territories with mediterranean shores .
he had touted his vision as a potential avenue for peace between israel and the palestinians and had hinted it might be offered to turkey as an alternative to eu membership . but those plans were scaled back after objections by powerful eu states not actually bordering the mediterranean , including germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy was unable to win over the rest of the eu turkey also only agreed to participate , if offered assurances that the union was not being put forward as an alternative to joining the eu - something the commission explicitly stated on tuesday . " this project is not directed against turkey , " ferrero-waldner said . the eu also scaled back the bureaucracy for the union and the frequency with which it will meet , making it essentially a new umbrella organization for an already existing euro-mediterranean partnership known as the barcelona process . the inaugural summit for the new bloc is scheduled for mid-july in paris . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on dsl , voice traffic is more or less an afterthought . the wired arcor network was established in the 1990s using the german railway system 's own telecommunications lines as a backbone . vodafone chief executive friedrich joussen said vodafone and arcor were currently providing 13 percent of german dsl connections , but the joint company aimed to raise that market share to 20 percent . dpa news agency -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on may 8 , the date commemorating the unconditional surrender of nazi germany to the allies - or ve day - a government appeals committee that deals with matters pertaining to the holocaust victims ' law and decided to grant jews who lived under curfew during world war ii the same compensation rights as other holocaust victims .
according to the holocaust victim 's law , those who lived under nazi rule and were " deprived of their freedom " are entitled to receive remuneration from the german government .
three years ago , the supreme court ruled that bulgarian jews who were expelled from their homes would be entitled to compensation , but those who rather lived under military-imposed curfews were deemed ineligible for this benefit .
the committee , after receiving a petition submitted from 109 bulgarian and romanian holocaust victims who were forced to live in restricted conditions but were not expelled from their homes , reversed the previous decision , thereby rendering the victims eligible .
in 1941 in bulgaria the " national defense law " was enacted , containing various provisions which restricted the freedom of movement of jews .
under the law , jews who remained were obligated to change their place of residence , and were concentrated into special quarters in cities and forbidden from leaving their homes .
the restrictions lasted for two years .

" we can do many things wrong here -lsb- in latin america -rsb- if we do not pay attention to it , " merkel said .
" however , we can do many things right , and secure many jobs in germany , if we build long-term partnerships . "
no concrete details of the agreement were made public , although merkel said the first step would be an analysis of how the rising living standards in emerging countries are influencing the situation regarding foodstuffs .
mexico says production boost needed in a joint press conference with merkel , calderon called for a massive increase in food production around the world .
he stressed that a " very aggressive production boost " is needed and blamed the food scarcity on stronger demand in china and india but also on the massive use of corn by the united states to boost its ethanol production .

merkel , who arrived in mexico late sunday , was given an official welcome at the central courtyard of the national palace , prior to a mexico and germany economic forum .
calderon attended last year 's g8 summit in heiligendamm , germany , alongside the leaders of a group of emerging countries such as brazil , india , south africa and china .

but it falls short of what sponsor france originally wanted . the european commission laid out its views in strasbourg on tuesday , may 20 . the project is open to all eu member states as well as countries from north africa , the middle east and the balkans and includes the palestinian authorities . this is an initiative to reinforce , to reinvigorate our relationship , " eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said at a press conference .
" the more we can develop the region in the south , the less illegal migration there will be … the more prosperity we can give , the less terrorism , the less criminality will be there .

" we can do many things wrong here -lsb- in latin america -rsb- if we do not pay attention to it , " merkel said .
" however , we can do many things right , and secure many jobs in germany , if we build long-term partnerships . "
no concrete details of the agreement were made public , although merkel said the first step would be an analysis of how the rising living standards in emerging countries are influencing the situation regarding foodstuffs .
mexico says production boost needed in a joint press conference with merkel , calderon called for a massive increase in food production around the world .
he stressed that a " very aggressive production boost " is needed and blamed the food scarcity on stronger demand in china and india but also on the massive use of corn by the united states to boost its ethanol production .
the rise in the price of corn , a staple in the mexican diet across all sectors of society , has caused particular worry in mexico in recent months .
neighboring countries like haiti and honduras have even seen violent riots in a reaction to rising food prices - as have other countries round the world .
merkel , who arrived in mexico late sunday , was given an official welcome at the central courtyard of the national palace , prior to a mexico and germany economic forum .
calderon attended last year 's g8 summit in heiligendamm , germany , alongside the leaders of a group of emerging countries such as brazil , india , south africa and china .
according to figures made public by the mexican-german chamber of commerce and industry , over 1,000 german firms are currently active in mexico , and the volume of trade between the two countries is almost $ 14 billion -lrb- 8.9 billion euros -rrb- a year . dpa news agency -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the proceedings revealed gruesome crimes and showed that many of the perpetrators continued to live normal lives in west germany for years after the war , their murderous campaign largely undetected .
the trial is considered a major break with how germany dealt with its nazi past until then .
dw-world.de spoke to dieter pohl , a historian and lecturer at the institute for contemporary history in munich , about the historic trial 50 years ago .
dw-world.de : the ulm einsatzgruppen trial is considered a turning point in how germany dealt with its nazi past .
why is that ?
dieter pohl : the bulk of the nazi war crime trials took place right after 1945 .
basically , from 1945 to 1949 , there were parallel allied tribunals and german courts .
the german courts largely dealt with crimes committed against german citizens ; the allied courts dealt with all others , which meant the majority of nazi crimes .
these proceedings petered out by the end of the 1940s and early 1950s largely because west german society suppressed the past and preferred not to talk about it .
nazi crimes hardly found mention in public discourse in the early 1950s . thus the ulm trial in 1958 marked the reopening of criminal proceedings against nazi criminals .
it was seen as a sign that the west german judicial system was taking the nazi past more seriously . but the most striking thing about the ulm trial was that it made clear that nazi atrocities were not just committed within the third reich but largely in eastern europe .
the 10 defendants in the ulm trial stood accused of murdering more than 5,000 jewish men , women and children .
who were these men ?
were they cold-blooded killers or just " ordinary men " ?
no , they certainly were n't average germans .
they were members of the gestapo in tilsit -lsb- editor 's note : the now russian town of sovetsk -rsb- on the northeastern tip of the third reich , some were even long-time ss members .
they were largely career policemen , people who usually joined the crime force and then went on to join the gestapo during the 1930s .
usually the leading personnel involved die-hard nazis - people who joined the nsdap relatively early , actively supported the nazi ideology and cracked down on the opponents of the ideology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the dock - some of the defendants in the ulm trial right after the wehrmacht 's invasion of the soviet union on june 22 , 1941 , the gestapo tilsit followed with small commandos , entered western lithuanian territory and began shooting jews .
this was where the first mass murder of jews in the so-called " final solution " took place on june 24 , 1941 , just two days after the beginning of the german campaign in the town of garsden .
the commandos largely targeted young jewish men old enough to join the army ; women and children were only killed in exceptions .
the crimes set the stage for what followed in the entire occupied soviet union over the next two years - large massacres of jewish communities with all the brutalities that went with it .
how did the ulm trial come about ? actually due to sheer coincidence .
one of the main defendants , bernhard fischer-schweder , the police chief in memel , lithuania , in 1941 and involved in the murder of thousands of jews , assumed a false name after 1945 and was appointed director of a refugee shelter near ulm in 1955 .
he was fired when his past came to light .
when he was refused another public sector job , fischer-schweder filed a lawsuit in a labor court .
a survivor of fischer-schweder 's murderous campaign in lithuania came across a newspaper article about the court case and identified him , revealing details about his past .
that provided the trigger for the trial .
unfortunately , most cases against nazi criminals at the time came into being this way .
a surviving victim usually happened to discover a perpetrator and then filed a lawsuit against him .
what kind of an atmosphere did the trial take place in ?
how was it viewed by the west germans and the justice system ?
the trial came at a time when much of the german population simply wanted to draw a line under the past .
after several years of allied rule and a constant focus on the nazi past , most people simply did n't want to hear about it anymore .
the judicial system in germany was partly shocked to see that severely incriminated perpetrators of nazi crimes had managed to get away without facing any criminal proceedings .
it was largely the then state prosecutor of baden-wuerttemberg , erwin schuele , who personally fought for the trial to take place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nuremberg war crimes trials in 1945 are well known but at the same time , germany 's judicial system in the 1950s was n't particularly interested in pursuing nazi crimes .
that had partly to do with the nazi-weary mentality of the time .
another major reason for the reluctance to crack down on nazi abuses was that there were quite a few lawyers and state prosecutors who had previously been members of the nazi party .
the presence of so many former nazis in the german judicial system gathered force in the 1950s , because many who underwent denazification and were dismissed from public service earlier reentered the system in the early 1950s .
yet ulm did command immense media attention in the federal republic of germany .
it was n't the first trial of its kind but it was certainly the most elaborate and most publicized of the time .
usually , with the exception of the big nazi war crime trials in allied tribunals , only a few regional and local papers reported about such cases .
in the 1950s especially , such trials hardly sparked any nationwide attention .
the defendants in the ulm trial were given relatively light prison sentences of between three and 15 years . why was that ?
the main problem that plagued all nazi war crime trials right up to the 1980s was the development of the so-called " accessory to murder " construct .
normally , a murderer is punished with a life sentence .
but most of the courts accepted that the main perpetrators of the mass murder of jews were the nazi leadership - hitler , himmler and others .
all the others were thus not considered murderers who killed jews out of a deep sense of personal motivation but rather simply helpers who aided in the crime .
that 's why the majority of nazi criminals were sentenced for being an accessory to murder .
it was only in cases where it could be proven that someone had committed crimes out of a sense of personal conviction that a life sentence was issued .
this strategy was strongly criticized in the 1960s and also proved to be wrong , because the courts were largely dealing with committed nazis and anti-semites .
another reason was that it was difficult to reconstruct crimes committed 10 or 12 years previously and build up cases with the help of eye witnesses that would eventually lead to court proceedings .
but the biggest problem was that the majority of the german population was simply not interested in tackling the past , and the authorities lacked the will to pursue people who committed atrocities under the nazis .
how were the sentences received in germany and abroad ?
there was certainly a resonance in the us and in israel , and i imagine there may have been some disappointments , particularly among jews .
in germany , reaction was divided because a liberal segment in society was deeply interested in the trial in the late 1950s and followed it critically .
but the majority of the german population at the time simply did n't want anything to do with it .
it 's true , the sentences in the ulm trial were very light .
there is hardly any person accused of crimes under the nazis who served out the entirety of the sentence issued in the federal republic of germany .
what effect did the ulm einsatzgruppen trial have on west germany 's efforts to bring nazi war criminals to justice ?
one of the most important and immediate political fall-outs of the ulm trial was that justice ministers in west germany , spurred on by the realization that many grave nazi crimes in eastern europe were left uninvestigated , completely reversed the existing investigation procedure .
they no longer relied on coincidences to bring nazi crimes to light but rather on systematically investigating them .
that was the immediate trigger for the establishment of a unique central authority in ludwigsburg to compile , coordinate and investigate all types of crimes committed under the nazis .
beyond that , the ulm trial was only a brief shock for the german population .
the real jolt came with the adolf eichmann arrest and trial and the auschwitz trial in frankfurt in 1963 .
the general awareness in the german population that most nazi crimes were committed in eastern europe and that the murderers live among us in society only sank in later . interview : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 20.05.2008 landmark trial pushed germany to tackle nazi past großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defendants lived normal lives in the midst of german society for years fifty years ago , a trial against 10 members of a nazi commando in the city of ulm , changed the way west germany dealt with its fascist past and crack down on crimes committed by the nazis . from july 28 to august 29 , 1958 , 10 men from a special nazi commando , " tilsit , " went on trial in the west german city of ulm in the state of baden-wuerttemberg .
the so-called ulm einsatzgruppen trial , one of the largest in a west german court that centered on the mass murder of jews , accused the men , gestapo and ss members , of killing more than 5,000 jewish men , women and children in lithuania .
the proceedings revealed gruesome crimes and showed that many of the perpetrators continued to live normal lives in west germany for years after the war , their murderous campaign largely undetected .
the trial is considered a major break with how germany dealt with its nazi past until then .
dw-world.de spoke to dieter pohl , a historian and lecturer at the institute for contemporary history in munich , about the historic trial 50 years ago .
dw-world.de : the ulm einsatzgruppen trial is considered a turning point in how germany dealt with its nazi past .
why is that ?
dieter pohl : the bulk of the nazi war crime trials took place right after 1945 .
basically , from 1945 to 1949 , there were parallel allied tribunals and german courts .
the german courts largely dealt with crimes committed against german citizens ; the allied courts dealt with all others , which meant the majority of nazi crimes .
these proceedings petered out by the end of the 1940s and early 1950s largely because west german society suppressed the past and preferred not to talk about it .
nazi crimes hardly found mention in public discourse in the early 1950s . thus the ulm trial in 1958 marked the reopening of criminal proceedings against nazi criminals .
it was seen as a sign that the west german judicial system was taking the nazi past more seriously . but the most striking thing about the ulm trial was that it made clear that nazi atrocities were not just committed within the third reich but largely in eastern europe .
the 10 defendants in the ulm trial stood accused of murdering more than 5,000 jewish men , women and children .
who were these men ?
were they cold-blooded killers or just " ordinary men " ?
no , they certainly were n't average germans .
they were members of the gestapo in tilsit -lsb- editor 's note : the now russian town of sovetsk -rsb- on the northeastern tip of the third reich , some were even long-time ss members .
they were largely career policemen , people who usually joined the crime force and then went on to join the gestapo during the 1930s .
usually the leading personnel involved die-hard nazis - people who joined the nsdap relatively early , actively supported the nazi ideology and cracked down on the opponents of the ideology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the dock - some of the defendants in the ulm trial right after the wehrmacht 's invasion of the soviet union on june 22 , 1941 , the gestapo tilsit followed with small commandos , entered western lithuanian territory and began shooting jews .
this was where the first mass murder of jews in the so-called " final solution " took place on june 24 , 1941 , just two days after the beginning of the german campaign in the town of garsden .
the commandos largely targeted young jewish men old enough to join the army ; women and children were only killed in exceptions .
the crimes set the stage for what followed in the entire occupied soviet union over the next two years - large massacres of jewish communities with all the brutalities that went with it .
how did the ulm trial come about ? actually due to sheer coincidence .
one of the main defendants , bernhard fischer-schweder , the police chief in memel , lithuania , in 1941 and involved in the murder of thousands of jews , assumed a false name after 1945 and was appointed director of a refugee shelter near ulm in 1955 .
he was fired when his past came to light .
when he was refused another public sector job , fischer-schweder filed a lawsuit in a labor court .
a survivor of fischer-schweder 's murderous campaign in lithuania came across a newspaper article about the court case and identified him , revealing details about his past .
that provided the trigger for the trial .
unfortunately , most cases against nazi criminals at the time came into being this way .
a surviving victim usually happened to discover a perpetrator and then filed a lawsuit against him .
what kind of an atmosphere did the trial take place in ?
how was it viewed by the west germans and the justice system ?
the trial came at a time when much of the german population simply wanted to draw a line under the past .
after several years of allied rule and a constant focus on the nazi past , most people simply did n't want to hear about it anymore .
the judicial system in germany was partly shocked to see that severely incriminated perpetrators of nazi crimes had managed to get away without facing any criminal proceedings .
it was largely the then state prosecutor of baden-wuerttemberg , erwin schuele , who personally fought for the trial to take place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nuremberg war crimes trials in 1945 are well known but at the same time , germany 's judicial system in the 1950s was n't particularly interested in pursuing nazi crimes .
that had partly to do with the nazi-weary mentality of the time .
another major reason for the reluctance to crack down on nazi abuses was that there were quite a few lawyers and state prosecutors who had previously been members of the nazi party .
the presence of so many former nazis in the german judicial system gathered force in the 1950s , because many who underwent denazification and were dismissed from public service earlier reentered the system in the early 1950s .
yet ulm did command immense media attention in the federal republic of germany .
it was n't the first trial of its kind but it was certainly the most elaborate and most publicized of the time .
usually , with the exception of the big nazi war crime trials in allied tribunals , only a few regional and local papers reported about such cases .
in the 1950s especially , such trials hardly sparked any nationwide attention .
the defendants in the ulm trial were given relatively light prison sentences of between three and 15 years . why was that ?
the main problem that plagued all nazi war crime trials right up to the 1980s was the development of the so-called " accessory to murder " construct .
normally , a murderer is punished with a life sentence .
but most of the courts accepted that the main perpetrators of the mass murder of jews were the nazi leadership - hitler , himmler and others .
all the others were thus not considered murderers who killed jews out of a deep sense of personal motivation but rather simply helpers who aided in the crime .
that 's why the majority of nazi criminals were sentenced for being an accessory to murder .
it was only in cases where it could be proven that someone had committed crimes out of a sense of personal conviction that a life sentence was issued .
this strategy was strongly criticized in the 1960s and also proved to be wrong , because the courts were largely dealing with committed nazis and anti-semites .
another reason was that it was difficult to reconstruct crimes committed 10 or 12 years previously and build up cases with the help of eye witnesses that would eventually lead to court proceedings .
but the biggest problem was that the majority of the german population was simply not interested in tackling the past , and the authorities lacked the will to pursue people who committed atrocities under the nazis .
how were the sentences received in germany and abroad ?
there was certainly a resonance in the us and in israel , and i imagine there may have been some disappointments , particularly among jews .
in germany , reaction was divided because a liberal segment in society was deeply interested in the trial in the late 1950s and followed it critically .
but the majority of the german population at the time simply did n't want anything to do with it .
it 's true , the sentences in the ulm trial were very light .
there is hardly any person accused of crimes under the nazis who served out the entirety of the sentence issued in the federal republic of germany .
what effect did the ulm einsatzgruppen trial have on west germany 's efforts to bring nazi war criminals to justice ?
one of the most important and immediate political fall-outs of the ulm trial was that justice ministers in west germany , spurred on by the realization that many grave nazi crimes in eastern europe were left uninvestigated , completely reversed the existing investigation procedure .
they no longer relied on coincidences to bring nazi crimes to light but rather on systematically investigating them .
that was the immediate trigger for the establishment of a unique central authority in ludwigsburg to compile , coordinate and investigate all types of crimes committed under the nazis .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 20.05.2008 landmark trial pushed germany to tackle nazi past großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defendants lived normal lives in the midst of german society for years fifty years ago , a trial against 10 members of a nazi commando in the city of ulm , changed the way west germany dealt with its fascist past and crack down on crimes committed by the nazis . from july 28 to august 29 , 1958 , 10 men from a special nazi commando , " tilsit , " went on trial in the west german city of ulm in the state of baden-wuerttemberg .
the so-called ulm einsatzgruppen trial , one of the largest in a west german court that centered on the mass murder of jews , accused the men , gestapo and ss members , of killing more than 5,000 jewish men , women and children in lithuania .
the proceedings revealed gruesome crimes and showed that many of the perpetrators continued to live normal lives in west germany for years after the war , their murderous campaign largely undetected .
the trial is considered a major break with how germany dealt with its nazi past until then .
dw-world.de spoke to dieter pohl , a historian and lecturer at the institute for contemporary history in munich , about the historic trial 50 years ago .
dw-world.de : the ulm einsatzgruppen trial is considered a turning point in how germany dealt with its nazi past .
why is that ?
dieter pohl : the bulk of the nazi war crime trials took place right after 1945 .
basically , from 1945 to 1949 , there were parallel allied tribunals and german courts .
the german courts largely dealt with crimes committed against german citizens ; the allied courts dealt with all others , which meant the majority of nazi crimes .
these proceedings petered out by the end of the 1940s and early 1950s largely because west german society suppressed the past and preferred not to talk about it .
nazi crimes hardly found mention in public discourse in the early 1950s . thus the ulm trial in 1958 marked the reopening of criminal proceedings against nazi criminals .
it was seen as a sign that the west german judicial system was taking the nazi past more seriously . but the most striking thing about the ulm trial was that it made clear that nazi atrocities were not just committed within the third reich but largely in eastern europe .
the 10 defendants in the ulm trial stood accused of murdering more than 5,000 jewish men , women and children .
who were these men ?
were they cold-blooded killers or just " ordinary men " ?
no , they certainly were n't average germans .
they were members of the gestapo in tilsit -lsb- editor 's note : the now russian town of sovetsk -rsb- on the northeastern tip of the third reich , some were even long-time ss members .
they were largely career policemen , people who usually joined the crime force and then went on to join the gestapo during the 1930s .
usually the leading personnel involved die-hard nazis - people who joined the nsdap relatively early , actively supported the nazi ideology and cracked down on the opponents of the ideology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the dock - some of the defendants in the ulm trial right after the wehrmacht 's invasion of the soviet union on june 22 , 1941 , the gestapo tilsit followed with small commandos , entered western lithuanian territory and began shooting jews .
this was where the first mass murder of jews in the so-called " final solution " took place on june 24 , 1941 , just two days after the beginning of the german campaign in the town of garsden .
the commandos largely targeted young jewish men old enough to join the army ; women and children were only killed in exceptions .
the crimes set the stage for what followed in the entire occupied soviet union over the next two years - large massacres of jewish communities with all the brutalities that went with it .
how did the ulm trial come about ? actually due to sheer coincidence .
one of the main defendants , bernhard fischer-schweder , the police chief in memel , lithuania , in 1941 and involved in the murder of thousands of jews , assumed a false name after 1945 and was appointed director of a refugee shelter near ulm in 1955 .
he was fired when his past came to light .
when he was refused another public sector job , fischer-schweder filed a lawsuit in a labor court .
a survivor of fischer-schweder 's murderous campaign in lithuania came across a newspaper article about the court case and identified him , revealing details about his past .
that provided the trigger for the trial .
unfortunately , most cases against nazi criminals at the time came into being this way .
a surviving victim usually happened to discover a perpetrator and then filed a lawsuit against him .
what kind of an atmosphere did the trial take place in ?
how was it viewed by the west germans and the justice system ?
the trial came at a time when much of the german population simply wanted to draw a line under the past .
after several years of allied rule and a constant focus on the nazi past , most people simply did n't want to hear about it anymore .
the judicial system in germany was partly shocked to see that severely incriminated perpetrators of nazi crimes had managed to get away without facing any criminal proceedings .
it was largely the then state prosecutor of baden-wuerttemberg , erwin schuele , who personally fought for the trial to take place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nuremberg war crimes trials in 1945 are well known but at the same time , germany 's judicial system in the 1950s was n't particularly interested in pursuing nazi crimes .
that had partly to do with the nazi-weary mentality of the time .
another major reason for the reluctance to crack down on nazi abuses was that there were quite a few lawyers and state prosecutors who had previously been members of the nazi party .
the presence of so many former nazis in the german judicial system gathered force in the 1950s , because many who underwent denazification and were dismissed from public service earlier reentered the system in the early 1950s .
yet ulm did command immense media attention in the federal republic of germany .
it was n't the first trial of its kind but it was certainly the most elaborate and most publicized of the time .
usually , with the exception of the big nazi war crime trials in allied tribunals , only a few regional and local papers reported about such cases .
in the 1950s especially , such trials hardly sparked any nationwide attention .
the defendants in the ulm trial were given relatively light prison sentences of between three and 15 years . why was that ?
the main problem that plagued all nazi war crime trials right up to the 1980s was the development of the so-called " accessory to murder " construct .
normally , a murderer is punished with a life sentence .
but most of the courts accepted that the main perpetrators of the mass murder of jews were the nazi leadership - hitler , himmler and others .
all the others were thus not considered murderers who killed jews out of a deep sense of personal motivation but rather simply helpers who aided in the crime .
that 's why the majority of nazi criminals were sentenced for being an accessory to murder .
it was only in cases where it could be proven that someone had committed crimes out of a sense of personal conviction that a life sentence was issued .
this strategy was strongly criticized in the 1960s and also proved to be wrong , because the courts were largely dealing with committed nazis and anti-semites .
another reason was that it was difficult to reconstruct crimes committed 10 or 12 years previously and build up cases with the help of eye witnesses that would eventually lead to court proceedings .
but the biggest problem was that the majority of the german population was simply not interested in tackling the past , and the authorities lacked the will to pursue people who committed atrocities under the nazis .
how were the sentences received in germany and abroad ?
there was certainly a resonance in the us and in israel , and i imagine there may have been some disappointments , particularly among jews .
in germany , reaction was divided because a liberal segment in society was deeply interested in the trial in the late 1950s and followed it critically .
but the majority of the german population at the time simply did n't want anything to do with it .
it 's true , the sentences in the ulm trial were very light .
there is hardly any person accused of crimes under the nazis who served out the entirety of the sentence issued in the federal republic of germany .
what effect did the ulm einsatzgruppen trial have on west germany 's efforts to bring nazi war criminals to justice ?
one of the most important and immediate political fall-outs of the ulm trial was that justice ministers in west germany , spurred on by the realization that many grave nazi crimes in eastern europe were left uninvestigated , completely reversed the existing investigation procedure .
they no longer relied on coincidences to bring nazi crimes to light but rather on systematically investigating them .
that was the immediate trigger for the establishment of a unique central authority in ludwigsburg to compile , coordinate and investigate all types of crimes committed under the nazis .
beyond that , the ulm trial was only a brief shock for the german population .
the real jolt came with the adolf eichmann arrest and trial and the auschwitz trial in frankfurt in 1963 .
the general awareness in the german population that most nazi crimes were committed in eastern europe and that the murderers live among us in society only sank in later . interview : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 20.05.2008 europe readies for nasty food fight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the farm lobby is strong in germany stabilizing food prices across europe needs to be a top priority , europe 's agriculture ministers agree .
the hard part will be deciding how to best reform the system . current european union agricultural policy encourages farmers to keep land fallow , a practice that seems to contradict the rising global demand for food .
the eu seems likely to acknowledge it needs to put more land into production when it announces agricultural reforms on tuesday , may 20 .
one solution would be for the eu to phase out its program of paying farmers to keep farmland out of production , hoping that it will help stabilize food prices .
" i think it 's important that we continue to increase production in europe as much as we can within the natural limits , also taking into account environmental care , " agriculture and rural development commissioner mariann fischer boel told the dpa news agency .
fischer boel spent monday with eu agriculture ministers in brussels outlining her proposals to reform the bloc 's common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- .
yet the road to reforming the cap is likely to be long and riddled with obstacles .
even the relatively modest changes boel has proposed to direct farm subsidies are likely to be met with fierce resistance , particularly from france , which is the biggest recipient of agricultural aid .
britain calls for liberalization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer boel wants to increase production of some crops britain and some other member states would like to see the eu go even further in reforming its subsidies .
britain 's finance minister , alistair darling , called for europe to fundamentally reform its agricultural policy .
britain has argued that the current food crisis shows the need to liberalize laws .
all elements that keep prices above world market levels should be phased out , darling said last week .
those measures cost eu consumers 43 billion euros -lrb- $ 67 billion -rrb- in 2006 , he said .
darling also said he wants the eu to stop direct payments to farmers , which he said cost taxpayers an additional 34 billion euros in 2006 .
" barriers and distortions in the global food market increase volatility and stifle the incentives to increase supply to match demand , " he argued .
germany wants farmers protected slovenian agriculture minister iztok jarc , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , refused to comment on britain 's position , saying only that " there are many reasons for high food prices , so i would n't make a direct connection to the cap . "
" we do n't only have a problem with food prices , we also have the problem of climate change and high energy prices .
it 's a combination of all factors , " he said .
germany and france are against liberalization .
they say the current upswing in food prices show the importance of not liberalizing too much .
germany 's agriculture minister , horst seehofer , argues that " we have to make sure that we can provide this continent with food sustainability .
this can not be done by taking away subsidies from european farmers . "
long road ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposed changes could bring protests from farmers besides no longer paying farmers to leave land fallow , the eu proposals also call for phasing out quotas on milk production .
some observers have also guessed the eu will propose ending the extra bonuses given to farmers who grow crops which can be converted into fuel .
while fischer boel said she wants to see more money go towards environmental projects and less towards direct subsidy payments , she backed away from an earlier suggestion that subsidies to larger farms be capped .
that caused an outcry from germany and britain .
global food prices have nearly doubled in three years , according to the world bank .
the situation in developing countries has been of particular concern since higher costs have sparked riots and restrictions on food exports .
the cap proposals will go to eu member states and the european parliament for consideration in the second half of 2008 , during france 's eu presidency .
massive subsidies remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france is the biggest recipient of agricultural subsidies although food prices have eased somewhat in recent weeks , they remain at near record levels , with wheat up 84 percent over one year ago , corn up 21 percent , butter up 21 percent and eggs up 17 percent .
cost increases have a variety of causes including biofuel , trade constraints , increased demand from asia to serve changing diets , poor harvests and increasing transport costs .
if the cap reforms succeed in putting more land into production , it would be a reversal of past reform efforts , which have tried to reign in production .
in 2003 , the eu tried to discourage overproduction by " decoupling " subsidies from production .
despite reforms , farm hand-outs still make up 40 percent of the eu budget , by far the bloc 's biggest spending item . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

iceland is number one for peace the second annual global peace index , a survey on the harmoniousness of the world 's nations , has been released .
iceland has been named the world 's most peaceful country - and iraq its least . if you do n't like conflict , than maybe you should consider moving to reykjavik - that 's the message from the global peace index .
iceland headed the rankings of the survey , which is drawn up by a non-governmental initiative called vision of humanity .
it evaluates 140 nations with respect to 24 criteria , including numbers of deaths from organized conflict , levels of violent crime and proportions of gdp used for military expenditures .
denmark was deemed the world 's second most peaceful country , followed by norway , new zealand and japan .
" the world appears to be a marginally more peaceful place this year , " index founder and australian philanthropist steve killelea said in a statement .
" this is encouraging , but it takes small steps by individual countries for the world to make greater strides on the road to peace . "
confirming the obvious bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : five years of war have made iraq the world 's most dangerous place at the other end of the index , war-torn iraq was adjudged to be the most violent country on the globe .
it was followed by other perennial hotspots of conflict - sudan , afghanistan , israel and chad .
somewhat more surprisingly , russia ranks very low on the list in 131rd spot .
the united states is also in the bottom half of the table in position 97 .
meanwhile , china ranks 67 , and germany a respectable 14 .
the nations that made the biggest jumps in the table were angola , indonesia , india and uzbekistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kenya dropped dramatically on the global peace index meanwhile , owing to violence following last december 's presidential election , kenya suffered the steepest decline .
the index is pitched at governments as a means of self-evaluation and at commerce .
" you ultimately ca n't have business where you have conflict , " said nobel peace laureate archbishop desmond tutu of south africa , a major supporter of the survey .
" so it is in the nature of self-interest to promote the kind of circumstances and the kind of environment where you can carry out your business . " dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

denmark was deemed the world 's second most peaceful country , followed by norway , new zealand and japan .

the hard part will be deciding how to best reform the system . current european union agricultural policy encourages farmers to keep land fallow , a practice that seems to contradict the rising global demand for food .
the eu seems likely to acknowledge it needs to put more land into production when it announces agricultural reforms on tuesday , may 20 .
one solution would be for the eu to phase out its program of paying farmers to keep farmland out of production , hoping that it will help stabilize food prices .
" i think it 's important that we continue to increase production in europe as much as we can within the natural limits , also taking into account environmental care , " agriculture and rural development commissioner mariann fischer boel told the dpa news agency .
fischer boel spent monday with eu agriculture ministers in brussels outlining her proposals to reform the bloc 's common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- .
yet the road to reforming the cap is likely to be long and riddled with obstacles .
even the relatively modest changes boel has proposed to direct farm subsidies are likely to be met with fierce resistance , particularly from france , which is the biggest recipient of agricultural aid .
britain calls for liberalization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer boel wants to increase production of some crops britain and some other member states would like to see the eu go even further in reforming its subsidies .
britain 's finance minister , alistair darling , called for europe to fundamentally reform its agricultural policy .
britain has argued that the current food crisis shows the need to liberalize laws .
all elements that keep prices above world market levels should be phased out , darling said last week .
those measures cost eu consumers 43 billion euros -lrb- $ 67 billion -rrb- in 2006 , he said .
darling also said he wants the eu to stop direct payments to farmers , which he said cost taxpayers an additional 34 billion euros in 2006 .
" barriers and distortions in the global food market increase volatility and stifle the incentives to increase supply to match demand , " he argued .
germany wants farmers protected slovenian agriculture minister iztok jarc , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , refused to comment on britain 's position , saying only that " there are many reasons for high food prices , so i would n't make a direct connection to the cap . "
" we do n't only have a problem with food prices , we also have the problem of climate change and high energy prices .
it 's a combination of all factors , " he said .
germany and france are against liberalization .
they say the current upswing in food prices show the importance of not liberalizing too much .
germany 's agriculture minister , horst seehofer , argues that " we have to make sure that we can provide this continent with food sustainability .
this can not be done by taking away subsidies from european farmers . "
long road ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposed changes could bring protests from farmers besides no longer paying farmers to leave land fallow , the eu proposals also call for phasing out quotas on milk production .
some observers have also guessed the eu will propose ending the extra bonuses given to farmers who grow crops which can be converted into fuel .
while fischer boel said she wants to see more money go towards environmental projects and less towards direct subsidy payments , she backed away from an earlier suggestion that subsidies to larger farms be capped .
that caused an outcry from germany and britain .
global food prices have nearly doubled in three years , according to the world bank .
the situation in developing countries has been of particular concern since higher costs have sparked riots and restrictions on food exports .
the cap proposals will go to eu member states and the european parliament for consideration in the second half of 2008 , during france 's eu presidency .
massive subsidies remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france is the biggest recipient of agricultural subsidies although food prices have eased somewhat in recent weeks , they remain at near record levels , with wheat up 84 percent over one year ago , corn up 21 percent , butter up 21 percent and eggs up 17 percent .
cost increases have a variety of causes including biofuel , trade constraints , increased demand from asia to serve changing diets , poor harvests and increasing transport costs .
if the cap reforms succeed in putting more land into production , it would be a reversal of past reform efforts , which have tried to reign in production .
in 2003 , the eu tried to discourage overproduction by " decoupling " subsidies from production .
despite reforms , farm hand-outs still make up 40 percent of the eu budget , by far the bloc 's biggest spending item . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

britain calls for liberalization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer boel wants to increase production of some crops britain and some other member states would like to see the eu go even further in reforming its subsidies .
britain 's finance minister , alistair darling , called for europe to fundamentally reform its agricultural policy .
britain has argued that the current food crisis shows the need to liberalize laws .
all elements that keep prices above world market levels should be phased out , darling said last week .
those measures cost eu consumers 43 billion euros -lrb- $ 67 billion -rrb- in 2006 , he said .
darling also said he wants the eu to stop direct payments to farmers , which he said cost taxpayers an additional 34 billion euros in 2006 .
" barriers and distortions in the global food market increase volatility and stifle the incentives to increase supply to match demand , " he argued .
germany wants farmers protected slovenian agriculture minister iztok jarc , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , refused to comment on britain 's position , saying only that " there are many reasons for high food prices , so i would n't make a direct connection to the cap . "
" we do n't only have a problem with food prices , we also have the problem of climate change and high energy prices .
it 's a combination of all factors , " he said .
germany and france are against liberalization .
they say the current upswing in food prices show the importance of not liberalizing too much .
germany 's agriculture minister , horst seehofer , argues that " we have to make sure that we can provide this continent with food sustainability .
this can not be done by taking away subsidies from european farmers . "

while fischer boel said she wants to see more money go towards environmental projects and less towards direct subsidy payments , she backed away from an earlier suggestion that subsidies to larger farms be capped .
that caused an outcry from germany and britain .
global food prices have nearly doubled in three years , according to the world bank .
the situation in developing countries has been of particular concern since higher costs have sparked riots and restrictions on food exports .

iceland is number one for peace the second annual global peace index , a survey on the harmoniousness of the world 's nations , has been released .
iceland has been named the world 's most peaceful country - and iraq its least . if you do n't like conflict , than maybe you should consider moving to reykjavik - that 's the message from the global peace index .
iceland headed the rankings of the survey , which is drawn up by a non-governmental initiative called vision of humanity .
it evaluates 140 nations with respect to 24 criteria , including numbers of deaths from organized conflict , levels of violent crime and proportions of gdp used for military expenditures .
denmark was deemed the world 's second most peaceful country , followed by norway , new zealand and japan .
" the world appears to be a marginally more peaceful place this year , " index founder and australian philanthropist steve killelea said in a statement .
" this is encouraging , but it takes small steps by individual countries for the world to make greater strides on the road to peace . "
confirming the obvious bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : five years of war have made iraq the world 's most dangerous place at the other end of the index , war-torn iraq was adjudged to be the most violent country on the globe .
it was followed by other perennial hotspots of conflict - sudan , afghanistan , israel and chad .
somewhat more surprisingly , russia ranks very low on the list in 131rd spot .
the united states is also in the bottom half of the table in position 97 .
meanwhile , china ranks 67 , and germany a respectable 14 .
the nations that made the biggest jumps in the table were angola , indonesia , india and uzbekistan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kenya dropped dramatically on the global peace index meanwhile , owing to violence following last december 's presidential election , kenya suffered the steepest decline .
the index is pitched at governments as a means of self-evaluation and at commerce .
" you ultimately ca n't have business where you have conflict , " said nobel peace laureate archbishop desmond tutu of south africa , a major supporter of the survey .
" so it is in the nature of self-interest to promote the kind of circumstances and the kind of environment where you can carry out your business . " dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 20.05.2008 europe readies for nasty food fight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the farm lobby is strong in germany stabilizing food prices across europe needs to be a top priority , europe 's agriculture ministers agree .
the hard part will be deciding how to best reform the system . current european union agricultural policy encourages farmers to keep land fallow , a practice that seems to contradict the rising global demand for food .
the eu seems likely to acknowledge it needs to put more land into production when it announces agricultural reforms on tuesday , may 20 .
one solution would be for the eu to phase out its program of paying farmers to keep farmland out of production , hoping that it will help stabilize food prices .
" i think it 's important that we continue to increase production in europe as much as we can within the natural limits , also taking into account environmental care , " agriculture and rural development commissioner mariann fischer boel told the dpa news agency .
fischer boel spent monday with eu agriculture ministers in brussels outlining her proposals to reform the bloc 's common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- .
yet the road to reforming the cap is likely to be long and riddled with obstacles .
even the relatively modest changes boel has proposed to direct farm subsidies are likely to be met with fierce resistance , particularly from france , which is the biggest recipient of agricultural aid .
britain calls for liberalization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer boel wants to increase production of some crops britain and some other member states would like to see the eu go even further in reforming its subsidies .
britain 's finance minister , alistair darling , called for europe to fundamentally reform its agricultural policy .
britain has argued that the current food crisis shows the need to liberalize laws .
all elements that keep prices above world market levels should be phased out , darling said last week .
those measures cost eu consumers 43 billion euros -lrb- $ 67 billion -rrb- in 2006 , he said .
darling also said he wants the eu to stop direct payments to farmers , which he said cost taxpayers an additional 34 billion euros in 2006 .
" barriers and distortions in the global food market increase volatility and stifle the incentives to increase supply to match demand , " he argued .
germany wants farmers protected slovenian agriculture minister iztok jarc , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , refused to comment on britain 's position , saying only that " there are many reasons for high food prices , so i would n't make a direct connection to the cap . "
" we do n't only have a problem with food prices , we also have the problem of climate change and high energy prices .
it 's a combination of all factors , " he said .
germany and france are against liberalization .
they say the current upswing in food prices show the importance of not liberalizing too much .
germany 's agriculture minister , horst seehofer , argues that " we have to make sure that we can provide this continent with food sustainability .
this can not be done by taking away subsidies from european farmers . "
long road ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposed changes could bring protests from farmers besides no longer paying farmers to leave land fallow , the eu proposals also call for phasing out quotas on milk production .
some observers have also guessed the eu will propose ending the extra bonuses given to farmers who grow crops which can be converted into fuel .
while fischer boel said she wants to see more money go towards environmental projects and less towards direct subsidy payments , she backed away from an earlier suggestion that subsidies to larger farms be capped .
that caused an outcry from germany and britain .
global food prices have nearly doubled in three years , according to the world bank .
the situation in developing countries has been of particular concern since higher costs have sparked riots and restrictions on food exports .
the cap proposals will go to eu member states and the european parliament for consideration in the second half of 2008 , during france 's eu presidency .
massive subsidies remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france is the biggest recipient of agricultural subsidies although food prices have eased somewhat in recent weeks , they remain at near record levels , with wheat up 84 percent over one year ago , corn up 21 percent , butter up 21 percent and eggs up 17 percent .
cost increases have a variety of causes including biofuel , trade constraints , increased demand from asia to serve changing diets , poor harvests and increasing transport costs .
if the cap reforms succeed in putting more land into production , it would be a reversal of past reform efforts , which have tried to reign in production .
in 2003 , the eu tried to discourage overproduction by " decoupling " subsidies from production .
despite reforms , farm hand-outs still make up 40 percent of the eu budget , by far the bloc 's biggest spending item . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 20.05.2008 landmark trial pushed germany to tackle nazi past großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defendants lived normal lives in the midst of german society for years fifty years ago , a trial against 10 members of a nazi commando in the city of ulm , changed the way west germany dealt with its fascist past and crack down on crimes committed by the nazis . from july 28 to august 29 , 1958 , 10 men from a special nazi commando , " tilsit , " went on trial in the west german city of ulm in the state of baden-wuerttemberg .
the so-called ulm einsatzgruppen trial , one of the largest in a west german court that centered on the mass murder of jews , accused the men , gestapo and ss members , of killing more than 5,000 jewish men , women and children in lithuania .
the proceedings revealed gruesome crimes and showed that many of the perpetrators continued to live normal lives in west germany for years after the war , their murderous campaign largely undetected .
the trial is considered a major break with how germany dealt with its nazi past until then .
dw-world.de spoke to dieter pohl , a historian and lecturer at the institute for contemporary history in munich , about the historic trial 50 years ago .
dw-world.de : the ulm einsatzgruppen trial is considered a turning point in how germany dealt with its nazi past .
why is that ?
dieter pohl : the bulk of the nazi war crime trials took place right after 1945 .
basically , from 1945 to 1949 , there were parallel allied tribunals and german courts .
the german courts largely dealt with crimes committed against german citizens ; the allied courts dealt with all others , which meant the majority of nazi crimes .
these proceedings petered out by the end of the 1940s and early 1950s largely because west german society suppressed the past and preferred not to talk about it .
nazi crimes hardly found mention in public discourse in the early 1950s . thus the ulm trial in 1958 marked the reopening of criminal proceedings against nazi criminals .
it was seen as a sign that the west german judicial system was taking the nazi past more seriously . but the most striking thing about the ulm trial was that it made clear that nazi atrocities were not just committed within the third reich but largely in eastern europe .
the 10 defendants in the ulm trial stood accused of murdering more than 5,000 jewish men , women and children .
who were these men ?
were they cold-blooded killers or just " ordinary men " ?
no , they certainly were n't average germans .
they were members of the gestapo in tilsit -lsb- editor 's note : the now russian town of sovetsk -rsb- on the northeastern tip of the third reich , some were even long-time ss members .
they were largely career policemen , people who usually joined the crime force and then went on to join the gestapo during the 1930s .
usually the leading personnel involved die-hard nazis - people who joined the nsdap relatively early , actively supported the nazi ideology and cracked down on the opponents of the ideology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the dock - some of the defendants in the ulm trial right after the wehrmacht 's invasion of the soviet union on june 22 , 1941 , the gestapo tilsit followed with small commandos , entered western lithuanian territory and began shooting jews .
this was where the first mass murder of jews in the so-called " final solution " took place on june 24 , 1941 , just two days after the beginning of the german campaign in the town of garsden .
the commandos largely targeted young jewish men old enough to join the army ; women and children were only killed in exceptions .
the crimes set the stage for what followed in the entire occupied soviet union over the next two years - large massacres of jewish communities with all the brutalities that went with it .
how did the ulm trial come about ? actually due to sheer coincidence .
one of the main defendants , bernhard fischer-schweder , the police chief in memel , lithuania , in 1941 and involved in the murder of thousands of jews , assumed a false name after 1945 and was appointed director of a refugee shelter near ulm in 1955 .
he was fired when his past came to light .
when he was refused another public sector job , fischer-schweder filed a lawsuit in a labor court .
a survivor of fischer-schweder 's murderous campaign in lithuania came across a newspaper article about the court case and identified him , revealing details about his past .
that provided the trigger for the trial .
unfortunately , most cases against nazi criminals at the time came into being this way .
a surviving victim usually happened to discover a perpetrator and then filed a lawsuit against him .
what kind of an atmosphere did the trial take place in ?
how was it viewed by the west germans and the justice system ?
the trial came at a time when much of the german population simply wanted to draw a line under the past .
after several years of allied rule and a constant focus on the nazi past , most people simply did n't want to hear about it anymore .
the judicial system in germany was partly shocked to see that severely incriminated perpetrators of nazi crimes had managed to get away without facing any criminal proceedings .
it was largely the then state prosecutor of baden-wuerttemberg , erwin schuele , who personally fought for the trial to take place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nuremberg war crimes trials in 1945 are well known but at the same time , germany 's judicial system in the 1950s was n't particularly interested in pursuing nazi crimes .
that had partly to do with the nazi-weary mentality of the time .
another major reason for the reluctance to crack down on nazi abuses was that there were quite a few lawyers and state prosecutors who had previously been members of the nazi party .
the presence of so many former nazis in the german judicial system gathered force in the 1950s , because many who underwent denazification and were dismissed from public service earlier reentered the system in the early 1950s .
yet ulm did command immense media attention in the federal republic of germany .
it was n't the first trial of its kind but it was certainly the most elaborate and most publicized of the time .
usually , with the exception of the big nazi war crime trials in allied tribunals , only a few regional and local papers reported about such cases .
in the 1950s especially , such trials hardly sparked any nationwide attention .
the defendants in the ulm trial were given relatively light prison sentences of between three and 15 years . why was that ?
the main problem that plagued all nazi war crime trials right up to the 1980s was the development of the so-called " accessory to murder " construct .
normally , a murderer is punished with a life sentence .
but most of the courts accepted that the main perpetrators of the mass murder of jews were the nazi leadership - hitler , himmler and others .
all the others were thus not considered murderers who killed jews out of a deep sense of personal motivation but rather simply helpers who aided in the crime .
that 's why the majority of nazi criminals were sentenced for being an accessory to murder .
it was only in cases where it could be proven that someone had committed crimes out of a sense of personal conviction that a life sentence was issued .
this strategy was strongly criticized in the 1960s and also proved to be wrong , because the courts were largely dealing with committed nazis and anti-semites .
another reason was that it was difficult to reconstruct crimes committed 10 or 12 years previously and build up cases with the help of eye witnesses that would eventually lead to court proceedings .
but the biggest problem was that the majority of the german population was simply not interested in tackling the past , and the authorities lacked the will to pursue people who committed atrocities under the nazis .
how were the sentences received in germany and abroad ?
there was certainly a resonance in the us and in israel , and i imagine there may have been some disappointments , particularly among jews .
in germany , reaction was divided because a liberal segment in society was deeply interested in the trial in the late 1950s and followed it critically .
but the majority of the german population at the time simply did n't want anything to do with it .
it 's true , the sentences in the ulm trial were very light .
there is hardly any person accused of crimes under the nazis who served out the entirety of the sentence issued in the federal republic of germany .
what effect did the ulm einsatzgruppen trial have on west germany 's efforts to bring nazi war criminals to justice ?
one of the most important and immediate political fall-outs of the ulm trial was that justice ministers in west germany , spurred on by the realization that many grave nazi crimes in eastern europe were left uninvestigated , completely reversed the existing investigation procedure .
they no longer relied on coincidences to bring nazi crimes to light but rather on systematically investigating them .
that was the immediate trigger for the establishment of a unique central authority in ludwigsburg to compile , coordinate and investigate all types of crimes committed under the nazis .
beyond that , the ulm trial was only a brief shock for the german population .
the real jolt came with the adolf eichmann arrest and trial and the auschwitz trial in frankfurt in 1963 .
the general awareness in the german population that most nazi crimes were committed in eastern europe and that the murderers live among us in society only sank in later . interview : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they managed to get it under control by sunset . a fire which broke out tuesday afternoon at berlin 's philharmonie , the concert hall that is home to the berlin philharmonic , was under control before sunset , berlin fire chief wilfried graefling said . the fire was , however , still smouldering , and the damage was considerable , he told berlin 's regional public broadcaster rbb . graefling said the fire had broken out in the iconic golden building at around 2 p.m. while repairs to the roof were being carried out .
a police spokeswoman said a probe into the cause was underway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firemen battled the blaze all afternoon by mid-afternoon , a pall of brown smoke hung over the area close to berlin 's central tiergarten park . fire crews were expected to work into the night to douse the fire completely . " but things will not deteriorate , " graefling said .
he added that the concrete roof of the 45-year-old building had held , and that damage from the water used to douse the fire was thus limited . musicians evacuated expensive instruments from the building , which also houses a musical instrument museum . the fire alert began only an hour before the famous orchestra , an adult choir and 400 children were to have begun a joint rehearsal for a concert to take place friday night .
the building was cleared , and nobody was injured .
bildunterschrift : an aerial view showed the extent of the fire firefighters spent hours ripping off parts of the golden sheet-metal roof to gain access to burning insulation . the hall 's chief executive , pamela rosenberg , said claudio abbado , who retired as conductor of the orchestra in 2002 , had been in the building at the time the blaze began , preparing for a comeback program from friday to sunday . sir simon rattle , the orchestra 's regular conductor , was in france , she added . the 2,200-seat building , designed by hans scharoun , opened in 1963 on the west berlin side of the berlin wall . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 20.05.2008 landmark trial pushed germany to tackle nazi past großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defendants lived normal lives in the midst of german society for years fifty years ago , a trial against 10 members of a nazi commando in the city of ulm , changed the way west germany dealt with its fascist past and crack down on crimes committed by the nazis . from july 28 to august 29 , 1958 , 10 men from a special nazi commando , " tilsit , " went on trial in the west german city of ulm in the state of baden-wuerttemberg .
the so-called ulm einsatzgruppen trial , one of the largest in a west german court that centered on the mass murder of jews , accused the men , gestapo and ss members , of killing more than 5,000 jewish men , women and children in lithuania .
the proceedings revealed gruesome crimes and showed that many of the perpetrators continued to live normal lives in west germany for years after the war , their murderous campaign largely undetected .
the trial is considered a major break with how germany dealt with its nazi past until then .
dw-world.de spoke to dieter pohl , a historian and lecturer at the institute for contemporary history in munich , about the historic trial 50 years ago .
dw-world.de : the ulm einsatzgruppen trial is considered a turning point in how germany dealt with its nazi past .
why is that ?
dieter pohl : the bulk of the nazi war crime trials took place right after 1945 .
basically , from 1945 to 1949 , there were parallel allied tribunals and german courts .
the german courts largely dealt with crimes committed against german citizens ; the allied courts dealt with all others , which meant the majority of nazi crimes .
these proceedings petered out by the end of the 1940s and early 1950s largely because west german society suppressed the past and preferred not to talk about it .
nazi crimes hardly found mention in public discourse in the early 1950s . thus the ulm trial in 1958 marked the reopening of criminal proceedings against nazi criminals .
it was seen as a sign that the west german judicial system was taking the nazi past more seriously . but the most striking thing about the ulm trial was that it made clear that nazi atrocities were not just committed within the third reich but largely in eastern europe .
the 10 defendants in the ulm trial stood accused of murdering more than 5,000 jewish men , women and children .
who were these men ?
were they cold-blooded killers or just " ordinary men " ?
no , they certainly were n't average germans .
they were members of the gestapo in tilsit -lsb- editor 's note : the now russian town of sovetsk -rsb- on the northeastern tip of the third reich , some were even long-time ss members .
they were largely career policemen , people who usually joined the crime force and then went on to join the gestapo during the 1930s .
usually the leading personnel involved die-hard nazis - people who joined the nsdap relatively early , actively supported the nazi ideology and cracked down on the opponents of the ideology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the dock - some of the defendants in the ulm trial right after the wehrmacht 's invasion of the soviet union on june 22 , 1941 , the gestapo tilsit followed with small commandos , entered western lithuanian territory and began shooting jews .
this was where the first mass murder of jews in the so-called " final solution " took place on june 24 , 1941 , just two days after the beginning of the german campaign in the town of garsden .
the commandos largely targeted young jewish men old enough to join the army ; women and children were only killed in exceptions .
the crimes set the stage for what followed in the entire occupied soviet union over the next two years - large massacres of jewish communities with all the brutalities that went with it .
how did the ulm trial come about ? actually due to sheer coincidence .
one of the main defendants , bernhard fischer-schweder , the police chief in memel , lithuania , in 1941 and involved in the murder of thousands of jews , assumed a false name after 1945 and was appointed director of a refugee shelter near ulm in 1955 .
he was fired when his past came to light .
when he was refused another public sector job , fischer-schweder filed a lawsuit in a labor court .
a survivor of fischer-schweder 's murderous campaign in lithuania came across a newspaper article about the court case and identified him , revealing details about his past .
that provided the trigger for the trial .
unfortunately , most cases against nazi criminals at the time came into being this way .
a surviving victim usually happened to discover a perpetrator and then filed a lawsuit against him .
what kind of an atmosphere did the trial take place in ?
how was it viewed by the west germans and the justice system ?
the trial came at a time when much of the german population simply wanted to draw a line under the past .
after several years of allied rule and a constant focus on the nazi past , most people simply did n't want to hear about it anymore .
the judicial system in germany was partly shocked to see that severely incriminated perpetrators of nazi crimes had managed to get away without facing any criminal proceedings .
it was largely the then state prosecutor of baden-wuerttemberg , erwin schuele , who personally fought for the trial to take place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nuremberg war crimes trials in 1945 are well known but at the same time , germany 's judicial system in the 1950s was n't particularly interested in pursuing nazi crimes .
that had partly to do with the nazi-weary mentality of the time .
another major reason for the reluctance to crack down on nazi abuses was that there were quite a few lawyers and state prosecutors who had previously been members of the nazi party .
the presence of so many former nazis in the german judicial system gathered force in the 1950s , because many who underwent denazification and were dismissed from public service earlier reentered the system in the early 1950s .
yet ulm did command immense media attention in the federal republic of germany .
it was n't the first trial of its kind but it was certainly the most elaborate and most publicized of the time .
usually , with the exception of the big nazi war crime trials in allied tribunals , only a few regional and local papers reported about such cases .
in the 1950s especially , such trials hardly sparked any nationwide attention .
the defendants in the ulm trial were given relatively light prison sentences of between three and 15 years . why was that ?
the main problem that plagued all nazi war crime trials right up to the 1980s was the development of the so-called " accessory to murder " construct .
normally , a murderer is punished with a life sentence .
but most of the courts accepted that the main perpetrators of the mass murder of jews were the nazi leadership - hitler , himmler and others .
all the others were thus not considered murderers who killed jews out of a deep sense of personal motivation but rather simply helpers who aided in the crime .
that 's why the majority of nazi criminals were sentenced for being an accessory to murder .
it was only in cases where it could be proven that someone had committed crimes out of a sense of personal conviction that a life sentence was issued .
this strategy was strongly criticized in the 1960s and also proved to be wrong , because the courts were largely dealing with committed nazis and anti-semites .
another reason was that it was difficult to reconstruct crimes committed 10 or 12 years previously and build up cases with the help of eye witnesses that would eventually lead to court proceedings .
but the biggest problem was that the majority of the german population was simply not interested in tackling the past , and the authorities lacked the will to pursue people who committed atrocities under the nazis .
how were the sentences received in germany and abroad ?
there was certainly a resonance in the us and in israel , and i imagine there may have been some disappointments , particularly among jews .
in germany , reaction was divided because a liberal segment in society was deeply interested in the trial in the late 1950s and followed it critically .
but the majority of the german population at the time simply did n't want anything to do with it .
it 's true , the sentences in the ulm trial were very light .
there is hardly any person accused of crimes under the nazis who served out the entirety of the sentence issued in the federal republic of germany .
what effect did the ulm einsatzgruppen trial have on west germany 's efforts to bring nazi war criminals to justice ?
one of the most important and immediate political fall-outs of the ulm trial was that justice ministers in west germany , spurred on by the realization that many grave nazi crimes in eastern europe were left uninvestigated , completely reversed the existing investigation procedure .
they no longer relied on coincidences to bring nazi crimes to light but rather on systematically investigating them .
that was the immediate trigger for the establishment of a unique central authority in ludwigsburg to compile , coordinate and investigate all types of crimes committed under the nazis .
beyond that , the ulm trial was only a brief shock for the german population .
the real jolt came with the adolf eichmann arrest and trial and the auschwitz trial in frankfurt in 1963 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 20.05.2008 landmark trial pushed germany to tackle nazi past großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defendants lived normal lives in the midst of german society for years fifty years ago , a trial against 10 members of a nazi commando in the city of ulm , changed the way west germany dealt with its fascist past and crack down on crimes committed by the nazis . from july 28 to august 29 , 1958 , 10 men from a special nazi commando , " tilsit , " went on trial in the west german city of ulm in the state of baden-wuerttemberg .
the so-called ulm einsatzgruppen trial , one of the largest in a west german court that centered on the mass murder of jews , accused the men , gestapo and ss members , of killing more than 5,000 jewish men , women and children in lithuania .
the proceedings revealed gruesome crimes and showed that many of the perpetrators continued to live normal lives in west germany for years after the war , their murderous campaign largely undetected .
the trial is considered a major break with how germany dealt with its nazi past until then .
dw-world.de spoke to dieter pohl , a historian and lecturer at the institute for contemporary history in munich , about the historic trial 50 years ago .
dw-world.de : the ulm einsatzgruppen trial is considered a turning point in how germany dealt with its nazi past .
why is that ?
dieter pohl : the bulk of the nazi war crime trials took place right after 1945 .
basically , from 1945 to 1949 , there were parallel allied tribunals and german courts .
the german courts largely dealt with crimes committed against german citizens ; the allied courts dealt with all others , which meant the majority of nazi crimes .
these proceedings petered out by the end of the 1940s and early 1950s largely because west german society suppressed the past and preferred not to talk about it .
nazi crimes hardly found mention in public discourse in the early 1950s . thus the ulm trial in 1958 marked the reopening of criminal proceedings against nazi criminals .
it was seen as a sign that the west german judicial system was taking the nazi past more seriously . but the most striking thing about the ulm trial was that it made clear that nazi atrocities were not just committed within the third reich but largely in eastern europe .
the 10 defendants in the ulm trial stood accused of murdering more than 5,000 jewish men , women and children .
who were these men ?
were they cold-blooded killers or just " ordinary men " ?
no , they certainly were n't average germans .
they were members of the gestapo in tilsit -lsb- editor 's note : the now russian town of sovetsk -rsb- on the northeastern tip of the third reich , some were even long-time ss members .
they were largely career policemen , people who usually joined the crime force and then went on to join the gestapo during the 1930s .
usually the leading personnel involved die-hard nazis - people who joined the nsdap relatively early , actively supported the nazi ideology and cracked down on the opponents of the ideology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the dock - some of the defendants in the ulm trial right after the wehrmacht 's invasion of the soviet union on june 22 , 1941 , the gestapo tilsit followed with small commandos , entered western lithuanian territory and began shooting jews .
this was where the first mass murder of jews in the so-called " final solution " took place on june 24 , 1941 , just two days after the beginning of the german campaign in the town of garsden .
the commandos largely targeted young jewish men old enough to join the army ; women and children were only killed in exceptions .
the crimes set the stage for what followed in the entire occupied soviet union over the next two years - large massacres of jewish communities with all the brutalities that went with it .
how did the ulm trial come about ? actually due to sheer coincidence .
one of the main defendants , bernhard fischer-schweder , the police chief in memel , lithuania , in 1941 and involved in the murder of thousands of jews , assumed a false name after 1945 and was appointed director of a refugee shelter near ulm in 1955 .
he was fired when his past came to light .
when he was refused another public sector job , fischer-schweder filed a lawsuit in a labor court .
a survivor of fischer-schweder 's murderous campaign in lithuania came across a newspaper article about the court case and identified him , revealing details about his past .
that provided the trigger for the trial .
unfortunately , most cases against nazi criminals at the time came into being this way .
a surviving victim usually happened to discover a perpetrator and then filed a lawsuit against him .
what kind of an atmosphere did the trial take place in ?
how was it viewed by the west germans and the justice system ?
the trial came at a time when much of the german population simply wanted to draw a line under the past .
after several years of allied rule and a constant focus on the nazi past , most people simply did n't want to hear about it anymore .
the judicial system in germany was partly shocked to see that severely incriminated perpetrators of nazi crimes had managed to get away without facing any criminal proceedings .
it was largely the then state prosecutor of baden-wuerttemberg , erwin schuele , who personally fought for the trial to take place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nuremberg war crimes trials in 1945 are well known but at the same time , germany 's judicial system in the 1950s was n't particularly interested in pursuing nazi crimes .
that had partly to do with the nazi-weary mentality of the time .
another major reason for the reluctance to crack down on nazi abuses was that there were quite a few lawyers and state prosecutors who had previously been members of the nazi party .
the presence of so many former nazis in the german judicial system gathered force in the 1950s , because many who underwent denazification and were dismissed from public service earlier reentered the system in the early 1950s .
yet ulm did command immense media attention in the federal republic of germany .
it was n't the first trial of its kind but it was certainly the most elaborate and most publicized of the time .
usually , with the exception of the big nazi war crime trials in allied tribunals , only a few regional and local papers reported about such cases .
in the 1950s especially , such trials hardly sparked any nationwide attention .
the defendants in the ulm trial were given relatively light prison sentences of between three and 15 years . why was that ?
the main problem that plagued all nazi war crime trials right up to the 1980s was the development of the so-called " accessory to murder " construct .
normally , a murderer is punished with a life sentence .
but most of the courts accepted that the main perpetrators of the mass murder of jews were the nazi leadership - hitler , himmler and others .
all the others were thus not considered murderers who killed jews out of a deep sense of personal motivation but rather simply helpers who aided in the crime .
that 's why the majority of nazi criminals were sentenced for being an accessory to murder .
it was only in cases where it could be proven that someone had committed crimes out of a sense of personal conviction that a life sentence was issued .
this strategy was strongly criticized in the 1960s and also proved to be wrong , because the courts were largely dealing with committed nazis and anti-semites .
another reason was that it was difficult to reconstruct crimes committed 10 or 12 years previously and build up cases with the help of eye witnesses that would eventually lead to court proceedings .
but the biggest problem was that the majority of the german population was simply not interested in tackling the past , and the authorities lacked the will to pursue people who committed atrocities under the nazis .
how were the sentences received in germany and abroad ?
there was certainly a resonance in the us and in israel , and i imagine there may have been some disappointments , particularly among jews .
in germany , reaction was divided because a liberal segment in society was deeply interested in the trial in the late 1950s and followed it critically .
but the majority of the german population at the time simply did n't want anything to do with it .
it 's true , the sentences in the ulm trial were very light .
there is hardly any person accused of crimes under the nazis who served out the entirety of the sentence issued in the federal republic of germany .
what effect did the ulm einsatzgruppen trial have on west germany 's efforts to bring nazi war criminals to justice ?
one of the most important and immediate political fall-outs of the ulm trial was that justice ministers in west germany , spurred on by the realization that many grave nazi crimes in eastern europe were left uninvestigated , completely reversed the existing investigation procedure .
they no longer relied on coincidences to bring nazi crimes to light but rather on systematically investigating them .
that was the immediate trigger for the establishment of a unique central authority in ludwigsburg to compile , coordinate and investigate all types of crimes committed under the nazis .
beyond that , the ulm trial was only a brief shock for the german population .
the real jolt came with the adolf eichmann arrest and trial and the auschwitz trial in frankfurt in 1963 .
the general awareness in the german population that most nazi crimes were committed in eastern europe and that the murderers live among us in society only sank in later . interview : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the judicial system in germany was partly shocked to see that severely incriminated perpetrators of nazi crimes had managed to get away without facing any criminal proceedings .
it was largely the then state prosecutor of baden-wuerttemberg , erwin schuele , who personally fought for the trial to take place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nuremberg war crimes trials in 1945 are well known but at the same time , germany 's judicial system in the 1950s was n't particularly interested in pursuing nazi crimes .
that had partly to do with the nazi-weary mentality of the time .
another major reason for the reluctance to crack down on nazi abuses was that there were quite a few lawyers and state prosecutors who had previously been members of the nazi party .
the presence of so many former nazis in the german judicial system gathered force in the 1950s , because many who underwent denazification and were dismissed from public service earlier reentered the system in the early 1950s .
yet ulm did command immense media attention in the federal republic of germany .
it was n't the first trial of its kind but it was certainly the most elaborate and most publicized of the time .
usually , with the exception of the big nazi war crime trials in allied tribunals , only a few regional and local papers reported about such cases .
in the 1950s especially , such trials hardly sparked any nationwide attention .
the defendants in the ulm trial were given relatively light prison sentences of between three and 15 years . why was that ?
the main problem that plagued all nazi war crime trials right up to the 1980s was the development of the so-called " accessory to murder " construct .
normally , a murderer is punished with a life sentence .
but most of the courts accepted that the main perpetrators of the mass murder of jews were the nazi leadership - hitler , himmler and others .
all the others were thus not considered murderers who killed jews out of a deep sense of personal motivation but rather simply helpers who aided in the crime .
that 's why the majority of nazi criminals were sentenced for being an accessory to murder .
it was only in cases where it could be proven that someone had committed crimes out of a sense of personal conviction that a life sentence was issued .
this strategy was strongly criticized in the 1960s and also proved to be wrong , because the courts were largely dealing with committed nazis and anti-semites .
another reason was that it was difficult to reconstruct crimes committed 10 or 12 years previously and build up cases with the help of eye witnesses that would eventually lead to court proceedings .
but the biggest problem was that the majority of the german population was simply not interested in tackling the past , and the authorities lacked the will to pursue people who committed atrocities under the nazis .
how were the sentences received in germany and abroad ?
there was certainly a resonance in the us and in israel , and i imagine there may have been some disappointments , particularly among jews .
in germany , reaction was divided because a liberal segment in society was deeply interested in the trial in the late 1950s and followed it critically .
but the majority of the german population at the time simply did n't want anything to do with it .
it 's true , the sentences in the ulm trial were very light .
there is hardly any person accused of crimes under the nazis who served out the entirety of the sentence issued in the federal republic of germany .
what effect did the ulm einsatzgruppen trial have on west germany 's efforts to bring nazi war criminals to justice ?
one of the most important and immediate political fall-outs of the ulm trial was that justice ministers in west germany , spurred on by the realization that many grave nazi crimes in eastern europe were left uninvestigated , completely reversed the existing investigation procedure .
they no longer relied on coincidences to bring nazi crimes to light but rather on systematically investigating them .
that was the immediate trigger for the establishment of a unique central authority in ludwigsburg to compile , coordinate and investigate all types of crimes committed under the nazis .
beyond that , the ulm trial was only a brief shock for the german population .
the real jolt came with the adolf eichmann arrest and trial and the auschwitz trial in frankfurt in 1963 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 20.05.2008 landmark trial pushed germany to tackle nazi past großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defendants lived normal lives in the midst of german society for years fifty years ago , a trial against 10 members of a nazi commando in the city of ulm , changed the way west germany dealt with its fascist past and crack down on crimes committed by the nazis . from july 28 to august 29 , 1958 , 10 men from a special nazi commando , " tilsit , " went on trial in the west german city of ulm in the state of baden-wuerttemberg .
the so-called ulm einsatzgruppen trial , one of the largest in a west german court that centered on the mass murder of jews , accused the men , gestapo and ss members , of killing more than 5,000 jewish men , women and children in lithuania .
the proceedings revealed gruesome crimes and showed that many of the perpetrators continued to live normal lives in west germany for years after the war , their murderous campaign largely undetected .
the trial is considered a major break with how germany dealt with its nazi past until then .
dw-world.de spoke to dieter pohl , a historian and lecturer at the institute for contemporary history in munich , about the historic trial 50 years ago .
dw-world.de : the ulm einsatzgruppen trial is considered a turning point in how germany dealt with its nazi past .
why is that ?
dieter pohl : the bulk of the nazi war crime trials took place right after 1945 .
basically , from 1945 to 1949 , there were parallel allied tribunals and german courts .
the german courts largely dealt with crimes committed against german citizens ; the allied courts dealt with all others , which meant the majority of nazi crimes .
these proceedings petered out by the end of the 1940s and early 1950s largely because west german society suppressed the past and preferred not to talk about it .
nazi crimes hardly found mention in public discourse in the early 1950s . thus the ulm trial in 1958 marked the reopening of criminal proceedings against nazi criminals .
it was seen as a sign that the west german judicial system was taking the nazi past more seriously . but the most striking thing about the ulm trial was that it made clear that nazi atrocities were not just committed within the third reich but largely in eastern europe .
the 10 defendants in the ulm trial stood accused of murdering more than 5,000 jewish men , women and children .
who were these men ?
were they cold-blooded killers or just " ordinary men " ?
no , they certainly were n't average germans .
they were members of the gestapo in tilsit -lsb- editor 's note : the now russian town of sovetsk -rsb- on the northeastern tip of the third reich , some were even long-time ss members .
they were largely career policemen , people who usually joined the crime force and then went on to join the gestapo during the 1930s .
usually the leading personnel involved die-hard nazis - people who joined the nsdap relatively early , actively supported the nazi ideology and cracked down on the opponents of the ideology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the dock - some of the defendants in the ulm trial right after the wehrmacht 's invasion of the soviet union on june 22 , 1941 , the gestapo tilsit followed with small commandos , entered western lithuanian territory and began shooting jews .
this was where the first mass murder of jews in the so-called " final solution " took place on june 24 , 1941 , just two days after the beginning of the german campaign in the town of garsden .
the commandos largely targeted young jewish men old enough to join the army ; women and children were only killed in exceptions .
the crimes set the stage for what followed in the entire occupied soviet union over the next two years - large massacres of jewish communities with all the brutalities that went with it .
how did the ulm trial come about ? actually due to sheer coincidence .
one of the main defendants , bernhard fischer-schweder , the police chief in memel , lithuania , in 1941 and involved in the murder of thousands of jews , assumed a false name after 1945 and was appointed director of a refugee shelter near ulm in 1955 .
he was fired when his past came to light .
when he was refused another public sector job , fischer-schweder filed a lawsuit in a labor court .
a survivor of fischer-schweder 's murderous campaign in lithuania came across a newspaper article about the court case and identified him , revealing details about his past .
that provided the trigger for the trial .
unfortunately , most cases against nazi criminals at the time came into being this way .
a surviving victim usually happened to discover a perpetrator and then filed a lawsuit against him .
what kind of an atmosphere did the trial take place in ?
how was it viewed by the west germans and the justice system ?
the trial came at a time when much of the german population simply wanted to draw a line under the past .
after several years of allied rule and a constant focus on the nazi past , most people simply did n't want to hear about it anymore .
the judicial system in germany was partly shocked to see that severely incriminated perpetrators of nazi crimes had managed to get away without facing any criminal proceedings .
it was largely the then state prosecutor of baden-wuerttemberg , erwin schuele , who personally fought for the trial to take place .

but this week , all serbs will be europe 's biggest fans as the continent 's largest song contest comes to belgrade . serbia 's three anti-european political parties want to move their country away from the european union and towards russia .
by agreeing on general principles to create a coalition last thursday , may 15 , they could even form the country 's next government - despite the fact that the pro-european party of serbian president boris tadic actually won early parliamentary elections on may 11 .
but tadic 's party has failed to find a coalition partner so far . amid this tense and anti-european political situation , serbia 's getting ready to host a truly european event - the eurovision song contest . the event 's organizers do n't want to let the situation spoil the mood and have been trying to ban political debate from the show . " participants represent their countries , not their governments , " said sandra susa , who 's responsible for organizing the contest .
" we 're calling on serbian and foreign media to set politics aside .

they managed to get it under control by sunset . a fire which broke out tuesday afternoon at berlin 's philharmonie , the concert hall that is home to the berlin philharmonic , was under control before sunset , berlin fire chief wilfried graefling said . the fire was , however , still smouldering , and the damage was considerable , he told berlin 's regional public broadcaster rbb . graefling said the fire had broken out in the iconic golden building at around 2 p.m. while repairs to the roof were being carried out .
a police spokeswoman said a probe into the cause was underway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firemen battled the blaze all afternoon by mid-afternoon , a pall of brown smoke hung over the area close to berlin 's central tiergarten park . fire crews were expected to work into the night to douse the fire completely . " but things will not deteriorate , " graefling said .
he added that the concrete roof of the 45-year-old building had held , and that damage from the water used to douse the fire was thus limited . musicians evacuated expensive instruments from the building , which also houses a musical instrument museum . the fire alert began only an hour before the famous orchestra , an adult choir and 400 children were to have begun a joint rehearsal for a concert to take place friday night .
the building was cleared , and nobody was injured .
bildunterschrift : an aerial view showed the extent of the fire firefighters spent hours ripping off parts of the golden sheet-metal roof to gain access to burning insulation . the hall 's chief executive , pamela rosenberg , said claudio abbado , who retired as conductor of the orchestra in 2002 , had been in the building at the time the blaze began , preparing for a comeback program from friday to sunday . sir simon rattle , the orchestra 's regular conductor , was in france , she added . the 2,200-seat building , designed by hans scharoun , opened in 1963 on the west berlin side of the berlin wall . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they managed to get it under control by sunset . a fire which broke out tuesday afternoon at berlin 's philharmonie , the concert hall that is home to the berlin philharmonic , was under control before sunset , berlin fire chief wilfried graefling said . the fire was , however , still smouldering , and the damage was considerable , he told berlin 's regional public broadcaster rbb . graefling said the fire had broken out in the iconic golden building at around 2 p.m. while repairs to the roof were being carried out .
a police spokeswoman said a probe into the cause was underway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firemen battled the blaze all afternoon by mid-afternoon , a pall of brown smoke hung over the area close to berlin 's central tiergarten park . fire crews were expected to work into the night to douse the fire completely . " but things will not deteriorate , " graefling said .
he added that the concrete roof of the 45-year-old building had held , and that damage from the water used to douse the fire was thus limited . musicians evacuated expensive instruments from the building , which also houses a musical instrument museum . the fire alert began only an hour before the famous orchestra , an adult choir and 400 children were to have begun a joint rehearsal for a concert to take place friday night .
the building was cleared , and nobody was injured .
bildunterschrift : an aerial view showed the extent of the fire firefighters spent hours ripping off parts of the golden sheet-metal roof to gain access to burning insulation . the hall 's chief executive , pamela rosenberg , said claudio abbado , who retired as conductor of the orchestra in 2002 , had been in the building at the time the blaze began , preparing for a comeback program from friday to sunday . sir simon rattle , the orchestra 's regular conductor , was in france , she added . the 2,200-seat building , designed by hans scharoun , opened in 1963 on the west berlin side of the berlin wall . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 20.05.2008 landmark trial pushed germany to tackle nazi past großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defendants lived normal lives in the midst of german society for years fifty years ago , a trial against 10 members of a nazi commando in the city of ulm , changed the way west germany dealt with its fascist past and crack down on crimes committed by the nazis . from july 28 to august 29 , 1958 , 10 men from a special nazi commando , " tilsit , " went on trial in the west german city of ulm in the state of baden-wuerttemberg .
the so-called ulm einsatzgruppen trial , one of the largest in a west german court that centered on the mass murder of jews , accused the men , gestapo and ss members , of killing more than 5,000 jewish men , women and children in lithuania .
the proceedings revealed gruesome crimes and showed that many of the perpetrators continued to live normal lives in west germany for years after the war , their murderous campaign largely undetected .
the trial is considered a major break with how germany dealt with its nazi past until then .
dw-world.de spoke to dieter pohl , a historian and lecturer at the institute for contemporary history in munich , about the historic trial 50 years ago .
dw-world.de : the ulm einsatzgruppen trial is considered a turning point in how germany dealt with its nazi past .
why is that ?
dieter pohl : the bulk of the nazi war crime trials took place right after 1945 .
basically , from 1945 to 1949 , there were parallel allied tribunals and german courts .
the german courts largely dealt with crimes committed against german citizens ; the allied courts dealt with all others , which meant the majority of nazi crimes .
these proceedings petered out by the end of the 1940s and early 1950s largely because west german society suppressed the past and preferred not to talk about it .
nazi crimes hardly found mention in public discourse in the early 1950s . thus the ulm trial in 1958 marked the reopening of criminal proceedings against nazi criminals .
it was seen as a sign that the west german judicial system was taking the nazi past more seriously . but the most striking thing about the ulm trial was that it made clear that nazi atrocities were not just committed within the third reich but largely in eastern europe .
the 10 defendants in the ulm trial stood accused of murdering more than 5,000 jewish men , women and children .
who were these men ?
were they cold-blooded killers or just " ordinary men " ?
no , they certainly were n't average germans .
they were members of the gestapo in tilsit -lsb- editor 's note : the now russian town of sovetsk -rsb- on the northeastern tip of the third reich , some were even long-time ss members .
they were largely career policemen , people who usually joined the crime force and then went on to join the gestapo during the 1930s .
usually the leading personnel involved die-hard nazis - people who joined the nsdap relatively early , actively supported the nazi ideology and cracked down on the opponents of the ideology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the dock - some of the defendants in the ulm trial right after the wehrmacht 's invasion of the soviet union on june 22 , 1941 , the gestapo tilsit followed with small commandos , entered western lithuanian territory and began shooting jews .
this was where the first mass murder of jews in the so-called " final solution " took place on june 24 , 1941 , just two days after the beginning of the german campaign in the town of garsden .
the commandos largely targeted young jewish men old enough to join the army ; women and children were only killed in exceptions .
the crimes set the stage for what followed in the entire occupied soviet union over the next two years - large massacres of jewish communities with all the brutalities that went with it .
how did the ulm trial come about ? actually due to sheer coincidence .
one of the main defendants , bernhard fischer-schweder , the police chief in memel , lithuania , in 1941 and involved in the murder of thousands of jews , assumed a false name after 1945 and was appointed director of a refugee shelter near ulm in 1955 .
he was fired when his past came to light .
when he was refused another public sector job , fischer-schweder filed a lawsuit in a labor court .
a survivor of fischer-schweder 's murderous campaign in lithuania came across a newspaper article about the court case and identified him , revealing details about his past .
that provided the trigger for the trial .
unfortunately , most cases against nazi criminals at the time came into being this way .
a surviving victim usually happened to discover a perpetrator and then filed a lawsuit against him .
what kind of an atmosphere did the trial take place in ?
how was it viewed by the west germans and the justice system ?
the trial came at a time when much of the german population simply wanted to draw a line under the past .
after several years of allied rule and a constant focus on the nazi past , most people simply did n't want to hear about it anymore .
the judicial system in germany was partly shocked to see that severely incriminated perpetrators of nazi crimes had managed to get away without facing any criminal proceedings .
it was largely the then state prosecutor of baden-wuerttemberg , erwin schuele , who personally fought for the trial to take place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nuremberg war crimes trials in 1945 are well known but at the same time , germany 's judicial system in the 1950s was n't particularly interested in pursuing nazi crimes .
that had partly to do with the nazi-weary mentality of the time .
another major reason for the reluctance to crack down on nazi abuses was that there were quite a few lawyers and state prosecutors who had previously been members of the nazi party .
the presence of so many former nazis in the german judicial system gathered force in the 1950s , because many who underwent denazification and were dismissed from public service earlier reentered the system in the early 1950s .
yet ulm did command immense media attention in the federal republic of germany .
it was n't the first trial of its kind but it was certainly the most elaborate and most publicized of the time .
usually , with the exception of the big nazi war crime trials in allied tribunals , only a few regional and local papers reported about such cases .
in the 1950s especially , such trials hardly sparked any nationwide attention .
the defendants in the ulm trial were given relatively light prison sentences of between three and 15 years . why was that ?
the main problem that plagued all nazi war crime trials right up to the 1980s was the development of the so-called " accessory to murder " construct .
normally , a murderer is punished with a life sentence .
but most of the courts accepted that the main perpetrators of the mass murder of jews were the nazi leadership - hitler , himmler and others .
all the others were thus not considered murderers who killed jews out of a deep sense of personal motivation but rather simply helpers who aided in the crime .
that 's why the majority of nazi criminals were sentenced for being an accessory to murder .
it was only in cases where it could be proven that someone had committed crimes out of a sense of personal conviction that a life sentence was issued .
this strategy was strongly criticized in the 1960s and also proved to be wrong , because the courts were largely dealing with committed nazis and anti-semites .
another reason was that it was difficult to reconstruct crimes committed 10 or 12 years previously and build up cases with the help of eye witnesses that would eventually lead to court proceedings .
but the biggest problem was that the majority of the german population was simply not interested in tackling the past , and the authorities lacked the will to pursue people who committed atrocities under the nazis .
how were the sentences received in germany and abroad ?
there was certainly a resonance in the us and in israel , and i imagine there may have been some disappointments , particularly among jews .
in germany , reaction was divided because a liberal segment in society was deeply interested in the trial in the late 1950s and followed it critically .
but the majority of the german population at the time simply did n't want anything to do with it .
it 's true , the sentences in the ulm trial were very light .
there is hardly any person accused of crimes under the nazis who served out the entirety of the sentence issued in the federal republic of germany .
what effect did the ulm einsatzgruppen trial have on west germany 's efforts to bring nazi war criminals to justice ?
one of the most important and immediate political fall-outs of the ulm trial was that justice ministers in west germany , spurred on by the realization that many grave nazi crimes in eastern europe were left uninvestigated , completely reversed the existing investigation procedure .
they no longer relied on coincidences to bring nazi crimes to light but rather on systematically investigating them .
that was the immediate trigger for the establishment of a unique central authority in ludwigsburg to compile , coordinate and investigate all types of crimes committed under the nazis .
beyond that , the ulm trial was only a brief shock for the german population .
the real jolt came with the adolf eichmann arrest and trial and the auschwitz trial in frankfurt in 1963 .
the general awareness in the german population that most nazi crimes were committed in eastern europe and that the murderers live among us in society only sank in later . interview : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we can do many things wrong here -lsb- in latin america -rsb- if we do not pay attention to it , " merkel said .
" however , we can do many things right , and secure many jobs in germany , if we build long-term partnerships . "
no concrete details of the agreement were made public , although merkel said the first step would be an analysis of how the rising living standards in emerging countries are influencing the situation regarding foodstuffs .
mexico says production boost needed in a joint press conference with merkel , calderon called for a massive increase in food production around the world .
he stressed that a " very aggressive production boost " is needed and blamed the food scarcity on stronger demand in china and india but also on the massive use of corn by the united states to boost its ethanol production .
the rise in the price of corn , a staple in the mexican diet across all sectors of society , has caused particular worry in mexico in recent months .
neighboring countries like haiti and honduras have even seen violent riots in a reaction to rising food prices - as have other countries round the world .
merkel , who arrived in mexico late sunday , was given an official welcome at the central courtyard of the national palace , prior to a mexico and germany economic forum .
calderon attended last year 's g8 summit in heiligendamm , germany , alongside the leaders of a group of emerging countries such as brazil , india , south africa and china .
according to figures made public by the mexican-german chamber of commerce and industry , over 1,000 german firms are currently active in mexico , and the volume of trade between the two countries is almost $ 14 billion -lrb- 8.9 billion euros -rrb- a year . dpa news agency -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 20.05.2008 landmark trial pushed germany to tackle nazi past großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defendants lived normal lives in the midst of german society for years fifty years ago , a trial against 10 members of a nazi commando in the city of ulm , changed the way west germany dealt with its fascist past and crack down on crimes committed by the nazis . from july 28 to august 29 , 1958 , 10 men from a special nazi commando , " tilsit , " went on trial in the west german city of ulm in the state of baden-wuerttemberg .
the so-called ulm einsatzgruppen trial , one of the largest in a west german court that centered on the mass murder of jews , accused the men , gestapo and ss members , of killing more than 5,000 jewish men , women and children in lithuania .
the proceedings revealed gruesome crimes and showed that many of the perpetrators continued to live normal lives in west germany for years after the war , their murderous campaign largely undetected .
the trial is considered a major break with how germany dealt with its nazi past until then .
dw-world.de spoke to dieter pohl , a historian and lecturer at the institute for contemporary history in munich , about the historic trial 50 years ago .
dw-world.de : the ulm einsatzgruppen trial is considered a turning point in how germany dealt with its nazi past .
why is that ?
dieter pohl : the bulk of the nazi war crime trials took place right after 1945 .
basically , from 1945 to 1949 , there were parallel allied tribunals and german courts .
the german courts largely dealt with crimes committed against german citizens ; the allied courts dealt with all others , which meant the majority of nazi crimes .
these proceedings petered out by the end of the 1940s and early 1950s largely because west german society suppressed the past and preferred not to talk about it .
nazi crimes hardly found mention in public discourse in the early 1950s . thus the ulm trial in 1958 marked the reopening of criminal proceedings against nazi criminals .
it was seen as a sign that the west german judicial system was taking the nazi past more seriously . but the most striking thing about the ulm trial was that it made clear that nazi atrocities were not just committed within the third reich but largely in eastern europe .
the 10 defendants in the ulm trial stood accused of murdering more than 5,000 jewish men , women and children .
who were these men ?
were they cold-blooded killers or just " ordinary men " ?
no , they certainly were n't average germans .
they were members of the gestapo in tilsit -lsb- editor 's note : the now russian town of sovetsk -rsb- on the northeastern tip of the third reich , some were even long-time ss members .
they were largely career policemen , people who usually joined the crime force and then went on to join the gestapo during the 1930s .
usually the leading personnel involved die-hard nazis - people who joined the nsdap relatively early , actively supported the nazi ideology and cracked down on the opponents of the ideology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the dock - some of the defendants in the ulm trial right after the wehrmacht 's invasion of the soviet union on june 22 , 1941 , the gestapo tilsit followed with small commandos , entered western lithuanian territory and began shooting jews .
this was where the first mass murder of jews in the so-called " final solution " took place on june 24 , 1941 , just two days after the beginning of the german campaign in the town of garsden .
the commandos largely targeted young jewish men old enough to join the army ; women and children were only killed in exceptions .
the crimes set the stage for what followed in the entire occupied soviet union over the next two years - large massacres of jewish communities with all the brutalities that went with it .
how did the ulm trial come about ? actually due to sheer coincidence .
one of the main defendants , bernhard fischer-schweder , the police chief in memel , lithuania , in 1941 and involved in the murder of thousands of jews , assumed a false name after 1945 and was appointed director of a refugee shelter near ulm in 1955 .
he was fired when his past came to light .
when he was refused another public sector job , fischer-schweder filed a lawsuit in a labor court .
a survivor of fischer-schweder 's murderous campaign in lithuania came across a newspaper article about the court case and identified him , revealing details about his past .
that provided the trigger for the trial .
unfortunately , most cases against nazi criminals at the time came into being this way .
a surviving victim usually happened to discover a perpetrator and then filed a lawsuit against him .
what kind of an atmosphere did the trial take place in ?
how was it viewed by the west germans and the justice system ?
the trial came at a time when much of the german population simply wanted to draw a line under the past .
after several years of allied rule and a constant focus on the nazi past , most people simply did n't want to hear about it anymore .
the judicial system in germany was partly shocked to see that severely incriminated perpetrators of nazi crimes had managed to get away without facing any criminal proceedings .
it was largely the then state prosecutor of baden-wuerttemberg , erwin schuele , who personally fought for the trial to take place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nuremberg war crimes trials in 1945 are well known but at the same time , germany 's judicial system in the 1950s was n't particularly interested in pursuing nazi crimes .
that had partly to do with the nazi-weary mentality of the time .
another major reason for the reluctance to crack down on nazi abuses was that there were quite a few lawyers and state prosecutors who had previously been members of the nazi party .
the presence of so many former nazis in the german judicial system gathered force in the 1950s , because many who underwent denazification and were dismissed from public service earlier reentered the system in the early 1950s .
yet ulm did command immense media attention in the federal republic of germany .
it was n't the first trial of its kind but it was certainly the most elaborate and most publicized of the time .
usually , with the exception of the big nazi war crime trials in allied tribunals , only a few regional and local papers reported about such cases .
in the 1950s especially , such trials hardly sparked any nationwide attention .
the defendants in the ulm trial were given relatively light prison sentences of between three and 15 years . why was that ?
the main problem that plagued all nazi war crime trials right up to the 1980s was the development of the so-called " accessory to murder " construct .
normally , a murderer is punished with a life sentence .
but most of the courts accepted that the main perpetrators of the mass murder of jews were the nazi leadership - hitler , himmler and others .
all the others were thus not considered murderers who killed jews out of a deep sense of personal motivation but rather simply helpers who aided in the crime .
that 's why the majority of nazi criminals were sentenced for being an accessory to murder .
it was only in cases where it could be proven that someone had committed crimes out of a sense of personal conviction that a life sentence was issued .
this strategy was strongly criticized in the 1960s and also proved to be wrong , because the courts were largely dealing with committed nazis and anti-semites .
another reason was that it was difficult to reconstruct crimes committed 10 or 12 years previously and build up cases with the help of eye witnesses that would eventually lead to court proceedings .
but the biggest problem was that the majority of the german population was simply not interested in tackling the past , and the authorities lacked the will to pursue people who committed atrocities under the nazis .
how were the sentences received in germany and abroad ?
there was certainly a resonance in the us and in israel , and i imagine there may have been some disappointments , particularly among jews .
in germany , reaction was divided because a liberal segment in society was deeply interested in the trial in the late 1950s and followed it critically .
but the majority of the german population at the time simply did n't want anything to do with it .
it 's true , the sentences in the ulm trial were very light .
there is hardly any person accused of crimes under the nazis who served out the entirety of the sentence issued in the federal republic of germany .
what effect did the ulm einsatzgruppen trial have on west germany 's efforts to bring nazi war criminals to justice ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 20.05.2008 landmark trial pushed germany to tackle nazi past großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defendants lived normal lives in the midst of german society for years fifty years ago , a trial against 10 members of a nazi commando in the city of ulm , changed the way west germany dealt with its fascist past and crack down on crimes committed by the nazis . from july 28 to august 29 , 1958 , 10 men from a special nazi commando , " tilsit , " went on trial in the west german city of ulm in the state of baden-wuerttemberg .
the so-called ulm einsatzgruppen trial , one of the largest in a west german court that centered on the mass murder of jews , accused the men , gestapo and ss members , of killing more than 5,000 jewish men , women and children in lithuania .
the proceedings revealed gruesome crimes and showed that many of the perpetrators continued to live normal lives in west germany for years after the war , their murderous campaign largely undetected .
the trial is considered a major break with how germany dealt with its nazi past until then .
dw-world.de spoke to dieter pohl , a historian and lecturer at the institute for contemporary history in munich , about the historic trial 50 years ago .
dw-world.de : the ulm einsatzgruppen trial is considered a turning point in how germany dealt with its nazi past .
why is that ?
dieter pohl : the bulk of the nazi war crime trials took place right after 1945 .
basically , from 1945 to 1949 , there were parallel allied tribunals and german courts .
the german courts largely dealt with crimes committed against german citizens ; the allied courts dealt with all others , which meant the majority of nazi crimes .
these proceedings petered out by the end of the 1940s and early 1950s largely because west german society suppressed the past and preferred not to talk about it .
nazi crimes hardly found mention in public discourse in the early 1950s . thus the ulm trial in 1958 marked the reopening of criminal proceedings against nazi criminals .
it was seen as a sign that the west german judicial system was taking the nazi past more seriously . but the most striking thing about the ulm trial was that it made clear that nazi atrocities were not just committed within the third reich but largely in eastern europe .
the 10 defendants in the ulm trial stood accused of murdering more than 5,000 jewish men , women and children .
who were these men ?
were they cold-blooded killers or just " ordinary men " ?
no , they certainly were n't average germans .
they were members of the gestapo in tilsit -lsb- editor 's note : the now russian town of sovetsk -rsb- on the northeastern tip of the third reich , some were even long-time ss members .
they were largely career policemen , people who usually joined the crime force and then went on to join the gestapo during the 1930s .
usually the leading personnel involved die-hard nazis - people who joined the nsdap relatively early , actively supported the nazi ideology and cracked down on the opponents of the ideology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the dock - some of the defendants in the ulm trial right after the wehrmacht 's invasion of the soviet union on june 22 , 1941 , the gestapo tilsit followed with small commandos , entered western lithuanian territory and began shooting jews .
this was where the first mass murder of jews in the so-called " final solution " took place on june 24 , 1941 , just two days after the beginning of the german campaign in the town of garsden .
the commandos largely targeted young jewish men old enough to join the army ; women and children were only killed in exceptions .
the crimes set the stage for what followed in the entire occupied soviet union over the next two years - large massacres of jewish communities with all the brutalities that went with it .
how did the ulm trial come about ? actually due to sheer coincidence .
one of the main defendants , bernhard fischer-schweder , the police chief in memel , lithuania , in 1941 and involved in the murder of thousands of jews , assumed a false name after 1945 and was appointed director of a refugee shelter near ulm in 1955 .
he was fired when his past came to light .
when he was refused another public sector job , fischer-schweder filed a lawsuit in a labor court .
a survivor of fischer-schweder 's murderous campaign in lithuania came across a newspaper article about the court case and identified him , revealing details about his past .
that provided the trigger for the trial .
unfortunately , most cases against nazi criminals at the time came into being this way .
a surviving victim usually happened to discover a perpetrator and then filed a lawsuit against him .
what kind of an atmosphere did the trial take place in ?
how was it viewed by the west germans and the justice system ?
the trial came at a time when much of the german population simply wanted to draw a line under the past .
after several years of allied rule and a constant focus on the nazi past , most people simply did n't want to hear about it anymore .
the judicial system in germany was partly shocked to see that severely incriminated perpetrators of nazi crimes had managed to get away without facing any criminal proceedings .
it was largely the then state prosecutor of baden-wuerttemberg , erwin schuele , who personally fought for the trial to take place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nuremberg war crimes trials in 1945 are well known but at the same time , germany 's judicial system in the 1950s was n't particularly interested in pursuing nazi crimes .
that had partly to do with the nazi-weary mentality of the time .
another major reason for the reluctance to crack down on nazi abuses was that there were quite a few lawyers and state prosecutors who had previously been members of the nazi party .
the presence of so many former nazis in the german judicial system gathered force in the 1950s , because many who underwent denazification and were dismissed from public service earlier reentered the system in the early 1950s .
yet ulm did command immense media attention in the federal republic of germany .
it was n't the first trial of its kind but it was certainly the most elaborate and most publicized of the time .
usually , with the exception of the big nazi war crime trials in allied tribunals , only a few regional and local papers reported about such cases .
in the 1950s especially , such trials hardly sparked any nationwide attention .
the defendants in the ulm trial were given relatively light prison sentences of between three and 15 years . why was that ?
the main problem that plagued all nazi war crime trials right up to the 1980s was the development of the so-called " accessory to murder " construct .
normally , a murderer is punished with a life sentence .
but most of the courts accepted that the main perpetrators of the mass murder of jews were the nazi leadership - hitler , himmler and others .
all the others were thus not considered murderers who killed jews out of a deep sense of personal motivation but rather simply helpers who aided in the crime .
that 's why the majority of nazi criminals were sentenced for being an accessory to murder .
it was only in cases where it could be proven that someone had committed crimes out of a sense of personal conviction that a life sentence was issued .
this strategy was strongly criticized in the 1960s and also proved to be wrong , because the courts were largely dealing with committed nazis and anti-semites .
another reason was that it was difficult to reconstruct crimes committed 10 or 12 years previously and build up cases with the help of eye witnesses that would eventually lead to court proceedings .
but the biggest problem was that the majority of the german population was simply not interested in tackling the past , and the authorities lacked the will to pursue people who committed atrocities under the nazis .
how were the sentences received in germany and abroad ?
there was certainly a resonance in the us and in israel , and i imagine there may have been some disappointments , particularly among jews .
in germany , reaction was divided because a liberal segment in society was deeply interested in the trial in the late 1950s and followed it critically .
but the majority of the german population at the time simply did n't want anything to do with it .
it 's true , the sentences in the ulm trial were very light .
there is hardly any person accused of crimes under the nazis who served out the entirety of the sentence issued in the federal republic of germany .
what effect did the ulm einsatzgruppen trial have on west germany 's efforts to bring nazi war criminals to justice ?
one of the most important and immediate political fall-outs of the ulm trial was that justice ministers in west germany , spurred on by the realization that many grave nazi crimes in eastern europe were left uninvestigated , completely reversed the existing investigation procedure .
they no longer relied on coincidences to bring nazi crimes to light but rather on systematically investigating them .
that was the immediate trigger for the establishment of a unique central authority in ludwigsburg to compile , coordinate and investigate all types of crimes committed under the nazis .
beyond that , the ulm trial was only a brief shock for the german population .
the real jolt came with the adolf eichmann arrest and trial and the auschwitz trial in frankfurt in 1963 .
the general awareness in the german population that most nazi crimes were committed in eastern europe and that the murderers live among us in society only sank in later . interview : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 20.05.2008 europe readies for nasty food fight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the farm lobby is strong in germany stabilizing food prices across europe needs to be a top priority , europe 's agriculture ministers agree .
the hard part will be deciding how to best reform the system . current european union agricultural policy encourages farmers to keep land fallow , a practice that seems to contradict the rising global demand for food .
the eu seems likely to acknowledge it needs to put more land into production when it announces agricultural reforms on tuesday , may 20 .
one solution would be for the eu to phase out its program of paying farmers to keep farmland out of production , hoping that it will help stabilize food prices .
" i think it 's important that we continue to increase production in europe as much as we can within the natural limits , also taking into account environmental care , " agriculture and rural development commissioner mariann fischer boel told the dpa news agency .
fischer boel spent monday with eu agriculture ministers in brussels outlining her proposals to reform the bloc 's common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- .
yet the road to reforming the cap is likely to be long and riddled with obstacles .
even the relatively modest changes boel has proposed to direct farm subsidies are likely to be met with fierce resistance , particularly from france , which is the biggest recipient of agricultural aid .
britain calls for liberalization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer boel wants to increase production of some crops britain and some other member states would like to see the eu go even further in reforming its subsidies .
britain 's finance minister , alistair darling , called for europe to fundamentally reform its agricultural policy .
britain has argued that the current food crisis shows the need to liberalize laws .
all elements that keep prices above world market levels should be phased out , darling said last week .
those measures cost eu consumers 43 billion euros -lrb- $ 67 billion -rrb- in 2006 , he said .
darling also said he wants the eu to stop direct payments to farmers , which he said cost taxpayers an additional 34 billion euros in 2006 .
" barriers and distortions in the global food market increase volatility and stifle the incentives to increase supply to match demand , " he argued .
germany wants farmers protected slovenian agriculture minister iztok jarc , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , refused to comment on britain 's position , saying only that " there are many reasons for high food prices , so i would n't make a direct connection to the cap . "
" we do n't only have a problem with food prices , we also have the problem of climate change and high energy prices .
it 's a combination of all factors , " he said .
germany and france are against liberalization .
they say the current upswing in food prices show the importance of not liberalizing too much .
germany 's agriculture minister , horst seehofer , argues that " we have to make sure that we can provide this continent with food sustainability .
this can not be done by taking away subsidies from european farmers . "
long road ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposed changes could bring protests from farmers besides no longer paying farmers to leave land fallow , the eu proposals also call for phasing out quotas on milk production .
some observers have also guessed the eu will propose ending the extra bonuses given to farmers who grow crops which can be converted into fuel .
while fischer boel said she wants to see more money go towards environmental projects and less towards direct subsidy payments , she backed away from an earlier suggestion that subsidies to larger farms be capped .
that caused an outcry from germany and britain .
global food prices have nearly doubled in three years , according to the world bank .
the situation in developing countries has been of particular concern since higher costs have sparked riots and restrictions on food exports .
the cap proposals will go to eu member states and the european parliament for consideration in the second half of 2008 , during france 's eu presidency .
massive subsidies remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france is the biggest recipient of agricultural subsidies although food prices have eased somewhat in recent weeks , they remain at near record levels , with wheat up 84 percent over one year ago , corn up 21 percent , butter up 21 percent and eggs up 17 percent .
cost increases have a variety of causes including biofuel , trade constraints , increased demand from asia to serve changing diets , poor harvests and increasing transport costs .
if the cap reforms succeed in putting more land into production , it would be a reversal of past reform efforts , which have tried to reign in production .
in 2003 , the eu tried to discourage overproduction by " decoupling " subsidies from production .
despite reforms , farm hand-outs still make up 40 percent of the eu budget , by far the bloc 's biggest spending item . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the hard part will be deciding how to best reform the system . current european union agricultural policy encourages farmers to keep land fallow , a practice that seems to contradict the rising global demand for food .
the eu seems likely to acknowledge it needs to put more land into production when it announces agricultural reforms on tuesday , may 20 .
one solution would be for the eu to phase out its program of paying farmers to keep farmland out of production , hoping that it will help stabilize food prices .
" i think it 's important that we continue to increase production in europe as much as we can within the natural limits , also taking into account environmental care , " agriculture and rural development commissioner mariann fischer boel told the dpa news agency .
fischer boel spent monday with eu agriculture ministers in brussels outlining her proposals to reform the bloc 's common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- .
yet the road to reforming the cap is likely to be long and riddled with obstacles .
even the relatively modest changes boel has proposed to direct farm subsidies are likely to be met with fierce resistance , particularly from france , which is the biggest recipient of agricultural aid .
britain calls for liberalization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer boel wants to increase production of some crops britain and some other member states would like to see the eu go even further in reforming its subsidies .
britain 's finance minister , alistair darling , called for europe to fundamentally reform its agricultural policy .
britain has argued that the current food crisis shows the need to liberalize laws .
all elements that keep prices above world market levels should be phased out , darling said last week .
those measures cost eu consumers 43 billion euros -lrb- $ 67 billion -rrb- in 2006 , he said .
darling also said he wants the eu to stop direct payments to farmers , which he said cost taxpayers an additional 34 billion euros in 2006 .
" barriers and distortions in the global food market increase volatility and stifle the incentives to increase supply to match demand , " he argued .
germany wants farmers protected slovenian agriculture minister iztok jarc , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , refused to comment on britain 's position , saying only that " there are many reasons for high food prices , so i would n't make a direct connection to the cap . "
" we do n't only have a problem with food prices , we also have the problem of climate change and high energy prices .
it 's a combination of all factors , " he said .
germany and france are against liberalization .
they say the current upswing in food prices show the importance of not liberalizing too much .
germany 's agriculture minister , horst seehofer , argues that " we have to make sure that we can provide this continent with food sustainability .
this can not be done by taking away subsidies from european farmers . "
long road ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposed changes could bring protests from farmers besides no longer paying farmers to leave land fallow , the eu proposals also call for phasing out quotas on milk production .
some observers have also guessed the eu will propose ending the extra bonuses given to farmers who grow crops which can be converted into fuel .
while fischer boel said she wants to see more money go towards environmental projects and less towards direct subsidy payments , she backed away from an earlier suggestion that subsidies to larger farms be capped .
that caused an outcry from germany and britain .
global food prices have nearly doubled in three years , according to the world bank .
the situation in developing countries has been of particular concern since higher costs have sparked riots and restrictions on food exports .
the cap proposals will go to eu member states and the european parliament for consideration in the second half of 2008 , during france 's eu presidency .
massive subsidies remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france is the biggest recipient of agricultural subsidies although food prices have eased somewhat in recent weeks , they remain at near record levels , with wheat up 84 percent over one year ago , corn up 21 percent , butter up 21 percent and eggs up 17 percent .
cost increases have a variety of causes including biofuel , trade constraints , increased demand from asia to serve changing diets , poor harvests and increasing transport costs .
if the cap reforms succeed in putting more land into production , it would be a reversal of past reform efforts , which have tried to reign in production .
in 2003 , the eu tried to discourage overproduction by " decoupling " subsidies from production .

the hard part will be deciding how to best reform the system . current european union agricultural policy encourages farmers to keep land fallow , a practice that seems to contradict the rising global demand for food .
the eu seems likely to acknowledge it needs to put more land into production when it announces agricultural reforms on tuesday , may 20 .
one solution would be for the eu to phase out its program of paying farmers to keep farmland out of production , hoping that it will help stabilize food prices .
" i think it 's important that we continue to increase production in europe as much as we can within the natural limits , also taking into account environmental care , " agriculture and rural development commissioner mariann fischer boel told the dpa news agency .
fischer boel spent monday with eu agriculture ministers in brussels outlining her proposals to reform the bloc 's common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- .
yet the road to reforming the cap is likely to be long and riddled with obstacles .
even the relatively modest changes boel has proposed to direct farm subsidies are likely to be met with fierce resistance , particularly from france , which is the biggest recipient of agricultural aid .
britain calls for liberalization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer boel wants to increase production of some crops britain and some other member states would like to see the eu go even further in reforming its subsidies .
britain 's finance minister , alistair darling , called for europe to fundamentally reform its agricultural policy .
britain has argued that the current food crisis shows the need to liberalize laws .
all elements that keep prices above world market levels should be phased out , darling said last week .
those measures cost eu consumers 43 billion euros -lrb- $ 67 billion -rrb- in 2006 , he said .
darling also said he wants the eu to stop direct payments to farmers , which he said cost taxpayers an additional 34 billion euros in 2006 .
" barriers and distortions in the global food market increase volatility and stifle the incentives to increase supply to match demand , " he argued .
germany wants farmers protected slovenian agriculture minister iztok jarc , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , refused to comment on britain 's position , saying only that " there are many reasons for high food prices , so i would n't make a direct connection to the cap . "
" we do n't only have a problem with food prices , we also have the problem of climate change and high energy prices .
it 's a combination of all factors , " he said .
germany and france are against liberalization .
they say the current upswing in food prices show the importance of not liberalizing too much .
germany 's agriculture minister , horst seehofer , argues that " we have to make sure that we can provide this continent with food sustainability .
this can not be done by taking away subsidies from european farmers . "
long road ahead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the proposed changes could bring protests from farmers besides no longer paying farmers to leave land fallow , the eu proposals also call for phasing out quotas on milk production .
some observers have also guessed the eu will propose ending the extra bonuses given to farmers who grow crops which can be converted into fuel .
while fischer boel said she wants to see more money go towards environmental projects and less towards direct subsidy payments , she backed away from an earlier suggestion that subsidies to larger farms be capped .
that caused an outcry from germany and britain .
global food prices have nearly doubled in three years , according to the world bank .
the situation in developing countries has been of particular concern since higher costs have sparked riots and restrictions on food exports .
the cap proposals will go to eu member states and the european parliament for consideration in the second half of 2008 , during france 's eu presidency .
massive subsidies remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france is the biggest recipient of agricultural subsidies although food prices have eased somewhat in recent weeks , they remain at near record levels , with wheat up 84 percent over one year ago , corn up 21 percent , butter up 21 percent and eggs up 17 percent .
cost increases have a variety of causes including biofuel , trade constraints , increased demand from asia to serve changing diets , poor harvests and increasing transport costs .
if the cap reforms succeed in putting more land into production , it would be a reversal of past reform efforts , which have tried to reign in production .
in 2003 , the eu tried to discourage overproduction by " decoupling " subsidies from production .
despite reforms , farm hand-outs still make up 40 percent of the eu budget , by far the bloc 's biggest spending item . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on may 8 , the date commemorating the unconditional surrender of nazi germany to the allies - or ve day - a government appeals committee that deals with matters pertaining to the holocaust victims ' law and decided to grant jews who lived under curfew during world war ii the same compensation rights as other holocaust victims .
according to the holocaust victim 's law , those who lived under nazi rule and were " deprived of their freedom " are entitled to receive remuneration from the german government .
three years ago , the supreme court ruled that bulgarian jews who were expelled from their homes would be entitled to compensation , but those who rather lived under military-imposed curfews were deemed ineligible for this benefit .
the committee , after receiving a petition submitted from 109 bulgarian and romanian holocaust victims who were forced to live in restricted conditions but were not expelled from their homes , reversed the previous decision , thereby rendering the victims eligible .
in 1941 in bulgaria the " national defense law " was enacted , containing various provisions which restricted the freedom of movement of jews .
under the law , jews who remained were obligated to change their place of residence , and were concentrated into special quarters in cities and forbidden from leaving their homes .
the restrictions lasted for two years .

on may 8 , the date commemorating the unconditional surrender of nazi germany to the allies - or ve day - a government appeals committee that deals with matters pertaining to the holocaust victims ' law and decided to grant jews who lived under curfew during world war ii the same compensation rights as other holocaust victims .
according to the holocaust victim 's law , those who lived under nazi rule and were " deprived of their freedom " are entitled to receive remuneration from the german government .
three years ago , the supreme court ruled that bulgarian jews who were expelled from their homes would be entitled to compensation , but those who rather lived under military-imposed curfews were deemed ineligible for this benefit .
the committee , after receiving a petition submitted from 109 bulgarian and romanian holocaust victims who were forced to live in restricted conditions but were not expelled from their homes , reversed the previous decision , thereby rendering the victims eligible .
in 1941 in bulgaria the " national defense law " was enacted , containing various provisions which restricted the freedom of movement of jews .
under the law , jews who remained were obligated to change their place of residence , and were concentrated into special quarters in cities and forbidden from leaving their homes .
the restrictions lasted for two years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 20.05.2008 landmark trial pushed germany to tackle nazi past großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defendants lived normal lives in the midst of german society for years fifty years ago , a trial against 10 members of a nazi commando in the city of ulm , changed the way west germany dealt with its fascist past and crack down on crimes committed by the nazis . from july 28 to august 29 , 1958 , 10 men from a special nazi commando , " tilsit , " went on trial in the west german city of ulm in the state of baden-wuerttemberg .
the so-called ulm einsatzgruppen trial , one of the largest in a west german court that centered on the mass murder of jews , accused the men , gestapo and ss members , of killing more than 5,000 jewish men , women and children in lithuania .
the proceedings revealed gruesome crimes and showed that many of the perpetrators continued to live normal lives in west germany for years after the war , their murderous campaign largely undetected .
the trial is considered a major break with how germany dealt with its nazi past until then .
dw-world.de spoke to dieter pohl , a historian and lecturer at the institute for contemporary history in munich , about the historic trial 50 years ago .
dw-world.de : the ulm einsatzgruppen trial is considered a turning point in how germany dealt with its nazi past .
why is that ?
dieter pohl : the bulk of the nazi war crime trials took place right after 1945 .
basically , from 1945 to 1949 , there were parallel allied tribunals and german courts .
the german courts largely dealt with crimes committed against german citizens ; the allied courts dealt with all others , which meant the majority of nazi crimes .
these proceedings petered out by the end of the 1940s and early 1950s largely because west german society suppressed the past and preferred not to talk about it .
nazi crimes hardly found mention in public discourse in the early 1950s . thus the ulm trial in 1958 marked the reopening of criminal proceedings against nazi criminals .
it was seen as a sign that the west german judicial system was taking the nazi past more seriously . but the most striking thing about the ulm trial was that it made clear that nazi atrocities were not just committed within the third reich but largely in eastern europe .
the 10 defendants in the ulm trial stood accused of murdering more than 5,000 jewish men , women and children .
who were these men ?
were they cold-blooded killers or just " ordinary men " ?
no , they certainly were n't average germans .
they were members of the gestapo in tilsit -lsb- editor 's note : the now russian town of sovetsk -rsb- on the northeastern tip of the third reich , some were even long-time ss members .
they were largely career policemen , people who usually joined the crime force and then went on to join the gestapo during the 1930s .
usually the leading personnel involved die-hard nazis - people who joined the nsdap relatively early , actively supported the nazi ideology and cracked down on the opponents of the ideology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the dock - some of the defendants in the ulm trial right after the wehrmacht 's invasion of the soviet union on june 22 , 1941 , the gestapo tilsit followed with small commandos , entered western lithuanian territory and began shooting jews .
this was where the first mass murder of jews in the so-called " final solution " took place on june 24 , 1941 , just two days after the beginning of the german campaign in the town of garsden .
the commandos largely targeted young jewish men old enough to join the army ; women and children were only killed in exceptions .
the crimes set the stage for what followed in the entire occupied soviet union over the next two years - large massacres of jewish communities with all the brutalities that went with it .
how did the ulm trial come about ? actually due to sheer coincidence .
one of the main defendants , bernhard fischer-schweder , the police chief in memel , lithuania , in 1941 and involved in the murder of thousands of jews , assumed a false name after 1945 and was appointed director of a refugee shelter near ulm in 1955 .
he was fired when his past came to light .
when he was refused another public sector job , fischer-schweder filed a lawsuit in a labor court .
a survivor of fischer-schweder 's murderous campaign in lithuania came across a newspaper article about the court case and identified him , revealing details about his past .
that provided the trigger for the trial .
unfortunately , most cases against nazi criminals at the time came into being this way .
a surviving victim usually happened to discover a perpetrator and then filed a lawsuit against him .
what kind of an atmosphere did the trial take place in ?
how was it viewed by the west germans and the justice system ?
the trial came at a time when much of the german population simply wanted to draw a line under the past .
after several years of allied rule and a constant focus on the nazi past , most people simply did n't want to hear about it anymore .
the judicial system in germany was partly shocked to see that severely incriminated perpetrators of nazi crimes had managed to get away without facing any criminal proceedings .
it was largely the then state prosecutor of baden-wuerttemberg , erwin schuele , who personally fought for the trial to take place .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nuremberg war crimes trials in 1945 are well known but at the same time , germany 's judicial system in the 1950s was n't particularly interested in pursuing nazi crimes .
that had partly to do with the nazi-weary mentality of the time .
another major reason for the reluctance to crack down on nazi abuses was that there were quite a few lawyers and state prosecutors who had previously been members of the nazi party .
the presence of so many former nazis in the german judicial system gathered force in the 1950s , because many who underwent denazification and were dismissed from public service earlier reentered the system in the early 1950s .
yet ulm did command immense media attention in the federal republic of germany .
it was n't the first trial of its kind but it was certainly the most elaborate and most publicized of the time .
usually , with the exception of the big nazi war crime trials in allied tribunals , only a few regional and local papers reported about such cases .
in the 1950s especially , such trials hardly sparked any nationwide attention .
the defendants in the ulm trial were given relatively light prison sentences of between three and 15 years . why was that ?
the main problem that plagued all nazi war crime trials right up to the 1980s was the development of the so-called " accessory to murder " construct .
normally , a murderer is punished with a life sentence .
but most of the courts accepted that the main perpetrators of the mass murder of jews were the nazi leadership - hitler , himmler and others .
all the others were thus not considered murderers who killed jews out of a deep sense of personal motivation but rather simply helpers who aided in the crime .
that 's why the majority of nazi criminals were sentenced for being an accessory to murder .
it was only in cases where it could be proven that someone had committed crimes out of a sense of personal conviction that a life sentence was issued .
this strategy was strongly criticized in the 1960s and also proved to be wrong , because the courts were largely dealing with committed nazis and anti-semites .
another reason was that it was difficult to reconstruct crimes committed 10 or 12 years previously and build up cases with the help of eye witnesses that would eventually lead to court proceedings .
but the biggest problem was that the majority of the german population was simply not interested in tackling the past , and the authorities lacked the will to pursue people who committed atrocities under the nazis .
how were the sentences received in germany and abroad ?
there was certainly a resonance in the us and in israel , and i imagine there may have been some disappointments , particularly among jews .
in germany , reaction was divided because a liberal segment in society was deeply interested in the trial in the late 1950s and followed it critically .
but the majority of the german population at the time simply did n't want anything to do with it .
it 's true , the sentences in the ulm trial were very light .
there is hardly any person accused of crimes under the nazis who served out the entirety of the sentence issued in the federal republic of germany .
what effect did the ulm einsatzgruppen trial have on west germany 's efforts to bring nazi war criminals to justice ?
one of the most important and immediate political fall-outs of the ulm trial was that justice ministers in west germany , spurred on by the realization that many grave nazi crimes in eastern europe were left uninvestigated , completely reversed the existing investigation procedure .
they no longer relied on coincidences to bring nazi crimes to light but rather on systematically investigating them .
that was the immediate trigger for the establishment of a unique central authority in ludwigsburg to compile , coordinate and investigate all types of crimes committed under the nazis .
beyond that , the ulm trial was only a brief shock for the german population .
the real jolt came with the adolf eichmann arrest and trial and the auschwitz trial in frankfurt in 1963 .
the general awareness in the german population that most nazi crimes were committed in eastern europe and that the murderers live among us in society only sank in later . interview : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

tourism minister rhodri glyn thomas blamed the drop on the rain-hit summer of 2007 , the strength of the pound , and success in the previous two years .
operators said the 2007 season had begun well , but they struggled as the weather failed to improve .
experts are carrying out an analysis of the welsh tourism industry and an action plan will be drawn up .
we had a fantastic start to 2007 in march and april , but we did n't realise that would be our summer chris osborne , hotelier visitor figures dropped from 9.61m in 2006 to 8.85m in 2007 .
mr thomas said the figures bore out some of the anecdotal feedback from the industry .
he has asked the wales tourism alliance for its co-operation in commissioning an analysis of the industry .
mr thomas said he wanted " a deeper understanding of its current and developing needs and then to draw up an action plan designed to improve wales ' competitive position where possible " .
the minister said the current economic climate was a cause of concern - but it could work to the benefit of welsh tourism as people might choose to holiday in the uk instead .
he added : " finally , although these figures are disappointing , our five-wave surveys of the industry throughout the year show that the level of general confidence is high and that there is a will to succeed ... "
quieter but positive feeling in ceredigion taking the tourism temperature in aberaeron rachel hicks , chief executive of pembrokeshire tourism , said 2007 started well , but after april it was a different story .
its survey of businesses in july 2007 showed that 83 % reported bookings were down on 2006 , 10 % remained the same and 7 % showed a small increase .
floods hit she said : " booking patterns changed in 2007 .
according to our survey businesses in pembrokeshire found that visitors were booking for three days and not a full week .
" overall the north of pembrokeshire , especially st davids and newport , were less affected .
however , many businesses reported brisk business in september . "
chris osborne , owner of the fourcroft hotel in tenby , said : " we had a fantastic start to 2007 in march and april , but we did n't realise that would be our summer .
" we found that the floods in england hit our target market , the west midlands , and so we experienced much lower visitor numbers than normal . "
dewi davies , director of tourism partnership north wales , said : " the weather was tough , there 's no doubt about that .
and we have been struggling with the pound being so strong against other currencies . "
budgets for marketing campaigns were very important to attract families to wales who live relatively close , such as manchester , birmingham and liverpool .
" the right amount of funds for us to market - that 's an important part and we need to continue to focus on family and short breaks , " he added .

this is an industry that is changing our way of life and if it does not take these challenges upon themselves to be more green we are going to be in deep trouble very , very soon zeina al-hajj , greenpeace " we were shocked with nintendo ; it was our biggest surprise . "
nintendo is ranked at the bottom of greenpeace 's global assessment of " green " technology companies .
" recently they added a list of certain commitments they have , which purely comply with legislation , " said ms al-hajj .
the organisation has called on all technology firms to take immediate action to eliminate toxic chemicals from products .
the report found that the ps3 and 360 both contained " very high " levels of chemicals , called phthalates , which are used to " soften " flexible materials like wires and cable coatings .
they are not permitted in toys sold in europe but under eu regulations games consoles are not classed as toys .
ms al-hajj said : " we see a gap there .
for us this is still a toy .
" and whether or not it 's a toy , we do not want these chemicals in our products . "
the report found that all three consoles contained varying levels of the toxic element bromine , which is used as a flame retardant .
the presence of beryllium was found in both the ps3 and xbox 360 .
the element is not banned under eu law but it has been linked to lung cancer when dust and fumes are created through some recycling processes .
a nintendo spokesman told bbc news : " we fully comply with all the necessary eu directives on the restriction of hazardous substances aimed at environmental protection and consumer health and safety .
" furthermore , in order to ensure our products are safe for use by young children we also take into consideration the standards applicable to toys . "
according to the united nations environment programme 50 tonnes of hazardous e-waste is generated every year .
greenpeace said it was concerned that there was no " safe way " to dispose of old consoles and called on games console makers to introduce return and recycle policies .
a spokesman for sony said the firm had joined with other companies , braun , hp and electrolux , to establish the european recycling platform .
the consoles were dismantled at greenpeace research labs at exeter university microsoft has committed to eliminating the use of polyvinyl chloride -lrb- pvc -rrb- , which includes phthalates , and brominated flame retardants -lrb- bfr -rrb- by 2010 .
nintendo has also committed to removing pvc from future products , but has not given a specific timeframe .
the nintendo spokesman said : " we have endeavoured to eliminate the use of pvc by replacing it with other materials and other methods .
" however , we continue to use pvc in certain products such as ac adaptors , within the scope of regulations from the viewpoint of ensuring safety . "
greenpeace criticised sony for failing to agree to eliminate pvc and bfr from its games consoles , while at the same time pledging their removal from its mobile products .
ms al-hajj said : " sony has a very good record in our ranking guide .
they have committed to eliminating these chemicals from mobile devices .
" but why are we finding them in such high percentages in a console ?
this is a tool used by children in our homes .
" none of these chemicals exist in sony 's vaio laptop .
so if they can do it for a laptop , why ca n't they push this for the console also ? "
a spokesman for sony told bbc news that the company would eliminate pvc and bfr from all of its products " as and when we are satisfied that we can produce products of equal sony quality in all regards using new alternative materials " .
ms al-hajj said the electronics industry needed take more responsibility .
" this is one of the most innovative industries we have on the planet .
" this is an industry that is changing our way of life and if it does not take these challenges upon themselves to be more green , we are going to be in deep trouble very , very soon .
" it is not enough just to comply with the law for such an industry . "
she said the european union 's restriction of hazardous substances -lrb- rohs -rrb- directive was not strong enough .
" rohs is not enough now to control the electronics industry .
" if they are pushed to putting the environment as the priority the electronics industries will come up with alternatives because they are technically capable . "
no-one from microsoft was available for comment on the findings of the greenpeace report .

the consoles were dismantled at greenpeace research labs at exeter university microsoft has committed to eliminating the use of polyvinyl chloride -lrb- pvc -rrb- , which includes phthalates , and brominated flame retardants -lrb- bfr -rrb- by 2010 .
nintendo has also committed to removing pvc from future products , but has not given a specific timeframe .
the nintendo spokesman said : " we have endeavoured to eliminate the use of pvc by replacing it with other materials and other methods .
" however , we continue to use pvc in certain products such as ac adaptors , within the scope of regulations from the viewpoint of ensuring safety . "
greenpeace criticised sony for failing to agree to eliminate pvc and bfr from its games consoles , while at the same time pledging their removal from its mobile products .
ms al-hajj said : " sony has a very good record in our ranking guide .
they have committed to eliminating these chemicals from mobile devices .
" but why are we finding them in such high percentages in a console ?
this is a tool used by children in our homes .
" none of these chemicals exist in sony 's vaio laptop .
so if they can do it for a laptop , why ca n't they push this for the console also ? "
a spokesman for sony told bbc news that the company would eliminate pvc and bfr from all of its products " as and when we are satisfied that we can produce products of equal sony quality in all regards using new alternative materials " .
ms al-hajj said the electronics industry needed take more responsibility .
" this is one of the most innovative industries we have on the planet .
" this is an industry that is changing our way of life and if it does not take these challenges upon themselves to be more green , we are going to be in deep trouble very , very soon .
" it is not enough just to comply with the law for such an industry . "
she said the european union 's restriction of hazardous substances -lrb- rohs -rrb- directive was not strong enough .
" rohs is not enough now to control the electronics industry .
" if they are pushed to putting the environment as the priority the electronics industries will come up with alternatives because they are technically capable . "

the body examined materials used inside the sony playstation 3 -lrb- ps3 -rrb- , microsoft xbox 360 and nintendo wii .
greenpeace said that while all three machines complied with european laws , the consoles still contained harmful materials that " needed to be replaced " .
nintendo 's environment policies were " non-existent " , greenpeace added .
" nintendo does n't have any environmental policies , " said zeina al-hajj , greenpeace 's international toxic campaign co-ordinator .

the organisation has called on all technology firms to take immediate action to eliminate toxic chemicals from products .
the report found that the ps3 and 360 both contained " very high " levels of chemicals , called phthalates , which are used to " soften " flexible materials like wires and cable coatings .

ms al-hajj said : " we see a gap there .

" and whether or not it 's a toy , we do not want these chemicals in our products . "
the report found that all three consoles contained varying levels of the toxic element bromine , which is used as a flame retardant .
the presence of beryllium was found in both the ps3 and xbox 360 .
the element is not banned under eu law but it has been linked to lung cancer when dust and fumes are created through some recycling processes .
a nintendo spokesman told bbc news : " we fully comply with all the necessary eu directives on the restriction of hazardous substances aimed at environmental protection and consumer health and safety .

australian scientists extracted genetic material from a 100-year-old museum specimen , and put it into a mouse embryo to study how it worked .
it is the first time dna of an extinct species has been used in this way , says a university of melbourne team .
the study , published online by the public library of science -lrb- plos -rrb- , suggests the marsupial 's genetic biodiversity may not be lost .
dr andrew pask , of the department of zoology , who led the research , said it was the first time that dna from an extinct species had been used to carry out a function in a living organism .
" as more and more species of animals become extinct , we are continuing to lose critical knowledge of gene function and its potential , " he said .
" up until now we have only been able to examine gene sequences from extinct animals .
this research was developed to go one step further to examine extinct gene function in a whole organism . "
genetic heritage the tasmanian tiger was hunted to extinction in the wild in the early 1900s .
the last known specimen died in captivity in 1936 , but several museums around the world still hold tissue samples preserved in alcohol .
the tasmanian tiger was the world 's largest carnivorous marsupial the university of melbourne team extracted dna from some of these specimens , and injected a gene involved in cartilage formation into developing mouse embryos .
the dna functioned in a similar way to the equivalent gene in mice , giving information about the genetic make-up of the extinct marsupial .
" at a time when extinction rates are increasing at an alarming rate , especially of mammals , this research discovery is critical , " said professor marilyn renfree , also of the university of melbourne 's department of zoology .
" for those species that have already become extinct , our method shows that access to their genetic biodiversity may not be completely lost . "
frozen ark prof david rawson , who was not part of the research team , said the work gave a glimpse of an aspect of an organism that we no longer have .
" we only get a glimpse ; we only see a tiny part of the whole picture , " he said .
prof rawson said the dna came from a species that only recently died out , and for which there are samples preserved in alcohol .
going further back in time will be more difficult , he added .
" to go back to animals and plants that went extinct thousands of years ago , there is less chance to get a sizeable portion of dna to unravel it , " he explained .
" but modern techniques are developing all the time - we can now get information from material we once thought was impossible . "
some researchers think the method could help reveal the function of genes in species such as the neanderthals or mammoths .
prof rawson , of the lirans institute of research at the university of bedfordshire , uk , is one of several uk experts involved in the frozen ark , a global project to preserve genetic information from a range of threatened species .
full details of the australian study are published in the open-access journal plos one .

australian scientists extracted genetic material from a 100-year-old museum specimen , and put it into a mouse embryo to study how it worked .
it is the first time dna of an extinct species has been used in this way , says a university of melbourne team .
the study , published online by the public library of science -lrb- plos -rrb- , suggests the marsupial 's genetic biodiversity may not be lost .
dr andrew pask , of the department of zoology , who led the research , said it was the first time that dna from an extinct species had been used to carry out a function in a living organism .
" as more and more species of animals become extinct , we are continuing to lose critical knowledge of gene function and its potential , " he said .
" up until now we have only been able to examine gene sequences from extinct animals .
this research was developed to go one step further to examine extinct gene function in a whole organism . "
genetic heritage the tasmanian tiger was hunted to extinction in the wild in the early 1900s .
the last known specimen died in captivity in 1936 , but several museums around the world still hold tissue samples preserved in alcohol .
the tasmanian tiger was the world 's largest carnivorous marsupial the university of melbourne team extracted dna from some of these specimens , and injected a gene involved in cartilage formation into developing mouse embryos .
the dna functioned in a similar way to the equivalent gene in mice , giving information about the genetic make-up of the extinct marsupial .
" at a time when extinction rates are increasing at an alarming rate , especially of mammals , this research discovery is critical , " said professor marilyn renfree , also of the university of melbourne 's department of zoology .
" for those species that have already become extinct , our method shows that access to their genetic biodiversity may not be completely lost . "
frozen ark prof david rawson , who was not part of the research team , said the work gave a glimpse of an aspect of an organism that we no longer have .
" we only get a glimpse ; we only see a tiny part of the whole picture , " he said .
prof rawson said the dna came from a species that only recently died out , and for which there are samples preserved in alcohol .
going further back in time will be more difficult , he added .
" to go back to animals and plants that went extinct thousands of years ago , there is less chance to get a sizeable portion of dna to unravel it , " he explained .
" but modern techniques are developing all the time - we can now get information from material we once thought was impossible . "
some researchers think the method could help reveal the function of genes in species such as the neanderthals or mammoths .
prof rawson , of the lirans institute of research at the university of bedfordshire , uk , is one of several uk experts involved in the frozen ark , a global project to preserve genetic information from a range of threatened species .

the plans , reported in the times , are at an early stage and may be included in the draft communications bill later this year , the home office confirmed .
a home office spokesman said the data was a " crucial tool " for protecting national security and preventing crime .
ministers have not seen the plans which were drawn up by home office officials .
a home office spokesman said : " the communications data bill will help ensure that crucial capabilities in the use of communications data for counter-terrorism and investigation of crime continue to be available .
" these powers will continue to be subject to strict safeguards to ensure the right balance between privacy and protecting the public . "
" given the appalling track record of data loss , this state is simply not to be trusted with such private information " chris huhne lib dems the spokesman said changes need to be made to the regulation of investigatory powers act 2000 " to ensure that public authorities can continue to obtain and have access to communications data essential for counter-terrorism and investigation of crime purposes " .
but the information commission , an independent authority set up to protect personal information , said the database " may well be a step too far " and highlighted the risk of data being lost , traded or stolen .
assistant information commissioner jonathan bamford said : " we are not aware of any justification for the state to hold every uk citizen 's phone and internet records .
we have real doubts that such a measure can be justified , or is proportionate or desirable .
" defeating crime and terrorism is of the utmost importance , but we are not aware of any pressing need to justify the government itself holding this sort of data . "
' appalling record ' a number of data protection failures in recent months , including the loss of a cd carrying the personal details of every child benefit claimant , have embarrassed the government .
the plans also prompted concern from political groups .
the shadow home secretary , david davis , said : " given -lsb- ministers ' -rsb- appalling record at maintaining the integrity of databases holding people 's sensitive data , this could well be more of a threat to our security than a support . "
liberal democrat home affairs spokesman chris huhne called the proposals " an orwellian step too far " .
he said ministers had " taken leave of their senses if they think that this proposal is compatible with a free country and a free people " .

the plans , reported in the times , are at an early stage and may be included in the draft communications bill later this year , the home office confirmed .
a home office spokesman said the data was a " crucial tool " for protecting national security and preventing crime .
ministers have not seen the plans which were drawn up by home office officials .
a home office spokesman said : " the communications data bill will help ensure that crucial capabilities in the use of communications data for counter-terrorism and investigation of crime continue to be available .
