while plans for an eu common defence policy are still at the embryonic stage , the bloc has already deployed peacekeepers to bosnia-herzegovina and chad and is training policemen in afghanistan and the western balkans .
georgia on friday joined the list of countries seeking help from brussels in training its security forces .
much of the discussions , however , are likely to focus on the eu-lex law mission in kosovo , which was originally meant to take over the administration of the newly-independent country from the united nations on june 15 .
eu officials now concede that legal and logistical difficulties mean that deadline is unrealistic .
while the mission 's overall goal " has not changed , " ministers are unlikely to commit themselves to a new date , sources from the slovenian presidency of the eu said .
tuesday 's discussions will turn to development and aid issues amid calls from the european commission for governments to commit more funds and demands for help from china and myanmar .
ministers are likely to reaffirm their " serious concern " about the violence and irregularities that have marred elections in zimbabwe , where a run-off vote for the presidency is due to take place on june 27 , nearly three months after the first round of voting took place .
the meeting 's overall objective is to prepare the groundwork for the regular summer gathering of eu heads of government and state , due to take place june 19-20 .
poland calls for an eastern alliance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland wants an eastern version of sarkozy 's club med at their last summit , eu leaders backed french calls to revamp their relations with their southern neighbors through the creation of a union for the mediterranean .
but poland insisted at the time that the eu should also forge closer ties to the east .
those polish calls have now developed into a proposed eastern partnership .
backed by sweden and blessed by heavyweights france and germany , the eastern partnership would seek to negotiate visa-free travel and create free-trade zones with ukraine , moldova , georgia , armenia and azerbaijan .
poland and sweden argue that their initiative will help steer ukraine away from moscow and closer to the west .
since it will not cost more money and will not create more bureaucracy , they are optimistic that it can enjoy the backing of other member states .
the european commission has not been consulted and says it is eager to hear from warsaw and stockholm .
at the same time , officials in brussels note that just as with french president nicolas sarkozy 's plan for a mediterranean union , the eastern partnership would only be given serious consideration if it can provide " added value " and avoid duplication in its structures .
russia deal likely to be formally agreed upon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia and the eu have been facing off of late during their meeting , the eu 's foreign ministers are expected to give their formal backing to the launch of long-awaited talks on a strategic deal with russia .
a breakthrough on the issue was obtained by eu ambassadors on wednesday , after lithuania agreed to withdraw its veto in protest at russia 's closure of the main oil pipeline into lithuania , its treatment of georgia and its refusal to hand over men suspected of committing atrocities in lithuania in 1991 .
while the launch of talks is due to be agreed by ministers without discussion , eu diplomats warn that that deal is not yet in the bag .
" we 've seen a lot of surprises on this issue during the last years , " one official said .

while plans for an eu common defence policy are still at the embryonic stage , the bloc has already deployed peacekeepers to bosnia-herzegovina and chad and is training policemen in afghanistan and the western balkans .
georgia on friday joined the list of countries seeking help from brussels in training its security forces .
much of the discussions , however , are likely to focus on the eu-lex law mission in kosovo , which was originally meant to take over the administration of the newly-independent country from the united nations on june 15 .
eu officials now concede that legal and logistical difficulties mean that deadline is unrealistic .
while the mission 's overall goal " has not changed , " ministers are unlikely to commit themselves to a new date , sources from the slovenian presidency of the eu said .
tuesday 's discussions will turn to development and aid issues amid calls from the european commission for governments to commit more funds and demands for help from china and myanmar .
ministers are likely to reaffirm their " serious concern " about the violence and irregularities that have marred elections in zimbabwe , where a run-off vote for the presidency is due to take place on june 27 , nearly three months after the first round of voting took place .
the meeting 's overall objective is to prepare the groundwork for the regular summer gathering of eu heads of government and state , due to take place june 19-20 .
poland calls for an eastern alliance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland wants an eastern version of sarkozy 's club med at their last summit , eu leaders backed french calls to revamp their relations with their southern neighbors through the creation of a union for the mediterranean .
but poland insisted at the time that the eu should also forge closer ties to the east .
those polish calls have now developed into a proposed eastern partnership .
backed by sweden and blessed by heavyweights france and germany , the eastern partnership would seek to negotiate visa-free travel and create free-trade zones with ukraine , moldova , georgia , armenia and azerbaijan .
poland and sweden argue that their initiative will help steer ukraine away from moscow and closer to the west .
since it will not cost more money and will not create more bureaucracy , they are optimistic that it can enjoy the backing of other member states .
the european commission has not been consulted and says it is eager to hear from warsaw and stockholm .

those who dare to criticize often come under enormous pressure , says milan-based journalist kirstin hausen . television host fabio fazio knew what he was getting into when he invited journalist marco travaglio to be a guest on his show .
travaglio does n't mince words , especially when it comes to criticizing italian politicians .
over the years , travaglio has gained the reputation of being italy 's most outspoken journalist .
on fazio 's show , he spoke openly about a topic that everyone more or less knew about , but which had n't been openly discussed : the past mafia connections of current senate president renato schifani .
the fact that travaglio dared to speak openly about the subject caused a furor in italy , with schifani threatening to sue for slander , a common weapon used against outspoken journalists in italy .
many journalists steer clear of criticism even during the live television interview , host fabio fazio distanced himself from the accusations .
he looked into the camera , an embarrassed expression on his face , and apologized to newly re-elected premier and media magnate silvio berlusconi .
berlusconi is not a fan of airing such uncomfortable truths about his party supporters , yet politicians from other parties also have taken to ranting daily in talk shows and newspapers on the topic .
the real scandal has been completely pushed to the background : namely that the newly elected senate president had mafia ties .
yet it was travaglio who was denounced for openly discussing the matter .
politicians vs. journalists the state television broadcaster rai , which aired the live discussion with marco travaglio , has publicly apologized to schifani .
the ruling parties welcomed the apology as did giovanna meladri , the communication director for the opposition .
no one from opposition leader walter vetroni 's party defended travaglio .
but this does n't bother travaglio .
he stands by his reporting .
" i am a journalist and i do n't care what politicians say about me , " travaglio said .
" journalists have to tell people the truth and that is what i have done . "
travaglio understands his journalistic responsibilities and he has a work ethic that many italian journalists seem to have lost long ago .
travaglio said he sees it as a tragedy that italian newspapers only write about what the television news reported on the day before .
politicians then pick up on these reports and react if they do n't like what they see or hear .
politicians stand ready to " muzzle journalists , " travaglio said .
journalists know it and " restrain themselves accordingly . "
italian public largely apathetic for certain topics , censorship is n't even necessary as journalists practice self-censorship to avoid trouble .
plus , there 's no clamor for the type of investigative reporting done by travaglio .
many italians are simply not interested in knowing about the underhanded dealings of the political class .
writer nanni ballestrini calls it a " weak dictatorship . "
italians are complicit in the set-up , ballestrini said .
in fact , there 's grudging admiration of a clever politician , such as berlusconi , who can hold on to power even while under investigation .
but that does n't mean berlusconi wants his legal maneuverings spoken about in the media .
at his own television channels , a call is all it takes to spike critical news reports .
at the state television station rai the influence is less direct , but nevertheless noticeable .
in italy the ruling parties decide the top positions at the television station , which means they can put their cronies in charge .
the new government will decide on how to fill these posts very soon .

"
the 2007 winners and hosts serbia were sixth with jelena tomasevic 's song " oro . "
belgrade , which hosted the largest-ever eurovision song contest of 43 nations , was praised for flawless organization , both in the packed , 16,000-seat arena and in central belgrade , where thousands of people watched the contest on a huge video screen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek-american kalomira looked like the winner for a tense while russia reportedly invested 10 million euros -lrb- $ 15.7 million -rrb- in bilan 's shot at winning .
the singer was accompanied on stage by a stradivari-playing violinist and olympic figure skater evgeni plushenko , who danced on his skates on a small round of what looked like ice , but was actually plastic .
the " voice of russia " had been the favorite to win in belgrade , according to british bookmaker ladbrokes which gave him 3- to-1 odds .
big purses guarantee a slot albania , armenia , azerbaijan , bosnia and herzegovina , croatia , denmark , finland , georgia , greece , iceland , israel , latvia , norway , poland , portugal , sweden , turkey , romania , russia and ukraine qualified through the two semi-finals of the mammoth show .

the " big four " were also among the low scorers : britain , germany and poland shared last place with 14 points , while france scored 47 and spain 55 .
russia won 272 points .
the practice of awarding top points - 12 , 10 and eight for the first three places - to countries from the region , which favors balkan , nordic and former soviet countries , largely continued in saturday 's contest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's " no angels " failed to impress europe german eurovision tv commentator peter urban suggested , as he has in the past , that it might be time to again revise the voting procedure to hinder countries from handing their points to their neighbors .
points are awarded to the performers by television viewers , who vote by telephone or text message .

those who dare to criticize often come under enormous pressure , says milan-based journalist kirstin hausen . television host fabio fazio knew what he was getting into when he invited journalist marco travaglio to be a guest on his show .
travaglio does n't mince words , especially when it comes to criticizing italian politicians .
over the years , travaglio has gained the reputation of being italy 's most outspoken journalist .
on fazio 's show , he spoke openly about a topic that everyone more or less knew about , but which had n't been openly discussed : the past mafia connections of current senate president renato schifani .
the fact that travaglio dared to speak openly about the subject caused a furor in italy , with schifani threatening to sue for slander , a common weapon used against outspoken journalists in italy .
many journalists steer clear of criticism even during the live television interview , host fabio fazio distanced himself from the accusations .
he looked into the camera , an embarrassed expression on his face , and apologized to newly re-elected premier and media magnate silvio berlusconi .
berlusconi is not a fan of airing such uncomfortable truths about his party supporters , yet politicians from other parties also have taken to ranting daily in talk shows and newspapers on the topic .
the real scandal has been completely pushed to the background : namely that the newly elected senate president had mafia ties .
yet it was travaglio who was denounced for openly discussing the matter .
politicians vs. journalists the state television broadcaster rai , which aired the live discussion with marco travaglio , has publicly apologized to schifani .
the ruling parties welcomed the apology as did giovanna meladri , the communication director for the opposition .
no one from opposition leader walter vetroni 's party defended travaglio .
but this does n't bother travaglio .
he stands by his reporting .
" i am a journalist and i do n't care what politicians say about me , " travaglio said .
" journalists have to tell people the truth and that is what i have done . "
travaglio understands his journalistic responsibilities and he has a work ethic that many italian journalists seem to have lost long ago .
travaglio said he sees it as a tragedy that italian newspapers only write about what the television news reported on the day before .
politicians then pick up on these reports and react if they do n't like what they see or hear .
politicians stand ready to " muzzle journalists , " travaglio said .
journalists know it and " restrain themselves accordingly . "
italian public largely apathetic for certain topics , censorship is n't even necessary as journalists practice self-censorship to avoid trouble .
plus , there 's no clamor for the type of investigative reporting done by travaglio .
many italians are simply not interested in knowing about the underhanded dealings of the political class .
writer nanni ballestrini calls it a " weak dictatorship . "
italians are complicit in the set-up , ballestrini said .
in fact , there 's grudging admiration of a clever politician , such as berlusconi , who can hold on to power even while under investigation .
but that does n't mean berlusconi wants his legal maneuverings spoken about in the media .
at his own television channels , a call is all it takes to spike critical news reports .
at the state television station rai the influence is less direct , but nevertheless noticeable .
in italy the ruling parties decide the top positions at the television station , which means they can put their cronies in charge .
the new government will decide on how to fill these posts very soon .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 25.05.2008 russia wins eurovision song contest with million-euro act großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bilan was backed by millions of euros - and it paid off russian singer dima bilan won the 2008 eurovision song contest late saturday , may 24 , in belgrade with the song " believe " in the first triumph for russia in more than half a century of the competition . ukraine placed second with ani lorak and the song " shady lady , " and greece was third with kalomira 's song " secret combination . "
the 2007 winners and hosts serbia were sixth with jelena tomasevic 's song " oro . "
belgrade , which hosted the largest-ever eurovision song contest of 43 nations , was praised for flawless organization , both in the packed , 16,000-seat arena and in central belgrade , where thousands of people watched the contest on a huge video screen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek-american kalomira looked like the winner for a tense while russia reportedly invested 10 million euros -lrb- $ 15.7 million -rrb- in bilan 's shot at winning .
the singer was accompanied on stage by a stradivari-playing violinist and olympic figure skater evgeni plushenko , who danced on his skates on a small round of what looked like ice , but was actually plastic .
the " voice of russia " had been the favorite to win in belgrade , according to british bookmaker ladbrokes which gave him 3- to-1 odds .
big purses guarantee a slot albania , armenia , azerbaijan , bosnia and herzegovina , croatia , denmark , finland , georgia , greece , iceland , israel , latvia , norway , poland , portugal , sweden , turkey , romania , russia and ukraine qualified through the two semi-finals of the mammoth show .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's rodolfo chikilicuatre gave the contest an extra dose of comedy in line with new rules introduced this year , the " big four " - britain , france , germany and spain - who bear the largest part of financing the competition , qualified directly , as did last year 's winner and host , serbia .
the " big four " were also among the low scorers : britain , germany and poland shared last place with 14 points , while france scored 47 and spain 55 .
russia won 272 points .
the practice of awarding top points - 12 , 10 and eight for the first three places - to countries from the region , which favors balkan , nordic and former soviet countries , largely continued in saturday 's contest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's " no angels " failed to impress europe german eurovision tv commentator peter urban suggested , as he has in the past , that it might be time to again revise the voting procedure to hinder countries from handing their points to their neighbors .
points are awarded to the performers by television viewers , who vote by telephone or text message .
they may not cast votes for their own country .

in a speech to delegates , leader voigt won applause as he said the party 's policy was both nationalist and socialist , but used german grammar to carefully separate them into two words . he said this had no connection whatever to the nazi era .

german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said , " i hope that a new government can be formed soon under president suleiman and that the political stalemate and instability in lebanon can be permanently overcome . "
suleiman took his oath of office as the 12th president , filling a post left vacant for six months and ending a political crisis that threatened a new civil war . suleiman , who leaves his post as army chief , was sworn in after garnering 118 of 127 votes in an election by parliament which had been postponed 19 times over the past six months . the ballots had the name of former deputy nassib lahoud , another the name of former late premier rafik hariri and martyrs of lebanon and a third had the name of jean obeid - one of the presidential candidates . " i pledge to respect and protect lebanon 's independence , sovereignty and its constitution , " said suleiman , who was greeted with applause from lawmakers and guests . suleiman addressed the session after a minute 's silence for the martyrs who have died in lebanon since 2005 including the late hariri , who was assassinated in a huge bomb blast .
hariri 's followers blamed the assassination on syria . the new president called for " distinguished and balanced relations " with damascus . he also backed a un international tribunal to try those responsible for the assassination of hariri and other assassination attempts which have targeted anti-syrian officials and journalists .

he asked president suleiman " to shepherd national dialogue on a defense strategy , " adding a united lebanon and its army would protect the homeland from terrorist threats . berri congratulated suleiman saying : " reconciliation is an essential step for the revival of lebanon . "

iranian-backed hezbollah fighters briefly seized parts of beirut , routing government loyalists . under the doha deal , the priority was to elect a president and then form a national unity government , in which the opposition will have veto power , and a new law for 2009 parliamentary polls . the occasion was summed up by italy 's foreign minister franco frattini , one of several eu and arab foreign ministers attending the session , as " a great day of hope for lebanon , starting a new process of consolidation of democratic institutions .

german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said , " i hope that a new government can be formed soon under president suleiman and that the political stalemate and instability in lebanon can be permanently overcome . "
suleiman took his oath of office as the 12th president , filling a post left vacant for six months and ending a political crisis that threatened a new civil war . suleiman , who leaves his post as army chief , was sworn in after garnering 118 of 127 votes in an election by parliament which had been postponed 19 times over the past six months . the ballots had the name of former deputy nassib lahoud , another the name of former late premier rafik hariri and martyrs of lebanon and a third had the name of jean obeid - one of the presidential candidates . " i pledge to respect and protect lebanon 's independence , sovereignty and its constitution , " said suleiman , who was greeted with applause from lawmakers and guests . suleiman addressed the session after a minute 's silence for the martyrs who have died in lebanon since 2005 including the late hariri , who was assassinated in a huge bomb blast .
hariri 's followers blamed the assassination on syria . the new president called for " distinguished and balanced relations " with damascus . he also backed a un international tribunal to try those responsible for the assassination of hariri and other assassination attempts which have targeted anti-syrian officials and journalists . " we should all open a new chapter in favor of lebanon , " the new president said . in reference to the weapons of the shiite movement hezbollah , suleiman called " for adopting a defense strategy so that accomplishments of the resistance -lrb- hezbollah -rrb- would not get lost . " hezbollah has waged a war on israel since the 1980s which led in 2000 to israeli withdrawal from southern lebanon . house speaker nabih berri expressed gratitude to the united states .
he asked president suleiman " to shepherd national dialogue on a defense strategy , " adding a united lebanon and its army would protect the homeland from terrorist threats . berri congratulated suleiman saying : " reconciliation is an essential step for the revival of lebanon . "
he also thanked qatar for his efforts to end the lebanese crisis . the emir of qatar sheikh hamad bin khalif al-thani , who attended the session said : " the winner is lebanon and the loser is the civil strife . " " you and lebanon has made this success in doha , " the emir said afterwards . a qatari-brokered deal last week between rival lebanese leaders defused 18 months of political stalemate that erupted into fighting this month .
iranian-backed hezbollah fighters briefly seized parts of beirut , routing government loyalists . under the doha deal , the priority was to elect a president and then form a national unity government , in which the opposition will have veto power , and a new law for 2009 parliamentary polls . the occasion was summed up by italy 's foreign minister franco frattini , one of several eu and arab foreign ministers attending the session , as " a great day of hope for lebanon , starting a new process of consolidation of democratic institutions . " prior to sunday , parliament had not met for more than a year and a half , during which time the government of prime minister fouad seniora barely functioned . bouts of violence claimed scores of lives and revived memories of the 1975 to 1990 civil war . the other foreign dignitaries attending sunday 's vote included a host of foreign ministers and those of archrivals syria and saudi arabia . the government of premier fouad seniora is now considered an acting government and the new president is due to start consultations to appoint a new prime minister who will later form the national unity cabinet . deutsche presse agentur -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

last year , 14,000 went just next door , to the netherlands , with maastricht the destination of choice . it was rush hour in the cafe at the university of maastricht as dozens of students waited in an endless line for their coffee .
it 's no wonder , as this place serves the best cappuccino in town - at least according to julia langenohl . the 19-year-old is originally from wuppertal in western germany , but came to maastricht last fall to study business .
she was looking for a degree program offered in english with an international focus when the university of maastricht caught her eye . " everything is very international here , " she said .
" the education system is better than in germany .
when you look at the universities , you can see that they 've been invested in . " she 's not the only one to appreciate the city 's university : 50 percent of students in maastricht are foreign , and 30 percent of these come from germany . " that 's an important part of our strategy , " said jo ritzen , president of the university and a former dutch minister of education .
the goal is to prepare students for the international job market , he added , and the biggest challenge is to reverse the brain drain by bringing in students from abroad . fighting the brain-drain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : courses are offered in english to avoid language barriers " in the rest of the world , the number of university students will increase , but here it would decrease , " said ritzen . as education minister in the 1990s , ritzen encouraged colleges and universities to further open their doors to foreign students - and with success .
today , in addition to the many german students , 5,000 chinese and 2,500 belgian students live in maastricht , as do many poles , indonesians and americans . one point that foreign school-seekers often find attractive in maastricht is that many courses are offered in english and in very small groups . there are very few lecture halls .
mainly , students are given assignments and expected to work independently with their fellow students - an approach that goes over well with the germans , said arjan vlaskamp , who has studied in maastricht for two years . langenohl said that when she first came to maastricht she was amazed at the resources available to students . " as far as the facilities go , the university of maastricht is comparable to a private university in germany , " she said . the group rooms are renovated and there are projectors and computers everywhere .
each group is assigned a tutor to provide assistance .
all of these perks played a role in julia 's decision to go to maastricht . keeping the foreign students coming other germans go to the netherlands to get around final exams that are required in some subjects in germany , but not in the neighboring country - psychology , for example .
that 's why more than 350 german psychology students have made their way to maastricht . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maastricht in southernmost holland has a charming old town while dutch universities may offer a few advantages that are particularly attractive to foreign students , they also actively recruit in other european countries .
in germany , for example , they regularly hold informational seminars and have set up a special web site for german students in holland . financial motivation also plays a role in recruitment . " every dean knows that he gets more money , when he has more students and more graduates , " ritzen said . universities in the netherlands are paid according to the number of students and graduates they have , which ritzen says means between 10,000 and 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 15,800-31,500 -rrb- per degree per year . expanding horizons , erasing borders for langenohl and vlaskamp , studying abroad is n't only about getting a high quality education , but also learning about a new culture . while seminars at the university are in english , vlaskamp 's friends are mainly german and dutch .
sometimes he even uses all three languages in the same sentence . " i 'm from goch , which is pretty close to the german-dutch border , " he said .

all of these perks played a role in julia 's decision to go to maastricht . keeping the foreign students coming other germans go to the netherlands to get around final exams that are required in some subjects in germany , but not in the neighboring country - psychology , for example .

those who dare to criticize often come under enormous pressure , says milan-based journalist kirstin hausen . television host fabio fazio knew what he was getting into when he invited journalist marco travaglio to be a guest on his show .
travaglio does n't mince words , especially when it comes to criticizing italian politicians .
over the years , travaglio has gained the reputation of being italy 's most outspoken journalist .
on fazio 's show , he spoke openly about a topic that everyone more or less knew about , but which had n't been openly discussed : the past mafia connections of current senate president renato schifani .
the fact that travaglio dared to speak openly about the subject caused a furor in italy , with schifani threatening to sue for slander , a common weapon used against outspoken journalists in italy .
many journalists steer clear of criticism even during the live television interview , host fabio fazio distanced himself from the accusations .
he looked into the camera , an embarrassed expression on his face , and apologized to newly re-elected premier and media magnate silvio berlusconi .
berlusconi is not a fan of airing such uncomfortable truths about his party supporters , yet politicians from other parties also have taken to ranting daily in talk shows and newspapers on the topic .
the real scandal has been completely pushed to the background : namely that the newly elected senate president had mafia ties .
yet it was travaglio who was denounced for openly discussing the matter .
politicians vs. journalists the state television broadcaster rai , which aired the live discussion with marco travaglio , has publicly apologized to schifani .
the ruling parties welcomed the apology as did giovanna meladri , the communication director for the opposition .
no one from opposition leader walter vetroni 's party defended travaglio .
but this does n't bother travaglio .
he stands by his reporting .
" i am a journalist and i do n't care what politicians say about me , " travaglio said .
" journalists have to tell people the truth and that is what i have done . "
travaglio understands his journalistic responsibilities and he has a work ethic that many italian journalists seem to have lost long ago .
travaglio said he sees it as a tragedy that italian newspapers only write about what the television news reported on the day before .
politicians then pick up on these reports and react if they do n't like what they see or hear .
politicians stand ready to " muzzle journalists , " travaglio said .
journalists know it and " restrain themselves accordingly . "
italian public largely apathetic for certain topics , censorship is n't even necessary as journalists practice self-censorship to avoid trouble .
plus , there 's no clamor for the type of investigative reporting done by travaglio .
many italians are simply not interested in knowing about the underhanded dealings of the political class .
writer nanni ballestrini calls it a " weak dictatorship . "
italians are complicit in the set-up , ballestrini said .
in fact , there 's grudging admiration of a clever politician , such as berlusconi , who can hold on to power even while under investigation .
but that does n't mean berlusconi wants his legal maneuverings spoken about in the media .
at his own television channels , a call is all it takes to spike critical news reports .
at the state television station rai the influence is less direct , but nevertheless noticeable .
in italy the ruling parties decide the top positions at the television station , which means they can put their cronies in charge .
the new government will decide on how to fill these posts very soon .

the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- ministers were to release a plan at the end of their discussions on monday on technology transfer to developing countries on waste management .
environment minister ichiro kamoshita told the meeting japan was hoping for a long-term deal on targets for halving carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions by 2050 at the upcoming g8 meeting in july .
kamoshita said he hoped " the target would present a shared vision among the countries participating in the g8 summit . "
he also called on china , the us and other major co2 producers to attend the summit .
biggest polluters must sign up , says japan japan , which currently holds the g8 presidency , believes that without the largest producers of co2 , a follow-up agreement to the kyoto protocol that runs out in 2012 would be ineffective .
critics accuse japan of trying to shift the blame for co2 emissions onto developing countries with tokyo 's proposals for measuring co2 reductions by industry sector .
the proposals call for all countries , including china and india , to agree to reductions in certain industries instead of setting national targets .
the proposal would only work if the industrialized countries first meet their own responsibilities by setting mid-term targets , according to the head of the german delegation in kobe , matthias machnig .
japan 's approach could be an element of any future hierarchy of responsibility for reducing co2 emissions , but it was " not a solution to the problem , " machnig said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : internet censorship and freedom of expression facebook , twitter help moldova protesters organize demonstrations european journalists sound the alarm on press freedom europe considers measure to punish aiding internet censorship director blames media for playing up movie censorship in iran media -pipe- 25.05.2008 opinion : italian journalists muzzle their criticisms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : press freedom in italy is a complicated topic , with most italian journalists practicing self-censorship .
those who dare to criticize often come under enormous pressure , says milan-based journalist kirstin hausen . television host fabio fazio knew what he was getting into when he invited journalist marco travaglio to be a guest on his show .
travaglio does n't mince words , especially when it comes to criticizing italian politicians .
over the years , travaglio has gained the reputation of being italy 's most outspoken journalist .
on fazio 's show , he spoke openly about a topic that everyone more or less knew about , but which had n't been openly discussed : the past mafia connections of current senate president renato schifani .
the fact that travaglio dared to speak openly about the subject caused a furor in italy , with schifani threatening to sue for slander , a common weapon used against outspoken journalists in italy .
many journalists steer clear of criticism even during the live television interview , host fabio fazio distanced himself from the accusations .
he looked into the camera , an embarrassed expression on his face , and apologized to newly re-elected premier and media magnate silvio berlusconi .
berlusconi is not a fan of airing such uncomfortable truths about his party supporters , yet politicians from other parties also have taken to ranting daily in talk shows and newspapers on the topic .
the real scandal has been completely pushed to the background : namely that the newly elected senate president had mafia ties .
yet it was travaglio who was denounced for openly discussing the matter .
politicians vs. journalists the state television broadcaster rai , which aired the live discussion with marco travaglio , has publicly apologized to schifani .
the ruling parties welcomed the apology as did giovanna meladri , the communication director for the opposition .
no one from opposition leader walter vetroni 's party defended travaglio .
but this does n't bother travaglio .
he stands by his reporting .
" i am a journalist and i do n't care what politicians say about me , " travaglio said .
" journalists have to tell people the truth and that is what i have done . "
travaglio understands his journalistic responsibilities and he has a work ethic that many italian journalists seem to have lost long ago .
travaglio said he sees it as a tragedy that italian newspapers only write about what the television news reported on the day before .
politicians then pick up on these reports and react if they do n't like what they see or hear .
politicians stand ready to " muzzle journalists , " travaglio said .
journalists know it and " restrain themselves accordingly . "
italian public largely apathetic for certain topics , censorship is n't even necessary as journalists practice self-censorship to avoid trouble .
plus , there 's no clamor for the type of investigative reporting done by travaglio .
many italians are simply not interested in knowing about the underhanded dealings of the political class .
writer nanni ballestrini calls it a " weak dictatorship . "
italians are complicit in the set-up , ballestrini said .
in fact , there 's grudging admiration of a clever politician , such as berlusconi , who can hold on to power even while under investigation .
but that does n't mean berlusconi wants his legal maneuverings spoken about in the media .
at his own television channels , a call is all it takes to spike critical news reports .
at the state television station rai the influence is less direct , but nevertheless noticeable .
in italy the ruling parties decide the top positions at the television station , which means they can put their cronies in charge .
the new government will decide on how to fill these posts very soon .

the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- ministers were to release a plan at the end of their discussions on monday on technology transfer to developing countries on waste management .
environment minister ichiro kamoshita told the meeting japan was hoping for a long-term deal on targets for halving carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions by 2050 at the upcoming g8 meeting in july .
kamoshita said he hoped " the target would present a shared vision among the countries participating in the g8 summit . "
he also called on china , the us and other major co2 producers to attend the summit .
biggest polluters must sign up , says japan japan , which currently holds the g8 presidency , believes that without the largest producers of co2 , a follow-up agreement to the kyoto protocol that runs out in 2012 would be ineffective .
critics accuse japan of trying to shift the blame for co2 emissions onto developing countries with tokyo 's proposals for measuring co2 reductions by industry sector .
the proposals call for all countries , including china and india , to agree to reductions in certain industries instead of setting national targets .
the proposal would only work if the industrialized countries first meet their own responsibilities by setting mid-term targets , according to the head of the german delegation in kobe , matthias machnig .

the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- ministers were to release a plan at the end of their discussions on monday on technology transfer to developing countries on waste management .
environment minister ichiro kamoshita told the meeting japan was hoping for a long-term deal on targets for halving carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions by 2050 at the upcoming g8 meeting in july .
kamoshita said he hoped " the target would present a shared vision among the countries participating in the g8 summit . "
he also called on china , the us and other major co2 producers to attend the summit .
biggest polluters must sign up , says japan japan , which currently holds the g8 presidency , believes that without the largest producers of co2 , a follow-up agreement to the kyoto protocol that runs out in 2012 would be ineffective .
critics accuse japan of trying to shift the blame for co2 emissions onto developing countries with tokyo 's proposals for measuring co2 reductions by industry sector .
the proposals call for all countries , including china and india , to agree to reductions in certain industries instead of setting national targets .
the proposal would only work if the industrialized countries first meet their own responsibilities by setting mid-term targets , according to the head of the german delegation in kobe , matthias machnig .
japan 's approach could be an element of any future hierarchy of responsibility for reducing co2 emissions , but it was " not a solution to the problem , " machnig said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

private information should only be divulged cautiously , they say . staying in contact with friends , swapping photos , or even making new business contacts - these are all stock- in-trade for web 2.0 social networks .
there are now various platforms oriented toward helping users make contact with one another .
but there are drawbacks and potential dangers linked to sites such as facebook and xing , according to german privacy specialists .
" the big problem with social networks is that you do n't know just who can poke around in there , " says henry krasemann , an expert at the independent centre for data protection for schleswig-holstein in kiel , germany .
that means that employers can potentially also access the data .
that 's why data protection specialists recommend storing as little private information as possible online .
" under no circumstances should you be putting bikini or party photos up onto a network of that kind , " says constanze kurz , spokeswoman for the chaos computer club -lrb- ccc -rrb- in berlin .
other threats can come through the websites ' general terms and conditions .
the german networks meinvz and schuelervz recently raised eyebrows with their unusually intrusive demands .
users had to agree to personalized advertising to retain access .
these terms have been adjusted in the interim , confirms studivz spokesman dirk hensen .
" if users do n't want that kind of advertising , they can opt to receive standard advertisements and the account used as before , " hensen says .
this is not the only important setting that is not by default geared toward increased privacy , such as standard settings on who may view a user 's profile .
identity theft a real problem for sites another problem for social networks is identity grabbing : somebody logs in using another user 's data and then makes direct changes to the profile .
one way to fight that is choosing a non-obvious password , meaning no birthdays or children 's names .
even so , many of the sites are freely accessible through search engines : " all user data for studivz are already published on the net .
you do n't even need to hack it to crack into the system , " says hensen .
another issue to consider is the international nature of many of the social networking sites .
facebook , for example , is one of the leading social communities on the web .
yet while users from germany have the option of using a version of the web site localized into german , the company does not have a german branch office .

while plans for an eu common defence policy are still at the embryonic stage , the bloc has already deployed peacekeepers to bosnia-herzegovina and chad and is training policemen in afghanistan and the western balkans .
georgia on friday joined the list of countries seeking help from brussels in training its security forces .
much of the discussions , however , are likely to focus on the eu-lex law mission in kosovo , which was originally meant to take over the administration of the newly-independent country from the united nations on june 15 .
eu officials now concede that legal and logistical difficulties mean that deadline is unrealistic .
while the mission 's overall goal " has not changed , " ministers are unlikely to commit themselves to a new date , sources from the slovenian presidency of the eu said .
tuesday 's discussions will turn to development and aid issues amid calls from the european commission for governments to commit more funds and demands for help from china and myanmar .
ministers are likely to reaffirm their " serious concern " about the violence and irregularities that have marred elections in zimbabwe , where a run-off vote for the presidency is due to take place on june 27 , nearly three months after the first round of voting took place .
the meeting 's overall objective is to prepare the groundwork for the regular summer gathering of eu heads of government and state , due to take place june 19-20 .
poland calls for an eastern alliance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland wants an eastern version of sarkozy 's club med at their last summit , eu leaders backed french calls to revamp their relations with their southern neighbors through the creation of a union for the mediterranean .
but poland insisted at the time that the eu should also forge closer ties to the east .
those polish calls have now developed into a proposed eastern partnership .
backed by sweden and blessed by heavyweights france and germany , the eastern partnership would seek to negotiate visa-free travel and create free-trade zones with ukraine , moldova , georgia , armenia and azerbaijan .
poland and sweden argue that their initiative will help steer ukraine away from moscow and closer to the west .
since it will not cost more money and will not create more bureaucracy , they are optimistic that it can enjoy the backing of other member states .
the european commission has not been consulted and says it is eager to hear from warsaw and stockholm .
at the same time , officials in brussels note that just as with french president nicolas sarkozy 's plan for a mediterranean union , the eastern partnership would only be given serious consideration if it can provide " added value " and avoid duplication in its structures .
russia deal likely to be formally agreed upon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia and the eu have been facing off of late during their meeting , the eu 's foreign ministers are expected to give their formal backing to the launch of long-awaited talks on a strategic deal with russia .
a breakthrough on the issue was obtained by eu ambassadors on wednesday , after lithuania agreed to withdraw its veto in protest at russia 's closure of the main oil pipeline into lithuania , its treatment of georgia and its refusal to hand over men suspected of committing atrocities in lithuania in 1991 .
while the launch of talks is due to be agreed by ministers without discussion , eu diplomats warn that that deal is not yet in the bag .
" we 've seen a lot of surprises on this issue during the last years , " one official said .

while plans for an eu common defence policy are still at the embryonic stage , the bloc has already deployed peacekeepers to bosnia-herzegovina and chad and is training policemen in afghanistan and the western balkans .
georgia on friday joined the list of countries seeking help from brussels in training its security forces .
much of the discussions , however , are likely to focus on the eu-lex law mission in kosovo , which was originally meant to take over the administration of the newly-independent country from the united nations on june 15 .
eu officials now concede that legal and logistical difficulties mean that deadline is unrealistic .
while the mission 's overall goal " has not changed , " ministers are unlikely to commit themselves to a new date , sources from the slovenian presidency of the eu said .
tuesday 's discussions will turn to development and aid issues amid calls from the european commission for governments to commit more funds and demands for help from china and myanmar .
ministers are likely to reaffirm their " serious concern " about the violence and irregularities that have marred elections in zimbabwe , where a run-off vote for the presidency is due to take place on june 27 , nearly three months after the first round of voting took place .
the meeting 's overall objective is to prepare the groundwork for the regular summer gathering of eu heads of government and state , due to take place june 19-20 .
poland calls for an eastern alliance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland wants an eastern version of sarkozy 's club med at their last summit , eu leaders backed french calls to revamp their relations with their southern neighbors through the creation of a union for the mediterranean .
but poland insisted at the time that the eu should also forge closer ties to the east .
those polish calls have now developed into a proposed eastern partnership .
backed by sweden and blessed by heavyweights france and germany , the eastern partnership would seek to negotiate visa-free travel and create free-trade zones with ukraine , moldova , georgia , armenia and azerbaijan .
poland and sweden argue that their initiative will help steer ukraine away from moscow and closer to the west .
since it will not cost more money and will not create more bureaucracy , they are optimistic that it can enjoy the backing of other member states .
the european commission has not been consulted and says it is eager to hear from warsaw and stockholm .
at the same time , officials in brussels note that just as with french president nicolas sarkozy 's plan for a mediterranean union , the eastern partnership would only be given serious consideration if it can provide " added value " and avoid duplication in its structures .
russia deal likely to be formally agreed upon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia and the eu have been facing off of late during their meeting , the eu 's foreign ministers are expected to give their formal backing to the launch of long-awaited talks on a strategic deal with russia .
a breakthrough on the issue was obtained by eu ambassadors on wednesday , after lithuania agreed to withdraw its veto in protest at russia 's closure of the main oil pipeline into lithuania , its treatment of georgia and its refusal to hand over men suspected of committing atrocities in lithuania in 1991 .
while the launch of talks is due to be agreed by ministers without discussion , eu diplomats warn that that deal is not yet in the bag .
" we 've seen a lot of surprises on this issue during the last years , " one official said .
relations between the eu and russia on issues ranging from energy to education are currently governed by a partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- , agreed in 1997 and intended to run for 10 years . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said , " i hope that a new government can be formed soon under president suleiman and that the political stalemate and instability in lebanon can be permanently overcome . "
suleiman took his oath of office as the 12th president , filling a post left vacant for six months and ending a political crisis that threatened a new civil war . suleiman , who leaves his post as army chief , was sworn in after garnering 118 of 127 votes in an election by parliament which had been postponed 19 times over the past six months . the ballots had the name of former deputy nassib lahoud , another the name of former late premier rafik hariri and martyrs of lebanon and a third had the name of jean obeid - one of the presidential candidates . " i pledge to respect and protect lebanon 's independence , sovereignty and its constitution , " said suleiman , who was greeted with applause from lawmakers and guests . suleiman addressed the session after a minute 's silence for the martyrs who have died in lebanon since 2005 including the late hariri , who was assassinated in a huge bomb blast .
hariri 's followers blamed the assassination on syria . the new president called for " distinguished and balanced relations " with damascus . he also backed a un international tribunal to try those responsible for the assassination of hariri and other assassination attempts which have targeted anti-syrian officials and journalists . " we should all open a new chapter in favor of lebanon , " the new president said . in reference to the weapons of the shiite movement hezbollah , suleiman called " for adopting a defense strategy so that accomplishments of the resistance -lrb- hezbollah -rrb- would not get lost . " hezbollah has waged a war on israel since the 1980s which led in 2000 to israeli withdrawal from southern lebanon . house speaker nabih berri expressed gratitude to the united states .
he asked president suleiman " to shepherd national dialogue on a defense strategy , " adding a united lebanon and its army would protect the homeland from terrorist threats . berri congratulated suleiman saying : " reconciliation is an essential step for the revival of lebanon . "
he also thanked qatar for his efforts to end the lebanese crisis . the emir of qatar sheikh hamad bin khalif al-thani , who attended the session said : " the winner is lebanon and the loser is the civil strife . " " you and lebanon has made this success in doha , " the emir said afterwards . a qatari-brokered deal last week between rival lebanese leaders defused 18 months of political stalemate that erupted into fighting this month .
iranian-backed hezbollah fighters briefly seized parts of beirut , routing government loyalists . under the doha deal , the priority was to elect a president and then form a national unity government , in which the opposition will have veto power , and a new law for 2009 parliamentary polls . the occasion was summed up by italy 's foreign minister franco frattini , one of several eu and arab foreign ministers attending the session , as " a great day of hope for lebanon , starting a new process of consolidation of democratic institutions . " prior to sunday , parliament had not met for more than a year and a half , during which time the government of prime minister fouad seniora barely functioned . bouts of violence claimed scores of lives and revived memories of the 1975 to 1990 civil war . the other foreign dignitaries attending sunday 's vote included a host of foreign ministers and those of archrivals syria and saudi arabia . the government of premier fouad seniora is now considered an acting government and the new president is due to start consultations to appoint a new prime minister who will later form the national unity cabinet . deutsche presse agentur -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

suleiman took his oath of office as the 12th president , filling a post left vacant for six months and ending a political crisis that threatened a new civil war . suleiman , who leaves his post as army chief , was sworn in after garnering 118 of 127 votes in an election by parliament which had been postponed 19 times over the past six months . the ballots had the name of former deputy nassib lahoud , another the name of former late premier rafik hariri and martyrs of lebanon and a third had the name of jean obeid - one of the presidential candidates . " i pledge to respect and protect lebanon 's independence , sovereignty and its constitution , " said suleiman , who was greeted with applause from lawmakers and guests . suleiman addressed the session after a minute 's silence for the martyrs who have died in lebanon since 2005 including the late hariri , who was assassinated in a huge bomb blast .
hariri 's followers blamed the assassination on syria . the new president called for " distinguished and balanced relations " with damascus . he also backed a un international tribunal to try those responsible for the assassination of hariri and other assassination attempts which have targeted anti-syrian officials and journalists . " we should all open a new chapter in favor of lebanon , " the new president said . in reference to the weapons of the shiite movement hezbollah , suleiman called " for adopting a defense strategy so that accomplishments of the resistance -lrb- hezbollah -rrb- would not get lost . " hezbollah has waged a war on israel since the 1980s which led in 2000 to israeli withdrawal from southern lebanon . house speaker nabih berri expressed gratitude to the united states .
he asked president suleiman " to shepherd national dialogue on a defense strategy , " adding a united lebanon and its army would protect the homeland from terrorist threats . berri congratulated suleiman saying : " reconciliation is an essential step for the revival of lebanon . "
he also thanked qatar for his efforts to end the lebanese crisis . the emir of qatar sheikh hamad bin khalif al-thani , who attended the session said : " the winner is lebanon and the loser is the civil strife . " " you and lebanon has made this success in doha , " the emir said afterwards . a qatari-brokered deal last week between rival lebanese leaders defused 18 months of political stalemate that erupted into fighting this month .
iranian-backed hezbollah fighters briefly seized parts of beirut , routing government loyalists . under the doha deal , the priority was to elect a president and then form a national unity government , in which the opposition will have veto power , and a new law for 2009 parliamentary polls . the occasion was summed up by italy 's foreign minister franco frattini , one of several eu and arab foreign ministers attending the session , as " a great day of hope for lebanon , starting a new process of consolidation of democratic institutions . " prior to sunday , parliament had not met for more than a year and a half , during which time the government of prime minister fouad seniora barely functioned . bouts of violence claimed scores of lives and revived memories of the 1975 to 1990 civil war . the other foreign dignitaries attending sunday 's vote included a host of foreign ministers and those of archrivals syria and saudi arabia . the government of premier fouad seniora is now considered an acting government and the new president is due to start consultations to appoint a new prime minister who will later form the national unity cabinet . deutsche presse agentur -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while plans for an eu common defence policy are still at the embryonic stage , the bloc has already deployed peacekeepers to bosnia-herzegovina and chad and is training policemen in afghanistan and the western balkans .
georgia on friday joined the list of countries seeking help from brussels in training its security forces .
much of the discussions , however , are likely to focus on the eu-lex law mission in kosovo , which was originally meant to take over the administration of the newly-independent country from the united nations on june 15 .
eu officials now concede that legal and logistical difficulties mean that deadline is unrealistic .
while the mission 's overall goal " has not changed , " ministers are unlikely to commit themselves to a new date , sources from the slovenian presidency of the eu said .
tuesday 's discussions will turn to development and aid issues amid calls from the european commission for governments to commit more funds and demands for help from china and myanmar .
ministers are likely to reaffirm their " serious concern " about the violence and irregularities that have marred elections in zimbabwe , where a run-off vote for the presidency is due to take place on june 27 , nearly three months after the first round of voting took place .
the meeting 's overall objective is to prepare the groundwork for the regular summer gathering of eu heads of government and state , due to take place june 19-20 .

those polish calls have now developed into a proposed eastern partnership .
backed by sweden and blessed by heavyweights france and germany , the eastern partnership would seek to negotiate visa-free travel and create free-trade zones with ukraine , moldova , georgia , armenia and azerbaijan .
poland and sweden argue that their initiative will help steer ukraine away from moscow and closer to the west .
since it will not cost more money and will not create more bureaucracy , they are optimistic that it can enjoy the backing of other member states .
the european commission has not been consulted and says it is eager to hear from warsaw and stockholm .
at the same time , officials in brussels note that just as with french president nicolas sarkozy 's plan for a mediterranean union , the eastern partnership would only be given serious consideration if it can provide " added value " and avoid duplication in its structures .

rieger has convictions for holocaust denial and assault .
reporters suggested that the overtly neo-nazi faction within the npd was gaining a greater voice in the anti-foreigner party , which has seats in two of germany 's 16 state assemblies but has never won parliamentary representation at federal level .
a party spokesman later welcomed rieger 's appointment , saying he would energize the npd .
under party leader udo voigt , the npd has sought the support of militants who praise adolf hitler 's national-socialist or nazi doctrines , though voigt insists that the npd 's nationalist views comply with germany 's democratic constitution .
in a speech to delegates , leader voigt won applause as he said the party 's policy was both nationalist and socialist , but used german grammar to carefully separate them into two words . he said this had no connection whatever to the nazi era .
more than 2,000 people demonstrated saturday against the annual convention of the npd in the bavarian city of bamberg .
kurt beck , leader of germany 's co-ruling social democratic party spd , called in leipzig for the npd to be compulsorily dissolved .
" it ought not to be allowed , " he said .

private information should only be divulged cautiously , they say . staying in contact with friends , swapping photos , or even making new business contacts - these are all stock- in-trade for web 2.0 social networks .
there are now various platforms oriented toward helping users make contact with one another .
but there are drawbacks and potential dangers linked to sites such as facebook and xing , according to german privacy specialists .
" the big problem with social networks is that you do n't know just who can poke around in there , " says henry krasemann , an expert at the independent centre for data protection for schleswig-holstein in kiel , germany .
that means that employers can potentially also access the data .
that 's why data protection specialists recommend storing as little private information as possible online .
" under no circumstances should you be putting bikini or party photos up onto a network of that kind , " says constanze kurz , spokeswoman for the chaos computer club -lrb- ccc -rrb- in berlin .
other threats can come through the websites ' general terms and conditions .
the german networks meinvz and schuelervz recently raised eyebrows with their unusually intrusive demands .
users had to agree to personalized advertising to retain access .
these terms have been adjusted in the interim , confirms studivz spokesman dirk hensen .
" if users do n't want that kind of advertising , they can opt to receive standard advertisements and the account used as before , " hensen says .
this is not the only important setting that is not by default geared toward increased privacy , such as standard settings on who may view a user 's profile .
identity theft a real problem for sites another problem for social networks is identity grabbing : somebody logs in using another user 's data and then makes direct changes to the profile .
one way to fight that is choosing a non-obvious password , meaning no birthdays or children 's names .
even so , many of the sites are freely accessible through search engines : " all user data for studivz are already published on the net .
you do n't even need to hack it to crack into the system , " says hensen .
another issue to consider is the international nature of many of the social networking sites .
facebook , for example , is one of the leading social communities on the web .
yet while users from germany have the option of using a version of the web site localized into german , the company does not have a german branch office .
that means that it follows the law of the u.s. state of delaware - and as such is subject to much less stringent data protection laws than those in germany . deutsche presse agentur -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

those who dare to criticize often come under enormous pressure , says milan-based journalist kirstin hausen . television host fabio fazio knew what he was getting into when he invited journalist marco travaglio to be a guest on his show .
travaglio does n't mince words , especially when it comes to criticizing italian politicians .
over the years , travaglio has gained the reputation of being italy 's most outspoken journalist .
on fazio 's show , he spoke openly about a topic that everyone more or less knew about , but which had n't been openly discussed : the past mafia connections of current senate president renato schifani .
the fact that travaglio dared to speak openly about the subject caused a furor in italy , with schifani threatening to sue for slander , a common weapon used against outspoken journalists in italy .
many journalists steer clear of criticism even during the live television interview , host fabio fazio distanced himself from the accusations .
he looked into the camera , an embarrassed expression on his face , and apologized to newly re-elected premier and media magnate silvio berlusconi .
berlusconi is not a fan of airing such uncomfortable truths about his party supporters , yet politicians from other parties also have taken to ranting daily in talk shows and newspapers on the topic .
the real scandal has been completely pushed to the background : namely that the newly elected senate president had mafia ties .
yet it was travaglio who was denounced for openly discussing the matter .
politicians vs. journalists the state television broadcaster rai , which aired the live discussion with marco travaglio , has publicly apologized to schifani .
the ruling parties welcomed the apology as did giovanna meladri , the communication director for the opposition .
no one from opposition leader walter vetroni 's party defended travaglio .
but this does n't bother travaglio .
he stands by his reporting .
" i am a journalist and i do n't care what politicians say about me , " travaglio said .
" journalists have to tell people the truth and that is what i have done . "
travaglio understands his journalistic responsibilities and he has a work ethic that many italian journalists seem to have lost long ago .
travaglio said he sees it as a tragedy that italian newspapers only write about what the television news reported on the day before .
politicians then pick up on these reports and react if they do n't like what they see or hear .
politicians stand ready to " muzzle journalists , " travaglio said .
journalists know it and " restrain themselves accordingly . "
italian public largely apathetic for certain topics , censorship is n't even necessary as journalists practice self-censorship to avoid trouble .
plus , there 's no clamor for the type of investigative reporting done by travaglio .
many italians are simply not interested in knowing about the underhanded dealings of the political class .
writer nanni ballestrini calls it a " weak dictatorship . "
italians are complicit in the set-up , ballestrini said .
in fact , there 's grudging admiration of a clever politician , such as berlusconi , who can hold on to power even while under investigation .
but that does n't mean berlusconi wants his legal maneuverings spoken about in the media .
at his own television channels , a call is all it takes to spike critical news reports .
at the state television station rai the influence is less direct , but nevertheless noticeable .
in italy the ruling parties decide the top positions at the television station , which means they can put their cronies in charge .
the new government will decide on how to fill these posts very soon .

"
the 2007 winners and hosts serbia were sixth with jelena tomasevic 's song " oro . "
belgrade , which hosted the largest-ever eurovision song contest of 43 nations , was praised for flawless organization , both in the packed , 16,000-seat arena and in central belgrade , where thousands of people watched the contest on a huge video screen .

rieger has convictions for holocaust denial and assault .
reporters suggested that the overtly neo-nazi faction within the npd was gaining a greater voice in the anti-foreigner party , which has seats in two of germany 's 16 state assemblies but has never won parliamentary representation at federal level .
a party spokesman later welcomed rieger 's appointment , saying he would energize the npd .
under party leader udo voigt , the npd has sought the support of militants who praise adolf hitler 's national-socialist or nazi doctrines , though voigt insists that the npd 's nationalist views comply with germany 's democratic constitution .
in a speech to delegates , leader voigt won applause as he said the party 's policy was both nationalist and socialist , but used german grammar to carefully separate them into two words . he said this had no connection whatever to the nazi era .
more than 2,000 people demonstrated saturday against the annual convention of the npd in the bavarian city of bamberg .
kurt beck , leader of germany 's co-ruling social democratic party spd , called in leipzig for the npd to be compulsorily dissolved .
" it ought not to be allowed , " he said .

those who dare to criticize often come under enormous pressure , says milan-based journalist kirstin hausen . television host fabio fazio knew what he was getting into when he invited journalist marco travaglio to be a guest on his show .
travaglio does n't mince words , especially when it comes to criticizing italian politicians .
over the years , travaglio has gained the reputation of being italy 's most outspoken journalist .
on fazio 's show , he spoke openly about a topic that everyone more or less knew about , but which had n't been openly discussed : the past mafia connections of current senate president renato schifani .
the fact that travaglio dared to speak openly about the subject caused a furor in italy , with schifani threatening to sue for slander , a common weapon used against outspoken journalists in italy .
many journalists steer clear of criticism even during the live television interview , host fabio fazio distanced himself from the accusations .
he looked into the camera , an embarrassed expression on his face , and apologized to newly re-elected premier and media magnate silvio berlusconi .
berlusconi is not a fan of airing such uncomfortable truths about his party supporters , yet politicians from other parties also have taken to ranting daily in talk shows and newspapers on the topic .
the real scandal has been completely pushed to the background : namely that the newly elected senate president had mafia ties .
yet it was travaglio who was denounced for openly discussing the matter .
politicians vs. journalists the state television broadcaster rai , which aired the live discussion with marco travaglio , has publicly apologized to schifani .
the ruling parties welcomed the apology as did giovanna meladri , the communication director for the opposition .
no one from opposition leader walter vetroni 's party defended travaglio .
but this does n't bother travaglio .
he stands by his reporting .
" i am a journalist and i do n't care what politicians say about me , " travaglio said .
" journalists have to tell people the truth and that is what i have done . "
travaglio understands his journalistic responsibilities and he has a work ethic that many italian journalists seem to have lost long ago .
travaglio said he sees it as a tragedy that italian newspapers only write about what the television news reported on the day before .
politicians then pick up on these reports and react if they do n't like what they see or hear .
politicians stand ready to " muzzle journalists , " travaglio said .
journalists know it and " restrain themselves accordingly . "
italian public largely apathetic for certain topics , censorship is n't even necessary as journalists practice self-censorship to avoid trouble .
plus , there 's no clamor for the type of investigative reporting done by travaglio .
many italians are simply not interested in knowing about the underhanded dealings of the political class .
writer nanni ballestrini calls it a " weak dictatorship . "
italians are complicit in the set-up , ballestrini said .
in fact , there 's grudging admiration of a clever politician , such as berlusconi , who can hold on to power even while under investigation .
but that does n't mean berlusconi wants his legal maneuverings spoken about in the media .
at his own television channels , a call is all it takes to spike critical news reports .
at the state television station rai the influence is less direct , but nevertheless noticeable .
in italy the ruling parties decide the top positions at the television station , which means they can put their cronies in charge .
the new government will decide on how to fill these posts very soon .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : internet censorship and freedom of expression facebook , twitter help moldova protesters organize demonstrations european journalists sound the alarm on press freedom europe considers measure to punish aiding internet censorship director blames media for playing up movie censorship in iran media -pipe- 25.05.2008 opinion : italian journalists muzzle their criticisms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : press freedom in italy is a complicated topic , with most italian journalists practicing self-censorship .
those who dare to criticize often come under enormous pressure , says milan-based journalist kirstin hausen . television host fabio fazio knew what he was getting into when he invited journalist marco travaglio to be a guest on his show .
travaglio does n't mince words , especially when it comes to criticizing italian politicians .
over the years , travaglio has gained the reputation of being italy 's most outspoken journalist .
on fazio 's show , he spoke openly about a topic that everyone more or less knew about , but which had n't been openly discussed : the past mafia connections of current senate president renato schifani .
the fact that travaglio dared to speak openly about the subject caused a furor in italy , with schifani threatening to sue for slander , a common weapon used against outspoken journalists in italy .
many journalists steer clear of criticism even during the live television interview , host fabio fazio distanced himself from the accusations .
he looked into the camera , an embarrassed expression on his face , and apologized to newly re-elected premier and media magnate silvio berlusconi .
berlusconi is not a fan of airing such uncomfortable truths about his party supporters , yet politicians from other parties also have taken to ranting daily in talk shows and newspapers on the topic .
the real scandal has been completely pushed to the background : namely that the newly elected senate president had mafia ties .
yet it was travaglio who was denounced for openly discussing the matter .
politicians vs. journalists the state television broadcaster rai , which aired the live discussion with marco travaglio , has publicly apologized to schifani .
the ruling parties welcomed the apology as did giovanna meladri , the communication director for the opposition .
no one from opposition leader walter vetroni 's party defended travaglio .
but this does n't bother travaglio .
he stands by his reporting .
" i am a journalist and i do n't care what politicians say about me , " travaglio said .
" journalists have to tell people the truth and that is what i have done . "
travaglio understands his journalistic responsibilities and he has a work ethic that many italian journalists seem to have lost long ago .
travaglio said he sees it as a tragedy that italian newspapers only write about what the television news reported on the day before .
politicians then pick up on these reports and react if they do n't like what they see or hear .
politicians stand ready to " muzzle journalists , " travaglio said .
journalists know it and " restrain themselves accordingly . "
italian public largely apathetic for certain topics , censorship is n't even necessary as journalists practice self-censorship to avoid trouble .
plus , there 's no clamor for the type of investigative reporting done by travaglio .
many italians are simply not interested in knowing about the underhanded dealings of the political class .
writer nanni ballestrini calls it a " weak dictatorship . "
italians are complicit in the set-up , ballestrini said .
in fact , there 's grudging admiration of a clever politician , such as berlusconi , who can hold on to power even while under investigation .
but that does n't mean berlusconi wants his legal maneuverings spoken about in the media .
at his own television channels , a call is all it takes to spike critical news reports .
at the state television station rai the influence is less direct , but nevertheless noticeable .

rieger has convictions for holocaust denial and assault .
reporters suggested that the overtly neo-nazi faction within the npd was gaining a greater voice in the anti-foreigner party , which has seats in two of germany 's 16 state assemblies but has never won parliamentary representation at federal level .
a party spokesman later welcomed rieger 's appointment , saying he would energize the npd .
under party leader udo voigt , the npd has sought the support of militants who praise adolf hitler 's national-socialist or nazi doctrines , though voigt insists that the npd 's nationalist views comply with germany 's democratic constitution .
in a speech to delegates , leader voigt won applause as he said the party 's policy was both nationalist and socialist , but used german grammar to carefully separate them into two words . he said this had no connection whatever to the nazi era .
more than 2,000 people demonstrated saturday against the annual convention of the npd in the bavarian city of bamberg .

german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said , " i hope that a new government can be formed soon under president suleiman and that the political stalemate and instability in lebanon can be permanently overcome . "
suleiman took his oath of office as the 12th president , filling a post left vacant for six months and ending a political crisis that threatened a new civil war . suleiman , who leaves his post as army chief , was sworn in after garnering 118 of 127 votes in an election by parliament which had been postponed 19 times over the past six months . the ballots had the name of former deputy nassib lahoud , another the name of former late premier rafik hariri and martyrs of lebanon and a third had the name of jean obeid - one of the presidential candidates . " i pledge to respect and protect lebanon 's independence , sovereignty and its constitution , " said suleiman , who was greeted with applause from lawmakers and guests . suleiman addressed the session after a minute 's silence for the martyrs who have died in lebanon since 2005 including the late hariri , who was assassinated in a huge bomb blast .
hariri 's followers blamed the assassination on syria . the new president called for " distinguished and balanced relations " with damascus . he also backed a un international tribunal to try those responsible for the assassination of hariri and other assassination attempts which have targeted anti-syrian officials and journalists . " we should all open a new chapter in favor of lebanon , " the new president said . in reference to the weapons of the shiite movement hezbollah , suleiman called " for adopting a defense strategy so that accomplishments of the resistance -lrb- hezbollah -rrb- would not get lost . " hezbollah has waged a war on israel since the 1980s which led in 2000 to israeli withdrawal from southern lebanon . house speaker nabih berri expressed gratitude to the united states .
he asked president suleiman " to shepherd national dialogue on a defense strategy , " adding a united lebanon and its army would protect the homeland from terrorist threats . berri congratulated suleiman saying : " reconciliation is an essential step for the revival of lebanon . "
he also thanked qatar for his efforts to end the lebanese crisis . the emir of qatar sheikh hamad bin khalif al-thani , who attended the session said : " the winner is lebanon and the loser is the civil strife . " " you and lebanon has made this success in doha , " the emir said afterwards . a qatari-brokered deal last week between rival lebanese leaders defused 18 months of political stalemate that erupted into fighting this month .
iranian-backed hezbollah fighters briefly seized parts of beirut , routing government loyalists . under the doha deal , the priority was to elect a president and then form a national unity government , in which the opposition will have veto power , and a new law for 2009 parliamentary polls . the occasion was summed up by italy 's foreign minister franco frattini , one of several eu and arab foreign ministers attending the session , as " a great day of hope for lebanon , starting a new process of consolidation of democratic institutions . " prior to sunday , parliament had not met for more than a year and a half , during which time the government of prime minister fouad seniora barely functioned . bouts of violence claimed scores of lives and revived memories of the 1975 to 1990 civil war . the other foreign dignitaries attending sunday 's vote included a host of foreign ministers and those of archrivals syria and saudi arabia . the government of premier fouad seniora is now considered an acting government and the new president is due to start consultations to appoint a new prime minister who will later form the national unity cabinet . deutsche presse agentur -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said , " i hope that a new government can be formed soon under president suleiman and that the political stalemate and instability in lebanon can be permanently overcome . "
suleiman took his oath of office as the 12th president , filling a post left vacant for six months and ending a political crisis that threatened a new civil war . suleiman , who leaves his post as army chief , was sworn in after garnering 118 of 127 votes in an election by parliament which had been postponed 19 times over the past six months . the ballots had the name of former deputy nassib lahoud , another the name of former late premier rafik hariri and martyrs of lebanon and a third had the name of jean obeid - one of the presidential candidates . " i pledge to respect and protect lebanon 's independence , sovereignty and its constitution , " said suleiman , who was greeted with applause from lawmakers and guests . suleiman addressed the session after a minute 's silence for the martyrs who have died in lebanon since 2005 including the late hariri , who was assassinated in a huge bomb blast .
hariri 's followers blamed the assassination on syria . the new president called for " distinguished and balanced relations " with damascus . he also backed a un international tribunal to try those responsible for the assassination of hariri and other assassination attempts which have targeted anti-syrian officials and journalists . " we should all open a new chapter in favor of lebanon , " the new president said . in reference to the weapons of the shiite movement hezbollah , suleiman called " for adopting a defense strategy so that accomplishments of the resistance -lrb- hezbollah -rrb- would not get lost . " hezbollah has waged a war on israel since the 1980s which led in 2000 to israeli withdrawal from southern lebanon . house speaker nabih berri expressed gratitude to the united states .
he asked president suleiman " to shepherd national dialogue on a defense strategy , " adding a united lebanon and its army would protect the homeland from terrorist threats . berri congratulated suleiman saying : " reconciliation is an essential step for the revival of lebanon . "
he also thanked qatar for his efforts to end the lebanese crisis . the emir of qatar sheikh hamad bin khalif al-thani , who attended the session said : " the winner is lebanon and the loser is the civil strife . " " you and lebanon has made this success in doha , " the emir said afterwards . a qatari-brokered deal last week between rival lebanese leaders defused 18 months of political stalemate that erupted into fighting this month .
iranian-backed hezbollah fighters briefly seized parts of beirut , routing government loyalists . under the doha deal , the priority was to elect a president and then form a national unity government , in which the opposition will have veto power , and a new law for 2009 parliamentary polls . the occasion was summed up by italy 's foreign minister franco frattini , one of several eu and arab foreign ministers attending the session , as " a great day of hope for lebanon , starting a new process of consolidation of democratic institutions .

suleiman took his oath of office as the 12th president , filling a post left vacant for six months and ending a political crisis that threatened a new civil war . suleiman , who leaves his post as army chief , was sworn in after garnering 118 of 127 votes in an election by parliament which had been postponed 19 times over the past six months . the ballots had the name of former deputy nassib lahoud , another the name of former late premier rafik hariri and martyrs of lebanon and a third had the name of jean obeid - one of the presidential candidates . " i pledge to respect and protect lebanon 's independence , sovereignty and its constitution , " said suleiman , who was greeted with applause from lawmakers and guests . suleiman addressed the session after a minute 's silence for the martyrs who have died in lebanon since 2005 including the late hariri , who was assassinated in a huge bomb blast .
hariri 's followers blamed the assassination on syria . the new president called for " distinguished and balanced relations " with damascus . he also backed a un international tribunal to try those responsible for the assassination of hariri and other assassination attempts which have targeted anti-syrian officials and journalists . " we should all open a new chapter in favor of lebanon , " the new president said . in reference to the weapons of the shiite movement hezbollah , suleiman called " for adopting a defense strategy so that accomplishments of the resistance -lrb- hezbollah -rrb- would not get lost . " hezbollah has waged a war on israel since the 1980s which led in 2000 to israeli withdrawal from southern lebanon . house speaker nabih berri expressed gratitude to the united states .
he asked president suleiman " to shepherd national dialogue on a defense strategy , " adding a united lebanon and its army would protect the homeland from terrorist threats . berri congratulated suleiman saying : " reconciliation is an essential step for the revival of lebanon . "
he also thanked qatar for his efforts to end the lebanese crisis . the emir of qatar sheikh hamad bin khalif al-thani , who attended the session said : " the winner is lebanon and the loser is the civil strife . " " you and lebanon has made this success in doha , " the emir said afterwards . a qatari-brokered deal last week between rival lebanese leaders defused 18 months of political stalemate that erupted into fighting this month .
iranian-backed hezbollah fighters briefly seized parts of beirut , routing government loyalists . under the doha deal , the priority was to elect a president and then form a national unity government , in which the opposition will have veto power , and a new law for 2009 parliamentary polls . the occasion was summed up by italy 's foreign minister franco frattini , one of several eu and arab foreign ministers attending the session , as " a great day of hope for lebanon , starting a new process of consolidation of democratic institutions . " prior to sunday , parliament had not met for more than a year and a half , during which time the government of prime minister fouad seniora barely functioned . bouts of violence claimed scores of lives and revived memories of the 1975 to 1990 civil war . the other foreign dignitaries attending sunday 's vote included a host of foreign ministers and those of archrivals syria and saudi arabia . the government of premier fouad seniora is now considered an acting government and the new president is due to start consultations to appoint a new prime minister who will later form the national unity cabinet . deutsche presse agentur -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

rieger has convictions for holocaust denial and assault .
reporters suggested that the overtly neo-nazi faction within the npd was gaining a greater voice in the anti-foreigner party , which has seats in two of germany 's 16 state assemblies but has never won parliamentary representation at federal level .
a party spokesman later welcomed rieger 's appointment , saying he would energize the npd .
under party leader udo voigt , the npd has sought the support of militants who praise adolf hitler 's national-socialist or nazi doctrines , though voigt insists that the npd 's nationalist views comply with germany 's democratic constitution .
in a speech to delegates , leader voigt won applause as he said the party 's policy was both nationalist and socialist , but used german grammar to carefully separate them into two words . he said this had no connection whatever to the nazi era .
more than 2,000 people demonstrated saturday against the annual convention of the npd in the bavarian city of bamberg .
kurt beck , leader of germany 's co-ruling social democratic party spd , called in leipzig for the npd to be compulsorily dissolved .
" it ought not to be allowed , " he said .
" a robust democracy ought not to give state support to people who want to abolish democracy . " deutsche presse agentur -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while plans for an eu common defence policy are still at the embryonic stage , the bloc has already deployed peacekeepers to bosnia-herzegovina and chad and is training policemen in afghanistan and the western balkans .
georgia on friday joined the list of countries seeking help from brussels in training its security forces .
much of the discussions , however , are likely to focus on the eu-lex law mission in kosovo , which was originally meant to take over the administration of the newly-independent country from the united nations on june 15 .
eu officials now concede that legal and logistical difficulties mean that deadline is unrealistic .
while the mission 's overall goal " has not changed , " ministers are unlikely to commit themselves to a new date , sources from the slovenian presidency of the eu said .
tuesday 's discussions will turn to development and aid issues amid calls from the european commission for governments to commit more funds and demands for help from china and myanmar .
ministers are likely to reaffirm their " serious concern " about the violence and irregularities that have marred elections in zimbabwe , where a run-off vote for the presidency is due to take place on june 27 , nearly three months after the first round of voting took place .
the meeting 's overall objective is to prepare the groundwork for the regular summer gathering of eu heads of government and state , due to take place june 19-20 .
poland calls for an eastern alliance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland wants an eastern version of sarkozy 's club med at their last summit , eu leaders backed french calls to revamp their relations with their southern neighbors through the creation of a union for the mediterranean .
but poland insisted at the time that the eu should also forge closer ties to the east .
those polish calls have now developed into a proposed eastern partnership .
backed by sweden and blessed by heavyweights france and germany , the eastern partnership would seek to negotiate visa-free travel and create free-trade zones with ukraine , moldova , georgia , armenia and azerbaijan .
poland and sweden argue that their initiative will help steer ukraine away from moscow and closer to the west .
since it will not cost more money and will not create more bureaucracy , they are optimistic that it can enjoy the backing of other member states .
the european commission has not been consulted and says it is eager to hear from warsaw and stockholm .
at the same time , officials in brussels note that just as with french president nicolas sarkozy 's plan for a mediterranean union , the eastern partnership would only be given serious consideration if it can provide " added value " and avoid duplication in its structures .
russia deal likely to be formally agreed upon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia and the eu have been facing off of late during their meeting , the eu 's foreign ministers are expected to give their formal backing to the launch of long-awaited talks on a strategic deal with russia .
a breakthrough on the issue was obtained by eu ambassadors on wednesday , after lithuania agreed to withdraw its veto in protest at russia 's closure of the main oil pipeline into lithuania , its treatment of georgia and its refusal to hand over men suspected of committing atrocities in lithuania in 1991 .
while the launch of talks is due to be agreed by ministers without discussion , eu diplomats warn that that deal is not yet in the bag .
" we 've seen a lot of surprises on this issue during the last years , " one official said .
relations between the eu and russia on issues ranging from energy to education are currently governed by a partnership and cooperation agreement -lrb- pca -rrb- , agreed in 1997 and intended to run for 10 years . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while plans for an eu common defence policy are still at the embryonic stage , the bloc has already deployed peacekeepers to bosnia-herzegovina and chad and is training policemen in afghanistan and the western balkans .
georgia on friday joined the list of countries seeking help from brussels in training its security forces .
much of the discussions , however , are likely to focus on the eu-lex law mission in kosovo , which was originally meant to take over the administration of the newly-independent country from the united nations on june 15 .
eu officials now concede that legal and logistical difficulties mean that deadline is unrealistic .
while the mission 's overall goal " has not changed , " ministers are unlikely to commit themselves to a new date , sources from the slovenian presidency of the eu said .
tuesday 's discussions will turn to development and aid issues amid calls from the european commission for governments to commit more funds and demands for help from china and myanmar .
ministers are likely to reaffirm their " serious concern " about the violence and irregularities that have marred elections in zimbabwe , where a run-off vote for the presidency is due to take place on june 27 , nearly three months after the first round of voting took place .
the meeting 's overall objective is to prepare the groundwork for the regular summer gathering of eu heads of government and state , due to take place june 19-20 .
poland calls for an eastern alliance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland wants an eastern version of sarkozy 's club med at their last summit , eu leaders backed french calls to revamp their relations with their southern neighbors through the creation of a union for the mediterranean .
but poland insisted at the time that the eu should also forge closer ties to the east .
those polish calls have now developed into a proposed eastern partnership .
backed by sweden and blessed by heavyweights france and germany , the eastern partnership would seek to negotiate visa-free travel and create free-trade zones with ukraine , moldova , georgia , armenia and azerbaijan .
poland and sweden argue that their initiative will help steer ukraine away from moscow and closer to the west .
since it will not cost more money and will not create more bureaucracy , they are optimistic that it can enjoy the backing of other member states .
the european commission has not been consulted and says it is eager to hear from warsaw and stockholm .
at the same time , officials in brussels note that just as with french president nicolas sarkozy 's plan for a mediterranean union , the eastern partnership would only be given serious consideration if it can provide " added value " and avoid duplication in its structures .
russia deal likely to be formally agreed upon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia and the eu have been facing off of late during their meeting , the eu 's foreign ministers are expected to give their formal backing to the launch of long-awaited talks on a strategic deal with russia .
a breakthrough on the issue was obtained by eu ambassadors on wednesday , after lithuania agreed to withdraw its veto in protest at russia 's closure of the main oil pipeline into lithuania , its treatment of georgia and its refusal to hand over men suspected of committing atrocities in lithuania in 1991 .
while the launch of talks is due to be agreed by ministers without discussion , eu diplomats warn that that deal is not yet in the bag .

last year , 14,000 went just next door , to the netherlands , with maastricht the destination of choice . it was rush hour in the cafe at the university of maastricht as dozens of students waited in an endless line for their coffee .
it 's no wonder , as this place serves the best cappuccino in town - at least according to julia langenohl . the 19-year-old is originally from wuppertal in western germany , but came to maastricht last fall to study business .
she was looking for a degree program offered in english with an international focus when the university of maastricht caught her eye . " everything is very international here , " she said .
" the education system is better than in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 25.05.2008 eu looks east as foreign policy council convenes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european union is expected to agree on a russia policy deal at the meeting the eu will look to the east monday , may 26 , when ministers will discuss a strategic deal with russia , their countries ' role in the western balkans and closer ties with ukraine , moldova , georgia , armenia and azerbaijan . at the so-called " jumbo council " in brussels , the foreign ministers will be flanked by their colleagues from the defense and development ministries .
while plans for an eu common defence policy are still at the embryonic stage , the bloc has already deployed peacekeepers to bosnia-herzegovina and chad and is training policemen in afghanistan and the western balkans .
georgia on friday joined the list of countries seeking help from brussels in training its security forces .
much of the discussions , however , are likely to focus on the eu-lex law mission in kosovo , which was originally meant to take over the administration of the newly-independent country from the united nations on june 15 .
eu officials now concede that legal and logistical difficulties mean that deadline is unrealistic .
while the mission 's overall goal " has not changed , " ministers are unlikely to commit themselves to a new date , sources from the slovenian presidency of the eu said .
tuesday 's discussions will turn to development and aid issues amid calls from the european commission for governments to commit more funds and demands for help from china and myanmar .
ministers are likely to reaffirm their " serious concern " about the violence and irregularities that have marred elections in zimbabwe , where a run-off vote for the presidency is due to take place on june 27 , nearly three months after the first round of voting took place .
the meeting 's overall objective is to prepare the groundwork for the regular summer gathering of eu heads of government and state , due to take place june 19-20 .
poland calls for an eastern alliance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland wants an eastern version of sarkozy 's club med at their last summit , eu leaders backed french calls to revamp their relations with their southern neighbors through the creation of a union for the mediterranean .
but poland insisted at the time that the eu should also forge closer ties to the east .

backed by sweden and blessed by heavyweights france and germany , the eastern partnership would seek to negotiate visa-free travel and create free-trade zones with ukraine , moldova , georgia , armenia and azerbaijan .

the european commission has not been consulted and says it is eager to hear from warsaw and stockholm .

while plans for an eu common defence policy are still at the embryonic stage , the bloc has already deployed peacekeepers to bosnia-herzegovina and chad and is training policemen in afghanistan and the western balkans .
georgia on friday joined the list of countries seeking help from brussels in training its security forces .
much of the discussions , however , are likely to focus on the eu-lex law mission in kosovo , which was originally meant to take over the administration of the newly-independent country from the united nations on june 15 .
eu officials now concede that legal and logistical difficulties mean that deadline is unrealistic .
while the mission 's overall goal " has not changed , " ministers are unlikely to commit themselves to a new date , sources from the slovenian presidency of the eu said .
tuesday 's discussions will turn to development and aid issues amid calls from the european commission for governments to commit more funds and demands for help from china and myanmar .
ministers are likely to reaffirm their " serious concern " about the violence and irregularities that have marred elections in zimbabwe , where a run-off vote for the presidency is due to take place on june 27 , nearly three months after the first round of voting took place .
the meeting 's overall objective is to prepare the groundwork for the regular summer gathering of eu heads of government and state , due to take place june 19-20 .
poland calls for an eastern alliance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland wants an eastern version of sarkozy 's club med at their last summit , eu leaders backed french calls to revamp their relations with their southern neighbors through the creation of a union for the mediterranean .
but poland insisted at the time that the eu should also forge closer ties to the east .
those polish calls have now developed into a proposed eastern partnership .
backed by sweden and blessed by heavyweights france and germany , the eastern partnership would seek to negotiate visa-free travel and create free-trade zones with ukraine , moldova , georgia , armenia and azerbaijan .

last year , 14,000 went just next door , to the netherlands , with maastricht the destination of choice . it was rush hour in the cafe at the university of maastricht as dozens of students waited in an endless line for their coffee .
it 's no wonder , as this place serves the best cappuccino in town - at least according to julia langenohl . the 19-year-old is originally from wuppertal in western germany , but came to maastricht last fall to study business .
she was looking for a degree program offered in english with an international focus when the university of maastricht caught her eye . " everything is very international here , " she said .
" the education system is better than in germany .
when you look at the universities , you can see that they 've been invested in .

today , in addition to the many german students , 5,000 chinese and 2,500 belgian students live in maastricht , as do many poles , indonesians and americans . one point that foreign school-seekers often find attractive in maastricht is that many courses are offered in english and in very small groups . there are very few lecture halls .
mainly , students are given assignments and expected to work independently with their fellow students - an approach that goes over well with the germans , said arjan vlaskamp , who has studied in maastricht for two years . langenohl said that when she first came to maastricht she was amazed at the resources available to students .

environment minister ichiro kamoshita told the meeting japan was hoping for a long-term deal on targets for halving carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions by 2050 at the upcoming g8 meeting in july .

critics accuse japan of trying to shift the blame for co2 emissions onto developing countries with tokyo 's proposals for measuring co2 reductions by industry sector .
the proposals call for all countries , including china and india , to agree to reductions in certain industries instead of setting national targets .
the proposal would only work if the industrialized countries first meet their own responsibilities by setting mid-term targets , according to the head of the german delegation in kobe , matthias machnig .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 25.05.2008 german privacy specialists warn of social network dangers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social networks like facebook can be accessed by people who may not be friends german privacy specialists are concerned about the practices of online social networks and recommend against revealing too much about yourself .
private information should only be divulged cautiously , they say . staying in contact with friends , swapping photos , or even making new business contacts - these are all stock- in-trade for web 2.0 social networks .
there are now various platforms oriented toward helping users make contact with one another .
but there are drawbacks and potential dangers linked to sites such as facebook and xing , according to german privacy specialists .
" the big problem with social networks is that you do n't know just who can poke around in there , " says henry krasemann , an expert at the independent centre for data protection for schleswig-holstein in kiel , germany .
that means that employers can potentially also access the data .
that 's why data protection specialists recommend storing as little private information as possible online .
" under no circumstances should you be putting bikini or party photos up onto a network of that kind , " says constanze kurz , spokeswoman for the chaos computer club -lrb- ccc -rrb- in berlin .
other threats can come through the websites ' general terms and conditions .
the german networks meinvz and schuelervz recently raised eyebrows with their unusually intrusive demands .

private information should only be divulged cautiously , they say . staying in contact with friends , swapping photos , or even making new business contacts - these are all stock- in-trade for web 2.0 social networks .
there are now various platforms oriented toward helping users make contact with one another .
but there are drawbacks and potential dangers linked to sites such as facebook and xing , according to german privacy specialists .
" the big problem with social networks is that you do n't know just who can poke around in there , " says henry krasemann , an expert at the independent centre for data protection for schleswig-holstein in kiel , germany .
that means that employers can potentially also access the data .
that 's why data protection specialists recommend storing as little private information as possible online .
" under no circumstances should you be putting bikini or party photos up onto a network of that kind , " says constanze kurz , spokeswoman for the chaos computer club -lrb- ccc -rrb- in berlin .
other threats can come through the websites ' general terms and conditions .
the german networks meinvz and schuelervz recently raised eyebrows with their unusually intrusive demands .
users had to agree to personalized advertising to retain access .
these terms have been adjusted in the interim , confirms studivz spokesman dirk hensen .
" if users do n't want that kind of advertising , they can opt to receive standard advertisements and the account used as before , " hensen says .
this is not the only important setting that is not by default geared toward increased privacy , such as standard settings on who may view a user 's profile .
identity theft a real problem for sites another problem for social networks is identity grabbing : somebody logs in using another user 's data and then makes direct changes to the profile .
one way to fight that is choosing a non-obvious password , meaning no birthdays or children 's names .
even so , many of the sites are freely accessible through search engines : " all user data for studivz are already published on the net .
you do n't even need to hack it to crack into the system , " says hensen .
another issue to consider is the international nature of many of the social networking sites .
facebook , for example , is one of the leading social communities on the web .
yet while users from germany have the option of using a version of the web site localized into german , the company does not have a german branch office .
that means that it follows the law of the u.s. state of delaware - and as such is subject to much less stringent data protection laws than those in germany . deutsche presse agentur -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

rieger has convictions for holocaust denial and assault .
reporters suggested that the overtly neo-nazi faction within the npd was gaining a greater voice in the anti-foreigner party , which has seats in two of germany 's 16 state assemblies but has never won parliamentary representation at federal level .
a party spokesman later welcomed rieger 's appointment , saying he would energize the npd .
under party leader udo voigt , the npd has sought the support of militants who praise adolf hitler 's national-socialist or nazi doctrines , though voigt insists that the npd 's nationalist views comply with germany 's democratic constitution .
in a speech to delegates , leader voigt won applause as he said the party 's policy was both nationalist and socialist , but used german grammar to carefully separate them into two words . he said this had no connection whatever to the nazi era .
more than 2,000 people demonstrated saturday against the annual convention of the npd in the bavarian city of bamberg .
kurt beck , leader of germany 's co-ruling social democratic party spd , called in leipzig for the npd to be compulsorily dissolved .
" it ought not to be allowed , " he said .
" a robust democracy ought not to give state support to people who want to abolish democracy . " deutsche presse agentur -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said , " i hope that a new government can be formed soon under president suleiman and that the political stalemate and instability in lebanon can be permanently overcome . "
suleiman took his oath of office as the 12th president , filling a post left vacant for six months and ending a political crisis that threatened a new civil war . suleiman , who leaves his post as army chief , was sworn in after garnering 118 of 127 votes in an election by parliament which had been postponed 19 times over the past six months . the ballots had the name of former deputy nassib lahoud , another the name of former late premier rafik hariri and martyrs of lebanon and a third had the name of jean obeid - one of the presidential candidates . " i pledge to respect and protect lebanon 's independence , sovereignty and its constitution , " said suleiman , who was greeted with applause from lawmakers and guests . suleiman addressed the session after a minute 's silence for the martyrs who have died in lebanon since 2005 including the late hariri , who was assassinated in a huge bomb blast .
hariri 's followers blamed the assassination on syria . the new president called for " distinguished and balanced relations " with damascus . he also backed a un international tribunal to try those responsible for the assassination of hariri and other assassination attempts which have targeted anti-syrian officials and journalists . " we should all open a new chapter in favor of lebanon , " the new president said . in reference to the weapons of the shiite movement hezbollah , suleiman called " for adopting a defense strategy so that accomplishments of the resistance -lrb- hezbollah -rrb- would not get lost . " hezbollah has waged a war on israel since the 1980s which led in 2000 to israeli withdrawal from southern lebanon . house speaker nabih berri expressed gratitude to the united states .
he asked president suleiman " to shepherd national dialogue on a defense strategy , " adding a united lebanon and its army would protect the homeland from terrorist threats . berri congratulated suleiman saying : " reconciliation is an essential step for the revival of lebanon . "
he also thanked qatar for his efforts to end the lebanese crisis . the emir of qatar sheikh hamad bin khalif al-thani , who attended the session said : " the winner is lebanon and the loser is the civil strife . " " you and lebanon has made this success in doha , " the emir said afterwards . a qatari-brokered deal last week between rival lebanese leaders defused 18 months of political stalemate that erupted into fighting this month .
iranian-backed hezbollah fighters briefly seized parts of beirut , routing government loyalists . under the doha deal , the priority was to elect a president and then form a national unity government , in which the opposition will have veto power , and a new law for 2009 parliamentary polls . the occasion was summed up by italy 's foreign minister franco frattini , one of several eu and arab foreign ministers attending the session , as " a great day of hope for lebanon , starting a new process of consolidation of democratic institutions . " prior to sunday , parliament had not met for more than a year and a half , during which time the government of prime minister fouad seniora barely functioned . bouts of violence claimed scores of lives and revived memories of the 1975 to 1990 civil war . the other foreign dignitaries attending sunday 's vote included a host of foreign ministers and those of archrivals syria and saudi arabia . the government of premier fouad seniora is now considered an acting government and the new president is due to start consultations to appoint a new prime minister who will later form the national unity cabinet . deutsche presse agentur -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said , " i hope that a new government can be formed soon under president suleiman and that the political stalemate and instability in lebanon can be permanently overcome . "
suleiman took his oath of office as the 12th president , filling a post left vacant for six months and ending a political crisis that threatened a new civil war . suleiman , who leaves his post as army chief , was sworn in after garnering 118 of 127 votes in an election by parliament which had been postponed 19 times over the past six months . the ballots had the name of former deputy nassib lahoud , another the name of former late premier rafik hariri and martyrs of lebanon and a third had the name of jean obeid - one of the presidential candidates . " i pledge to respect and protect lebanon 's independence , sovereignty and its constitution , " said suleiman , who was greeted with applause from lawmakers and guests . suleiman addressed the session after a minute 's silence for the martyrs who have died in lebanon since 2005 including the late hariri , who was assassinated in a huge bomb blast .
hariri 's followers blamed the assassination on syria . the new president called for " distinguished and balanced relations " with damascus . he also backed a un international tribunal to try those responsible for the assassination of hariri and other assassination attempts which have targeted anti-syrian officials and journalists . " we should all open a new chapter in favor of lebanon , " the new president said . in reference to the weapons of the shiite movement hezbollah , suleiman called " for adopting a defense strategy so that accomplishments of the resistance -lrb- hezbollah -rrb- would not get lost . " hezbollah has waged a war on israel since the 1980s which led in 2000 to israeli withdrawal from southern lebanon . house speaker nabih berri expressed gratitude to the united states .
he asked president suleiman " to shepherd national dialogue on a defense strategy , " adding a united lebanon and its army would protect the homeland from terrorist threats . berri congratulated suleiman saying : " reconciliation is an essential step for the revival of lebanon . "
he also thanked qatar for his efforts to end the lebanese crisis . the emir of qatar sheikh hamad bin khalif al-thani , who attended the session said : " the winner is lebanon and the loser is the civil strife . " " you and lebanon has made this success in doha , " the emir said afterwards . a qatari-brokered deal last week between rival lebanese leaders defused 18 months of political stalemate that erupted into fighting this month .
iranian-backed hezbollah fighters briefly seized parts of beirut , routing government loyalists . under the doha deal , the priority was to elect a president and then form a national unity government , in which the opposition will have veto power , and a new law for 2009 parliamentary polls . the occasion was summed up by italy 's foreign minister franco frattini , one of several eu and arab foreign ministers attending the session , as " a great day of hope for lebanon , starting a new process of consolidation of democratic institutions . " prior to sunday , parliament had not met for more than a year and a half , during which time the government of prime minister fouad seniora barely functioned . bouts of violence claimed scores of lives and revived memories of the 1975 to 1990 civil war . the other foreign dignitaries attending sunday 's vote included a host of foreign ministers and those of archrivals syria and saudi arabia . the government of premier fouad seniora is now considered an acting government and the new president is due to start consultations to appoint a new prime minister who will later form the national unity cabinet . deutsche presse agentur -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

rieger has convictions for holocaust denial and assault .
reporters suggested that the overtly neo-nazi faction within the npd was gaining a greater voice in the anti-foreigner party , which has seats in two of germany 's 16 state assemblies but has never won parliamentary representation at federal level .
a party spokesman later welcomed rieger 's appointment , saying he would energize the npd .
under party leader udo voigt , the npd has sought the support of militants who praise adolf hitler 's national-socialist or nazi doctrines , though voigt insists that the npd 's nationalist views comply with germany 's democratic constitution .
in a speech to delegates , leader voigt won applause as he said the party 's policy was both nationalist and socialist , but used german grammar to carefully separate them into two words . he said this had no connection whatever to the nazi era .
more than 2,000 people demonstrated saturday against the annual convention of the npd in the bavarian city of bamberg .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 25.05.2008 fed up with colleges at home , germans go next door to study großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch universities offer mainly small seminars instead of big lectures some 70,000 german students study abroad each year , but most of them do n't go far .
last year , 14,000 went just next door , to the netherlands , with maastricht the destination of choice . it was rush hour in the cafe at the university of maastricht as dozens of students waited in an endless line for their coffee .
it 's no wonder , as this place serves the best cappuccino in town - at least according to julia langenohl . the 19-year-old is originally from wuppertal in western germany , but came to maastricht last fall to study business .
she was looking for a degree program offered in english with an international focus when the university of maastricht caught her eye . " everything is very international here , " she said .
" the education system is better than in germany .
when you look at the universities , you can see that they 've been invested in . " she 's not the only one to appreciate the city 's university : 50 percent of students in maastricht are foreign , and 30 percent of these come from germany . " that 's an important part of our strategy , " said jo ritzen , president of the university and a former dutch minister of education .
the goal is to prepare students for the international job market , he added , and the biggest challenge is to reverse the brain drain by bringing in students from abroad . fighting the brain-drain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : courses are offered in english to avoid language barriers " in the rest of the world , the number of university students will increase , but here it would decrease , " said ritzen . as education minister in the 1990s , ritzen encouraged colleges and universities to further open their doors to foreign students - and with success .
today , in addition to the many german students , 5,000 chinese and 2,500 belgian students live in maastricht , as do many poles , indonesians and americans . one point that foreign school-seekers often find attractive in maastricht is that many courses are offered in english and in very small groups . there are very few lecture halls .
mainly , students are given assignments and expected to work independently with their fellow students - an approach that goes over well with the germans , said arjan vlaskamp , who has studied in maastricht for two years . langenohl said that when she first came to maastricht she was amazed at the resources available to students . " as far as the facilities go , the university of maastricht is comparable to a private university in germany , " she said . the group rooms are renovated and there are projectors and computers everywhere .
each group is assigned a tutor to provide assistance .
all of these perks played a role in julia 's decision to go to maastricht . keeping the foreign students coming other germans go to the netherlands to get around final exams that are required in some subjects in germany , but not in the neighboring country - psychology , for example .

last year , 14,000 went just next door , to the netherlands , with maastricht the destination of choice . it was rush hour in the cafe at the university of maastricht as dozens of students waited in an endless line for their coffee .
it 's no wonder , as this place serves the best cappuccino in town - at least according to julia langenohl . the 19-year-old is originally from wuppertal in western germany , but came to maastricht last fall to study business .
she was looking for a degree program offered in english with an international focus when the university of maastricht caught her eye . " everything is very international here , " she said .

private information should only be divulged cautiously , they say . staying in contact with friends , swapping photos , or even making new business contacts - these are all stock- in-trade for web 2.0 social networks .
there are now various platforms oriented toward helping users make contact with one another .
but there are drawbacks and potential dangers linked to sites such as facebook and xing , according to german privacy specialists .
" the big problem with social networks is that you do n't know just who can poke around in there , " says henry krasemann , an expert at the independent centre for data protection for schleswig-holstein in kiel , germany .
that means that employers can potentially also access the data .
that 's why data protection specialists recommend storing as little private information as possible online .
" under no circumstances should you be putting bikini or party photos up onto a network of that kind , " says constanze kurz , spokeswoman for the chaos computer club -lrb- ccc -rrb- in berlin .
other threats can come through the websites ' general terms and conditions .
the german networks meinvz and schuelervz recently raised eyebrows with their unusually intrusive demands .
users had to agree to personalized advertising to retain access .
these terms have been adjusted in the interim , confirms studivz spokesman dirk hensen .
" if users do n't want that kind of advertising , they can opt to receive standard advertisements and the account used as before , " hensen says .
this is not the only important setting that is not by default geared toward increased privacy , such as standard settings on who may view a user 's profile .
identity theft a real problem for sites another problem for social networks is identity grabbing : somebody logs in using another user 's data and then makes direct changes to the profile .
one way to fight that is choosing a non-obvious password , meaning no birthdays or children 's names .
even so , many of the sites are freely accessible through search engines : " all user data for studivz are already published on the net .
you do n't even need to hack it to crack into the system , " says hensen .
another issue to consider is the international nature of many of the social networking sites .
facebook , for example , is one of the leading social communities on the web .
yet while users from germany have the option of using a version of the web site localized into german , the company does not have a german branch office .

while plans for an eu common defence policy are still at the embryonic stage , the bloc has already deployed peacekeepers to bosnia-herzegovina and chad and is training policemen in afghanistan and the western balkans .
georgia on friday joined the list of countries seeking help from brussels in training its security forces .
much of the discussions , however , are likely to focus on the eu-lex law mission in kosovo , which was originally meant to take over the administration of the newly-independent country from the united nations on june 15 .
eu officials now concede that legal and logistical difficulties mean that deadline is unrealistic .
while the mission 's overall goal " has not changed , " ministers are unlikely to commit themselves to a new date , sources from the slovenian presidency of the eu said .
tuesday 's discussions will turn to development and aid issues amid calls from the european commission for governments to commit more funds and demands for help from china and myanmar .
ministers are likely to reaffirm their " serious concern " about the violence and irregularities that have marred elections in zimbabwe , where a run-off vote for the presidency is due to take place on june 27 , nearly three months after the first round of voting took place .
the meeting 's overall objective is to prepare the groundwork for the regular summer gathering of eu heads of government and state , due to take place june 19-20 .
poland calls for an eastern alliance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland wants an eastern version of sarkozy 's club med at their last summit , eu leaders backed french calls to revamp their relations with their southern neighbors through the creation of a union for the mediterranean .
but poland insisted at the time that the eu should also forge closer ties to the east .
those polish calls have now developed into a proposed eastern partnership .
backed by sweden and blessed by heavyweights france and germany , the eastern partnership would seek to negotiate visa-free travel and create free-trade zones with ukraine , moldova , georgia , armenia and azerbaijan .
poland and sweden argue that their initiative will help steer ukraine away from moscow and closer to the west .
since it will not cost more money and will not create more bureaucracy , they are optimistic that it can enjoy the backing of other member states .
the european commission has not been consulted and says it is eager to hear from warsaw and stockholm .
at the same time , officials in brussels note that just as with french president nicolas sarkozy 's plan for a mediterranean union , the eastern partnership would only be given serious consideration if it can provide " added value " and avoid duplication in its structures .

a breakthrough on the issue was obtained by eu ambassadors on wednesday , after lithuania agreed to withdraw its veto in protest at russia 's closure of the main oil pipeline into lithuania , its treatment of georgia and its refusal to hand over men suspected of committing atrocities in lithuania in 1991 .
while the launch of talks is due to be agreed by ministers without discussion , eu diplomats warn that that deal is not yet in the bag .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 25.05.2008 german privacy specialists warn of social network dangers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : social networks like facebook can be accessed by people who may not be friends german privacy specialists are concerned about the practices of online social networks and recommend against revealing too much about yourself .
private information should only be divulged cautiously , they say . staying in contact with friends , swapping photos , or even making new business contacts - these are all stock- in-trade for web 2.0 social networks .
there are now various platforms oriented toward helping users make contact with one another .
but there are drawbacks and potential dangers linked to sites such as facebook and xing , according to german privacy specialists .
" the big problem with social networks is that you do n't know just who can poke around in there , " says henry krasemann , an expert at the independent centre for data protection for schleswig-holstein in kiel , germany .
that means that employers can potentially also access the data .
that 's why data protection specialists recommend storing as little private information as possible online .
" under no circumstances should you be putting bikini or party photos up onto a network of that kind , " says constanze kurz , spokeswoman for the chaos computer club -lrb- ccc -rrb- in berlin .
other threats can come through the websites ' general terms and conditions .
the german networks meinvz and schuelervz recently raised eyebrows with their unusually intrusive demands .
users had to agree to personalized advertising to retain access .
these terms have been adjusted in the interim , confirms studivz spokesman dirk hensen .
" if users do n't want that kind of advertising , they can opt to receive standard advertisements and the account used as before , " hensen says .
this is not the only important setting that is not by default geared toward increased privacy , such as standard settings on who may view a user 's profile .
identity theft a real problem for sites another problem for social networks is identity grabbing : somebody logs in using another user 's data and then makes direct changes to the profile .
one way to fight that is choosing a non-obvious password , meaning no birthdays or children 's names .
even so , many of the sites are freely accessible through search engines : " all user data for studivz are already published on the net .
you do n't even need to hack it to crack into the system , " says hensen .
another issue to consider is the international nature of many of the social networking sites .
facebook , for example , is one of the leading social communities on the web .
yet while users from germany have the option of using a version of the web site localized into german , the company does not have a german branch office .
that means that it follows the law of the u.s. state of delaware - and as such is subject to much less stringent data protection laws than those in germany . deutsche presse agentur -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

rieger has convictions for holocaust denial and assault .
reporters suggested that the overtly neo-nazi faction within the npd was gaining a greater voice in the anti-foreigner party , which has seats in two of germany 's 16 state assemblies but has never won parliamentary representation at federal level .
a party spokesman later welcomed rieger 's appointment , saying he would energize the npd .
under party leader udo voigt , the npd has sought the support of militants who praise adolf hitler 's national-socialist or nazi doctrines , though voigt insists that the npd 's nationalist views comply with germany 's democratic constitution .
in a speech to delegates , leader voigt won applause as he said the party 's policy was both nationalist and socialist , but used german grammar to carefully separate them into two words . he said this had no connection whatever to the nazi era .
more than 2,000 people demonstrated saturday against the annual convention of the npd in the bavarian city of bamberg .
kurt beck , leader of germany 's co-ruling social democratic party spd , called in leipzig for the npd to be compulsorily dissolved .
" it ought not to be allowed , " he said .

poland calls for an eastern alliance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland wants an eastern version of sarkozy 's club med at their last summit , eu leaders backed french calls to revamp their relations with their southern neighbors through the creation of a union for the mediterranean .

backed by sweden and blessed by heavyweights france and germany , the eastern partnership would seek to negotiate visa-free travel and create free-trade zones with ukraine , moldova , georgia , armenia and azerbaijan .

the european commission has not been consulted and says it is eager to hear from warsaw and stockholm .
at the same time , officials in brussels note that just as with french president nicolas sarkozy 's plan for a mediterranean union , the eastern partnership would only be given serious consideration if it can provide " added value " and avoid duplication in its structures .

private information should only be divulged cautiously , they say . staying in contact with friends , swapping photos , or even making new business contacts - these are all stock- in-trade for web 2.0 social networks .
there are now various platforms oriented toward helping users make contact with one another .
but there are drawbacks and potential dangers linked to sites such as facebook and xing , according to german privacy specialists .
" the big problem with social networks is that you do n't know just who can poke around in there , " says henry krasemann , an expert at the independent centre for data protection for schleswig-holstein in kiel , germany .
that means that employers can potentially also access the data .
that 's why data protection specialists recommend storing as little private information as possible online .
" under no circumstances should you be putting bikini or party photos up onto a network of that kind , " says constanze kurz , spokeswoman for the chaos computer club -lrb- ccc -rrb- in berlin .
other threats can come through the websites ' general terms and conditions .
the german networks meinvz and schuelervz recently raised eyebrows with their unusually intrusive demands .
users had to agree to personalized advertising to retain access .
these terms have been adjusted in the interim , confirms studivz spokesman dirk hensen .
" if users do n't want that kind of advertising , they can opt to receive standard advertisements and the account used as before , " hensen says .
this is not the only important setting that is not by default geared toward increased privacy , such as standard settings on who may view a user 's profile .
identity theft a real problem for sites another problem for social networks is identity grabbing : somebody logs in using another user 's data and then makes direct changes to the profile .
one way to fight that is choosing a non-obvious password , meaning no birthdays or children 's names .
even so , many of the sites are freely accessible through search engines : " all user data for studivz are already published on the net .
you do n't even need to hack it to crack into the system , " says hensen .
another issue to consider is the international nature of many of the social networking sites .
facebook , for example , is one of the leading social communities on the web .
yet while users from germany have the option of using a version of the web site localized into german , the company does not have a german branch office .

rieger has convictions for holocaust denial and assault .
reporters suggested that the overtly neo-nazi faction within the npd was gaining a greater voice in the anti-foreigner party , which has seats in two of germany 's 16 state assemblies but has never won parliamentary representation at federal level .
a party spokesman later welcomed rieger 's appointment , saying he would energize the npd .
under party leader udo voigt , the npd has sought the support of militants who praise adolf hitler 's national-socialist or nazi doctrines , though voigt insists that the npd 's nationalist views comply with germany 's democratic constitution .
in a speech to delegates , leader voigt won applause as he said the party 's policy was both nationalist and socialist , but used german grammar to carefully separate them into two words . he said this had no connection whatever to the nazi era .
more than 2,000 people demonstrated saturday against the annual convention of the npd in the bavarian city of bamberg .

german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said , " i hope that a new government can be formed soon under president suleiman and that the political stalemate and instability in lebanon can be permanently overcome . "
suleiman took his oath of office as the 12th president , filling a post left vacant for six months and ending a political crisis that threatened a new civil war . suleiman , who leaves his post as army chief , was sworn in after garnering 118 of 127 votes in an election by parliament which had been postponed 19 times over the past six months . the ballots had the name of former deputy nassib lahoud , another the name of former late premier rafik hariri and martyrs of lebanon and a third had the name of jean obeid - one of the presidential candidates . " i pledge to respect and protect lebanon 's independence , sovereignty and its constitution , " said suleiman , who was greeted with applause from lawmakers and guests . suleiman addressed the session after a minute 's silence for the martyrs who have died in lebanon since 2005 including the late hariri , who was assassinated in a huge bomb blast .
hariri 's followers blamed the assassination on syria . the new president called for " distinguished and balanced relations " with damascus . he also backed a un international tribunal to try those responsible for the assassination of hariri and other assassination attempts which have targeted anti-syrian officials and journalists . " we should all open a new chapter in favor of lebanon , " the new president said . in reference to the weapons of the shiite movement hezbollah , suleiman called " for adopting a defense strategy so that accomplishments of the resistance -lrb- hezbollah -rrb- would not get lost . " hezbollah has waged a war on israel since the 1980s which led in 2000 to israeli withdrawal from southern lebanon . house speaker nabih berri expressed gratitude to the united states .
he asked president suleiman " to shepherd national dialogue on a defense strategy , " adding a united lebanon and its army would protect the homeland from terrorist threats . berri congratulated suleiman saying : " reconciliation is an essential step for the revival of lebanon . "
he also thanked qatar for his efforts to end the lebanese crisis . the emir of qatar sheikh hamad bin khalif al-thani , who attended the session said : " the winner is lebanon and the loser is the civil strife . " " you and lebanon has made this success in doha , " the emir said afterwards . a qatari-brokered deal last week between rival lebanese leaders defused 18 months of political stalemate that erupted into fighting this month .
iranian-backed hezbollah fighters briefly seized parts of beirut , routing government loyalists . under the doha deal , the priority was to elect a president and then form a national unity government , in which the opposition will have veto power , and a new law for 2009 parliamentary polls . the occasion was summed up by italy 's foreign minister franco frattini , one of several eu and arab foreign ministers attending the session , as " a great day of hope for lebanon , starting a new process of consolidation of democratic institutions . " prior to sunday , parliament had not met for more than a year and a half , during which time the government of prime minister fouad seniora barely functioned . bouts of violence claimed scores of lives and revived memories of the 1975 to 1990 civil war . the other foreign dignitaries attending sunday 's vote included a host of foreign ministers and those of archrivals syria and saudi arabia . the government of premier fouad seniora is now considered an acting government and the new president is due to start consultations to appoint a new prime minister who will later form the national unity cabinet . deutsche presse agentur -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while plans for an eu common defence policy are still at the embryonic stage , the bloc has already deployed peacekeepers to bosnia-herzegovina and chad and is training policemen in afghanistan and the western balkans .
georgia on friday joined the list of countries seeking help from brussels in training its security forces .
much of the discussions , however , are likely to focus on the eu-lex law mission in kosovo , which was originally meant to take over the administration of the newly-independent country from the united nations on june 15 .
eu officials now concede that legal and logistical difficulties mean that deadline is unrealistic .
while the mission 's overall goal " has not changed , " ministers are unlikely to commit themselves to a new date , sources from the slovenian presidency of the eu said .
tuesday 's discussions will turn to development and aid issues amid calls from the european commission for governments to commit more funds and demands for help from china and myanmar .
ministers are likely to reaffirm their " serious concern " about the violence and irregularities that have marred elections in zimbabwe , where a run-off vote for the presidency is due to take place on june 27 , nearly three months after the first round of voting took place .
the meeting 's overall objective is to prepare the groundwork for the regular summer gathering of eu heads of government and state , due to take place june 19-20 .
poland calls for an eastern alliance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland wants an eastern version of sarkozy 's club med at their last summit , eu leaders backed french calls to revamp their relations with their southern neighbors through the creation of a union for the mediterranean .
but poland insisted at the time that the eu should also forge closer ties to the east .
those polish calls have now developed into a proposed eastern partnership .
backed by sweden and blessed by heavyweights france and germany , the eastern partnership would seek to negotiate visa-free travel and create free-trade zones with ukraine , moldova , georgia , armenia and azerbaijan .
poland and sweden argue that their initiative will help steer ukraine away from moscow and closer to the west .
since it will not cost more money and will not create more bureaucracy , they are optimistic that it can enjoy the backing of other member states .
the european commission has not been consulted and says it is eager to hear from warsaw and stockholm .
at the same time , officials in brussels note that just as with french president nicolas sarkozy 's plan for a mediterranean union , the eastern partnership would only be given serious consideration if it can provide " added value " and avoid duplication in its structures .
russia deal likely to be formally agreed upon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia and the eu have been facing off of late during their meeting , the eu 's foreign ministers are expected to give their formal backing to the launch of long-awaited talks on a strategic deal with russia .
a breakthrough on the issue was obtained by eu ambassadors on wednesday , after lithuania agreed to withdraw its veto in protest at russia 's closure of the main oil pipeline into lithuania , its treatment of georgia and its refusal to hand over men suspected of committing atrocities in lithuania in 1991 .
while the launch of talks is due to be agreed by ministers without discussion , eu diplomats warn that that deal is not yet in the bag .

those who dare to criticize often come under enormous pressure , says milan-based journalist kirstin hausen . television host fabio fazio knew what he was getting into when he invited journalist marco travaglio to be a guest on his show .
travaglio does n't mince words , especially when it comes to criticizing italian politicians .
over the years , travaglio has gained the reputation of being italy 's most outspoken journalist .
on fazio 's show , he spoke openly about a topic that everyone more or less knew about , but which had n't been openly discussed : the past mafia connections of current senate president renato schifani .
the fact that travaglio dared to speak openly about the subject caused a furor in italy , with schifani threatening to sue for slander , a common weapon used against outspoken journalists in italy .
many journalists steer clear of criticism even during the live television interview , host fabio fazio distanced himself from the accusations .
he looked into the camera , an embarrassed expression on his face , and apologized to newly re-elected premier and media magnate silvio berlusconi .
berlusconi is not a fan of airing such uncomfortable truths about his party supporters , yet politicians from other parties also have taken to ranting daily in talk shows and newspapers on the topic .
the real scandal has been completely pushed to the background : namely that the newly elected senate president had mafia ties .
yet it was travaglio who was denounced for openly discussing the matter .
politicians vs. journalists the state television broadcaster rai , which aired the live discussion with marco travaglio , has publicly apologized to schifani .
the ruling parties welcomed the apology as did giovanna meladri , the communication director for the opposition .
no one from opposition leader walter vetroni 's party defended travaglio .
but this does n't bother travaglio .
he stands by his reporting .
" i am a journalist and i do n't care what politicians say about me , " travaglio said .
" journalists have to tell people the truth and that is what i have done . "
travaglio understands his journalistic responsibilities and he has a work ethic that many italian journalists seem to have lost long ago .
travaglio said he sees it as a tragedy that italian newspapers only write about what the television news reported on the day before .
politicians then pick up on these reports and react if they do n't like what they see or hear .
politicians stand ready to " muzzle journalists , " travaglio said .
journalists know it and " restrain themselves accordingly . "
italian public largely apathetic for certain topics , censorship is n't even necessary as journalists practice self-censorship to avoid trouble .
plus , there 's no clamor for the type of investigative reporting done by travaglio .
many italians are simply not interested in knowing about the underhanded dealings of the political class .
writer nanni ballestrini calls it a " weak dictatorship . "
italians are complicit in the set-up , ballestrini said .
in fact , there 's grudging admiration of a clever politician , such as berlusconi , who can hold on to power even while under investigation .
but that does n't mean berlusconi wants his legal maneuverings spoken about in the media .
at his own television channels , a call is all it takes to spike critical news reports .
at the state television station rai the influence is less direct , but nevertheless noticeable .
in italy the ruling parties decide the top positions at the television station , which means they can put their cronies in charge .
the new government will decide on how to fill these posts very soon .

those who dare to criticize often come under enormous pressure , says milan-based journalist kirstin hausen . television host fabio fazio knew what he was getting into when he invited journalist marco travaglio to be a guest on his show .
travaglio does n't mince words , especially when it comes to criticizing italian politicians .
over the years , travaglio has gained the reputation of being italy 's most outspoken journalist .
on fazio 's show , he spoke openly about a topic that everyone more or less knew about , but which had n't been openly discussed : the past mafia connections of current senate president renato schifani .
the fact that travaglio dared to speak openly about the subject caused a furor in italy , with schifani threatening to sue for slander , a common weapon used against outspoken journalists in italy .
many journalists steer clear of criticism even during the live television interview , host fabio fazio distanced himself from the accusations .
he looked into the camera , an embarrassed expression on his face , and apologized to newly re-elected premier and media magnate silvio berlusconi .
berlusconi is not a fan of airing such uncomfortable truths about his party supporters , yet politicians from other parties also have taken to ranting daily in talk shows and newspapers on the topic .
the real scandal has been completely pushed to the background : namely that the newly elected senate president had mafia ties .
yet it was travaglio who was denounced for openly discussing the matter .
politicians vs. journalists the state television broadcaster rai , which aired the live discussion with marco travaglio , has publicly apologized to schifani .
the ruling parties welcomed the apology as did giovanna meladri , the communication director for the opposition .
no one from opposition leader walter vetroni 's party defended travaglio .
but this does n't bother travaglio .
he stands by his reporting .
" i am a journalist and i do n't care what politicians say about me , " travaglio said .
" journalists have to tell people the truth and that is what i have done . "
travaglio understands his journalistic responsibilities and he has a work ethic that many italian journalists seem to have lost long ago .
travaglio said he sees it as a tragedy that italian newspapers only write about what the television news reported on the day before .
politicians then pick up on these reports and react if they do n't like what they see or hear .
politicians stand ready to " muzzle journalists , " travaglio said .
journalists know it and " restrain themselves accordingly . "
italian public largely apathetic for certain topics , censorship is n't even necessary as journalists practice self-censorship to avoid trouble .
plus , there 's no clamor for the type of investigative reporting done by travaglio .
many italians are simply not interested in knowing about the underhanded dealings of the political class .
writer nanni ballestrini calls it a " weak dictatorship . "

on fazio 's show , he spoke openly about a topic that everyone more or less knew about , but which had n't been openly discussed : the past mafia connections of current senate president renato schifani .
the fact that travaglio dared to speak openly about the subject caused a furor in italy , with schifani threatening to sue for slander , a common weapon used against outspoken journalists in italy .
many journalists steer clear of criticism even during the live television interview , host fabio fazio distanced himself from the accusations .
he looked into the camera , an embarrassed expression on his face , and apologized to newly re-elected premier and media magnate silvio berlusconi .
berlusconi is not a fan of airing such uncomfortable truths about his party supporters , yet politicians from other parties also have taken to ranting daily in talk shows and newspapers on the topic .
the real scandal has been completely pushed to the background : namely that the newly elected senate president had mafia ties .
yet it was travaglio who was denounced for openly discussing the matter .
politicians vs. journalists the state television broadcaster rai , which aired the live discussion with marco travaglio , has publicly apologized to schifani .
the ruling parties welcomed the apology as did giovanna meladri , the communication director for the opposition .
no one from opposition leader walter vetroni 's party defended travaglio .
but this does n't bother travaglio .
he stands by his reporting .
" i am a journalist and i do n't care what politicians say about me , " travaglio said .
" journalists have to tell people the truth and that is what i have done . "
travaglio understands his journalistic responsibilities and he has a work ethic that many italian journalists seem to have lost long ago .
travaglio said he sees it as a tragedy that italian newspapers only write about what the television news reported on the day before .
politicians then pick up on these reports and react if they do n't like what they see or hear .
politicians stand ready to " muzzle journalists , " travaglio said .
journalists know it and " restrain themselves accordingly . "
italian public largely apathetic for certain topics , censorship is n't even necessary as journalists practice self-censorship to avoid trouble .
plus , there 's no clamor for the type of investigative reporting done by travaglio .
many italians are simply not interested in knowing about the underhanded dealings of the political class .
writer nanni ballestrini calls it a " weak dictatorship . "
italians are complicit in the set-up , ballestrini said .
in fact , there 's grudging admiration of a clever politician , such as berlusconi , who can hold on to power even while under investigation .
but that does n't mean berlusconi wants his legal maneuverings spoken about in the media .
at his own television channels , a call is all it takes to spike critical news reports .
at the state television station rai the influence is less direct , but nevertheless noticeable .
in italy the ruling parties decide the top positions at the television station , which means they can put their cronies in charge .
the new government will decide on how to fill these posts very soon .

those who dare to criticize often come under enormous pressure , says milan-based journalist kirstin hausen . television host fabio fazio knew what he was getting into when he invited journalist marco travaglio to be a guest on his show .
travaglio does n't mince words , especially when it comes to criticizing italian politicians .
over the years , travaglio has gained the reputation of being italy 's most outspoken journalist .
on fazio 's show , he spoke openly about a topic that everyone more or less knew about , but which had n't been openly discussed : the past mafia connections of current senate president renato schifani .
the fact that travaglio dared to speak openly about the subject caused a furor in italy , with schifani threatening to sue for slander , a common weapon used against outspoken journalists in italy .
many journalists steer clear of criticism even during the live television interview , host fabio fazio distanced himself from the accusations .
he looked into the camera , an embarrassed expression on his face , and apologized to newly re-elected premier and media magnate silvio berlusconi .
berlusconi is not a fan of airing such uncomfortable truths about his party supporters , yet politicians from other parties also have taken to ranting daily in talk shows and newspapers on the topic .
the real scandal has been completely pushed to the background : namely that the newly elected senate president had mafia ties .
yet it was travaglio who was denounced for openly discussing the matter .
politicians vs. journalists the state television broadcaster rai , which aired the live discussion with marco travaglio , has publicly apologized to schifani .
the ruling parties welcomed the apology as did giovanna meladri , the communication director for the opposition .
no one from opposition leader walter vetroni 's party defended travaglio .
but this does n't bother travaglio .
he stands by his reporting .
" i am a journalist and i do n't care what politicians say about me , " travaglio said .
" journalists have to tell people the truth and that is what i have done . "
travaglio understands his journalistic responsibilities and he has a work ethic that many italian journalists seem to have lost long ago .
travaglio said he sees it as a tragedy that italian newspapers only write about what the television news reported on the day before .
politicians then pick up on these reports and react if they do n't like what they see or hear .
politicians stand ready to " muzzle journalists , " travaglio said .
journalists know it and " restrain themselves accordingly . "

rieger has convictions for holocaust denial and assault .
reporters suggested that the overtly neo-nazi faction within the npd was gaining a greater voice in the anti-foreigner party , which has seats in two of germany 's 16 state assemblies but has never won parliamentary representation at federal level .
a party spokesman later welcomed rieger 's appointment , saying he would energize the npd .
under party leader udo voigt , the npd has sought the support of militants who praise adolf hitler 's national-socialist or nazi doctrines , though voigt insists that the npd 's nationalist views comply with germany 's democratic constitution .
in a speech to delegates , leader voigt won applause as he said the party 's policy was both nationalist and socialist , but used german grammar to carefully separate them into two words . he said this had no connection whatever to the nazi era .
more than 2,000 people demonstrated saturday against the annual convention of the npd in the bavarian city of bamberg .
kurt beck , leader of germany 's co-ruling social democratic party spd , called in leipzig for the npd to be compulsorily dissolved .
" it ought not to be allowed , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 25.05.2008 fed up with colleges at home , germans go next door to study großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch universities offer mainly small seminars instead of big lectures some 70,000 german students study abroad each year , but most of them do n't go far .
last year , 14,000 went just next door , to the netherlands , with maastricht the destination of choice . it was rush hour in the cafe at the university of maastricht as dozens of students waited in an endless line for their coffee .
it 's no wonder , as this place serves the best cappuccino in town - at least according to julia langenohl . the 19-year-old is originally from wuppertal in western germany , but came to maastricht last fall to study business .
she was looking for a degree program offered in english with an international focus when the university of maastricht caught her eye . " everything is very international here , " she said .
" the education system is better than in germany .
when you look at the universities , you can see that they 've been invested in . " she 's not the only one to appreciate the city 's university : 50 percent of students in maastricht are foreign , and 30 percent of these come from germany . " that 's an important part of our strategy , " said jo ritzen , president of the university and a former dutch minister of education .
the goal is to prepare students for the international job market , he added , and the biggest challenge is to reverse the brain drain by bringing in students from abroad . fighting the brain-drain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : courses are offered in english to avoid language barriers " in the rest of the world , the number of university students will increase , but here it would decrease , " said ritzen . as education minister in the 1990s , ritzen encouraged colleges and universities to further open their doors to foreign students - and with success .
today , in addition to the many german students , 5,000 chinese and 2,500 belgian students live in maastricht , as do many poles , indonesians and americans . one point that foreign school-seekers often find attractive in maastricht is that many courses are offered in english and in very small groups . there are very few lecture halls .
mainly , students are given assignments and expected to work independently with their fellow students - an approach that goes over well with the germans , said arjan vlaskamp , who has studied in maastricht for two years . langenohl said that when she first came to maastricht she was amazed at the resources available to students . " as far as the facilities go , the university of maastricht is comparable to a private university in germany , " she said . the group rooms are renovated and there are projectors and computers everywhere .
each group is assigned a tutor to provide assistance .
all of these perks played a role in julia 's decision to go to maastricht . keeping the foreign students coming other germans go to the netherlands to get around final exams that are required in some subjects in germany , but not in the neighboring country - psychology , for example .
that 's why more than 350 german psychology students have made their way to maastricht . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maastricht in southernmost holland has a charming old town while dutch universities may offer a few advantages that are particularly attractive to foreign students , they also actively recruit in other european countries .
in germany , for example , they regularly hold informational seminars and have set up a special web site for german students in holland . financial motivation also plays a role in recruitment . " every dean knows that he gets more money , when he has more students and more graduates , " ritzen said . universities in the netherlands are paid according to the number of students and graduates they have , which ritzen says means between 10,000 and 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 15,800-31,500 -rrb- per degree per year . expanding horizons , erasing borders for langenohl and vlaskamp , studying abroad is n't only about getting a high quality education , but also learning about a new culture . while seminars at the university are in english , vlaskamp 's friends are mainly german and dutch .
sometimes he even uses all three languages in the same sentence . " i 'm from goch , which is pretty close to the german-dutch border , " he said .
" there 's practically no border there anymore ; it gets more blurred every year . " ruth reichstein -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

last year , 14,000 went just next door , to the netherlands , with maastricht the destination of choice . it was rush hour in the cafe at the university of maastricht as dozens of students waited in an endless line for their coffee .
it 's no wonder , as this place serves the best cappuccino in town - at least according to julia langenohl . the 19-year-old is originally from wuppertal in western germany , but came to maastricht last fall to study business .
she was looking for a degree program offered in english with an international focus when the university of maastricht caught her eye . " everything is very international here , " she said .
" the education system is better than in germany .
when you look at the universities , you can see that they 've been invested in . " she 's not the only one to appreciate the city 's university : 50 percent of students in maastricht are foreign , and 30 percent of these come from germany .

those who dare to criticize often come under enormous pressure , says milan-based journalist kirstin hausen . television host fabio fazio knew what he was getting into when he invited journalist marco travaglio to be a guest on his show .
travaglio does n't mince words , especially when it comes to criticizing italian politicians .
over the years , travaglio has gained the reputation of being italy 's most outspoken journalist .
on fazio 's show , he spoke openly about a topic that everyone more or less knew about , but which had n't been openly discussed : the past mafia connections of current senate president renato schifani .
the fact that travaglio dared to speak openly about the subject caused a furor in italy , with schifani threatening to sue for slander , a common weapon used against outspoken journalists in italy .
many journalists steer clear of criticism even during the live television interview , host fabio fazio distanced himself from the accusations .
he looked into the camera , an embarrassed expression on his face , and apologized to newly re-elected premier and media magnate silvio berlusconi .
berlusconi is not a fan of airing such uncomfortable truths about his party supporters , yet politicians from other parties also have taken to ranting daily in talk shows and newspapers on the topic .
the real scandal has been completely pushed to the background : namely that the newly elected senate president had mafia ties .
yet it was travaglio who was denounced for openly discussing the matter .
politicians vs. journalists the state television broadcaster rai , which aired the live discussion with marco travaglio , has publicly apologized to schifani .
the ruling parties welcomed the apology as did giovanna meladri , the communication director for the opposition .
no one from opposition leader walter vetroni 's party defended travaglio .
but this does n't bother travaglio .
he stands by his reporting .
" i am a journalist and i do n't care what politicians say about me , " travaglio said .
" journalists have to tell people the truth and that is what i have done . "
travaglio understands his journalistic responsibilities and he has a work ethic that many italian journalists seem to have lost long ago .
travaglio said he sees it as a tragedy that italian newspapers only write about what the television news reported on the day before .
politicians then pick up on these reports and react if they do n't like what they see or hear .
politicians stand ready to " muzzle journalists , " travaglio said .
journalists know it and " restrain themselves accordingly . "
italian public largely apathetic for certain topics , censorship is n't even necessary as journalists practice self-censorship to avoid trouble .
plus , there 's no clamor for the type of investigative reporting done by travaglio .
many italians are simply not interested in knowing about the underhanded dealings of the political class .
writer nanni ballestrini calls it a " weak dictatorship . "
italians are complicit in the set-up , ballestrini said .
in fact , there 's grudging admiration of a clever politician , such as berlusconi , who can hold on to power even while under investigation .
but that does n't mean berlusconi wants his legal maneuverings spoken about in the media .
at his own television channels , a call is all it takes to spike critical news reports .
at the state television station rai the influence is less direct , but nevertheless noticeable .
in italy the ruling parties decide the top positions at the television station , which means they can put their cronies in charge .
the new government will decide on how to fill these posts very soon .

those who dare to criticize often come under enormous pressure , says milan-based journalist kirstin hausen . television host fabio fazio knew what he was getting into when he invited journalist marco travaglio to be a guest on his show .
travaglio does n't mince words , especially when it comes to criticizing italian politicians .
over the years , travaglio has gained the reputation of being italy 's most outspoken journalist .
on fazio 's show , he spoke openly about a topic that everyone more or less knew about , but which had n't been openly discussed : the past mafia connections of current senate president renato schifani .
the fact that travaglio dared to speak openly about the subject caused a furor in italy , with schifani threatening to sue for slander , a common weapon used against outspoken journalists in italy .
many journalists steer clear of criticism even during the live television interview , host fabio fazio distanced himself from the accusations .
he looked into the camera , an embarrassed expression on his face , and apologized to newly re-elected premier and media magnate silvio berlusconi .
berlusconi is not a fan of airing such uncomfortable truths about his party supporters , yet politicians from other parties also have taken to ranting daily in talk shows and newspapers on the topic .
the real scandal has been completely pushed to the background : namely that the newly elected senate president had mafia ties .
yet it was travaglio who was denounced for openly discussing the matter .
politicians vs. journalists the state television broadcaster rai , which aired the live discussion with marco travaglio , has publicly apologized to schifani .
the ruling parties welcomed the apology as did giovanna meladri , the communication director for the opposition .
no one from opposition leader walter vetroni 's party defended travaglio .
but this does n't bother travaglio .
he stands by his reporting .
" i am a journalist and i do n't care what politicians say about me , " travaglio said .
" journalists have to tell people the truth and that is what i have done . "
travaglio understands his journalistic responsibilities and he has a work ethic that many italian journalists seem to have lost long ago .
travaglio said he sees it as a tragedy that italian newspapers only write about what the television news reported on the day before .
politicians then pick up on these reports and react if they do n't like what they see or hear .
politicians stand ready to " muzzle journalists , " travaglio said .
journalists know it and " restrain themselves accordingly . "
italian public largely apathetic for certain topics , censorship is n't even necessary as journalists practice self-censorship to avoid trouble .
plus , there 's no clamor for the type of investigative reporting done by travaglio .
many italians are simply not interested in knowing about the underhanded dealings of the political class .
writer nanni ballestrini calls it a " weak dictatorship . "
italians are complicit in the set-up , ballestrini said .
in fact , there 's grudging admiration of a clever politician , such as berlusconi , who can hold on to power even while under investigation .
but that does n't mean berlusconi wants his legal maneuverings spoken about in the media .
at his own television channels , a call is all it takes to spike critical news reports .
at the state television station rai the influence is less direct , but nevertheless noticeable .
in italy the ruling parties decide the top positions at the television station , which means they can put their cronies in charge .
the new government will decide on how to fill these posts very soon .

last year , 14,000 went just next door , to the netherlands , with maastricht the destination of choice . it was rush hour in the cafe at the university of maastricht as dozens of students waited in an endless line for their coffee .
it 's no wonder , as this place serves the best cappuccino in town - at least according to julia langenohl . the 19-year-old is originally from wuppertal in western germany , but came to maastricht last fall to study business .
she was looking for a degree program offered in english with an international focus when the university of maastricht caught her eye . " everything is very international here , " she said .
" the education system is better than in germany .
when you look at the universities , you can see that they 've been invested in . " she 's not the only one to appreciate the city 's university : 50 percent of students in maastricht are foreign , and 30 percent of these come from germany . " that 's an important part of our strategy , " said jo ritzen , president of the university and a former dutch minister of education .

today , in addition to the many german students , 5,000 chinese and 2,500 belgian students live in maastricht , as do many poles , indonesians and americans . one point that foreign school-seekers often find attractive in maastricht is that many courses are offered in english and in very small groups . there are very few lecture halls .
mainly , students are given assignments and expected to work independently with their fellow students - an approach that goes over well with the germans , said arjan vlaskamp , who has studied in maastricht for two years . langenohl said that when she first came to maastricht she was amazed at the resources available to students . " as far as the facilities go , the university of maastricht is comparable to a private university in germany , " she said . the group rooms are renovated and there are projectors and computers everywhere .
each group is assigned a tutor to provide assistance .
all of these perks played a role in julia 's decision to go to maastricht . keeping the foreign students coming other germans go to the netherlands to get around final exams that are required in some subjects in germany , but not in the neighboring country - psychology , for example .
that 's why more than 350 german psychology students have made their way to maastricht . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maastricht in southernmost holland has a charming old town while dutch universities may offer a few advantages that are particularly attractive to foreign students , they also actively recruit in other european countries .

german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said , " i hope that a new government can be formed soon under president suleiman and that the political stalemate and instability in lebanon can be permanently overcome . "
suleiman took his oath of office as the 12th president , filling a post left vacant for six months and ending a political crisis that threatened a new civil war . suleiman , who leaves his post as army chief , was sworn in after garnering 118 of 127 votes in an election by parliament which had been postponed 19 times over the past six months . the ballots had the name of former deputy nassib lahoud , another the name of former late premier rafik hariri and martyrs of lebanon and a third had the name of jean obeid - one of the presidential candidates . " i pledge to respect and protect lebanon 's independence , sovereignty and its constitution , " said suleiman , who was greeted with applause from lawmakers and guests . suleiman addressed the session after a minute 's silence for the martyrs who have died in lebanon since 2005 including the late hariri , who was assassinated in a huge bomb blast .
hariri 's followers blamed the assassination on syria . the new president called for " distinguished and balanced relations " with damascus . he also backed a un international tribunal to try those responsible for the assassination of hariri and other assassination attempts which have targeted anti-syrian officials and journalists . " we should all open a new chapter in favor of lebanon , " the new president said . in reference to the weapons of the shiite movement hezbollah , suleiman called " for adopting a defense strategy so that accomplishments of the resistance -lrb- hezbollah -rrb- would not get lost . " hezbollah has waged a war on israel since the 1980s which led in 2000 to israeli withdrawal from southern lebanon . house speaker nabih berri expressed gratitude to the united states .
he asked president suleiman " to shepherd national dialogue on a defense strategy , " adding a united lebanon and its army would protect the homeland from terrorist threats . berri congratulated suleiman saying : " reconciliation is an essential step for the revival of lebanon . "
he also thanked qatar for his efforts to end the lebanese crisis . the emir of qatar sheikh hamad bin khalif al-thani , who attended the session said : " the winner is lebanon and the loser is the civil strife . " " you and lebanon has made this success in doha , " the emir said afterwards . a qatari-brokered deal last week between rival lebanese leaders defused 18 months of political stalemate that erupted into fighting this month .
iranian-backed hezbollah fighters briefly seized parts of beirut , routing government loyalists . under the doha deal , the priority was to elect a president and then form a national unity government , in which the opposition will have veto power , and a new law for 2009 parliamentary polls . the occasion was summed up by italy 's foreign minister franco frattini , one of several eu and arab foreign ministers attending the session , as " a great day of hope for lebanon , starting a new process of consolidation of democratic institutions . " prior to sunday , parliament had not met for more than a year and a half , during which time the government of prime minister fouad seniora barely functioned . bouts of violence claimed scores of lives and revived memories of the 1975 to 1990 civil war . the other foreign dignitaries attending sunday 's vote included a host of foreign ministers and those of archrivals syria and saudi arabia . the government of premier fouad seniora is now considered an acting government and the new president is due to start consultations to appoint a new prime minister who will later form the national unity cabinet . deutsche presse agentur -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 25.05.2008 fed up with colleges at home , germans go next door to study großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch universities offer mainly small seminars instead of big lectures some 70,000 german students study abroad each year , but most of them do n't go far .
last year , 14,000 went just next door , to the netherlands , with maastricht the destination of choice . it was rush hour in the cafe at the university of maastricht as dozens of students waited in an endless line for their coffee .
it 's no wonder , as this place serves the best cappuccino in town - at least according to julia langenohl . the 19-year-old is originally from wuppertal in western germany , but came to maastricht last fall to study business .
she was looking for a degree program offered in english with an international focus when the university of maastricht caught her eye . " everything is very international here , " she said .
" the education system is better than in germany .
when you look at the universities , you can see that they 've been invested in . " she 's not the only one to appreciate the city 's university : 50 percent of students in maastricht are foreign , and 30 percent of these come from germany . " that 's an important part of our strategy , " said jo ritzen , president of the university and a former dutch minister of education .
the goal is to prepare students for the international job market , he added , and the biggest challenge is to reverse the brain drain by bringing in students from abroad . fighting the brain-drain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : courses are offered in english to avoid language barriers " in the rest of the world , the number of university students will increase , but here it would decrease , " said ritzen . as education minister in the 1990s , ritzen encouraged colleges and universities to further open their doors to foreign students - and with success .
today , in addition to the many german students , 5,000 chinese and 2,500 belgian students live in maastricht , as do many poles , indonesians and americans . one point that foreign school-seekers often find attractive in maastricht is that many courses are offered in english and in very small groups . there are very few lecture halls .
mainly , students are given assignments and expected to work independently with their fellow students - an approach that goes over well with the germans , said arjan vlaskamp , who has studied in maastricht for two years . langenohl said that when she first came to maastricht she was amazed at the resources available to students . " as far as the facilities go , the university of maastricht is comparable to a private university in germany , " she said . the group rooms are renovated and there are projectors and computers everywhere .
each group is assigned a tutor to provide assistance .
all of these perks played a role in julia 's decision to go to maastricht . keeping the foreign students coming other germans go to the netherlands to get around final exams that are required in some subjects in germany , but not in the neighboring country - psychology , for example .
that 's why more than 350 german psychology students have made their way to maastricht . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maastricht in southernmost holland has a charming old town while dutch universities may offer a few advantages that are particularly attractive to foreign students , they also actively recruit in other european countries .
in germany , for example , they regularly hold informational seminars and have set up a special web site for german students in holland . financial motivation also plays a role in recruitment . " every dean knows that he gets more money , when he has more students and more graduates , " ritzen said . universities in the netherlands are paid according to the number of students and graduates they have , which ritzen says means between 10,000 and 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 15,800-31,500 -rrb- per degree per year . expanding horizons , erasing borders for langenohl and vlaskamp , studying abroad is n't only about getting a high quality education , but also learning about a new culture . while seminars at the university are in english , vlaskamp 's friends are mainly german and dutch .
sometimes he even uses all three languages in the same sentence . " i 'm from goch , which is pretty close to the german-dutch border , " he said .
" there 's practically no border there anymore ; it gets more blurred every year . " ruth reichstein -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 25.05.2008 fed up with colleges at home , germans go next door to study großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch universities offer mainly small seminars instead of big lectures some 70,000 german students study abroad each year , but most of them do n't go far .
last year , 14,000 went just next door , to the netherlands , with maastricht the destination of choice . it was rush hour in the cafe at the university of maastricht as dozens of students waited in an endless line for their coffee .
it 's no wonder , as this place serves the best cappuccino in town - at least according to julia langenohl . the 19-year-old is originally from wuppertal in western germany , but came to maastricht last fall to study business .
she was looking for a degree program offered in english with an international focus when the university of maastricht caught her eye . " everything is very international here , " she said .
" the education system is better than in germany .
when you look at the universities , you can see that they 've been invested in . " she 's not the only one to appreciate the city 's university : 50 percent of students in maastricht are foreign , and 30 percent of these come from germany . " that 's an important part of our strategy , " said jo ritzen , president of the university and a former dutch minister of education .
the goal is to prepare students for the international job market , he added , and the biggest challenge is to reverse the brain drain by bringing in students from abroad . fighting the brain-drain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : courses are offered in english to avoid language barriers " in the rest of the world , the number of university students will increase , but here it would decrease , " said ritzen . as education minister in the 1990s , ritzen encouraged colleges and universities to further open their doors to foreign students - and with success .
today , in addition to the many german students , 5,000 chinese and 2,500 belgian students live in maastricht , as do many poles , indonesians and americans . one point that foreign school-seekers often find attractive in maastricht is that many courses are offered in english and in very small groups . there are very few lecture halls .
mainly , students are given assignments and expected to work independently with their fellow students - an approach that goes over well with the germans , said arjan vlaskamp , who has studied in maastricht for two years . langenohl said that when she first came to maastricht she was amazed at the resources available to students . " as far as the facilities go , the university of maastricht is comparable to a private university in germany , " she said . the group rooms are renovated and there are projectors and computers everywhere .
each group is assigned a tutor to provide assistance .
all of these perks played a role in julia 's decision to go to maastricht . keeping the foreign students coming other germans go to the netherlands to get around final exams that are required in some subjects in germany , but not in the neighboring country - psychology , for example .
that 's why more than 350 german psychology students have made their way to maastricht . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maastricht in southernmost holland has a charming old town while dutch universities may offer a few advantages that are particularly attractive to foreign students , they also actively recruit in other european countries .
in germany , for example , they regularly hold informational seminars and have set up a special web site for german students in holland . financial motivation also plays a role in recruitment . " every dean knows that he gets more money , when he has more students and more graduates , " ritzen said . universities in the netherlands are paid according to the number of students and graduates they have , which ritzen says means between 10,000 and 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 15,800-31,500 -rrb- per degree per year . expanding horizons , erasing borders for langenohl and vlaskamp , studying abroad is n't only about getting a high quality education , but also learning about a new culture . while seminars at the university are in english , vlaskamp 's friends are mainly german and dutch .
sometimes he even uses all three languages in the same sentence . " i 'm from goch , which is pretty close to the german-dutch border , " he said .

while plans for an eu common defence policy are still at the embryonic stage , the bloc has already deployed peacekeepers to bosnia-herzegovina and chad and is training policemen in afghanistan and the western balkans .
georgia on friday joined the list of countries seeking help from brussels in training its security forces .
much of the discussions , however , are likely to focus on the eu-lex law mission in kosovo , which was originally meant to take over the administration of the newly-independent country from the united nations on june 15 .
eu officials now concede that legal and logistical difficulties mean that deadline is unrealistic .
while the mission 's overall goal " has not changed , " ministers are unlikely to commit themselves to a new date , sources from the slovenian presidency of the eu said .
tuesday 's discussions will turn to development and aid issues amid calls from the european commission for governments to commit more funds and demands for help from china and myanmar .
ministers are likely to reaffirm their " serious concern " about the violence and irregularities that have marred elections in zimbabwe , where a run-off vote for the presidency is due to take place on june 27 , nearly three months after the first round of voting took place .
the meeting 's overall objective is to prepare the groundwork for the regular summer gathering of eu heads of government and state , due to take place june 19-20 .
poland calls for an eastern alliance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland wants an eastern version of sarkozy 's club med at their last summit , eu leaders backed french calls to revamp their relations with their southern neighbors through the creation of a union for the mediterranean .
but poland insisted at the time that the eu should also forge closer ties to the east .
those polish calls have now developed into a proposed eastern partnership .
backed by sweden and blessed by heavyweights france and germany , the eastern partnership would seek to negotiate visa-free travel and create free-trade zones with ukraine , moldova , georgia , armenia and azerbaijan .
poland and sweden argue that their initiative will help steer ukraine away from moscow and closer to the west .
since it will not cost more money and will not create more bureaucracy , they are optimistic that it can enjoy the backing of other member states .
the european commission has not been consulted and says it is eager to hear from warsaw and stockholm .
at the same time , officials in brussels note that just as with french president nicolas sarkozy 's plan for a mediterranean union , the eastern partnership would only be given serious consideration if it can provide " added value " and avoid duplication in its structures .
russia deal likely to be formally agreed upon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia and the eu have been facing off of late during their meeting , the eu 's foreign ministers are expected to give their formal backing to the launch of long-awaited talks on a strategic deal with russia .
a breakthrough on the issue was obtained by eu ambassadors on wednesday , after lithuania agreed to withdraw its veto in protest at russia 's closure of the main oil pipeline into lithuania , its treatment of georgia and its refusal to hand over men suspected of committing atrocities in lithuania in 1991 .
while the launch of talks is due to be agreed by ministers without discussion , eu diplomats warn that that deal is not yet in the bag .
" we 've seen a lot of surprises on this issue during the last years , " one official said .

poland and sweden argue that their initiative will help steer ukraine away from moscow and closer to the west .
since it will not cost more money and will not create more bureaucracy , they are optimistic that it can enjoy the backing of other member states .
the european commission has not been consulted and says it is eager to hear from warsaw and stockholm .
at the same time , officials in brussels note that just as with french president nicolas sarkozy 's plan for a mediterranean union , the eastern partnership would only be given serious consideration if it can provide " added value " and avoid duplication in its structures .

rieger has convictions for holocaust denial and assault .
reporters suggested that the overtly neo-nazi faction within the npd was gaining a greater voice in the anti-foreigner party , which has seats in two of germany 's 16 state assemblies but has never won parliamentary representation at federal level .
a party spokesman later welcomed rieger 's appointment , saying he would energize the npd .
under party leader udo voigt , the npd has sought the support of militants who praise adolf hitler 's national-socialist or nazi doctrines , though voigt insists that the npd 's nationalist views comply with germany 's democratic constitution .
in a speech to delegates , leader voigt won applause as he said the party 's policy was both nationalist and socialist , but used german grammar to carefully separate them into two words . he said this had no connection whatever to the nazi era .
more than 2,000 people demonstrated saturday against the annual convention of the npd in the bavarian city of bamberg .
kurt beck , leader of germany 's co-ruling social democratic party spd , called in leipzig for the npd to be compulsorily dissolved .
" it ought not to be allowed , " he said .

last year , 14,000 went just next door , to the netherlands , with maastricht the destination of choice . it was rush hour in the cafe at the university of maastricht as dozens of students waited in an endless line for their coffee .
it 's no wonder , as this place serves the best cappuccino in town - at least according to julia langenohl . the 19-year-old is originally from wuppertal in western germany , but came to maastricht last fall to study business .
she was looking for a degree program offered in english with an international focus when the university of maastricht caught her eye . " everything is very international here , " she said .
" the education system is better than in germany .
when you look at the universities , you can see that they 've been invested in . " she 's not the only one to appreciate the city 's university : 50 percent of students in maastricht are foreign , and 30 percent of these come from germany . " that 's an important part of our strategy , " said jo ritzen , president of the university and a former dutch minister of education .
the goal is to prepare students for the international job market , he added , and the biggest challenge is to reverse the brain drain by bringing in students from abroad . fighting the brain-drain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : courses are offered in english to avoid language barriers " in the rest of the world , the number of university students will increase , but here it would decrease , " said ritzen . as education minister in the 1990s , ritzen encouraged colleges and universities to further open their doors to foreign students - and with success .
today , in addition to the many german students , 5,000 chinese and 2,500 belgian students live in maastricht , as do many poles , indonesians and americans . one point that foreign school-seekers often find attractive in maastricht is that many courses are offered in english and in very small groups . there are very few lecture halls .
mainly , students are given assignments and expected to work independently with their fellow students - an approach that goes over well with the germans , said arjan vlaskamp , who has studied in maastricht for two years . langenohl said that when she first came to maastricht she was amazed at the resources available to students . " as far as the facilities go , the university of maastricht is comparable to a private university in germany , " she said . the group rooms are renovated and there are projectors and computers everywhere .
each group is assigned a tutor to provide assistance .
all of these perks played a role in julia 's decision to go to maastricht . keeping the foreign students coming other germans go to the netherlands to get around final exams that are required in some subjects in germany , but not in the neighboring country - psychology , for example .
that 's why more than 350 german psychology students have made their way to maastricht . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maastricht in southernmost holland has a charming old town while dutch universities may offer a few advantages that are particularly attractive to foreign students , they also actively recruit in other european countries .
in germany , for example , they regularly hold informational seminars and have set up a special web site for german students in holland . financial motivation also plays a role in recruitment . " every dean knows that he gets more money , when he has more students and more graduates , " ritzen said . universities in the netherlands are paid according to the number of students and graduates they have , which ritzen says means between 10,000 and 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 15,800-31,500 -rrb- per degree per year . expanding horizons , erasing borders for langenohl and vlaskamp , studying abroad is n't only about getting a high quality education , but also learning about a new culture . while seminars at the university are in english , vlaskamp 's friends are mainly german and dutch .
sometimes he even uses all three languages in the same sentence . " i 'm from goch , which is pretty close to the german-dutch border , " he said .
" there 's practically no border there anymore ; it gets more blurred every year . " ruth reichstein -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said , " i hope that a new government can be formed soon under president suleiman and that the political stalemate and instability in lebanon can be permanently overcome . "
suleiman took his oath of office as the 12th president , filling a post left vacant for six months and ending a political crisis that threatened a new civil war . suleiman , who leaves his post as army chief , was sworn in after garnering 118 of 127 votes in an election by parliament which had been postponed 19 times over the past six months . the ballots had the name of former deputy nassib lahoud , another the name of former late premier rafik hariri and martyrs of lebanon and a third had the name of jean obeid - one of the presidential candidates . " i pledge to respect and protect lebanon 's independence , sovereignty and its constitution , " said suleiman , who was greeted with applause from lawmakers and guests . suleiman addressed the session after a minute 's silence for the martyrs who have died in lebanon since 2005 including the late hariri , who was assassinated in a huge bomb blast .
hariri 's followers blamed the assassination on syria . the new president called for " distinguished and balanced relations " with damascus . he also backed a un international tribunal to try those responsible for the assassination of hariri and other assassination attempts which have targeted anti-syrian officials and journalists .

iranian-backed hezbollah fighters briefly seized parts of beirut , routing government loyalists . under the doha deal , the priority was to elect a president and then form a national unity government , in which the opposition will have veto power , and a new law for 2009 parliamentary polls . the occasion was summed up by italy 's foreign minister franco frattini , one of several eu and arab foreign ministers attending the session , as " a great day of hope for lebanon , starting a new process of consolidation of democratic institutions .

environment minister ichiro kamoshita told the meeting japan was hoping for a long-term deal on targets for halving carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions by 2050 at the upcoming g8 meeting in july .

the proposal would only work if the industrialized countries first meet their own responsibilities by setting mid-term targets , according to the head of the german delegation in kobe , matthias machnig .

the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- ministers were to release a plan at the end of their discussions on monday on technology transfer to developing countries on waste management .
environment minister ichiro kamoshita told the meeting japan was hoping for a long-term deal on targets for halving carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- emissions by 2050 at the upcoming g8 meeting in july .
kamoshita said he hoped " the target would present a shared vision among the countries participating in the g8 summit . "
he also called on china , the us and other major co2 producers to attend the summit .
biggest polluters must sign up , says japan japan , which currently holds the g8 presidency , believes that without the largest producers of co2 , a follow-up agreement to the kyoto protocol that runs out in 2012 would be ineffective .
critics accuse japan of trying to shift the blame for co2 emissions onto developing countries with tokyo 's proposals for measuring co2 reductions by industry sector .
the proposals call for all countries , including china and india , to agree to reductions in certain industries instead of setting national targets .
the proposal would only work if the industrialized countries first meet their own responsibilities by setting mid-term targets , according to the head of the german delegation in kobe , matthias machnig .
japan 's approach could be an element of any future hierarchy of responsibility for reducing co2 emissions , but it was " not a solution to the problem , " machnig said . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

rieger has convictions for holocaust denial and assault .
reporters suggested that the overtly neo-nazi faction within the npd was gaining a greater voice in the anti-foreigner party , which has seats in two of germany 's 16 state assemblies but has never won parliamentary representation at federal level .
a party spokesman later welcomed rieger 's appointment , saying he would energize the npd .
under party leader udo voigt , the npd has sought the support of militants who praise adolf hitler 's national-socialist or nazi doctrines , though voigt insists that the npd 's nationalist views comply with germany 's democratic constitution .
in a speech to delegates , leader voigt won applause as he said the party 's policy was both nationalist and socialist , but used german grammar to carefully separate them into two words . he said this had no connection whatever to the nazi era .
more than 2,000 people demonstrated saturday against the annual convention of the npd in the bavarian city of bamberg .
kurt beck , leader of germany 's co-ruling social democratic party spd , called in leipzig for the npd to be compulsorily dissolved .
" it ought not to be allowed , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de education -pipe- 25.05.2008 fed up with colleges at home , germans go next door to study großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch universities offer mainly small seminars instead of big lectures some 70,000 german students study abroad each year , but most of them do n't go far .
last year , 14,000 went just next door , to the netherlands , with maastricht the destination of choice . it was rush hour in the cafe at the university of maastricht as dozens of students waited in an endless line for their coffee .
it 's no wonder , as this place serves the best cappuccino in town - at least according to julia langenohl . the 19-year-old is originally from wuppertal in western germany , but came to maastricht last fall to study business .
she was looking for a degree program offered in english with an international focus when the university of maastricht caught her eye . " everything is very international here , " she said .
" the education system is better than in germany .
when you look at the universities , you can see that they 've been invested in . " she 's not the only one to appreciate the city 's university : 50 percent of students in maastricht are foreign , and 30 percent of these come from germany . " that 's an important part of our strategy , " said jo ritzen , president of the university and a former dutch minister of education .
the goal is to prepare students for the international job market , he added , and the biggest challenge is to reverse the brain drain by bringing in students from abroad . fighting the brain-drain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : courses are offered in english to avoid language barriers " in the rest of the world , the number of university students will increase , but here it would decrease , " said ritzen . as education minister in the 1990s , ritzen encouraged colleges and universities to further open their doors to foreign students - and with success .
today , in addition to the many german students , 5,000 chinese and 2,500 belgian students live in maastricht , as do many poles , indonesians and americans . one point that foreign school-seekers often find attractive in maastricht is that many courses are offered in english and in very small groups . there are very few lecture halls .
mainly , students are given assignments and expected to work independently with their fellow students - an approach that goes over well with the germans , said arjan vlaskamp , who has studied in maastricht for two years . langenohl said that when she first came to maastricht she was amazed at the resources available to students . " as far as the facilities go , the university of maastricht is comparable to a private university in germany , " she said . the group rooms are renovated and there are projectors and computers everywhere .
each group is assigned a tutor to provide assistance .
all of these perks played a role in julia 's decision to go to maastricht . keeping the foreign students coming other germans go to the netherlands to get around final exams that are required in some subjects in germany , but not in the neighboring country - psychology , for example .
that 's why more than 350 german psychology students have made their way to maastricht . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maastricht in southernmost holland has a charming old town while dutch universities may offer a few advantages that are particularly attractive to foreign students , they also actively recruit in other european countries .
in germany , for example , they regularly hold informational seminars and have set up a special web site for german students in holland . financial motivation also plays a role in recruitment . " every dean knows that he gets more money , when he has more students and more graduates , " ritzen said . universities in the netherlands are paid according to the number of students and graduates they have , which ritzen says means between 10,000 and 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 15,800-31,500 -rrb- per degree per year . expanding horizons , erasing borders for langenohl and vlaskamp , studying abroad is n't only about getting a high quality education , but also learning about a new culture . while seminars at the university are in english , vlaskamp 's friends are mainly german and dutch .
sometimes he even uses all three languages in the same sentence . " i 'm from goch , which is pretty close to the german-dutch border , " he said .
" there 's practically no border there anymore ; it gets more blurred every year . " ruth reichstein -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

last year , 14,000 went just next door , to the netherlands , with maastricht the destination of choice . it was rush hour in the cafe at the university of maastricht as dozens of students waited in an endless line for their coffee .
it 's no wonder , as this place serves the best cappuccino in town - at least according to julia langenohl . the 19-year-old is originally from wuppertal in western germany , but came to maastricht last fall to study business .
she was looking for a degree program offered in english with an international focus when the university of maastricht caught her eye . " everything is very international here , " she said .
" the education system is better than in germany .
when you look at the universities , you can see that they 've been invested in . " she 's not the only one to appreciate the city 's university : 50 percent of students in maastricht are foreign , and 30 percent of these come from germany . " that 's an important part of our strategy , " said jo ritzen , president of the university and a former dutch minister of education .
the goal is to prepare students for the international job market , he added , and the biggest challenge is to reverse the brain drain by bringing in students from abroad . fighting the brain-drain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : courses are offered in english to avoid language barriers " in the rest of the world , the number of university students will increase , but here it would decrease , " said ritzen . as education minister in the 1990s , ritzen encouraged colleges and universities to further open their doors to foreign students - and with success .
today , in addition to the many german students , 5,000 chinese and 2,500 belgian students live in maastricht , as do many poles , indonesians and americans . one point that foreign school-seekers often find attractive in maastricht is that many courses are offered in english and in very small groups . there are very few lecture halls .
mainly , students are given assignments and expected to work independently with their fellow students - an approach that goes over well with the germans , said arjan vlaskamp , who has studied in maastricht for two years . langenohl said that when she first came to maastricht she was amazed at the resources available to students . " as far as the facilities go , the university of maastricht is comparable to a private university in germany , " she said . the group rooms are renovated and there are projectors and computers everywhere .
each group is assigned a tutor to provide assistance .
all of these perks played a role in julia 's decision to go to maastricht . keeping the foreign students coming other germans go to the netherlands to get around final exams that are required in some subjects in germany , but not in the neighboring country - psychology , for example .
that 's why more than 350 german psychology students have made their way to maastricht . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maastricht in southernmost holland has a charming old town while dutch universities may offer a few advantages that are particularly attractive to foreign students , they also actively recruit in other european countries .
in germany , for example , they regularly hold informational seminars and have set up a special web site for german students in holland . financial motivation also plays a role in recruitment . " every dean knows that he gets more money , when he has more students and more graduates , " ritzen said . universities in the netherlands are paid according to the number of students and graduates they have , which ritzen says means between 10,000 and 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 15,800-31,500 -rrb- per degree per year . expanding horizons , erasing borders for langenohl and vlaskamp , studying abroad is n't only about getting a high quality education , but also learning about a new culture . while seminars at the university are in english , vlaskamp 's friends are mainly german and dutch .
sometimes he even uses all three languages in the same sentence . " i 'm from goch , which is pretty close to the german-dutch border , " he said .

that 's why more than 350 german psychology students have made their way to maastricht . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maastricht in southernmost holland has a charming old town while dutch universities may offer a few advantages that are particularly attractive to foreign students , they also actively recruit in other european countries .
in germany , for example , they regularly hold informational seminars and have set up a special web site for german students in holland . financial motivation also plays a role in recruitment . " every dean knows that he gets more money , when he has more students and more graduates , " ritzen said . universities in the netherlands are paid according to the number of students and graduates they have , which ritzen says means between 10,000 and 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 15,800-31,500 -rrb- per degree per year . expanding horizons , erasing borders for langenohl and vlaskamp , studying abroad is n't only about getting a high quality education , but also learning about a new culture . while seminars at the university are in english , vlaskamp 's friends are mainly german and dutch .
sometimes he even uses all three languages in the same sentence . " i 'm from goch , which is pretty close to the german-dutch border , " he said .

german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said , " i hope that a new government can be formed soon under president suleiman and that the political stalemate and instability in lebanon can be permanently overcome . "
suleiman took his oath of office as the 12th president , filling a post left vacant for six months and ending a political crisis that threatened a new civil war . suleiman , who leaves his post as army chief , was sworn in after garnering 118 of 127 votes in an election by parliament which had been postponed 19 times over the past six months . the ballots had the name of former deputy nassib lahoud , another the name of former late premier rafik hariri and martyrs of lebanon and a third had the name of jean obeid - one of the presidential candidates . " i pledge to respect and protect lebanon 's independence , sovereignty and its constitution , " said suleiman , who was greeted with applause from lawmakers and guests . suleiman addressed the session after a minute 's silence for the martyrs who have died in lebanon since 2005 including the late hariri , who was assassinated in a huge bomb blast .
hariri 's followers blamed the assassination on syria . the new president called for " distinguished and balanced relations " with damascus . he also backed a un international tribunal to try those responsible for the assassination of hariri and other assassination attempts which have targeted anti-syrian officials and journalists . " we should all open a new chapter in favor of lebanon , " the new president said . in reference to the weapons of the shiite movement hezbollah , suleiman called " for adopting a defense strategy so that accomplishments of the resistance -lrb- hezbollah -rrb- would not get lost . " hezbollah has waged a war on israel since the 1980s which led in 2000 to israeli withdrawal from southern lebanon . house speaker nabih berri expressed gratitude to the united states .
he asked president suleiman " to shepherd national dialogue on a defense strategy , " adding a united lebanon and its army would protect the homeland from terrorist threats . berri congratulated suleiman saying : " reconciliation is an essential step for the revival of lebanon . "
he also thanked qatar for his efforts to end the lebanese crisis . the emir of qatar sheikh hamad bin khalif al-thani , who attended the session said : " the winner is lebanon and the loser is the civil strife . " " you and lebanon has made this success in doha , " the emir said afterwards . a qatari-brokered deal last week between rival lebanese leaders defused 18 months of political stalemate that erupted into fighting this month .
iranian-backed hezbollah fighters briefly seized parts of beirut , routing government loyalists . under the doha deal , the priority was to elect a president and then form a national unity government , in which the opposition will have veto power , and a new law for 2009 parliamentary polls . the occasion was summed up by italy 's foreign minister franco frattini , one of several eu and arab foreign ministers attending the session , as " a great day of hope for lebanon , starting a new process of consolidation of democratic institutions . " prior to sunday , parliament had not met for more than a year and a half , during which time the government of prime minister fouad seniora barely functioned . bouts of violence claimed scores of lives and revived memories of the 1975 to 1990 civil war . the other foreign dignitaries attending sunday 's vote included a host of foreign ministers and those of archrivals syria and saudi arabia . the government of premier fouad seniora is now considered an acting government and the new president is due to start consultations to appoint a new prime minister who will later form the national unity cabinet . deutsche presse agentur -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

rieger has convictions for holocaust denial and assault .
reporters suggested that the overtly neo-nazi faction within the npd was gaining a greater voice in the anti-foreigner party , which has seats in two of germany 's 16 state assemblies but has never won parliamentary representation at federal level .
a party spokesman later welcomed rieger 's appointment , saying he would energize the npd .
under party leader udo voigt , the npd has sought the support of militants who praise adolf hitler 's national-socialist or nazi doctrines , though voigt insists that the npd 's nationalist views comply with germany 's democratic constitution .
in a speech to delegates , leader voigt won applause as he said the party 's policy was both nationalist and socialist , but used german grammar to carefully separate them into two words . he said this had no connection whatever to the nazi era .
more than 2,000 people demonstrated saturday against the annual convention of the npd in the bavarian city of bamberg .
kurt beck , leader of germany 's co-ruling social democratic party spd , called in leipzig for the npd to be compulsorily dissolved .
" it ought not to be allowed , " he said .
