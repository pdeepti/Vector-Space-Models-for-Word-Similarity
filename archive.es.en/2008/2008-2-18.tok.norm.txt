the allegations have led the japanese government to lodge a complaint with the us ambassador to japan thomas schieffer . over half of the roughly 40,000 us troops in japan are based on okinawa .
their presence is controversial .
local residents often complain of noise , pollution and crime related to the us bases .
crime has increased in recent weeks .
at the weekend , two marines were arrested ; one for drunken driving , the other for trespassing , after being found asleep on a local resident ’ s couch .
just one week before , another marine was arrested for allegedly raping a 14-year-old girl in a car .
officials say the 38-year-old has denied rape but admits forcing the girl to kiss him .
the case has brought back memories of the gang-rape of a 12-year-old girl , which triggered mass rallies against the us troops in 1995 .
promises of greater discipline last week , us officials flew to japan to offer their personal apologies and promise stricter discipline in the military .
the commander of the us forces in japan also announced the military had set up a task force to review and develop existing programmes to prevent sexual harassment and assault .
the most recent arrests have provoked further outrage across japan .
a top government spokesman said the us troops should not be drinking in the middle of the night and committing crimes just as people call for stricter discipline .
meanwhile , the us ambassador to japan , thomas schieffer , has said all the incidents are deeply regrettable and has promised once again that washington will make every effort to prevent such incidents from reoccurring .
when us secretary of state condoleezza rice flies into japan next week , she is widely expected to be grilled on this matter .
angry local residents but local residents think there will always be such incidents so long as there are the us military bases on okinawa .
lawmakers on the island have called for a reduction in the us military presence there .
however , this does not seem to be on the cards .
the us military is currently planning to move one air-base from the crowded city of ginowan to the coastal city of nago .
us and japanese officials have expressed their doubts that the incidents will have any impact on the plans .
us troops have been stationed on okinawa since the end of the second world war .
they occupy about 10 percent of the southern prefecture ’ s land .
at several times in post-war history , us forces have launched major operations from japan , most recently during the first gulf war . anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

the gap between german rhetoric and reality is likely to increase as elections near . the german army 's afghanistan mission is testing berlin 's long-held prohibition against involvement in foreign combat missions like never before .
yet germany 's resistance has more to do with politics than moral qualms , experts say . the german government has spent recent weeks insisting that it has no plans to significantly increase its involvement in afghanistan .
it stood firm even as nato allies , particularly the united states , pressured germany to increase involvement in fighting taliban forces in southern afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has a very strong pacificst movement with national elections scheduled for 2009 , elected officials are n't going to commit political suicide by proposing germany fight alongside nato allies in southern afghanistan , said thomas bauer of the center for applied policy research at the university of munich and an expert in german foreign affairs . " the moment this government decides to send in combat troops to the southern part of afghanistan , they will lose the next election , " bauer said . germany : a reluctant warrior the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , will try to win the next elections by portraying their coalition partners , chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , as pro-military .
to win votes , the left party will try to portray both the spd and cdu as warmongers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party will use afghanistan to score points with german pacifists " pushing this pacifist button " wins elections , bauer said . all of germany 's main political parties , with the exception of the left party , understand germany has a global responsibility which includes sending forces abroad and want to increase participation in nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
but they are afraid of voter backlash , experts say . germans remain deeply uneasy about taking part in military missions .
there 's the specter of world war ii and a long tradition of pacifism born during the cold war . this unease is shown by the limited scope parliament gave the bundeswehr in afghanistan .
the military can send a maximum of 3,500 soldiers to work out of the relatively peaceful north of the country where it is involved in rebuilding as well as peacekeeping and stabilization efforts . " it is important for nato to be seen as a community that implements its security strategy as a whole , " german defense minister franz-josef jung said recently , while insisting that germany will not participate in fighting in the south . increased involvement a tough sell bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some have questioned whether a political strategy exists in afghanistan the german public is overwhelmingly opposed to increasing the presence in afghanistan .
two out of every three say they want germany out of afghanistan as soon as possible . this has led to a certain amount of dishonesty in the political discourse surrounding afghanistan .
germany 's troop contribution to a quick reaction force is a perfect example of the divide between rhetoric and reality , said citha maass , the afghanistan expert at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs . germany agreed to send an additional 200 combat troops in july to take over for a norwegian contingent .
this force will be based in the north , but will assist allies in other regions .
these troops will have a combat component , maass said . " instead of discussing publically that you need some combat function , the government tries to hide it , " she said . on friday , feb .
15 , after denying press reports for days , the german government admitted it will discuss raising the number of troops in afghanistan when the parliamentary mandate comes up for renewal in the fall .
there 's also the possibility of changing the length of the mandate so that it does n't require renewal during election campaigning , according to press reports .
germany is , however , expected to stand firm on refusing to join fighting in the south . germany shirking its duties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has refused to join combat missions in southern afghanistan norine macdonald has spent most of the past three years doing field research in afghanistan as the president of the senlis council , a security and development think tank .
she said germany 's reluctance to get involved with fighting the taliban and al qaeda forces in southern afghanistan is outrageous and incomprehensible . german politicians lack the political will and the political skill to speak about the reality of the threat in afghanistan , macdonald said , something which she feels is " deeply irresponsible . " " germany is trying to create an alternate version of reality about afghanistan , " she said .
" unless you are going to go fight in the south , you are not part of the nato efforts to stabilize afghanistan . " unclear political goals in afghanistan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been focused on humanitarian aid the taliban and al qaeda forces control secondary roads in afghanistan 's south and are moving closer to kabul each month , . of nato members , only the united states , canada , the netherlands and great britain currently have troops are currently fighting in the south . there 's increasing worry among experts that the nato mission could fail to contain the taliban . part of the problem is that no one really knows what the ultimate goal is in afghanistan , said andreas heinemann-grüder , a senior researcher at the bonn-based bicc , an organization which focuses on peace building and conflict resolution issues . " the point is that they do n't know what they 're striving for , " heinemann-grüder said .
" what is ultimate goal for these combat missions ?
i do n't see any political strategy behind the military effort . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : canada has called on nato members to send more troops to southern afghanistan for many germans , the messier the situation in afghanistan gets , the more reason for germany to end its involvement .
but it should n't take a terrorist attack on german soil for the country to realize that isolation is not an option , said bauer of the center for applied policy research .
having the taliban destabilize afghanistan puts germany at risk , even if it seems intangible to many people . macdonald agreed , calling afghanistan germany 's " new back yard .

the gap between german rhetoric and reality is likely to increase as elections near . the german army 's afghanistan mission is testing berlin 's long-held prohibition against involvement in foreign combat missions like never before .
yet germany 's resistance has more to do with politics than moral qualms , experts say . the german government has spent recent weeks insisting that it has no plans to significantly increase its involvement in afghanistan .
it stood firm even as nato allies , particularly the united states , pressured germany to increase involvement in fighting taliban forces in southern afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has a very strong pacificst movement with national elections scheduled for 2009 , elected officials are n't going to commit political suicide by proposing germany fight alongside nato allies in southern afghanistan , said thomas bauer of the center for applied policy research at the university of munich and an expert in german foreign affairs . " the moment this government decides to send in combat troops to the southern part of afghanistan , they will lose the next election , " bauer said . germany : a reluctant warrior the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , will try to win the next elections by portraying their coalition partners , chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , as pro-military .

there 's the specter of world war ii and a long tradition of pacifism born during the cold war . this unease is shown by the limited scope parliament gave the bundeswehr in afghanistan .
the military can send a maximum of 3,500 soldiers to work out of the relatively peaceful north of the country where it is involved in rebuilding as well as peacekeeping and stabilization efforts .

germany 's troop contribution to a quick reaction force is a perfect example of the divide between rhetoric and reality , said citha maass , the afghanistan expert at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs . germany agreed to send an additional 200 combat troops in july to take over for a norwegian contingent .
this force will be based in the north , but will assist allies in other regions .
these troops will have a combat component , maass said . " instead of discussing publically that you need some combat function , the government tries to hide it , " she said . on friday , feb .

the gap between german rhetoric and reality is likely to increase as elections near . the german army 's afghanistan mission is testing berlin 's long-held prohibition against involvement in foreign combat missions like never before .
yet germany 's resistance has more to do with politics than moral qualms , experts say . the german government has spent recent weeks insisting that it has no plans to significantly increase its involvement in afghanistan .
it stood firm even as nato allies , particularly the united states , pressured germany to increase involvement in fighting taliban forces in southern afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has a very strong pacificst movement with national elections scheduled for 2009 , elected officials are n't going to commit political suicide by proposing germany fight alongside nato allies in southern afghanistan , said thomas bauer of the center for applied policy research at the university of munich and an expert in german foreign affairs . " the moment this government decides to send in combat troops to the southern part of afghanistan , they will lose the next election , " bauer said . germany : a reluctant warrior the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , will try to win the next elections by portraying their coalition partners , chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , as pro-military .
to win votes , the left party will try to portray both the spd and cdu as warmongers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party will use afghanistan to score points with german pacifists " pushing this pacifist button " wins elections , bauer said . all of germany 's main political parties , with the exception of the left party , understand germany has a global responsibility which includes sending forces abroad and want to increase participation in nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
but they are afraid of voter backlash , experts say . germans remain deeply uneasy about taking part in military missions .
there 's the specter of world war ii and a long tradition of pacifism born during the cold war . this unease is shown by the limited scope parliament gave the bundeswehr in afghanistan .
the military can send a maximum of 3,500 soldiers to work out of the relatively peaceful north of the country where it is involved in rebuilding as well as peacekeeping and stabilization efforts . " it is important for nato to be seen as a community that implements its security strategy as a whole , " german defense minister franz-josef jung said recently , while insisting that germany will not participate in fighting in the south . increased involvement a tough sell bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some have questioned whether a political strategy exists in afghanistan the german public is overwhelmingly opposed to increasing the presence in afghanistan .
two out of every three say they want germany out of afghanistan as soon as possible . this has led to a certain amount of dishonesty in the political discourse surrounding afghanistan .
germany 's troop contribution to a quick reaction force is a perfect example of the divide between rhetoric and reality , said citha maass , the afghanistan expert at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs . germany agreed to send an additional 200 combat troops in july to take over for a norwegian contingent .
this force will be based in the north , but will assist allies in other regions .
these troops will have a combat component , maass said . " instead of discussing publically that you need some combat function , the government tries to hide it , " she said . on friday , feb .
15 , after denying press reports for days , the german government admitted it will discuss raising the number of troops in afghanistan when the parliamentary mandate comes up for renewal in the fall .
there 's also the possibility of changing the length of the mandate so that it does n't require renewal during election campaigning , according to press reports .
germany is , however , expected to stand firm on refusing to join fighting in the south . germany shirking its duties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has refused to join combat missions in southern afghanistan norine macdonald has spent most of the past three years doing field research in afghanistan as the president of the senlis council , a security and development think tank .
she said germany 's reluctance to get involved with fighting the taliban and al qaeda forces in southern afghanistan is outrageous and incomprehensible . german politicians lack the political will and the political skill to speak about the reality of the threat in afghanistan , macdonald said , something which she feels is " deeply irresponsible . " " germany is trying to create an alternate version of reality about afghanistan , " she said .
" unless you are going to go fight in the south , you are not part of the nato efforts to stabilize afghanistan . " unclear political goals in afghanistan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been focused on humanitarian aid the taliban and al qaeda forces control secondary roads in afghanistan 's south and are moving closer to kabul each month , . of nato members , only the united states , canada , the netherlands and great britain currently have troops are currently fighting in the south . there 's increasing worry among experts that the nato mission could fail to contain the taliban . part of the problem is that no one really knows what the ultimate goal is in afghanistan , said andreas heinemann-grüder , a senior researcher at the bonn-based bicc , an organization which focuses on peace building and conflict resolution issues . " the point is that they do n't know what they 're striving for , " heinemann-grüder said .
" what is ultimate goal for these combat missions ?
i do n't see any political strategy behind the military effort . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : canada has called on nato members to send more troops to southern afghanistan for many germans , the messier the situation in afghanistan gets , the more reason for germany to end its involvement .
but it should n't take a terrorist attack on german soil for the country to realize that isolation is not an option , said bauer of the center for applied policy research .
having the taliban destabilize afghanistan puts germany at risk , even if it seems intangible to many people . macdonald agreed , calling afghanistan germany 's " new back yard .

opinion : long road to normalcy in kosovo kosovo -pipe- 18.02.2008 us , germany cautious on kosovo as separatists call for action großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and merkel are playing the waiting game over kosovo the united states and germany issued statements suggesting they would recognize kosovo 's independence but gave no official blessing .
meanwhile , fears of knock-on separatist action increased with unrest in bosnia . while not officially recognizing kosovo as an independent state , us president george w. bush said monday that the kosovars " are now independent " but added that us recognition would be guided by the un-supported ahtisaari plan .
" the ahtisaari plan is our blueprint forward , " bush said when asked in an interview if washington will officially recognize kosovo as a country .
but , bush added , " the kosovars are now independent .
it 's something i 've advocated along with my government . "
in berlin , german chancellor angela merkel said germany would not take an immediate decision on recognizing kosovo 's independence but wait for the european union to spell out its position .
" we will not take a decision today on recognizing kosovo 's independence .
ministers from the eu will meet today to put in place a platform that will allow each member to take a position on the declaration of independence , " she told reporters in berlin .
" so taking a decision on recognition is not on the order of the day .
the order of the day is first of all to answers questions of substance as to the eu 's platform . "
germany had been expected to formally recognize kosovo on monday along with britain , france , italy and the united states .
merkel added that kosovo was an isolated case not comparable with that in other countries and she stressed that the future of both kosovo and serbia lay with the european union .
" the whole situation in the western balkans can only be kept calm and peaceful from my point of view if we keep the european perspective as the perspective for the future for both serbia and kosovo , " merkel said .
chancellor calls for protection of minorities merkel stressed that kosovo and other countries in the region had to respect their minorities if they were to have a future in the european union .
" all must live with their minorities , " she said , acknowledging difficulties that stretched back over centuries .
without a european future for the countries of the former yugoslavia , she added , " the prospects for free democracy and securing economic development are much , much worse . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said the eu 's relations with russia were stable asked whether differences over kosovo would hurt eu-russian relations , merkel said the russian objections were of a principled nature and its attitude would not change .
but she added that eu relations with russia were " of a strategic nature and ... very stable . "
" we should in as far as possible try to come to the best diplomatic conclusions , " she said .
" we have strategic relations with russia that are capable of surviving differences of opinion because they are very stable . "
eu foreign ministers were locked in a crisis meeting in brussels monday to discuss the response to kosovo 's split from serbia on sunday amid signs of intense behind-the-scenes wrangling over recognition of the new state .
while some of the larger member states support the declaration , many others refuse to accept kosovo 's decision .
eu divisions exacerbated by separatist concerns the already difficult situation of presenting a united front on kosovo was made worse when spain announced that the socialist government will not give diplomatic recognition to the new state , and that spain 's conservative opposition had agreed with the government 's position .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain fears action by eta , the armed basque separatists spain fears that the serbian province 's declaration of independence could inspire its basque separatists to take a similar step .
these fears gained some credibility when it was revealed that the main opposition bosnian serb party had called for the independence of the serb-run half of bosnia monday , citing kosovo as a precedent .
" the serb democratic party -lsb- sds -rsb- is demanding republika srpska 's institutions provide -lsb- bosnian serbs -rsb- the same rights being given to kosovo albanians , " said the party , which was founded by war crimes fugitive radovan karadzic .
" we expect the -lsb- bosnian serb -rsb- government to meet previous promises and check the will of republika srpska citizens in a referendum , " the sds said in a statement .
since its 1992-1995 war , bosnia has consisted of two entities , the serb-run republika srpska -lsb- rs -rsb- and the muslim-croat federation , each with their own government , parliament and police force .
the sds was established in the early 1990s by karadzic , who remains at large around 12 years after the un war crimes tribunal charged him with genocide over the srebrenica massacre and siege of sarajevo .
bosnian serbs cite kosovo as precedent many bosnian serbs feel that their entity should follow kosovo 's lead and be allowed to secede from bosnia to be eventually attached to serbia , which they see as their motherland .
some local politicians have hinted that the rs could try such a move .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests in banja luka had xenophobic undertones meanwhile , up to 3,000 bosnian serbs gathered in banja luka to protest against kosovo 's independence .
" europe shame on you , world shame on you " and " hashim murderer " , the protestors chanted in a reference to kosovo prime minister hashim thaci .
they also chanted offensive slogans using derogatory terms for albanians .
the protest , organized by students , started with a minute 's silence , followed by another minute of hissing to voice disagreement with kosovo 's unilateral move .
banners in the crowd carried such slogans as " europe respect international law , " " kosovo = rs , " and " we do n't give up kosovo . "
" we are disappointed with the fate of -lsb- serbian -rsb- people in kosovo and we will continue to support them , " representative of students dejan kragulj told journalists .
" it 's clear that republika srpska now has the right to secede from bosnia , " zeljko , a 23-year-old student , told reporters . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" so taking a decision on recognition is not on the order of the day .
the order of the day is first of all to answers questions of substance as to the eu 's platform . "
germany had been expected to formally recognize kosovo on monday along with britain , france , italy and the united states .
merkel added that kosovo was an isolated case not comparable with that in other countries and she stressed that the future of both kosovo and serbia lay with the european union .
" the whole situation in the western balkans can only be kept calm and peaceful from my point of view if we keep the european perspective as the perspective for the future for both serbia and kosovo , " merkel said .
chancellor calls for protection of minorities merkel stressed that kosovo and other countries in the region had to respect their minorities if they were to have a future in the european union .
" all must live with their minorities , " she said , acknowledging difficulties that stretched back over centuries .
without a european future for the countries of the former yugoslavia , she added , " the prospects for free democracy and securing economic development are much , much worse . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said the eu 's relations with russia were stable asked whether differences over kosovo would hurt eu-russian relations , merkel said the russian objections were of a principled nature and its attitude would not change .
but she added that eu relations with russia were " of a strategic nature and ... very stable . "
" we should in as far as possible try to come to the best diplomatic conclusions , " she said .
" we have strategic relations with russia that are capable of surviving differences of opinion because they are very stable . "
eu foreign ministers were locked in a crisis meeting in brussels monday to discuss the response to kosovo 's split from serbia on sunday amid signs of intense behind-the-scenes wrangling over recognition of the new state .
while some of the larger member states support the declaration , many others refuse to accept kosovo 's decision .
eu divisions exacerbated by separatist concerns the already difficult situation of presenting a united front on kosovo was made worse when spain announced that the socialist government will not give diplomatic recognition to the new state , and that spain 's conservative opposition had agreed with the government 's position .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain fears action by eta , the armed basque separatists spain fears that the serbian province 's declaration of independence could inspire its basque separatists to take a similar step .
these fears gained some credibility when it was revealed that the main opposition bosnian serb party had called for the independence of the serb-run half of bosnia monday , citing kosovo as a precedent .
" the serb democratic party -lsb- sds -rsb- is demanding republika srpska 's institutions provide -lsb- bosnian serbs -rsb- the same rights being given to kosovo albanians , " said the party , which was founded by war crimes fugitive radovan karadzic .
" we expect the -lsb- bosnian serb -rsb- government to meet previous promises and check the will of republika srpska citizens in a referendum , " the sds said in a statement .
since its 1992-1995 war , bosnia has consisted of two entities , the serb-run republika srpska -lsb- rs -rsb- and the muslim-croat federation , each with their own government , parliament and police force .
the sds was established in the early 1990s by karadzic , who remains at large around 12 years after the un war crimes tribunal charged him with genocide over the srebrenica massacre and siege of sarajevo .
bosnian serbs cite kosovo as precedent many bosnian serbs feel that their entity should follow kosovo 's lead and be allowed to secede from bosnia to be eventually attached to serbia , which they see as their motherland .
some local politicians have hinted that the rs could try such a move .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests in banja luka had xenophobic undertones meanwhile , up to 3,000 bosnian serbs gathered in banja luka to protest against kosovo 's independence .
" europe shame on you , world shame on you " and " hashim murderer " , the protestors chanted in a reference to kosovo prime minister hashim thaci .
they also chanted offensive slogans using derogatory terms for albanians .
the protest , organized by students , started with a minute 's silence , followed by another minute of hissing to voice disagreement with kosovo 's unilateral move .
banners in the crowd carried such slogans as " europe respect international law , " " kosovo = rs , " and " we do n't give up kosovo . "
" we are disappointed with the fate of -lsb- serbian -rsb- people in kosovo and we will continue to support them , " representative of students dejan kragulj told journalists .
" it 's clear that republika srpska now has the right to secede from bosnia , " zeljko , a 23-year-old student , told reporters . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the gap between german rhetoric and reality is likely to increase as elections near . the german army 's afghanistan mission is testing berlin 's long-held prohibition against involvement in foreign combat missions like never before .
yet germany 's resistance has more to do with politics than moral qualms , experts say . the german government has spent recent weeks insisting that it has no plans to significantly increase its involvement in afghanistan .
it stood firm even as nato allies , particularly the united states , pressured germany to increase involvement in fighting taliban forces in southern afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has a very strong pacificst movement with national elections scheduled for 2009 , elected officials are n't going to commit political suicide by proposing germany fight alongside nato allies in southern afghanistan , said thomas bauer of the center for applied policy research at the university of munich and an expert in german foreign affairs . " the moment this government decides to send in combat troops to the southern part of afghanistan , they will lose the next election , " bauer said . germany : a reluctant warrior the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , will try to win the next elections by portraying their coalition partners , chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , as pro-military .
to win votes , the left party will try to portray both the spd and cdu as warmongers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party will use afghanistan to score points with german pacifists " pushing this pacifist button " wins elections , bauer said . all of germany 's main political parties , with the exception of the left party , understand germany has a global responsibility which includes sending forces abroad and want to increase participation in nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
but they are afraid of voter backlash , experts say . germans remain deeply uneasy about taking part in military missions .
there 's the specter of world war ii and a long tradition of pacifism born during the cold war . this unease is shown by the limited scope parliament gave the bundeswehr in afghanistan .
the military can send a maximum of 3,500 soldiers to work out of the relatively peaceful north of the country where it is involved in rebuilding as well as peacekeeping and stabilization efforts . " it is important for nato to be seen as a community that implements its security strategy as a whole , " german defense minister franz-josef jung said recently , while insisting that germany will not participate in fighting in the south . increased involvement a tough sell bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some have questioned whether a political strategy exists in afghanistan the german public is overwhelmingly opposed to increasing the presence in afghanistan .
two out of every three say they want germany out of afghanistan as soon as possible . this has led to a certain amount of dishonesty in the political discourse surrounding afghanistan .
germany 's troop contribution to a quick reaction force is a perfect example of the divide between rhetoric and reality , said citha maass , the afghanistan expert at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs . germany agreed to send an additional 200 combat troops in july to take over for a norwegian contingent .
this force will be based in the north , but will assist allies in other regions .
these troops will have a combat component , maass said . " instead of discussing publically that you need some combat function , the government tries to hide it , " she said . on friday , feb .
15 , after denying press reports for days , the german government admitted it will discuss raising the number of troops in afghanistan when the parliamentary mandate comes up for renewal in the fall .
there 's also the possibility of changing the length of the mandate so that it does n't require renewal during election campaigning , according to press reports .
germany is , however , expected to stand firm on refusing to join fighting in the south . germany shirking its duties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has refused to join combat missions in southern afghanistan norine macdonald has spent most of the past three years doing field research in afghanistan as the president of the senlis council , a security and development think tank .
she said germany 's reluctance to get involved with fighting the taliban and al qaeda forces in southern afghanistan is outrageous and incomprehensible . german politicians lack the political will and the political skill to speak about the reality of the threat in afghanistan , macdonald said , something which she feels is " deeply irresponsible . " " germany is trying to create an alternate version of reality about afghanistan , " she said .
" unless you are going to go fight in the south , you are not part of the nato efforts to stabilize afghanistan . " unclear political goals in afghanistan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been focused on humanitarian aid the taliban and al qaeda forces control secondary roads in afghanistan 's south and are moving closer to kabul each month , . of nato members , only the united states , canada , the netherlands and great britain currently have troops are currently fighting in the south . there 's increasing worry among experts that the nato mission could fail to contain the taliban . part of the problem is that no one really knows what the ultimate goal is in afghanistan , said andreas heinemann-grüder , a senior researcher at the bonn-based bicc , an organization which focuses on peace building and conflict resolution issues . " the point is that they do n't know what they 're striving for , " heinemann-grüder said .
" what is ultimate goal for these combat missions ?
i do n't see any political strategy behind the military effort . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : canada has called on nato members to send more troops to southern afghanistan for many germans , the messier the situation in afghanistan gets , the more reason for germany to end its involvement .
but it should n't take a terrorist attack on german soil for the country to realize that isolation is not an option , said bauer of the center for applied policy research .
having the taliban destabilize afghanistan puts germany at risk , even if it seems intangible to many people . macdonald agreed , calling afghanistan germany 's " new back yard . " " the world has shrunk so much we know that what happens in southern afghanistan is happening on the border of every western country , " macdonald said . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke to balkans expert stefan wolff about what kosovo and the world can expect in the near future . stefan wolff is a professor of political science and director of the centre for international crisis management and conflict resolution at nottingham university in the uk .
he has extensive expertise in northern ireland , the balkans and central and eastern europe , and has also worked on a wide range of other conflicts elsewhere , including the middle east , africa , and central , south and southeast asia . dw-world.de : is kosovo prepared for independence in terms of infrastructure , governance , security and stability ? stefan wolff : kosovo has most of the important institutions of statehood and democratic governance in place , but at the same time these institutions will require continued international support for some time .
this is accepted by both the kosovars and the west and is the background against which we need to understand the eu mission for kosovo - as external assistance to consolidate existing institutional structures to enable kosovars to take care of developing their economy , infrastructure and ensure security and stability . the decision to declare independence is not a unanimous one within the population .
what minorities in kosovo have most to lose from this independence ? in principle , all minorities and the majority albanian population can gain from the clarification of kosovo 's international status , not least in the sense that they will all benefit from economic development .
prime minister thaci made some very important gestures yesterday towards reconciliation with serbs in kosovo .
the arthisaari plan offers important mechanisms to serbs to preserve and develop their identity , gives them opportunities to play a meaningful part in the political process in kosovo and retain ties with serbia .
from this perspective , there is no need for conflict between the two main population groups , but that does not mean that extremists on either side will refrain from violence and provocations .
so far , this risk has been contained , but not eliminated . what can we expect in terms of reaction and action from kosovo 's balkan neighbors ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few of the region 's conflicts are fully resolved the balkan region as a whole remains quite vulnerable to the threat of ethnic conflict .
we must bear in mind that few , if any , of the conflicts that led to bloodshed throughout the 1990s have really been resolved .
we have institutions in place now that help manage these conflicts politically , but tensions in bosnia and macedonia , for example , remain .
apart from albania and slovenia , i do n't think that any of the other balkan countries will find it a very easy decision to recognize kosovo .
eventually , however , macedonia , bosnia , croatia and montenegro will recognize the independence of kosovo , but this will not be a process free from domestic debate .
how will kosovo 's independence affect the wider balkan region ?
because of the close links between kosovo and two other major previous secessionist conflicts - bosnia , the serbs , and macedonia , the albanians - there is a danger that violence in and around kosovo could spread and create instability across the balkans .
there also remains an open question in relation to the future of albanians in southern serbia .
the overall hope , of course , remains that with kosovo 's independence the last major unresolved issue has been tackled and that the region as a whole can now move forward to closer integration with the eu .
while this will not be easy over the coming months , eventually a sense of reality will set in , and people will realize that this is there only real hope for the future .
serbia has vowed not to recognize an independent kosovo and has spoken of economic and diplomatic sanctions .
what can we expect from serbia in the coming days ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riots broke out in belgrade after kosovo 's declaration there are already signs of serbia backing down from the quite exaggerated threats of cutting diplomatic ties with any country recognizing kosovo .
this is simply not feasible for serbia , especially as the population there still has clear aspirations of eu membership and very strong economic interests both in the eu and the neighboring region .
we will , however , see further declarations and statements against kosovo 's independence and against its recognition by other states .
together with russia , serbia is most likely to try and mobilize the un against kosovo 's unilateral declaration of independence , and membership in the un and other international organizations will be very difficult to obtain for kosovo because of serbian resistance .
while the likelihood of a military conflict is close to zero , there remains a threat of localized violence in and around kosovo , but serious escalation is in nobody 's interest .
moreover , serbia has to think carefully about how to manage its relations with serbs in kosovo .
the arthisaari plan offers many important opportunities to do so , opportunities that kosovo albanians are ready to accept .
discouraging kosovo serb political participation in pristina will not be in the interests of serbs living there , and might further encourage them to leave rather than to stay .
what action do you expect to be taken by the international community in the coming days ?
we will gradually see recognition of kosovo as an independent state from major countries in the eu and the west more generally .
we should also expect support from the arab league and member countries of the organization of the islamic conference .
nato will have to be very alert towards any risk of violence in kosovo , not least in order to assure serbs that they can remain in kosovo and participate in building a democratic state .
russian opposition , on the other hand , also remains a clear fact , and russia will use its membership in the un , and possibly the osce and council of europe , to mobilize against kosovo 's independence .
this , in turn , could have a further negative impact on relations between russia and the west as a whole , again not something in either russia 's or the west 's interests .
is kosovo becoming a pawn in the current power games between the west and russia ?
if so , how will an independent kosovo affect relations ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia , serbia 's ally , remains in opposition to the west kosovo has , for some time , been one among several pawns in these power games .
now that independence has been declared , the issue has come to a head , but at the same time kosovo will gradually become less of an issue , precisely because a decision has been made .
russia may choose not to recognize it and bring it up before the security council and elsewhere , but it was in particular kosovo 's unresolved status that gave russia a certain degree of leverage .
in the long term , i think interest in kosovo will fade , especially if the transition to independence is smooth , no major violence occurs , and kosovo quickly gains recognition from a large number of countries beyond the core western powers .
what will the newly independent kosovo 's view be towards the european union and the west ?
kosovo albanians remain the most pro-european and pro-atlanticist of all the balkan people .
the challenge for prime minister thaci and president sejdiu will be to prepare kosovo politically , economically and socially for closer links with the eu and to overcome resistance within the eu from countries like cyprus , greece , romania , slovakia and spain who fear that kosovo sets an unwelcome precedent for secessionist threats that they themselves perceive .
from that perspective , kosovo and its supporters in the eu have a unique responsibility and opportunity to demonstrate that kosovo can develop into a full european , democratic state and that its independence does not lead to the instability and insecurity feared by some .
not all eu countries are in favor of an independent kosovo - how is the declaration likely to affect relations within the european bloc when the official eu line will be one of overall support ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some eu nations , like germany , will recognize kosovo some countries have expressed concern and reservations , primarily because of their own domestic situation .
on the other hand , none of them can have a real interest in risking the eu 's ability to act swiftly and decisively over the kosovo issue .
this is not least the case because , apart from the eu in cooperation with nato , there really is no other international actor willing and able to manage kosovo 's transition to independence .
thus , my hope is that despite some countries ' reluctance to recognize kosovo , none of them will be foolish enough to sabotage the eu 's efforts to maintain stability in kosovo and the wider region and enable the region to forge ever closer ties with the bloc as a whole .
what are the best and worst scenarios arising from this declaration of independence : for kosovo , for the balkans , for the eu and for the relationship between east and west ?
the worst-case scenario would be one of wide-spread violence in kosovo , triggering instability in macedonia and bosnia and an eu and nato unable to manage these threats .
also , a prolonged delay in sufficient levels of international recognition of kosovo leading to insufficient economic recovery there , and continuing strains between serbs and albanians in kosovo are unlikely to be helpful to demonstrate that kosovo as an independent state can succeed politically , economically and socially without destabilizing its neighborhood .
the more negative local developments , the more likely also is it that relations between east and west will remain difficult and impact on other major challenges in the international arena - from the middle east conflict , to nuclear proliferation in iran and north korea , to continuing bloodshed in africa .
as a best-case scenario , kosovo will remain stable , its development will take off , serbs will gradually begin to participate in the political process , the balkans will become more integrated into the eu , and the current level of international tensions over kosovo will quickly die down .
this is a tall order , and one would have to be very optimistic to see any , let alone all of this , happen very soon , but neither is there any reason to see the future as bleak as the worst-case scenario . interview : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the overall hope , of course , remains that with kosovo 's independence the last major unresolved issue has been tackled and that the region as a whole can now move forward to closer integration with the eu .
while this will not be easy over the coming months , eventually a sense of reality will set in , and people will realize that this is there only real hope for the future .
serbia has vowed not to recognize an independent kosovo and has spoken of economic and diplomatic sanctions .
what can we expect from serbia in the coming days ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riots broke out in belgrade after kosovo 's declaration there are already signs of serbia backing down from the quite exaggerated threats of cutting diplomatic ties with any country recognizing kosovo .
this is simply not feasible for serbia , especially as the population there still has clear aspirations of eu membership and very strong economic interests both in the eu and the neighboring region .
we will , however , see further declarations and statements against kosovo 's independence and against its recognition by other states .
together with russia , serbia is most likely to try and mobilize the un against kosovo 's unilateral declaration of independence , and membership in the un and other international organizations will be very difficult to obtain for kosovo because of serbian resistance .
while the likelihood of a military conflict is close to zero , there remains a threat of localized violence in and around kosovo , but serious escalation is in nobody 's interest .
moreover , serbia has to think carefully about how to manage its relations with serbs in kosovo .
the arthisaari plan offers many important opportunities to do so , opportunities that kosovo albanians are ready to accept .
discouraging kosovo serb political participation in pristina will not be in the interests of serbs living there , and might further encourage them to leave rather than to stay .
what action do you expect to be taken by the international community in the coming days ?
we will gradually see recognition of kosovo as an independent state from major countries in the eu and the west more generally .
we should also expect support from the arab league and member countries of the organization of the islamic conference .
nato will have to be very alert towards any risk of violence in kosovo , not least in order to assure serbs that they can remain in kosovo and participate in building a democratic state .
russian opposition , on the other hand , also remains a clear fact , and russia will use its membership in the un , and possibly the osce and council of europe , to mobilize against kosovo 's independence .
this , in turn , could have a further negative impact on relations between russia and the west as a whole , again not something in either russia 's or the west 's interests .
is kosovo becoming a pawn in the current power games between the west and russia ?
if so , how will an independent kosovo affect relations ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia , serbia 's ally , remains in opposition to the west kosovo has , for some time , been one among several pawns in these power games .
now that independence has been declared , the issue has come to a head , but at the same time kosovo will gradually become less of an issue , precisely because a decision has been made .
russia may choose not to recognize it and bring it up before the security council and elsewhere , but it was in particular kosovo 's unresolved status that gave russia a certain degree of leverage .
in the long term , i think interest in kosovo will fade , especially if the transition to independence is smooth , no major violence occurs , and kosovo quickly gains recognition from a large number of countries beyond the core western powers .
what will the newly independent kosovo 's view be towards the european union and the west ?
kosovo albanians remain the most pro-european and pro-atlanticist of all the balkan people .
the challenge for prime minister thaci and president sejdiu will be to prepare kosovo politically , economically and socially for closer links with the eu and to overcome resistance within the eu from countries like cyprus , greece , romania , slovakia and spain who fear that kosovo sets an unwelcome precedent for secessionist threats that they themselves perceive .
from that perspective , kosovo and its supporters in the eu have a unique responsibility and opportunity to demonstrate that kosovo can develop into a full european , democratic state and that its independence does not lead to the instability and insecurity feared by some .
not all eu countries are in favor of an independent kosovo - how is the declaration likely to affect relations within the european bloc when the official eu line will be one of overall support ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some eu nations , like germany , will recognize kosovo some countries have expressed concern and reservations , primarily because of their own domestic situation .
on the other hand , none of them can have a real interest in risking the eu 's ability to act swiftly and decisively over the kosovo issue .
this is not least the case because , apart from the eu in cooperation with nato , there really is no other international actor willing and able to manage kosovo 's transition to independence .
thus , my hope is that despite some countries ' reluctance to recognize kosovo , none of them will be foolish enough to sabotage the eu 's efforts to maintain stability in kosovo and the wider region and enable the region to forge ever closer ties with the bloc as a whole .
what are the best and worst scenarios arising from this declaration of independence : for kosovo , for the balkans , for the eu and for the relationship between east and west ?
the worst-case scenario would be one of wide-spread violence in kosovo , triggering instability in macedonia and bosnia and an eu and nato unable to manage these threats .
also , a prolonged delay in sufficient levels of international recognition of kosovo leading to insufficient economic recovery there , and continuing strains between serbs and albanians in kosovo are unlikely to be helpful to demonstrate that kosovo as an independent state can succeed politically , economically and socially without destabilizing its neighborhood .
the more negative local developments , the more likely also is it that relations between east and west will remain difficult and impact on other major challenges in the international arena - from the middle east conflict , to nuclear proliferation in iran and north korea , to continuing bloodshed in africa .
as a best-case scenario , kosovo will remain stable , its development will take off , serbs will gradually begin to participate in the political process , the balkans will become more integrated into the eu , and the current level of international tensions over kosovo will quickly die down .
this is a tall order , and one would have to be very optimistic to see any , let alone all of this , happen very soon , but neither is there any reason to see the future as bleak as the worst-case scenario . interview : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke to balkans expert stefan wolff about what kosovo and the world can expect in the near future . stefan wolff is a professor of political science and director of the centre for international crisis management and conflict resolution at nottingham university in the uk .
he has extensive expertise in northern ireland , the balkans and central and eastern europe , and has also worked on a wide range of other conflicts elsewhere , including the middle east , africa , and central , south and southeast asia . dw-world.de : is kosovo prepared for independence in terms of infrastructure , governance , security and stability ? stefan wolff : kosovo has most of the important institutions of statehood and democratic governance in place , but at the same time these institutions will require continued international support for some time .
this is accepted by both the kosovars and the west and is the background against which we need to understand the eu mission for kosovo - as external assistance to consolidate existing institutional structures to enable kosovars to take care of developing their economy , infrastructure and ensure security and stability . the decision to declare independence is not a unanimous one within the population .
what minorities in kosovo have most to lose from this independence ? in principle , all minorities and the majority albanian population can gain from the clarification of kosovo 's international status , not least in the sense that they will all benefit from economic development .
prime minister thaci made some very important gestures yesterday towards reconciliation with serbs in kosovo .
the arthisaari plan offers important mechanisms to serbs to preserve and develop their identity , gives them opportunities to play a meaningful part in the political process in kosovo and retain ties with serbia .
from this perspective , there is no need for conflict between the two main population groups , but that does not mean that extremists on either side will refrain from violence and provocations .
so far , this risk has been contained , but not eliminated . what can we expect in terms of reaction and action from kosovo 's balkan neighbors ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few of the region 's conflicts are fully resolved the balkan region as a whole remains quite vulnerable to the threat of ethnic conflict .
we must bear in mind that few , if any , of the conflicts that led to bloodshed throughout the 1990s have really been resolved .
we have institutions in place now that help manage these conflicts politically , but tensions in bosnia and macedonia , for example , remain .
apart from albania and slovenia , i do n't think that any of the other balkan countries will find it a very easy decision to recognize kosovo .
eventually , however , macedonia , bosnia , croatia and montenegro will recognize the independence of kosovo , but this will not be a process free from domestic debate .
how will kosovo 's independence affect the wider balkan region ?
because of the close links between kosovo and two other major previous secessionist conflicts - bosnia , the serbs , and macedonia , the albanians - there is a danger that violence in and around kosovo could spread and create instability across the balkans .
there also remains an open question in relation to the future of albanians in southern serbia .

board members in listed companies received anything from 40,000 to over seven million euros -lrb- $ 58,000 to over $ 10 million -rrb- . the release of the survey comes at a particularly sensitive time in germany .
a huge tax evasion scandal involving senior executives is currently unfolding , and concerns are growing about the gulf between the haves and the have-nots .
the kienbaum management consultancy firm said it had arrived at its results after questioning 4,300 executives at 1,300 companies .
top managers in dax-listed companies came out best in the survey with an average increase in earnings of 23.3 percent , while executive pay in privately owned firms climbed by 12.6 percent .
performance-related pay shot up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans feel the gulf between the poor and the wealthy is getting too wide most of the increase was accounted for in the form of bonuses , according to the study .
" this clear rise is due above all to the increase in the variable parts of their saleries indexed on their company results , while base salaries generally remained constant , " said kienbaum 's managing director alexander von preen .
among those surveyed , some 350 companies gave their board members more than 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 732,635 -rrb- , 128 of them rewarded them with over a million and 44 paid more than two million euros .
according to kienbaum , the number of staff and the state of a firm 's finances were the main factors determining pay levels .
on average , board chairmans received 50 percent more than other board members , but the difference in practice ranged from 10 to 300 percent .

board members in listed companies received anything from 40,000 to over seven million euros -lrb- $ 58,000 to over $ 10 million -rrb- . the release of the survey comes at a particularly sensitive time in germany .
a huge tax evasion scandal involving senior executives is currently unfolding , and concerns are growing about the gulf between the haves and the have-nots .
the kienbaum management consultancy firm said it had arrived at its results after questioning 4,300 executives at 1,300 companies .
top managers in dax-listed companies came out best in the survey with an average increase in earnings of 23.3 percent , while executive pay in privately owned firms climbed by 12.6 percent .
performance-related pay shot up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans feel the gulf between the poor and the wealthy is getting too wide most of the increase was accounted for in the form of bonuses , according to the study .
" this clear rise is due above all to the increase in the variable parts of their saleries indexed on their company results , while base salaries generally remained constant , " said kienbaum 's managing director alexander von preen .
among those surveyed , some 350 companies gave their board members more than 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 732,635 -rrb- , 128 of them rewarded them with over a million and 44 paid more than two million euros .
according to kienbaum , the number of staff and the state of a firm 's finances were the main factors determining pay levels .
on average , board chairmans received 50 percent more than other board members , but the difference in practice ranged from 10 to 300 percent .
adding fuel to the flames ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the probe against the former post ceo and other executives is raising questions the figures are set to further stoke the debate in germany about the integrity of the executive class sparked by a tax probe into allegations that wealthy executives hid assets in liechtenstein to dodge paying taxes .
at the same time , there is also growing resentment over benefit cuts and stagnating wages in the light of the renewed economic growth of recent years and rising energy and food prices .
after months of wild cat strikes , the german rail company agreed at the end of january to give german train drivers an eight-per cent pay rise from march .

dw-world.de spoke to balkans expert stefan wolff about what kosovo and the world can expect in the near future . stefan wolff is a professor of political science and director of the centre for international crisis management and conflict resolution at nottingham university in the uk .
he has extensive expertise in northern ireland , the balkans and central and eastern europe , and has also worked on a wide range of other conflicts elsewhere , including the middle east , africa , and central , south and southeast asia . dw-world.de : is kosovo prepared for independence in terms of infrastructure , governance , security and stability ? stefan wolff : kosovo has most of the important institutions of statehood and democratic governance in place , but at the same time these institutions will require continued international support for some time .
this is accepted by both the kosovars and the west and is the background against which we need to understand the eu mission for kosovo - as external assistance to consolidate existing institutional structures to enable kosovars to take care of developing their economy , infrastructure and ensure security and stability . the decision to declare independence is not a unanimous one within the population .
what minorities in kosovo have most to lose from this independence ? in principle , all minorities and the majority albanian population can gain from the clarification of kosovo 's international status , not least in the sense that they will all benefit from economic development .
prime minister thaci made some very important gestures yesterday towards reconciliation with serbs in kosovo .
the arthisaari plan offers important mechanisms to serbs to preserve and develop their identity , gives them opportunities to play a meaningful part in the political process in kosovo and retain ties with serbia .
from this perspective , there is no need for conflict between the two main population groups , but that does not mean that extremists on either side will refrain from violence and provocations .
so far , this risk has been contained , but not eliminated . what can we expect in terms of reaction and action from kosovo 's balkan neighbors ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few of the region 's conflicts are fully resolved the balkan region as a whole remains quite vulnerable to the threat of ethnic conflict .
we must bear in mind that few , if any , of the conflicts that led to bloodshed throughout the 1990s have really been resolved .
we have institutions in place now that help manage these conflicts politically , but tensions in bosnia and macedonia , for example , remain .
apart from albania and slovenia , i do n't think that any of the other balkan countries will find it a very easy decision to recognize kosovo .
eventually , however , macedonia , bosnia , croatia and montenegro will recognize the independence of kosovo , but this will not be a process free from domestic debate .
how will kosovo 's independence affect the wider balkan region ?
because of the close links between kosovo and two other major previous secessionist conflicts - bosnia , the serbs , and macedonia , the albanians - there is a danger that violence in and around kosovo could spread and create instability across the balkans .
there also remains an open question in relation to the future of albanians in southern serbia .
the overall hope , of course , remains that with kosovo 's independence the last major unresolved issue has been tackled and that the region as a whole can now move forward to closer integration with the eu .
while this will not be easy over the coming months , eventually a sense of reality will set in , and people will realize that this is there only real hope for the future .
serbia has vowed not to recognize an independent kosovo and has spoken of economic and diplomatic sanctions .
what can we expect from serbia in the coming days ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riots broke out in belgrade after kosovo 's declaration there are already signs of serbia backing down from the quite exaggerated threats of cutting diplomatic ties with any country recognizing kosovo .
this is simply not feasible for serbia , especially as the population there still has clear aspirations of eu membership and very strong economic interests both in the eu and the neighboring region .
we will , however , see further declarations and statements against kosovo 's independence and against its recognition by other states .
together with russia , serbia is most likely to try and mobilize the un against kosovo 's unilateral declaration of independence , and membership in the un and other international organizations will be very difficult to obtain for kosovo because of serbian resistance .
while the likelihood of a military conflict is close to zero , there remains a threat of localized violence in and around kosovo , but serious escalation is in nobody 's interest .
moreover , serbia has to think carefully about how to manage its relations with serbs in kosovo .
the arthisaari plan offers many important opportunities to do so , opportunities that kosovo albanians are ready to accept .
discouraging kosovo serb political participation in pristina will not be in the interests of serbs living there , and might further encourage them to leave rather than to stay .
what action do you expect to be taken by the international community in the coming days ?
we will gradually see recognition of kosovo as an independent state from major countries in the eu and the west more generally .
we should also expect support from the arab league and member countries of the organization of the islamic conference .
nato will have to be very alert towards any risk of violence in kosovo , not least in order to assure serbs that they can remain in kosovo and participate in building a democratic state .
russian opposition , on the other hand , also remains a clear fact , and russia will use its membership in the un , and possibly the osce and council of europe , to mobilize against kosovo 's independence .
this , in turn , could have a further negative impact on relations between russia and the west as a whole , again not something in either russia 's or the west 's interests .
is kosovo becoming a pawn in the current power games between the west and russia ?
if so , how will an independent kosovo affect relations ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia , serbia 's ally , remains in opposition to the west kosovo has , for some time , been one among several pawns in these power games .
now that independence has been declared , the issue has come to a head , but at the same time kosovo will gradually become less of an issue , precisely because a decision has been made .
russia may choose not to recognize it and bring it up before the security council and elsewhere , but it was in particular kosovo 's unresolved status that gave russia a certain degree of leverage .
in the long term , i think interest in kosovo will fade , especially if the transition to independence is smooth , no major violence occurs , and kosovo quickly gains recognition from a large number of countries beyond the core western powers .
what will the newly independent kosovo 's view be towards the european union and the west ?
kosovo albanians remain the most pro-european and pro-atlanticist of all the balkan people .
the challenge for prime minister thaci and president sejdiu will be to prepare kosovo politically , economically and socially for closer links with the eu and to overcome resistance within the eu from countries like cyprus , greece , romania , slovakia and spain who fear that kosovo sets an unwelcome precedent for secessionist threats that they themselves perceive .
from that perspective , kosovo and its supporters in the eu have a unique responsibility and opportunity to demonstrate that kosovo can develop into a full european , democratic state and that its independence does not lead to the instability and insecurity feared by some .
not all eu countries are in favor of an independent kosovo - how is the declaration likely to affect relations within the european bloc when the official eu line will be one of overall support ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some eu nations , like germany , will recognize kosovo some countries have expressed concern and reservations , primarily because of their own domestic situation .
on the other hand , none of them can have a real interest in risking the eu 's ability to act swiftly and decisively over the kosovo issue .
this is not least the case because , apart from the eu in cooperation with nato , there really is no other international actor willing and able to manage kosovo 's transition to independence .
thus , my hope is that despite some countries ' reluctance to recognize kosovo , none of them will be foolish enough to sabotage the eu 's efforts to maintain stability in kosovo and the wider region and enable the region to forge ever closer ties with the bloc as a whole .
what are the best and worst scenarios arising from this declaration of independence : for kosovo , for the balkans , for the eu and for the relationship between east and west ?
the worst-case scenario would be one of wide-spread violence in kosovo , triggering instability in macedonia and bosnia and an eu and nato unable to manage these threats .
also , a prolonged delay in sufficient levels of international recognition of kosovo leading to insufficient economic recovery there , and continuing strains between serbs and albanians in kosovo are unlikely to be helpful to demonstrate that kosovo as an independent state can succeed politically , economically and socially without destabilizing its neighborhood .
the more negative local developments , the more likely also is it that relations between east and west will remain difficult and impact on other major challenges in the international arena - from the middle east conflict , to nuclear proliferation in iran and north korea , to continuing bloodshed in africa .
as a best-case scenario , kosovo will remain stable , its development will take off , serbs will gradually begin to participate in the political process , the balkans will become more integrated into the eu , and the current level of international tensions over kosovo will quickly die down .
this is a tall order , and one would have to be very optimistic to see any , let alone all of this , happen very soon , but neither is there any reason to see the future as bleak as the worst-case scenario . interview : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the concert brought both applause and protests . heesters is a controversial figure in the netherlands because of his cozy relationship with the nazi occupiers .
security was tight at the de flint theater in heester 's hometown of amersfoort , where he put on a concert for the first time since 1963 on saturday , feb .
16 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors equate the singer with fascism police said several dozen protesters as well as a few neo-nazis showed up outside the concert hall , but the performance went on undisturbed .
the last time heesters tried to peform in the netherlands , he was booed off the stage by the audience , who stood up and gave nazi salutes .
heesters was born in amersfoort , a town 50 kilometers -lrb- 35 miles -rrb- east of amsterdam in 1903 .
yet he made his fortune in germany .
the artist is revered by generations of germans for his operettas and film performances .
one of hitler 's " divinely gifted " artists heesters has been a popular german-language singer since the 1930s , becoming a favorite of the nazis and one of the " divinely gifted " artists who took part in performances to boost the morale of soldiers during the war .
heesters claims he did not know what was happening to jews during the war despite visiting the dachau concentration camp in 1941 .
" honestly , i was too busy working , " heesters said in an interview after a tv gala celebrating his 100th birthday in 2003 .
" i could n't do anything about politics . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heesters is considered a musical legend in germany while germans have taken heesters at his word and continue to watch his old films such as " always you " and " illusion , " many of his dutch countrymen have never forgiven him for his acceptance of the nazi regime during world war ii .
after the nazi defeat , heesters continued his career in germany , settling in bavaria .
heesters is considered to be the oldest living performer .
at the concert saturday , heesters performed hits such as " the merry widow " and " there by the windmill " despite breaking several ribs on jan .
1 during a fall .
at the concert he occasionally needed help from his wife to remember the lines , but otherwise sang with a steady voice , according to media reports . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

opinion : long road to normalcy in kosovo european ties -pipe- 18.02.2008 major eu powers , us recognize kosovo independence großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people in kosovo celebrated the independence of their nation with a new flag the four major european powers and the majority of its other member states have said they will soon formally accept kosovo as an independent state , following the us ' lead . us secretary of state condoleeza rice congratulated the people of kosovo on monday on becoming the world 's newest state .
" as kosovo today begins its life as an independent state , the united states pledges to continue to be its close friend and partner , " she said , while also calling serbia to reaffirm the us 's ties with serbia , an ally during two world wars .
germany , france , britain and italy were among the countries that announced their intention to recognize kosovo at an eu foreign ministers ' meeting in brussels on monday .
spain and several other european countries have vowed not to do so .
nevertheless , the 27 ministers managed to unite behind a statement that left each member state free to make up its mind on the issue of recognition , but authorized the european union to use bloc funds and staff to " promote economic and political development " in kosovo .
germany to take step in two days ' time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's action against serbia in kosovo was its first post-world war ii military engagement german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier told reporters that berlin would formally recognize the state on wednesday and french foreign minister bernard kouchner said president nicolas sarkozy had written a letter of recognition which would be sent to the president of the new state on monday .
the danish news agendy ritzau reported that danish foreign minister per stig moeller said 12 to 15 eu states would also take this step on thursday or friday .
british foreign minister david miliband described the move " as the last piece of the yugoslav jigsaw . "
the ministers said kosovo was a unique case because of the yugoslav wars of the 1990s and did not set a precedent for other breakaway regions around the world or undermine international legal principles .
spain , cyprus , slovakia and romania - which all have concerns about the legal precedent or minority rights - opposed an independent kosovo .
spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos said secession needed either the agreement of both serbia and kosovo , or a un security council resolution to be legal .
slovenia , which holds the eu 's rotating presidency , played down the differences .
the eu has already taken an important decision to help guarantee kosovo 's future .
at the weekend , it launched a mission to send police , justice and administrative officials to the balkans .
serbia , which claims sovereignty over the territory , vowed to blockade kosovo and launched a criminal action against its leaders for their declaration of independence .
russia , serbia 's closest ally , stopped the un security council from adopting a blueprint for supervised independence last year .
serbia said on monday it was recalling its ambasssador to the united states after washington recognised serbia 's breakaway province of kosovo as independent . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de southern europe -pipe- 18.02.2008 cyprus election gives new hope for dialogue , reunification großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cypriots voted for change sunday a surprise outcome in the first round of voting in cyprus revived hopes that the island will be able to end three decades of division along ethnic lines . current president tassos papadopoulos , a staunch opponent of dialogue with turkish cypriots , suffered a surprising defeat in the first round of presidential elections on sunday , feb .
17 . the two front-runners have vowed to change course and find a solution to the " cyprus problem " which has kept the island divided for three decades . conservative ioannis kassoulidis and general secretary of the communist party demetris christofias will vie for the presidency in the final round of voting on feb .
24 .
both have pledged to resume peace talks , which were stalled after papadopoulos urged the rejection of a united nations peace plan in 2004 . surprising defeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demetris christofias wants reunification president papadopoulos was expected to easily make it into the final round of voting , as he was ahead in opinion polls .
during campaigning papadopoulos said his political rivals would " sell out " the republic of cyprus if they won . after his surprising third-place finish sunday , kassoulidis and christofias began aggressively courting papadopoulos supporters . kassoulidis , the country 's former foreign minister , won 33.5 percent of the vote .
christofias , who is parliament speaker and left the government coalition led by papadopoulos to run for president , won 33.3 percent of the vote .
less than 1,000 votes separated the two candidates . both candidates are appealing to the socialist party edek , center-right diko and the greens to join their ticket in the general elections .
in cyprus , where voting is obligatory , the president has to clinch at least 50 percent plus one vote . politicians will spend the next week strengthening party alliances and making political promises in exchange for support in the presidential race , european university of cyprus research executive pambos papageorgiou told afp . " in the end it will come down to party alliances and horse trading , “ papageorgiou said . both candidates want dialogue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ioannis kasoulides wants an end to the " cyprus problem " " all those who believe that cyprus should become a modern european state , now is the time to join together , " kasoulides , 59 , said sunday outside his campaign headquarters .
" now is the time to overcome all that has divided the people on the cyprus problem these past years . " cyprus , which gained independence from britain in 1960 , is one of the most popular mediterranean tourist destinations . cyprus was split along ethnic lines in 1974 after turkey responded to an effort to unite the island with greece by invading the northern part of the country .
turkish cypriots have a breakaway state in the north which is recognized only by ankara . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president papadopoulos was ousted in the voting “ our goal is to reunite the people of this tragic , afflicted country , ” christofias , 61 , said . papadopoulos , 74 , is seen as responsible for the failure of a un blueprint in 2004 to unite the country before it entered the eu .
after the plan failed , the southern republic of cyprus joined the eu in 2004 .
turkey has repeatedly accused greek cypriots of trying to stop its own efforts to join the eu . turkish prime minister recep tayyib erdogan said ahead of the vote that he remained hopeful of a cyprus settlement . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 18.02.2008 berlin film festival winner courts controversy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " tropa de elite " has divided viewers both at home , in brazil , and abroad brazilian director jose padilha won the berlin film festival 's top prize for his controversial movie , " tropa de elite " -lrb- " elite squad " -rrb- .
dw-world.de spoke to him about the film 's reception , brazil and on-screen violence . dw-world.de : you decided on a first-person narrator who tells the story off-camera .
it 's a means to make the viewer identify with the main character , a brutal police officer .
were you conscious of the possibility that the protagonist could also be understood as the hero ? jose padilha : the movie 's main character is n't seen that way at all .
some newspapers wrote that the brazilians had found a hero in captain nascimento and that that would mean the brazilian people were in favor of violence .
that 's not the case .
that 's a distortion of brazilian reality . narration in the first-person form is common in film .
indeed , it does create a relationship between the viewer and the character who 's telling the story .
the viewer sees the movie through the eyes of this character .
but i do n't see it as a problem to do that with a police officer in order to understand his point of view .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : padilha certainly got people talking in the same manner , i do n't have a problem with scorsese 's choice in " good fellas . "
the main character is a mafioso .
as the viewer , you 're on his side the whole time , and that certainly does n't mean that you think the mafia is good .
the viewer has the ability to keep fiction and reality separate .
many critics underestimate that , but i believe that the viewer is smart enough to understand what he sees . the depiction of the brazilian middle class in your film was very controversial in brazil - the same middle and upper class that place the entire blame for social problems on the governments , without bearing in mind that they exploit their domestic help .
is your movie the beginning of a consciousness in that respect ? urban violence in brazil is viewed as a private war between criminals and drug dealers .
the middle class thus counts itself out .
but it goes without saying that it 's involved .
it takes part in this war .
when a drug user buys his dope from an armed group that controls a poor neighborhood , he 's backing the drug dealer 's weapons .
the user is aware of it all .
he 's part of this societal process . the hypocrisy is enormous among the brazilian middle class .
many of the people who have money take advantage of police corruption .
someone from the middle class who 's committed an offense can bribe a police officer and wo n't even be arrested .
there 's complicity between this middle class and the current situation in brazil , which causes violence . bildunterschrift : padilha did not shy away from showing violence your movie is debated both in brazil as well as abroad .
there 's been serious criticism as well as much praise , but people are not neutral about it .
did you expect the film 's reception to be so contentious outside of brazil too ? it was clear that the discussion would come to berlin .
it was brought here by brazilian critics .
whether the polemic would have developed here , i ca n't say , maybe .
in any case , the discussion is interesting .
part of this debate developed because many people viewed interrelations with dated concepts .
the idea that one must observe a societal process from the right or the left is dead for me . my film sees reality through the metaphor of a game .
if you want to understand an individual 's behavior , you have to take into account that this person makes decisions according to the rules of a society .
that 's clear in the film .
what rules must a police officer from rio submit to ?
he earns $ 400 -lrb- 275 euros -rrb- a month , is poorly educated and must find his way within a completely corrupt structure .
and on top of that we want him to take a stand against heavily armed opponents in the favela -lsb- slums -rsb- in the name of the law .
he 's supposed to risk his life and for the long term . " tropa de elite " shows brazil as an unscrupulous country , whether in the callousness of the middle class or in the brutality of the police .
is there a way out of this situation ? the result of the game depends on the rules .
that means that if you change the rules , you can get a different result .
the players themselves determine these societal rules .
we can change a lot : the law that controls the drug trade , the police structures .
we can stop sending a violent police force into the slums , and instead we can build a school there .
one can change a lot .
my aim is to show that we have created this situation ourselves .
and so , we can change it to .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : padilha aimed to depict brazilian reality you worked together with one of the scriptwriters from " city of god . "
the two films have certain similarities : the unsteady camera , the editing and , to a certain extent , the soundtrack .
is there a new genre in brazilian film that favors violence packaged in a fast rhythm ? in those days , the prevailing opinion was that one could only make a critical film by using a distanced approach .
it was important not to involve the viewer emotionally .
that 's not been the case for ages .
in " city of god , " fernando meirelles saw precisely that .
i do n't need any slow sequences , which - referring to brecht - take the viewer out of the events and tell him : " now think about it . "
that 's not necessary . if i involve the viewer emotionally throughout the entire film , i create an even bigger debate in the end . i 'm not saying in any way that you should n't make slow films anymore .
for me , it 's about stressing that a movie that uses emotion to involve the viewer does n't need to preclude reason .
on the contrary , emotion brings reason into the film , much more so than a critical and distanced approach .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 18.02.2008 berlin film festival winner courts controversy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " tropa de elite " has divided viewers both at home , in brazil , and abroad brazilian director jose padilha won the berlin film festival 's top prize for his controversial movie , " tropa de elite " -lrb- " elite squad " -rrb- .
dw-world.de spoke to him about the film 's reception , brazil and on-screen violence . dw-world.de : you decided on a first-person narrator who tells the story off-camera .
it 's a means to make the viewer identify with the main character , a brutal police officer .
were you conscious of the possibility that the protagonist could also be understood as the hero ? jose padilha : the movie 's main character is n't seen that way at all .
some newspapers wrote that the brazilians had found a hero in captain nascimento and that that would mean the brazilian people were in favor of violence .
that 's not the case .
that 's a distortion of brazilian reality . narration in the first-person form is common in film .
indeed , it does create a relationship between the viewer and the character who 's telling the story .
the viewer sees the movie through the eyes of this character .
but i do n't see it as a problem to do that with a police officer in order to understand his point of view .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : padilha certainly got people talking in the same manner , i do n't have a problem with scorsese 's choice in " good fellas . "
the main character is a mafioso .
as the viewer , you 're on his side the whole time , and that certainly does n't mean that you think the mafia is good .
the viewer has the ability to keep fiction and reality separate .
many critics underestimate that , but i believe that the viewer is smart enough to understand what he sees . the depiction of the brazilian middle class in your film was very controversial in brazil - the same middle and upper class that place the entire blame for social problems on the governments , without bearing in mind that they exploit their domestic help .
is your movie the beginning of a consciousness in that respect ? urban violence in brazil is viewed as a private war between criminals and drug dealers .
the middle class thus counts itself out .
but it goes without saying that it 's involved .
it takes part in this war .
when a drug user buys his dope from an armed group that controls a poor neighborhood , he 's backing the drug dealer 's weapons .
the user is aware of it all .
he 's part of this societal process . the hypocrisy is enormous among the brazilian middle class .
many of the people who have money take advantage of police corruption .
someone from the middle class who 's committed an offense can bribe a police officer and wo n't even be arrested .
there 's complicity between this middle class and the current situation in brazil , which causes violence . bildunterschrift : padilha did not shy away from showing violence your movie is debated both in brazil as well as abroad .
there 's been serious criticism as well as much praise , but people are not neutral about it .
did you expect the film 's reception to be so contentious outside of brazil too ? it was clear that the discussion would come to berlin .
it was brought here by brazilian critics .
whether the polemic would have developed here , i ca n't say , maybe .
in any case , the discussion is interesting .
part of this debate developed because many people viewed interrelations with dated concepts .
the idea that one must observe a societal process from the right or the left is dead for me . my film sees reality through the metaphor of a game .
if you want to understand an individual 's behavior , you have to take into account that this person makes decisions according to the rules of a society .
that 's clear in the film .
what rules must a police officer from rio submit to ?
he earns $ 400 -lrb- 275 euros -rrb- a month , is poorly educated and must find his way within a completely corrupt structure .
and on top of that we want him to take a stand against heavily armed opponents in the favela -lsb- slums -rsb- in the name of the law .
he 's supposed to risk his life and for the long term . " tropa de elite " shows brazil as an unscrupulous country , whether in the callousness of the middle class or in the brutality of the police .
is there a way out of this situation ? the result of the game depends on the rules .
that means that if you change the rules , you can get a different result .
the players themselves determine these societal rules .
we can change a lot : the law that controls the drug trade , the police structures .
we can stop sending a violent police force into the slums , and instead we can build a school there .
one can change a lot .
my aim is to show that we have created this situation ourselves .
and so , we can change it to .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : padilha aimed to depict brazilian reality you worked together with one of the scriptwriters from " city of god . "
the two films have certain similarities : the unsteady camera , the editing and , to a certain extent , the soundtrack .
is there a new genre in brazilian film that favors violence packaged in a fast rhythm ? in those days , the prevailing opinion was that one could only make a critical film by using a distanced approach .
it was important not to involve the viewer emotionally .
that 's not been the case for ages .
in " city of god , " fernando meirelles saw precisely that .
i do n't need any slow sequences , which - referring to brecht - take the viewer out of the events and tell him : " now think about it . "
that 's not necessary . if i involve the viewer emotionally throughout the entire film , i create an even bigger debate in the end . i 'm not saying in any way that you should n't make slow films anymore .
for me , it 's about stressing that a movie that uses emotion to involve the viewer does n't need to preclude reason .
on the contrary , emotion brings reason into the film , much more so than a critical and distanced approach .
people may love or hate " tropa de elite , " but they are talking about the film .

the middle class thus counts itself out .
but it goes without saying that it 's involved .
it takes part in this war .
when a drug user buys his dope from an armed group that controls a poor neighborhood , he 's backing the drug dealer 's weapons .
the user is aware of it all .
he 's part of this societal process . the hypocrisy is enormous among the brazilian middle class .
many of the people who have money take advantage of police corruption .
someone from the middle class who 's committed an offense can bribe a police officer and wo n't even be arrested .
there 's complicity between this middle class and the current situation in brazil , which causes violence . bildunterschrift : padilha did not shy away from showing violence your movie is debated both in brazil as well as abroad .
there 's been serious criticism as well as much praise , but people are not neutral about it .
did you expect the film 's reception to be so contentious outside of brazil too ? it was clear that the discussion would come to berlin .
it was brought here by brazilian critics .
whether the polemic would have developed here , i ca n't say , maybe .
in any case , the discussion is interesting .
part of this debate developed because many people viewed interrelations with dated concepts .
the idea that one must observe a societal process from the right or the left is dead for me . my film sees reality through the metaphor of a game .
if you want to understand an individual 's behavior , you have to take into account that this person makes decisions according to the rules of a society .
that 's clear in the film .
what rules must a police officer from rio submit to ?
he earns $ 400 -lrb- 275 euros -rrb- a month , is poorly educated and must find his way within a completely corrupt structure .
and on top of that we want him to take a stand against heavily armed opponents in the favela -lsb- slums -rsb- in the name of the law .
he 's supposed to risk his life and for the long term . " tropa de elite " shows brazil as an unscrupulous country , whether in the callousness of the middle class or in the brutality of the police .
is there a way out of this situation ? the result of the game depends on the rules .
that means that if you change the rules , you can get a different result .
the players themselves determine these societal rules .
we can change a lot : the law that controls the drug trade , the police structures .
we can stop sending a violent police force into the slums , and instead we can build a school there .
one can change a lot .
my aim is to show that we have created this situation ourselves .
and so , we can change it to .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : padilha aimed to depict brazilian reality you worked together with one of the scriptwriters from " city of god . "
the two films have certain similarities : the unsteady camera , the editing and , to a certain extent , the soundtrack .
is there a new genre in brazilian film that favors violence packaged in a fast rhythm ? in those days , the prevailing opinion was that one could only make a critical film by using a distanced approach .
it was important not to involve the viewer emotionally .
that 's not been the case for ages .
in " city of god , " fernando meirelles saw precisely that .
i do n't need any slow sequences , which - referring to brecht - take the viewer out of the events and tell him : " now think about it . "
that 's not necessary . if i involve the viewer emotionally throughout the entire film , i create an even bigger debate in the end . i 'm not saying in any way that you should n't make slow films anymore .
for me , it 's about stressing that a movie that uses emotion to involve the viewer does n't need to preclude reason .
on the contrary , emotion brings reason into the film , much more so than a critical and distanced approach .
people may love or hate " tropa de elite , " but they are talking about the film .
that 's exactly what we wanted . interview : soraia vilela -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

18 , it was the differences of their clean-up operations which summed up the feelings not only of their country folk but those of the international community at large . in kosovo 's capital , the detritus of celebration littered the streets as the sun rose on the country 's first full day of self-declared independence from serbia .
tens of thousands of people celebrated long into the night in central pristina on sunday in recognition of the kosovo parliament 's formal vote to break from serbia , a move that completed the conflict-strewn breakup of the former yugoslavia . however , as the first rays of light settled on belgrade , the night 's events in the serbian capital told a different story . the rubble , broken glass and spent tear gas canisters spoke volumes about the serbian response : riots in protest against kosovo 's declaration had swept through the streets for several hours , with the wrath of the crowd focused on the symbols of those they perceived as helping tear serbian 's heartland province away .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the streets of belgrade erupted in violence riot police battled hundreds of youths with batons after the baying mob had smashed two mcdonald 's restaurants and attacked the us and slovenian embassies with stones .
hospital officials said at least 50 people , including 20 policemen , were injured during the rioting , but none seriously . earlier , in the south of serbia , members of the kosovo police service stopped several hundred former serbian army reservists dressed in military uniforms from crossing into the province ahead of the declaration . international reactions reflect divide away from the streets , the international community soon began positioning itself in the two camps of " for " and " against . "
the trickle of responses began early , with those opposing the move striking quickly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia 's reaction would be peaceful but forceful said tadic serbia 's president boris tadic attempted to calm fears of escalating violence by speaking diplomatically , but the message was clear : serbia would not recognize this new kosovo and would work to stop its independence in its tracks .
" serbia has reacted and will react with all peaceful , diplomatic and legal means to annul this act committed by kosovo 's institutions , " he said . serbia 's main ally , russia , soon threw its considerable weight behind tadic 's message by calling a special meeting of the united nations security council to discuss the issue late sunday , but failed to secure backing for its call to declare kosovo 's declaration " null and void . " china expressed concern about the effects kosovo 's declaration would have on peace in the balkans , urging the two governments to work out their problems through dialogue .
" kosovo 's unilateral act can produce a series of results that will lead to seriously negative influence on peace and stability in the balkan region and on the realization of building a multiethnic society in kosovo , which china is deeply concerned about , " foreign affairs ministry spokesman liu jianchao said . " china calls on the two sides of serbia and kosovo to continue to seek a proper solution through negotiation within the framework of international law , and the international community should create favorable conditions for this , " he added . concerns over wave of separatist declarations sri lanka , a country with its own problems with separatism , said it was concerned about kosovo 's unilateral declaration of independence , as it could set a precedent in other parts of the world and hurt nations . " the unilateral declaration of independence by kosovo could set an unmanageable precedent in the conduct of international relations , the established global order of sovereign states and could thus pose a grave threat to international peace and security , " the foreign ministry said in a statement .
" this action by kosovo is a violation of the charter of the united nations , which enshrines the sovereignty and territorial integrity of member states . " sri lankan forces have been fighting a 25-year insurgency by tamil separatists , who want an independent homeland in the east and north of the island . new zealand 's prime minister helen clark announced that her country would not recognize an independent kosovo , saying it was never the government 's position to offer diplomatic recognition in such circumstances .

" we are not intending to make a formal statement . " supporters say stability comes from recognition bildunterschrift : kosovo thanks its supporters but not everyone is in favor australia led the early calls of support for independent kosovo , with prime minister kevin rudd announcing that australia would recognize the new state .
" the sorry history of kosovo means that we 've got to do whatever we can do to ensure the citizens of that part of the world are protected into the future , " rudd said .

that 's why diplomatically we would extend diplomatic recognition at the earliest opportunity . " taiwan 's independence-leaning government echoed australia 's stance .
" self-determination is a right recognized by the united nations , and it is the people who are masters of their nation 's future , " the foreign ministry said in a statement .
" in no way should the independence of one nation be denied by another .

18 , it was the differences of their clean-up operations which summed up the feelings not only of their country folk but those of the international community at large . in kosovo 's capital , the detritus of celebration littered the streets as the sun rose on the country 's first full day of self-declared independence from serbia .
tens of thousands of people celebrated long into the night in central pristina on sunday in recognition of the kosovo parliament 's formal vote to break from serbia , a move that completed the conflict-strewn breakup of the former yugoslavia . however , as the first rays of light settled on belgrade , the night 's events in the serbian capital told a different story . the rubble , broken glass and spent tear gas canisters spoke volumes about the serbian response : riots in protest against kosovo 's declaration had swept through the streets for several hours , with the wrath of the crowd focused on the symbols of those they perceived as helping tear serbian 's heartland province away .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the streets of belgrade erupted in violence riot police battled hundreds of youths with batons after the baying mob had smashed two mcdonald 's restaurants and attacked the us and slovenian embassies with stones .
hospital officials said at least 50 people , including 20 policemen , were injured during the rioting , but none seriously . earlier , in the south of serbia , members of the kosovo police service stopped several hundred former serbian army reservists dressed in military uniforms from crossing into the province ahead of the declaration . international reactions reflect divide away from the streets , the international community soon began positioning itself in the two camps of " for " and " against . "
the trickle of responses began early , with those opposing the move striking quickly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia 's reaction would be peaceful but forceful said tadic serbia 's president boris tadic attempted to calm fears of escalating violence by speaking diplomatically , but the message was clear : serbia would not recognize this new kosovo and would work to stop its independence in its tracks .
" serbia has reacted and will react with all peaceful , diplomatic and legal means to annul this act committed by kosovo 's institutions , " he said . serbia 's main ally , russia , soon threw its considerable weight behind tadic 's message by calling a special meeting of the united nations security council to discuss the issue late sunday , but failed to secure backing for its call to declare kosovo 's declaration " null and void . " china expressed concern about the effects kosovo 's declaration would have on peace in the balkans , urging the two governments to work out their problems through dialogue .
" kosovo 's unilateral act can produce a series of results that will lead to seriously negative influence on peace and stability in the balkan region and on the realization of building a multiethnic society in kosovo , which china is deeply concerned about , " foreign affairs ministry spokesman liu jianchao said . " china calls on the two sides of serbia and kosovo to continue to seek a proper solution through negotiation within the framework of international law , and the international community should create favorable conditions for this , " he added . concerns over wave of separatist declarations sri lanka , a country with its own problems with separatism , said it was concerned about kosovo 's unilateral declaration of independence , as it could set a precedent in other parts of the world and hurt nations . " the unilateral declaration of independence by kosovo could set an unmanageable precedent in the conduct of international relations , the established global order of sovereign states and could thus pose a grave threat to international peace and security , " the foreign ministry said in a statement .
" this action by kosovo is a violation of the charter of the united nations , which enshrines the sovereignty and territorial integrity of member states . " sri lankan forces have been fighting a 25-year insurgency by tamil separatists , who want an independent homeland in the east and north of the island . new zealand 's prime minister helen clark announced that her country would not recognize an independent kosovo , saying it was never the government 's position to offer diplomatic recognition in such circumstances .
" we neither recognize nor not recognize , " she said .
" we are not intending to make a formal statement . " supporters say stability comes from recognition bildunterschrift : kosovo thanks its supporters but not everyone is in favor australia led the early calls of support for independent kosovo , with prime minister kevin rudd announcing that australia would recognize the new state .

the gap between german rhetoric and reality is likely to increase as elections near . the german army 's afghanistan mission is testing berlin 's long-held prohibition against involvement in foreign combat missions like never before .
yet germany 's resistance has more to do with politics than moral qualms , experts say . the german government has spent recent weeks insisting that it has no plans to significantly increase its involvement in afghanistan .
it stood firm even as nato allies , particularly the united states , pressured germany to increase involvement in fighting taliban forces in southern afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has a very strong pacificst movement with national elections scheduled for 2009 , elected officials are n't going to commit political suicide by proposing germany fight alongside nato allies in southern afghanistan , said thomas bauer of the center for applied policy research at the university of munich and an expert in german foreign affairs . " the moment this government decides to send in combat troops to the southern part of afghanistan , they will lose the next election , " bauer said . germany : a reluctant warrior the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , will try to win the next elections by portraying their coalition partners , chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , as pro-military .
to win votes , the left party will try to portray both the spd and cdu as warmongers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party will use afghanistan to score points with german pacifists " pushing this pacifist button " wins elections , bauer said . all of germany 's main political parties , with the exception of the left party , understand germany has a global responsibility which includes sending forces abroad and want to increase participation in nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
but they are afraid of voter backlash , experts say . germans remain deeply uneasy about taking part in military missions .
there 's the specter of world war ii and a long tradition of pacifism born during the cold war . this unease is shown by the limited scope parliament gave the bundeswehr in afghanistan .
the military can send a maximum of 3,500 soldiers to work out of the relatively peaceful north of the country where it is involved in rebuilding as well as peacekeeping and stabilization efforts . " it is important for nato to be seen as a community that implements its security strategy as a whole , " german defense minister franz-josef jung said recently , while insisting that germany will not participate in fighting in the south . increased involvement a tough sell bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some have questioned whether a political strategy exists in afghanistan the german public is overwhelmingly opposed to increasing the presence in afghanistan .
two out of every three say they want germany out of afghanistan as soon as possible . this has led to a certain amount of dishonesty in the political discourse surrounding afghanistan .
germany 's troop contribution to a quick reaction force is a perfect example of the divide between rhetoric and reality , said citha maass , the afghanistan expert at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs . germany agreed to send an additional 200 combat troops in july to take over for a norwegian contingent .
this force will be based in the north , but will assist allies in other regions .
these troops will have a combat component , maass said . " instead of discussing publically that you need some combat function , the government tries to hide it , " she said . on friday , feb .
15 , after denying press reports for days , the german government admitted it will discuss raising the number of troops in afghanistan when the parliamentary mandate comes up for renewal in the fall .
there 's also the possibility of changing the length of the mandate so that it does n't require renewal during election campaigning , according to press reports .

she said germany 's reluctance to get involved with fighting the taliban and al qaeda forces in southern afghanistan is outrageous and incomprehensible . german politicians lack the political will and the political skill to speak about the reality of the threat in afghanistan , macdonald said , something which she feels is " deeply irresponsible . " " germany is trying to create an alternate version of reality about afghanistan , " she said .
" unless you are going to go fight in the south , you are not part of the nato efforts to stabilize afghanistan .

" the point is that they do n't know what they 're striving for , " heinemann-grüder said .
" what is ultimate goal for these combat missions ?

to win votes , the left party will try to portray both the spd and cdu as warmongers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party will use afghanistan to score points with german pacifists " pushing this pacifist button " wins elections , bauer said . all of germany 's main political parties , with the exception of the left party , understand germany has a global responsibility which includes sending forces abroad and want to increase participation in nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
but they are afraid of voter backlash , experts say . germans remain deeply uneasy about taking part in military missions .
there 's the specter of world war ii and a long tradition of pacifism born during the cold war . this unease is shown by the limited scope parliament gave the bundeswehr in afghanistan .
the military can send a maximum of 3,500 soldiers to work out of the relatively peaceful north of the country where it is involved in rebuilding as well as peacekeeping and stabilization efforts . " it is important for nato to be seen as a community that implements its security strategy as a whole , " german defense minister franz-josef jung said recently , while insisting that germany will not participate in fighting in the south . increased involvement a tough sell bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some have questioned whether a political strategy exists in afghanistan the german public is overwhelmingly opposed to increasing the presence in afghanistan .
two out of every three say they want germany out of afghanistan as soon as possible . this has led to a certain amount of dishonesty in the political discourse surrounding afghanistan .
germany 's troop contribution to a quick reaction force is a perfect example of the divide between rhetoric and reality , said citha maass , the afghanistan expert at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs . germany agreed to send an additional 200 combat troops in july to take over for a norwegian contingent .
this force will be based in the north , but will assist allies in other regions .
these troops will have a combat component , maass said . " instead of discussing publically that you need some combat function , the government tries to hide it , " she said . on friday , feb .
15 , after denying press reports for days , the german government admitted it will discuss raising the number of troops in afghanistan when the parliamentary mandate comes up for renewal in the fall .
there 's also the possibility of changing the length of the mandate so that it does n't require renewal during election campaigning , according to press reports .
germany is , however , expected to stand firm on refusing to join fighting in the south . germany shirking its duties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has refused to join combat missions in southern afghanistan norine macdonald has spent most of the past three years doing field research in afghanistan as the president of the senlis council , a security and development think tank .
she said germany 's reluctance to get involved with fighting the taliban and al qaeda forces in southern afghanistan is outrageous and incomprehensible . german politicians lack the political will and the political skill to speak about the reality of the threat in afghanistan , macdonald said , something which she feels is " deeply irresponsible . " " germany is trying to create an alternate version of reality about afghanistan , " she said .
" unless you are going to go fight in the south , you are not part of the nato efforts to stabilize afghanistan . " unclear political goals in afghanistan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been focused on humanitarian aid the taliban and al qaeda forces control secondary roads in afghanistan 's south and are moving closer to kabul each month , . of nato members , only the united states , canada , the netherlands and great britain currently have troops are currently fighting in the south . there 's increasing worry among experts that the nato mission could fail to contain the taliban . part of the problem is that no one really knows what the ultimate goal is in afghanistan , said andreas heinemann-grüder , a senior researcher at the bonn-based bicc , an organization which focuses on peace building and conflict resolution issues . " the point is that they do n't know what they 're striving for , " heinemann-grüder said .
" what is ultimate goal for these combat missions ?
i do n't see any political strategy behind the military effort . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : canada has called on nato members to send more troops to southern afghanistan for many germans , the messier the situation in afghanistan gets , the more reason for germany to end its involvement .
but it should n't take a terrorist attack on german soil for the country to realize that isolation is not an option , said bauer of the center for applied policy research .
having the taliban destabilize afghanistan puts germany at risk , even if it seems intangible to many people . macdonald agreed , calling afghanistan germany 's " new back yard . " " the world has shrunk so much we know that what happens in southern afghanistan is happening on the border of every western country , " macdonald said . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

opinion : long road to normalcy in kosovo kosovo -pipe- 18.02.2008 us , germany cautious on kosovo as separatists call for action großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and merkel are playing the waiting game over kosovo the united states and germany issued statements suggesting they would recognize kosovo 's independence but gave no official blessing .
meanwhile , fears of knock-on separatist action increased with unrest in bosnia . while not officially recognizing kosovo as an independent state , us president george w. bush said monday that the kosovars " are now independent " but added that us recognition would be guided by the un-supported ahtisaari plan .
" the ahtisaari plan is our blueprint forward , " bush said when asked in an interview if washington will officially recognize kosovo as a country .
but , bush added , " the kosovars are now independent .
it 's something i 've advocated along with my government . "
in berlin , german chancellor angela merkel said germany would not take an immediate decision on recognizing kosovo 's independence but wait for the european union to spell out its position .
" we will not take a decision today on recognizing kosovo 's independence .
ministers from the eu will meet today to put in place a platform that will allow each member to take a position on the declaration of independence , " she told reporters in berlin .
" so taking a decision on recognition is not on the order of the day .
the order of the day is first of all to answers questions of substance as to the eu 's platform . "
germany had been expected to formally recognize kosovo on monday along with britain , france , italy and the united states .
merkel added that kosovo was an isolated case not comparable with that in other countries and she stressed that the future of both kosovo and serbia lay with the european union .
" the whole situation in the western balkans can only be kept calm and peaceful from my point of view if we keep the european perspective as the perspective for the future for both serbia and kosovo , " merkel said .
chancellor calls for protection of minorities merkel stressed that kosovo and other countries in the region had to respect their minorities if they were to have a future in the european union .
" all must live with their minorities , " she said , acknowledging difficulties that stretched back over centuries .
without a european future for the countries of the former yugoslavia , she added , " the prospects for free democracy and securing economic development are much , much worse . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said the eu 's relations with russia were stable asked whether differences over kosovo would hurt eu-russian relations , merkel said the russian objections were of a principled nature and its attitude would not change .
but she added that eu relations with russia were " of a strategic nature and ... very stable . "
" we should in as far as possible try to come to the best diplomatic conclusions , " she said .
" we have strategic relations with russia that are capable of surviving differences of opinion because they are very stable . "
eu foreign ministers were locked in a crisis meeting in brussels monday to discuss the response to kosovo 's split from serbia on sunday amid signs of intense behind-the-scenes wrangling over recognition of the new state .
while some of the larger member states support the declaration , many others refuse to accept kosovo 's decision .
eu divisions exacerbated by separatist concerns the already difficult situation of presenting a united front on kosovo was made worse when spain announced that the socialist government will not give diplomatic recognition to the new state , and that spain 's conservative opposition had agreed with the government 's position .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain fears action by eta , the armed basque separatists spain fears that the serbian province 's declaration of independence could inspire its basque separatists to take a similar step .
these fears gained some credibility when it was revealed that the main opposition bosnian serb party had called for the independence of the serb-run half of bosnia monday , citing kosovo as a precedent .
" the serb democratic party -lsb- sds -rsb- is demanding republika srpska 's institutions provide -lsb- bosnian serbs -rsb- the same rights being given to kosovo albanians , " said the party , which was founded by war crimes fugitive radovan karadzic .
" we expect the -lsb- bosnian serb -rsb- government to meet previous promises and check the will of republika srpska citizens in a referendum , " the sds said in a statement .
since its 1992-1995 war , bosnia has consisted of two entities , the serb-run republika srpska -lsb- rs -rsb- and the muslim-croat federation , each with their own government , parliament and police force .
the sds was established in the early 1990s by karadzic , who remains at large around 12 years after the un war crimes tribunal charged him with genocide over the srebrenica massacre and siege of sarajevo .
bosnian serbs cite kosovo as precedent many bosnian serbs feel that their entity should follow kosovo 's lead and be allowed to secede from bosnia to be eventually attached to serbia , which they see as their motherland .
some local politicians have hinted that the rs could try such a move .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests in banja luka had xenophobic undertones meanwhile , up to 3,000 bosnian serbs gathered in banja luka to protest against kosovo 's independence .
" europe shame on you , world shame on you " and " hashim murderer " , the protestors chanted in a reference to kosovo prime minister hashim thaci .
they also chanted offensive slogans using derogatory terms for albanians .
the protest , organized by students , started with a minute 's silence , followed by another minute of hissing to voice disagreement with kosovo 's unilateral move .
banners in the crowd carried such slogans as " europe respect international law , " " kosovo = rs , " and " we do n't give up kosovo . "
" we are disappointed with the fate of -lsb- serbian -rsb- people in kosovo and we will continue to support them , " representative of students dejan kragulj told journalists .

18 with both countries calling emergency sessions of parliament to discuss their next moves . russian deputies gathered to finalize a text on the " consequences " of kosovo 's declaration while preparing an official condemnation of the act and urging un chief ban ki-moon to take a tougher stance . " the kosovo example could plunge the world into chaos , " senior parliamentarian mikhail margelov was quoted by itar-tass as saying .
the independence declaration goes against " international law and morality .
this is a dangerous precedent , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and kostunica stand side by side on kosovo ahead of further discussion at the united nations , russian foreign ministry official alexander botsan-kharchenko urged the un secretary general ban to stand up for un resolutions and rules that he said backed moscow 's stance . " we think he should clearly define his position , " botsan-kharchenko told reporters in new york .
whe should remain loyal to the united nations ' charter and to the security council 's resolution 1244 on kosovo . " a veto-wielding permanent member of the un security council , russia has consistently opposed kosovo 's bid for independence , siding with serbia .
however , despite its power within the un , russia failed to secure security council backing for a bid to declare the independence declaration by kosovo 's ethnic albanian majority " null and void . " russia balancing kosovo stance with own separatist issues russian newspapers on monday said russia was also likely to use kosovo 's declaration to put more pressure on neighboring georgia , which has two separatist provinces - abkhazia and south ossetia - that adjoin russia and have moscow 's de facto backing . despite opposing kosovo 's independence , russia has said that it could serve as a precedent for the separatist provinces .
at the same time moscow has said it does not plan to recognize independence for the two provinces , reflecting worries about separatism within russia 's own borders . south ossetia and abkhazia plan to ask russia and the un to recognize their independence following kosovo ’ s declaration of independence . " in the near future abkhazia will appeal to the russian parliament and the un security council with a request to recognize its independence , " self-declared abkhaz president sergei bagapsh was quoted as saying by the interfax news agency . " south ossetia will in the near future appeal to the commonwealth of independent states and the un with a request to recognize our independence , " south ossetian president eduard kokoity was also quoted as saying by the news agency , referring to a grouping of ex-soviet states that includes russia . moscow could open representative offices in the capitals of the two georgian provinces , a step just short of formal recognition of independence , kommersant newspaper said , quoting unnamed government sources . analysts say russia is balancing its position as it seeks to use its separatist allies in georgia to gain diplomatic advantage over the georgian leadership , which is seeking to join western institutions such as nato . serbia moves to counter " violation of sovereignty " meanwhile , the serbian parliament will convene in belgrade later monday to adopt a decision to " annul " kosovo 's independence proclamation on the grounds that it " violates the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the republic of serbia . " " the parliament of serbia should confirm the serbian government 's decision to annul illegal acts by interim kosovo authorities to unilaterally proclaim independence , " the tanjug state-run news agency reported . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kostunica 's government pursues its annulment plan president boris tadic and prime minister vojislav kostunica said serbia would " never recognize an independent kosovo " after the province 's declaration on sunday . serbia also announced that police had filed criminal charges against kosovo albanian leaders for " organizing the proclamation of a phony state on serbian territory , " according to tanjug . the charges were laid against kosovo president fatmir sejdiu , prime minister hashim thaci and parliament speaker jakup krasniqi , the state-run agency said , citing an interior ministry statement . the serbian government also decided to proclaim as " null and void " all decisions by the european union to send a mission to kosovo .
" these decisions have no legal foundation for serbia and produce no obligation of serbia towards the european union , " the government statement read . the eu is preparing a kosovo mission dubbed eulex , which is designed to help the 90-percent ethnic albanian territory on its road to independence by deploying some 2,000 personnel . kosovo has been run by the united nations since mid-1999 , after a nato air assault drove out serbian forces waging a brutal crackdown on separatist ethnic albanian guerrillas and their civilian supporters . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

18 with both countries calling emergency sessions of parliament to discuss their next moves . russian deputies gathered to finalize a text on the " consequences " of kosovo 's declaration while preparing an official condemnation of the act and urging un chief ban ki-moon to take a tougher stance . " the kosovo example could plunge the world into chaos , " senior parliamentarian mikhail margelov was quoted by itar-tass as saying .
the independence declaration goes against " international law and morality .
this is a dangerous precedent , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and kostunica stand side by side on kosovo ahead of further discussion at the united nations , russian foreign ministry official alexander botsan-kharchenko urged the un secretary general ban to stand up for un resolutions and rules that he said backed moscow 's stance . " we think he should clearly define his position , " botsan-kharchenko told reporters in new york .
whe should remain loyal to the united nations ' charter and to the security council 's resolution 1244 on kosovo . " a veto-wielding permanent member of the un security council , russia has consistently opposed kosovo 's bid for independence , siding with serbia .
however , despite its power within the un , russia failed to secure security council backing for a bid to declare the independence declaration by kosovo 's ethnic albanian majority " null and void . " russia balancing kosovo stance with own separatist issues russian newspapers on monday said russia was also likely to use kosovo 's declaration to put more pressure on neighboring georgia , which has two separatist provinces - abkhazia and south ossetia - that adjoin russia and have moscow 's de facto backing . despite opposing kosovo 's independence , russia has said that it could serve as a precedent for the separatist provinces .
at the same time moscow has said it does not plan to recognize independence for the two provinces , reflecting worries about separatism within russia 's own borders . south ossetia and abkhazia plan to ask russia and the un to recognize their independence following kosovo ’ s declaration of independence . " in the near future abkhazia will appeal to the russian parliament and the un security council with a request to recognize its independence , " self-declared abkhaz president sergei bagapsh was quoted as saying by the interfax news agency . " south ossetia will in the near future appeal to the commonwealth of independent states and the un with a request to recognize our independence , " south ossetian president eduard kokoity was also quoted as saying by the news agency , referring to a grouping of ex-soviet states that includes russia . moscow could open representative offices in the capitals of the two georgian provinces , a step just short of formal recognition of independence , kommersant newspaper said , quoting unnamed government sources . analysts say russia is balancing its position as it seeks to use its separatist allies in georgia to gain diplomatic advantage over the georgian leadership , which is seeking to join western institutions such as nato . serbia moves to counter " violation of sovereignty " meanwhile , the serbian parliament will convene in belgrade later monday to adopt a decision to " annul " kosovo 's independence proclamation on the grounds that it " violates the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the republic of serbia . " " the parliament of serbia should confirm the serbian government 's decision to annul illegal acts by interim kosovo authorities to unilaterally proclaim independence , " the tanjug state-run news agency reported . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kostunica 's government pursues its annulment plan president boris tadic and prime minister vojislav kostunica said serbia would " never recognize an independent kosovo " after the province 's declaration on sunday . serbia also announced that police had filed criminal charges against kosovo albanian leaders for " organizing the proclamation of a phony state on serbian territory , " according to tanjug . the charges were laid against kosovo president fatmir sejdiu , prime minister hashim thaci and parliament speaker jakup krasniqi , the state-run agency said , citing an interior ministry statement . the serbian government also decided to proclaim as " null and void " all decisions by the european union to send a mission to kosovo .
" these decisions have no legal foundation for serbia and produce no obligation of serbia towards the european union , " the government statement read . the eu is preparing a kosovo mission dubbed eulex , which is designed to help the 90-percent ethnic albanian territory on its road to independence by deploying some 2,000 personnel . kosovo has been run by the united nations since mid-1999 , after a nato air assault drove out serbian forces waging a brutal crackdown on separatist ethnic albanian guerrillas and their civilian supporters . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

opinion : long road to normalcy in kosovo kosovo -pipe- 18.02.2008 us , germany cautious on kosovo as separatists call for action großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and merkel are playing the waiting game over kosovo the united states and germany issued statements suggesting they would recognize kosovo 's independence but gave no official blessing .
meanwhile , fears of knock-on separatist action increased with unrest in bosnia . while not officially recognizing kosovo as an independent state , us president george w. bush said monday that the kosovars " are now independent " but added that us recognition would be guided by the un-supported ahtisaari plan .
" the ahtisaari plan is our blueprint forward , " bush said when asked in an interview if washington will officially recognize kosovo as a country .
but , bush added , " the kosovars are now independent .
it 's something i 've advocated along with my government . "
in berlin , german chancellor angela merkel said germany would not take an immediate decision on recognizing kosovo 's independence but wait for the european union to spell out its position .
" we will not take a decision today on recognizing kosovo 's independence .
ministers from the eu will meet today to put in place a platform that will allow each member to take a position on the declaration of independence , " she told reporters in berlin .
" so taking a decision on recognition is not on the order of the day .
the order of the day is first of all to answers questions of substance as to the eu 's platform . "
germany had been expected to formally recognize kosovo on monday along with britain , france , italy and the united states .
merkel added that kosovo was an isolated case not comparable with that in other countries and she stressed that the future of both kosovo and serbia lay with the european union .
" the whole situation in the western balkans can only be kept calm and peaceful from my point of view if we keep the european perspective as the perspective for the future for both serbia and kosovo , " merkel said .
chancellor calls for protection of minorities merkel stressed that kosovo and other countries in the region had to respect their minorities if they were to have a future in the european union .
" all must live with their minorities , " she said , acknowledging difficulties that stretched back over centuries .
without a european future for the countries of the former yugoslavia , she added , " the prospects for free democracy and securing economic development are much , much worse . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said the eu 's relations with russia were stable asked whether differences over kosovo would hurt eu-russian relations , merkel said the russian objections were of a principled nature and its attitude would not change .
but she added that eu relations with russia were " of a strategic nature and ... very stable . "
" we should in as far as possible try to come to the best diplomatic conclusions , " she said .
" we have strategic relations with russia that are capable of surviving differences of opinion because they are very stable . "
eu foreign ministers were locked in a crisis meeting in brussels monday to discuss the response to kosovo 's split from serbia on sunday amid signs of intense behind-the-scenes wrangling over recognition of the new state .
while some of the larger member states support the declaration , many others refuse to accept kosovo 's decision .
eu divisions exacerbated by separatist concerns the already difficult situation of presenting a united front on kosovo was made worse when spain announced that the socialist government will not give diplomatic recognition to the new state , and that spain 's conservative opposition had agreed with the government 's position .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain fears action by eta , the armed basque separatists spain fears that the serbian province 's declaration of independence could inspire its basque separatists to take a similar step .
these fears gained some credibility when it was revealed that the main opposition bosnian serb party had called for the independence of the serb-run half of bosnia monday , citing kosovo as a precedent .
" the serb democratic party -lsb- sds -rsb- is demanding republika srpska 's institutions provide -lsb- bosnian serbs -rsb- the same rights being given to kosovo albanians , " said the party , which was founded by war crimes fugitive radovan karadzic .
" we expect the -lsb- bosnian serb -rsb- government to meet previous promises and check the will of republika srpska citizens in a referendum , " the sds said in a statement .
since its 1992-1995 war , bosnia has consisted of two entities , the serb-run republika srpska -lsb- rs -rsb- and the muslim-croat federation , each with their own government , parliament and police force .
the sds was established in the early 1990s by karadzic , who remains at large around 12 years after the un war crimes tribunal charged him with genocide over the srebrenica massacre and siege of sarajevo .
bosnian serbs cite kosovo as precedent many bosnian serbs feel that their entity should follow kosovo 's lead and be allowed to secede from bosnia to be eventually attached to serbia , which they see as their motherland .
some local politicians have hinted that the rs could try such a move .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests in banja luka had xenophobic undertones meanwhile , up to 3,000 bosnian serbs gathered in banja luka to protest against kosovo 's independence .
" europe shame on you , world shame on you " and " hashim murderer " , the protestors chanted in a reference to kosovo prime minister hashim thaci .
they also chanted offensive slogans using derogatory terms for albanians .
the protest , organized by students , started with a minute 's silence , followed by another minute of hissing to voice disagreement with kosovo 's unilateral move .
banners in the crowd carried such slogans as " europe respect international law , " " kosovo = rs , " and " we do n't give up kosovo . "
" we are disappointed with the fate of -lsb- serbian -rsb- people in kosovo and we will continue to support them , " representative of students dejan kragulj told journalists .

" all must live with their minorities , " she said , acknowledging difficulties that stretched back over centuries .
without a european future for the countries of the former yugoslavia , she added , " the prospects for free democracy and securing economic development are much , much worse . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said the eu 's relations with russia were stable asked whether differences over kosovo would hurt eu-russian relations , merkel said the russian objections were of a principled nature and its attitude would not change .
but she added that eu relations with russia were " of a strategic nature and ... very stable . "
" we should in as far as possible try to come to the best diplomatic conclusions , " she said .
" we have strategic relations with russia that are capable of surviving differences of opinion because they are very stable . "
eu foreign ministers were locked in a crisis meeting in brussels monday to discuss the response to kosovo 's split from serbia on sunday amid signs of intense behind-the-scenes wrangling over recognition of the new state .
while some of the larger member states support the declaration , many others refuse to accept kosovo 's decision .
eu divisions exacerbated by separatist concerns the already difficult situation of presenting a united front on kosovo was made worse when spain announced that the socialist government will not give diplomatic recognition to the new state , and that spain 's conservative opposition had agreed with the government 's position .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain fears action by eta , the armed basque separatists spain fears that the serbian province 's declaration of independence could inspire its basque separatists to take a similar step .
these fears gained some credibility when it was revealed that the main opposition bosnian serb party had called for the independence of the serb-run half of bosnia monday , citing kosovo as a precedent .
" the serb democratic party -lsb- sds -rsb- is demanding republika srpska 's institutions provide -lsb- bosnian serbs -rsb- the same rights being given to kosovo albanians , " said the party , which was founded by war crimes fugitive radovan karadzic .
" we expect the -lsb- bosnian serb -rsb- government to meet previous promises and check the will of republika srpska citizens in a referendum , " the sds said in a statement .
since its 1992-1995 war , bosnia has consisted of two entities , the serb-run republika srpska -lsb- rs -rsb- and the muslim-croat federation , each with their own government , parliament and police force .
the sds was established in the early 1990s by karadzic , who remains at large around 12 years after the un war crimes tribunal charged him with genocide over the srebrenica massacre and siege of sarajevo .
bosnian serbs cite kosovo as precedent many bosnian serbs feel that their entity should follow kosovo 's lead and be allowed to secede from bosnia to be eventually attached to serbia , which they see as their motherland .
some local politicians have hinted that the rs could try such a move .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests in banja luka had xenophobic undertones meanwhile , up to 3,000 bosnian serbs gathered in banja luka to protest against kosovo 's independence .
" europe shame on you , world shame on you " and " hashim murderer " , the protestors chanted in a reference to kosovo prime minister hashim thaci .
they also chanted offensive slogans using derogatory terms for albanians .
the protest , organized by students , started with a minute 's silence , followed by another minute of hissing to voice disagreement with kosovo 's unilateral move .
banners in the crowd carried such slogans as " europe respect international law , " " kosovo = rs , " and " we do n't give up kosovo . "
" we are disappointed with the fate of -lsb- serbian -rsb- people in kosovo and we will continue to support them , " representative of students dejan kragulj told journalists .
" it 's clear that republika srpska now has the right to secede from bosnia , " zeljko , a 23-year-old student , told reporters . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke to balkans expert stefan wolff about what kosovo and the world can expect in the near future . stefan wolff is a professor of political science and director of the centre for international crisis management and conflict resolution at nottingham university in the uk .
he has extensive expertise in northern ireland , the balkans and central and eastern europe , and has also worked on a wide range of other conflicts elsewhere , including the middle east , africa , and central , south and southeast asia . dw-world.de : is kosovo prepared for independence in terms of infrastructure , governance , security and stability ? stefan wolff : kosovo has most of the important institutions of statehood and democratic governance in place , but at the same time these institutions will require continued international support for some time .
this is accepted by both the kosovars and the west and is the background against which we need to understand the eu mission for kosovo - as external assistance to consolidate existing institutional structures to enable kosovars to take care of developing their economy , infrastructure and ensure security and stability . the decision to declare independence is not a unanimous one within the population .
what minorities in kosovo have most to lose from this independence ? in principle , all minorities and the majority albanian population can gain from the clarification of kosovo 's international status , not least in the sense that they will all benefit from economic development .
prime minister thaci made some very important gestures yesterday towards reconciliation with serbs in kosovo .
the arthisaari plan offers important mechanisms to serbs to preserve and develop their identity , gives them opportunities to play a meaningful part in the political process in kosovo and retain ties with serbia .
from this perspective , there is no need for conflict between the two main population groups , but that does not mean that extremists on either side will refrain from violence and provocations .
so far , this risk has been contained , but not eliminated . what can we expect in terms of reaction and action from kosovo 's balkan neighbors ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few of the region 's conflicts are fully resolved the balkan region as a whole remains quite vulnerable to the threat of ethnic conflict .
we must bear in mind that few , if any , of the conflicts that led to bloodshed throughout the 1990s have really been resolved .
we have institutions in place now that help manage these conflicts politically , but tensions in bosnia and macedonia , for example , remain .
apart from albania and slovenia , i do n't think that any of the other balkan countries will find it a very easy decision to recognize kosovo .
eventually , however , macedonia , bosnia , croatia and montenegro will recognize the independence of kosovo , but this will not be a process free from domestic debate .
how will kosovo 's independence affect the wider balkan region ?
because of the close links between kosovo and two other major previous secessionist conflicts - bosnia , the serbs , and macedonia , the albanians - there is a danger that violence in and around kosovo could spread and create instability across the balkans .
there also remains an open question in relation to the future of albanians in southern serbia .
the overall hope , of course , remains that with kosovo 's independence the last major unresolved issue has been tackled and that the region as a whole can now move forward to closer integration with the eu .
while this will not be easy over the coming months , eventually a sense of reality will set in , and people will realize that this is there only real hope for the future .
serbia has vowed not to recognize an independent kosovo and has spoken of economic and diplomatic sanctions .
what can we expect from serbia in the coming days ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riots broke out in belgrade after kosovo 's declaration there are already signs of serbia backing down from the quite exaggerated threats of cutting diplomatic ties with any country recognizing kosovo .
this is simply not feasible for serbia , especially as the population there still has clear aspirations of eu membership and very strong economic interests both in the eu and the neighboring region .
we will , however , see further declarations and statements against kosovo 's independence and against its recognition by other states .
together with russia , serbia is most likely to try and mobilize the un against kosovo 's unilateral declaration of independence , and membership in the un and other international organizations will be very difficult to obtain for kosovo because of serbian resistance .
while the likelihood of a military conflict is close to zero , there remains a threat of localized violence in and around kosovo , but serious escalation is in nobody 's interest .
moreover , serbia has to think carefully about how to manage its relations with serbs in kosovo .
the arthisaari plan offers many important opportunities to do so , opportunities that kosovo albanians are ready to accept .
discouraging kosovo serb political participation in pristina will not be in the interests of serbs living there , and might further encourage them to leave rather than to stay .
what action do you expect to be taken by the international community in the coming days ?
we will gradually see recognition of kosovo as an independent state from major countries in the eu and the west more generally .
we should also expect support from the arab league and member countries of the organization of the islamic conference .
nato will have to be very alert towards any risk of violence in kosovo , not least in order to assure serbs that they can remain in kosovo and participate in building a democratic state .
russian opposition , on the other hand , also remains a clear fact , and russia will use its membership in the un , and possibly the osce and council of europe , to mobilize against kosovo 's independence .
this , in turn , could have a further negative impact on relations between russia and the west as a whole , again not something in either russia 's or the west 's interests .
is kosovo becoming a pawn in the current power games between the west and russia ?
if so , how will an independent kosovo affect relations ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia , serbia 's ally , remains in opposition to the west kosovo has , for some time , been one among several pawns in these power games .
now that independence has been declared , the issue has come to a head , but at the same time kosovo will gradually become less of an issue , precisely because a decision has been made .
russia may choose not to recognize it and bring it up before the security council and elsewhere , but it was in particular kosovo 's unresolved status that gave russia a certain degree of leverage .
in the long term , i think interest in kosovo will fade , especially if the transition to independence is smooth , no major violence occurs , and kosovo quickly gains recognition from a large number of countries beyond the core western powers .
what will the newly independent kosovo 's view be towards the european union and the west ?
kosovo albanians remain the most pro-european and pro-atlanticist of all the balkan people .
the challenge for prime minister thaci and president sejdiu will be to prepare kosovo politically , economically and socially for closer links with the eu and to overcome resistance within the eu from countries like cyprus , greece , romania , slovakia and spain who fear that kosovo sets an unwelcome precedent for secessionist threats that they themselves perceive .
from that perspective , kosovo and its supporters in the eu have a unique responsibility and opportunity to demonstrate that kosovo can develop into a full european , democratic state and that its independence does not lead to the instability and insecurity feared by some .
not all eu countries are in favor of an independent kosovo - how is the declaration likely to affect relations within the european bloc when the official eu line will be one of overall support ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some eu nations , like germany , will recognize kosovo some countries have expressed concern and reservations , primarily because of their own domestic situation .
on the other hand , none of them can have a real interest in risking the eu 's ability to act swiftly and decisively over the kosovo issue .
this is not least the case because , apart from the eu in cooperation with nato , there really is no other international actor willing and able to manage kosovo 's transition to independence .
thus , my hope is that despite some countries ' reluctance to recognize kosovo , none of them will be foolish enough to sabotage the eu 's efforts to maintain stability in kosovo and the wider region and enable the region to forge ever closer ties with the bloc as a whole .
what are the best and worst scenarios arising from this declaration of independence : for kosovo , for the balkans , for the eu and for the relationship between east and west ?
the worst-case scenario would be one of wide-spread violence in kosovo , triggering instability in macedonia and bosnia and an eu and nato unable to manage these threats .
also , a prolonged delay in sufficient levels of international recognition of kosovo leading to insufficient economic recovery there , and continuing strains between serbs and albanians in kosovo are unlikely to be helpful to demonstrate that kosovo as an independent state can succeed politically , economically and socially without destabilizing its neighborhood .
the more negative local developments , the more likely also is it that relations between east and west will remain difficult and impact on other major challenges in the international arena - from the middle east conflict , to nuclear proliferation in iran and north korea , to continuing bloodshed in africa .
as a best-case scenario , kosovo will remain stable , its development will take off , serbs will gradually begin to participate in the political process , the balkans will become more integrated into the eu , and the current level of international tensions over kosovo will quickly die down .
this is a tall order , and one would have to be very optimistic to see any , let alone all of this , happen very soon , but neither is there any reason to see the future as bleak as the worst-case scenario . interview : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke to balkans expert stefan wolff about what kosovo and the world can expect in the near future . stefan wolff is a professor of political science and director of the centre for international crisis management and conflict resolution at nottingham university in the uk .
he has extensive expertise in northern ireland , the balkans and central and eastern europe , and has also worked on a wide range of other conflicts elsewhere , including the middle east , africa , and central , south and southeast asia . dw-world.de : is kosovo prepared for independence in terms of infrastructure , governance , security and stability ? stefan wolff : kosovo has most of the important institutions of statehood and democratic governance in place , but at the same time these institutions will require continued international support for some time .
this is accepted by both the kosovars and the west and is the background against which we need to understand the eu mission for kosovo - as external assistance to consolidate existing institutional structures to enable kosovars to take care of developing their economy , infrastructure and ensure security and stability . the decision to declare independence is not a unanimous one within the population .
what minorities in kosovo have most to lose from this independence ? in principle , all minorities and the majority albanian population can gain from the clarification of kosovo 's international status , not least in the sense that they will all benefit from economic development .
prime minister thaci made some very important gestures yesterday towards reconciliation with serbs in kosovo .
the arthisaari plan offers important mechanisms to serbs to preserve and develop their identity , gives them opportunities to play a meaningful part in the political process in kosovo and retain ties with serbia .
from this perspective , there is no need for conflict between the two main population groups , but that does not mean that extremists on either side will refrain from violence and provocations .
so far , this risk has been contained , but not eliminated . what can we expect in terms of reaction and action from kosovo 's balkan neighbors ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few of the region 's conflicts are fully resolved the balkan region as a whole remains quite vulnerable to the threat of ethnic conflict .
we must bear in mind that few , if any , of the conflicts that led to bloodshed throughout the 1990s have really been resolved .
we have institutions in place now that help manage these conflicts politically , but tensions in bosnia and macedonia , for example , remain .
apart from albania and slovenia , i do n't think that any of the other balkan countries will find it a very easy decision to recognize kosovo .
eventually , however , macedonia , bosnia , croatia and montenegro will recognize the independence of kosovo , but this will not be a process free from domestic debate .
how will kosovo 's independence affect the wider balkan region ?
because of the close links between kosovo and two other major previous secessionist conflicts - bosnia , the serbs , and macedonia , the albanians - there is a danger that violence in and around kosovo could spread and create instability across the balkans .
there also remains an open question in relation to the future of albanians in southern serbia .
the overall hope , of course , remains that with kosovo 's independence the last major unresolved issue has been tackled and that the region as a whole can now move forward to closer integration with the eu .
while this will not be easy over the coming months , eventually a sense of reality will set in , and people will realize that this is there only real hope for the future .
serbia has vowed not to recognize an independent kosovo and has spoken of economic and diplomatic sanctions .
what can we expect from serbia in the coming days ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riots broke out in belgrade after kosovo 's declaration there are already signs of serbia backing down from the quite exaggerated threats of cutting diplomatic ties with any country recognizing kosovo .
this is simply not feasible for serbia , especially as the population there still has clear aspirations of eu membership and very strong economic interests both in the eu and the neighboring region .
we will , however , see further declarations and statements against kosovo 's independence and against its recognition by other states .
together with russia , serbia is most likely to try and mobilize the un against kosovo 's unilateral declaration of independence , and membership in the un and other international organizations will be very difficult to obtain for kosovo because of serbian resistance .
while the likelihood of a military conflict is close to zero , there remains a threat of localized violence in and around kosovo , but serious escalation is in nobody 's interest .
moreover , serbia has to think carefully about how to manage its relations with serbs in kosovo .
the arthisaari plan offers many important opportunities to do so , opportunities that kosovo albanians are ready to accept .
discouraging kosovo serb political participation in pristina will not be in the interests of serbs living there , and might further encourage them to leave rather than to stay .
what action do you expect to be taken by the international community in the coming days ?
we will gradually see recognition of kosovo as an independent state from major countries in the eu and the west more generally .
we should also expect support from the arab league and member countries of the organization of the islamic conference .
nato will have to be very alert towards any risk of violence in kosovo , not least in order to assure serbs that they can remain in kosovo and participate in building a democratic state .
russian opposition , on the other hand , also remains a clear fact , and russia will use its membership in the un , and possibly the osce and council of europe , to mobilize against kosovo 's independence .
this , in turn , could have a further negative impact on relations between russia and the west as a whole , again not something in either russia 's or the west 's interests .
is kosovo becoming a pawn in the current power games between the west and russia ?
if so , how will an independent kosovo affect relations ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia , serbia 's ally , remains in opposition to the west kosovo has , for some time , been one among several pawns in these power games .
now that independence has been declared , the issue has come to a head , but at the same time kosovo will gradually become less of an issue , precisely because a decision has been made .
russia may choose not to recognize it and bring it up before the security council and elsewhere , but it was in particular kosovo 's unresolved status that gave russia a certain degree of leverage .
in the long term , i think interest in kosovo will fade , especially if the transition to independence is smooth , no major violence occurs , and kosovo quickly gains recognition from a large number of countries beyond the core western powers .
what will the newly independent kosovo 's view be towards the european union and the west ?
kosovo albanians remain the most pro-european and pro-atlanticist of all the balkan people .
the challenge for prime minister thaci and president sejdiu will be to prepare kosovo politically , economically and socially for closer links with the eu and to overcome resistance within the eu from countries like cyprus , greece , romania , slovakia and spain who fear that kosovo sets an unwelcome precedent for secessionist threats that they themselves perceive .
from that perspective , kosovo and its supporters in the eu have a unique responsibility and opportunity to demonstrate that kosovo can develop into a full european , democratic state and that its independence does not lead to the instability and insecurity feared by some .
not all eu countries are in favor of an independent kosovo - how is the declaration likely to affect relations within the european bloc when the official eu line will be one of overall support ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some eu nations , like germany , will recognize kosovo some countries have expressed concern and reservations , primarily because of their own domestic situation .
on the other hand , none of them can have a real interest in risking the eu 's ability to act swiftly and decisively over the kosovo issue .
this is not least the case because , apart from the eu in cooperation with nato , there really is no other international actor willing and able to manage kosovo 's transition to independence .
thus , my hope is that despite some countries ' reluctance to recognize kosovo , none of them will be foolish enough to sabotage the eu 's efforts to maintain stability in kosovo and the wider region and enable the region to forge ever closer ties with the bloc as a whole .
what are the best and worst scenarios arising from this declaration of independence : for kosovo , for the balkans , for the eu and for the relationship between east and west ?
the worst-case scenario would be one of wide-spread violence in kosovo , triggering instability in macedonia and bosnia and an eu and nato unable to manage these threats .
also , a prolonged delay in sufficient levels of international recognition of kosovo leading to insufficient economic recovery there , and continuing strains between serbs and albanians in kosovo are unlikely to be helpful to demonstrate that kosovo as an independent state can succeed politically , economically and socially without destabilizing its neighborhood .
the more negative local developments , the more likely also is it that relations between east and west will remain difficult and impact on other major challenges in the international arena - from the middle east conflict , to nuclear proliferation in iran and north korea , to continuing bloodshed in africa .
as a best-case scenario , kosovo will remain stable , its development will take off , serbs will gradually begin to participate in the political process , the balkans will become more integrated into the eu , and the current level of international tensions over kosovo will quickly die down .
this is a tall order , and one would have to be very optimistic to see any , let alone all of this , happen very soon , but neither is there any reason to see the future as bleak as the worst-case scenario . interview : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 18.02.2008 germany faces political dilemma in afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are uneasy about combat missions while experts say germany will likely increase its military involvement in afghanistan , the subject remains politically taboo .
the gap between german rhetoric and reality is likely to increase as elections near . the german army 's afghanistan mission is testing berlin 's long-held prohibition against involvement in foreign combat missions like never before .
yet germany 's resistance has more to do with politics than moral qualms , experts say . the german government has spent recent weeks insisting that it has no plans to significantly increase its involvement in afghanistan .
it stood firm even as nato allies , particularly the united states , pressured germany to increase involvement in fighting taliban forces in southern afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has a very strong pacificst movement with national elections scheduled for 2009 , elected officials are n't going to commit political suicide by proposing germany fight alongside nato allies in southern afghanistan , said thomas bauer of the center for applied policy research at the university of munich and an expert in german foreign affairs . " the moment this government decides to send in combat troops to the southern part of afghanistan , they will lose the next election , " bauer said . germany : a reluctant warrior the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , will try to win the next elections by portraying their coalition partners , chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , as pro-military .
to win votes , the left party will try to portray both the spd and cdu as warmongers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party will use afghanistan to score points with german pacifists " pushing this pacifist button " wins elections , bauer said . all of germany 's main political parties , with the exception of the left party , understand germany has a global responsibility which includes sending forces abroad and want to increase participation in nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
but they are afraid of voter backlash , experts say . germans remain deeply uneasy about taking part in military missions .
there 's the specter of world war ii and a long tradition of pacifism born during the cold war . this unease is shown by the limited scope parliament gave the bundeswehr in afghanistan .
the military can send a maximum of 3,500 soldiers to work out of the relatively peaceful north of the country where it is involved in rebuilding as well as peacekeeping and stabilization efforts . " it is important for nato to be seen as a community that implements its security strategy as a whole , " german defense minister franz-josef jung said recently , while insisting that germany will not participate in fighting in the south . increased involvement a tough sell bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some have questioned whether a political strategy exists in afghanistan the german public is overwhelmingly opposed to increasing the presence in afghanistan .
two out of every three say they want germany out of afghanistan as soon as possible . this has led to a certain amount of dishonesty in the political discourse surrounding afghanistan .
germany 's troop contribution to a quick reaction force is a perfect example of the divide between rhetoric and reality , said citha maass , the afghanistan expert at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs . germany agreed to send an additional 200 combat troops in july to take over for a norwegian contingent .
this force will be based in the north , but will assist allies in other regions .
these troops will have a combat component , maass said . " instead of discussing publically that you need some combat function , the government tries to hide it , " she said . on friday , feb .
15 , after denying press reports for days , the german government admitted it will discuss raising the number of troops in afghanistan when the parliamentary mandate comes up for renewal in the fall .
there 's also the possibility of changing the length of the mandate so that it does n't require renewal during election campaigning , according to press reports .
germany is , however , expected to stand firm on refusing to join fighting in the south . germany shirking its duties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has refused to join combat missions in southern afghanistan norine macdonald has spent most of the past three years doing field research in afghanistan as the president of the senlis council , a security and development think tank .
she said germany 's reluctance to get involved with fighting the taliban and al qaeda forces in southern afghanistan is outrageous and incomprehensible . german politicians lack the political will and the political skill to speak about the reality of the threat in afghanistan , macdonald said , something which she feels is " deeply irresponsible . " " germany is trying to create an alternate version of reality about afghanistan , " she said .
" unless you are going to go fight in the south , you are not part of the nato efforts to stabilize afghanistan . " unclear political goals in afghanistan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been focused on humanitarian aid the taliban and al qaeda forces control secondary roads in afghanistan 's south and are moving closer to kabul each month , . of nato members , only the united states , canada , the netherlands and great britain currently have troops are currently fighting in the south . there 's increasing worry among experts that the nato mission could fail to contain the taliban . part of the problem is that no one really knows what the ultimate goal is in afghanistan , said andreas heinemann-grüder , a senior researcher at the bonn-based bicc , an organization which focuses on peace building and conflict resolution issues . " the point is that they do n't know what they 're striving for , " heinemann-grüder said .
" what is ultimate goal for these combat missions ?

the gap between german rhetoric and reality is likely to increase as elections near . the german army 's afghanistan mission is testing berlin 's long-held prohibition against involvement in foreign combat missions like never before .
yet germany 's resistance has more to do with politics than moral qualms , experts say . the german government has spent recent weeks insisting that it has no plans to significantly increase its involvement in afghanistan .
it stood firm even as nato allies , particularly the united states , pressured germany to increase involvement in fighting taliban forces in southern afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has a very strong pacificst movement with national elections scheduled for 2009 , elected officials are n't going to commit political suicide by proposing germany fight alongside nato allies in southern afghanistan , said thomas bauer of the center for applied policy research at the university of munich and an expert in german foreign affairs . " the moment this government decides to send in combat troops to the southern part of afghanistan , they will lose the next election , " bauer said . germany : a reluctant warrior the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , will try to win the next elections by portraying their coalition partners , chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , as pro-military .

there 's the specter of world war ii and a long tradition of pacifism born during the cold war . this unease is shown by the limited scope parliament gave the bundeswehr in afghanistan .
the military can send a maximum of 3,500 soldiers to work out of the relatively peaceful north of the country where it is involved in rebuilding as well as peacekeeping and stabilization efforts .

two out of every three say they want germany out of afghanistan as soon as possible . this has led to a certain amount of dishonesty in the political discourse surrounding afghanistan .
germany 's troop contribution to a quick reaction force is a perfect example of the divide between rhetoric and reality , said citha maass , the afghanistan expert at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs . germany agreed to send an additional 200 combat troops in july to take over for a norwegian contingent .
this force will be based in the north , but will assist allies in other regions .

germany 's troop contribution to a quick reaction force is a perfect example of the divide between rhetoric and reality , said citha maass , the afghanistan expert at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs . germany agreed to send an additional 200 combat troops in july to take over for a norwegian contingent .
this force will be based in the north , but will assist allies in other regions .

dw-world.de spoke to balkans expert stefan wolff about what kosovo and the world can expect in the near future . stefan wolff is a professor of political science and director of the centre for international crisis management and conflict resolution at nottingham university in the uk .
he has extensive expertise in northern ireland , the balkans and central and eastern europe , and has also worked on a wide range of other conflicts elsewhere , including the middle east , africa , and central , south and southeast asia . dw-world.de : is kosovo prepared for independence in terms of infrastructure , governance , security and stability ? stefan wolff : kosovo has most of the important institutions of statehood and democratic governance in place , but at the same time these institutions will require continued international support for some time .
this is accepted by both the kosovars and the west and is the background against which we need to understand the eu mission for kosovo - as external assistance to consolidate existing institutional structures to enable kosovars to take care of developing their economy , infrastructure and ensure security and stability . the decision to declare independence is not a unanimous one within the population .
what minorities in kosovo have most to lose from this independence ? in principle , all minorities and the majority albanian population can gain from the clarification of kosovo 's international status , not least in the sense that they will all benefit from economic development .
prime minister thaci made some very important gestures yesterday towards reconciliation with serbs in kosovo .
the arthisaari plan offers important mechanisms to serbs to preserve and develop their identity , gives them opportunities to play a meaningful part in the political process in kosovo and retain ties with serbia .
from this perspective , there is no need for conflict between the two main population groups , but that does not mean that extremists on either side will refrain from violence and provocations .
so far , this risk has been contained , but not eliminated . what can we expect in terms of reaction and action from kosovo 's balkan neighbors ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few of the region 's conflicts are fully resolved the balkan region as a whole remains quite vulnerable to the threat of ethnic conflict .
we must bear in mind that few , if any , of the conflicts that led to bloodshed throughout the 1990s have really been resolved .
we have institutions in place now that help manage these conflicts politically , but tensions in bosnia and macedonia , for example , remain .
apart from albania and slovenia , i do n't think that any of the other balkan countries will find it a very easy decision to recognize kosovo .
eventually , however , macedonia , bosnia , croatia and montenegro will recognize the independence of kosovo , but this will not be a process free from domestic debate .
how will kosovo 's independence affect the wider balkan region ?
because of the close links between kosovo and two other major previous secessionist conflicts - bosnia , the serbs , and macedonia , the albanians - there is a danger that violence in and around kosovo could spread and create instability across the balkans .
there also remains an open question in relation to the future of albanians in southern serbia .
the overall hope , of course , remains that with kosovo 's independence the last major unresolved issue has been tackled and that the region as a whole can now move forward to closer integration with the eu .
while this will not be easy over the coming months , eventually a sense of reality will set in , and people will realize that this is there only real hope for the future .
serbia has vowed not to recognize an independent kosovo and has spoken of economic and diplomatic sanctions .
what can we expect from serbia in the coming days ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riots broke out in belgrade after kosovo 's declaration there are already signs of serbia backing down from the quite exaggerated threats of cutting diplomatic ties with any country recognizing kosovo .
this is simply not feasible for serbia , especially as the population there still has clear aspirations of eu membership and very strong economic interests both in the eu and the neighboring region .
we will , however , see further declarations and statements against kosovo 's independence and against its recognition by other states .
together with russia , serbia is most likely to try and mobilize the un against kosovo 's unilateral declaration of independence , and membership in the un and other international organizations will be very difficult to obtain for kosovo because of serbian resistance .
while the likelihood of a military conflict is close to zero , there remains a threat of localized violence in and around kosovo , but serious escalation is in nobody 's interest .
moreover , serbia has to think carefully about how to manage its relations with serbs in kosovo .
the arthisaari plan offers many important opportunities to do so , opportunities that kosovo albanians are ready to accept .
discouraging kosovo serb political participation in pristina will not be in the interests of serbs living there , and might further encourage them to leave rather than to stay .
what action do you expect to be taken by the international community in the coming days ?
we will gradually see recognition of kosovo as an independent state from major countries in the eu and the west more generally .
we should also expect support from the arab league and member countries of the organization of the islamic conference .
nato will have to be very alert towards any risk of violence in kosovo , not least in order to assure serbs that they can remain in kosovo and participate in building a democratic state .
russian opposition , on the other hand , also remains a clear fact , and russia will use its membership in the un , and possibly the osce and council of europe , to mobilize against kosovo 's independence .
this , in turn , could have a further negative impact on relations between russia and the west as a whole , again not something in either russia 's or the west 's interests .
is kosovo becoming a pawn in the current power games between the west and russia ?
if so , how will an independent kosovo affect relations ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia , serbia 's ally , remains in opposition to the west kosovo has , for some time , been one among several pawns in these power games .
now that independence has been declared , the issue has come to a head , but at the same time kosovo will gradually become less of an issue , precisely because a decision has been made .
russia may choose not to recognize it and bring it up before the security council and elsewhere , but it was in particular kosovo 's unresolved status that gave russia a certain degree of leverage .
in the long term , i think interest in kosovo will fade , especially if the transition to independence is smooth , no major violence occurs , and kosovo quickly gains recognition from a large number of countries beyond the core western powers .
what will the newly independent kosovo 's view be towards the european union and the west ?
kosovo albanians remain the most pro-european and pro-atlanticist of all the balkan people .
the challenge for prime minister thaci and president sejdiu will be to prepare kosovo politically , economically and socially for closer links with the eu and to overcome resistance within the eu from countries like cyprus , greece , romania , slovakia and spain who fear that kosovo sets an unwelcome precedent for secessionist threats that they themselves perceive .
from that perspective , kosovo and its supporters in the eu have a unique responsibility and opportunity to demonstrate that kosovo can develop into a full european , democratic state and that its independence does not lead to the instability and insecurity feared by some .
not all eu countries are in favor of an independent kosovo - how is the declaration likely to affect relations within the european bloc when the official eu line will be one of overall support ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some eu nations , like germany , will recognize kosovo some countries have expressed concern and reservations , primarily because of their own domestic situation .
on the other hand , none of them can have a real interest in risking the eu 's ability to act swiftly and decisively over the kosovo issue .
this is not least the case because , apart from the eu in cooperation with nato , there really is no other international actor willing and able to manage kosovo 's transition to independence .
thus , my hope is that despite some countries ' reluctance to recognize kosovo , none of them will be foolish enough to sabotage the eu 's efforts to maintain stability in kosovo and the wider region and enable the region to forge ever closer ties with the bloc as a whole .
what are the best and worst scenarios arising from this declaration of independence : for kosovo , for the balkans , for the eu and for the relationship between east and west ?
the worst-case scenario would be one of wide-spread violence in kosovo , triggering instability in macedonia and bosnia and an eu and nato unable to manage these threats .
also , a prolonged delay in sufficient levels of international recognition of kosovo leading to insufficient economic recovery there , and continuing strains between serbs and albanians in kosovo are unlikely to be helpful to demonstrate that kosovo as an independent state can succeed politically , economically and socially without destabilizing its neighborhood .
the more negative local developments , the more likely also is it that relations between east and west will remain difficult and impact on other major challenges in the international arena - from the middle east conflict , to nuclear proliferation in iran and north korea , to continuing bloodshed in africa .
as a best-case scenario , kosovo will remain stable , its development will take off , serbs will gradually begin to participate in the political process , the balkans will become more integrated into the eu , and the current level of international tensions over kosovo will quickly die down .
this is a tall order , and one would have to be very optimistic to see any , let alone all of this , happen very soon , but neither is there any reason to see the future as bleak as the worst-case scenario . interview : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke to him about the film 's reception , brazil and on-screen violence . dw-world.de : you decided on a first-person narrator who tells the story off-camera .
it 's a means to make the viewer identify with the main character , a brutal police officer .
were you conscious of the possibility that the protagonist could also be understood as the hero ? jose padilha : the movie 's main character is n't seen that way at all .
some newspapers wrote that the brazilians had found a hero in captain nascimento and that that would mean the brazilian people were in favor of violence .
that 's not the case .
that 's a distortion of brazilian reality . narration in the first-person form is common in film .
indeed , it does create a relationship between the viewer and the character who 's telling the story .
the viewer sees the movie through the eyes of this character .
but i do n't see it as a problem to do that with a police officer in order to understand his point of view .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : padilha certainly got people talking in the same manner , i do n't have a problem with scorsese 's choice in " good fellas . "
the main character is a mafioso .
as the viewer , you 're on his side the whole time , and that certainly does n't mean that you think the mafia is good .
the viewer has the ability to keep fiction and reality separate .
many critics underestimate that , but i believe that the viewer is smart enough to understand what he sees . the depiction of the brazilian middle class in your film was very controversial in brazil - the same middle and upper class that place the entire blame for social problems on the governments , without bearing in mind that they exploit their domestic help .
is your movie the beginning of a consciousness in that respect ? urban violence in brazil is viewed as a private war between criminals and drug dealers .
the middle class thus counts itself out .
but it goes without saying that it 's involved .
it takes part in this war .
when a drug user buys his dope from an armed group that controls a poor neighborhood , he 's backing the drug dealer 's weapons .
the user is aware of it all .
he 's part of this societal process . the hypocrisy is enormous among the brazilian middle class .
many of the people who have money take advantage of police corruption .
someone from the middle class who 's committed an offense can bribe a police officer and wo n't even be arrested .
there 's complicity between this middle class and the current situation in brazil , which causes violence . bildunterschrift : padilha did not shy away from showing violence your movie is debated both in brazil as well as abroad .
there 's been serious criticism as well as much praise , but people are not neutral about it .
did you expect the film 's reception to be so contentious outside of brazil too ? it was clear that the discussion would come to berlin .
it was brought here by brazilian critics .
whether the polemic would have developed here , i ca n't say , maybe .
in any case , the discussion is interesting .
part of this debate developed because many people viewed interrelations with dated concepts .
the idea that one must observe a societal process from the right or the left is dead for me . my film sees reality through the metaphor of a game .
if you want to understand an individual 's behavior , you have to take into account that this person makes decisions according to the rules of a society .
that 's clear in the film .
what rules must a police officer from rio submit to ?
he earns $ 400 -lrb- 275 euros -rrb- a month , is poorly educated and must find his way within a completely corrupt structure .
and on top of that we want him to take a stand against heavily armed opponents in the favela -lsb- slums -rsb- in the name of the law .
he 's supposed to risk his life and for the long term . " tropa de elite " shows brazil as an unscrupulous country , whether in the callousness of the middle class or in the brutality of the police .
is there a way out of this situation ? the result of the game depends on the rules .
that means that if you change the rules , you can get a different result .
the players themselves determine these societal rules .
we can change a lot : the law that controls the drug trade , the police structures .
we can stop sending a violent police force into the slums , and instead we can build a school there .
one can change a lot .
my aim is to show that we have created this situation ourselves .
and so , we can change it to .

but real peace in the balkans is still in the distant future , says dw 's verica spasovska . " calm and moderation " was berlin 's first cautious reaction .
for good reason , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier is calling on all involved parties in the region to keep a sober mind .
the cries of joy in pristina can not hide the fact that kosovo 's independence is n't solving all the problems of the balkans .
in reality , they 've only just begun . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verica spasovska first off , the high-flying expectations of many a citizen of kosovo that independence will automatically bring masses of foreign investors to the country will not be fulfilled that quickly .
on the contrary , a possible economic embargo by the serbian government - cutting off electricity , food and water supplies , internet and telephone connections - could make daily life harder for people in kosovo .
without generous eu support , the country will not be able to free itself from years of economic agony .
considering previous foreign aid worth billions , expectations should n't be too high that the money will lead to a rapid economic upswing . but the question whether the international community will manage to erect a truly democratic state that can integrate all its citizens is far more complicated than the economic situation .
it 's certainly possible that the 120,000 serbs in kosovo - backed by belgrade - will refuse to cooperate with the government in pristina and build parallel structures .
in the worst case , a similar situation to the " frozen conflict " in northern cyprus could develop in the long term . pristina 's declaration of independence is a tough test for the fragile coalition in belgrade .
national-conservative premier kostunica has already announced that he will reject all agreements that bring serbia closer to the eu in case of the recognition of kosovo by eu states .
president tadic meanwhile does not want to give up his pro-european stance .
at the same time , the serbian radical party is strengthening its position as the strongest fraction in parliament .
the municipal elections in may will - at the latest - force serbia to once more decide whether it wants to choose a path towards the eu or russia . the controversial step towards independence also adds oil to the fire in neighboring republics , such as the serbian entity in bosnia .
bosnians serbs are unlikely to call for independence and accession to serbia - there 's too much international pressure .
but citing kosovo , they 'll continue to test to what extent they can block the central government in sarajevo . bosnia , which has been under international control for more than a decade , also shows quite clearly the limits of " controlled independence . "
some are already beginning to ask how long kosovo albanians will put up with the semi-protectorate dictated by the eu .
the presence of 16,000 nato soldiers , who are meant to be able to prevent major unrest , brings some comfort in that respect . eu member states , a large majority of which will recognize kosovo diplomatically , know that the balkan peace process will remain a mammoth task .
the only way out of the dilemma may be a future in which national borders play a subordinate role .
only when kosovo and serbia are eu members , will the balkan find long-term peace .
it 's still a long way to go . verica spasovska heads dw-radio 's central and south-eastern european programs . -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

18 , it was the differences of their clean-up operations which summed up the feelings not only of their country folk but those of the international community at large . in kosovo 's capital , the detritus of celebration littered the streets as the sun rose on the country 's first full day of self-declared independence from serbia .
tens of thousands of people celebrated long into the night in central pristina on sunday in recognition of the kosovo parliament 's formal vote to break from serbia , a move that completed the conflict-strewn breakup of the former yugoslavia . however , as the first rays of light settled on belgrade , the night 's events in the serbian capital told a different story . the rubble , broken glass and spent tear gas canisters spoke volumes about the serbian response : riots in protest against kosovo 's declaration had swept through the streets for several hours , with the wrath of the crowd focused on the symbols of those they perceived as helping tear serbian 's heartland province away .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the streets of belgrade erupted in violence riot police battled hundreds of youths with batons after the baying mob had smashed two mcdonald 's restaurants and attacked the us and slovenian embassies with stones .
hospital officials said at least 50 people , including 20 policemen , were injured during the rioting , but none seriously . earlier , in the south of serbia , members of the kosovo police service stopped several hundred former serbian army reservists dressed in military uniforms from crossing into the province ahead of the declaration . international reactions reflect divide away from the streets , the international community soon began positioning itself in the two camps of " for " and " against . "
the trickle of responses began early , with those opposing the move striking quickly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia 's reaction would be peaceful but forceful said tadic serbia 's president boris tadic attempted to calm fears of escalating violence by speaking diplomatically , but the message was clear : serbia would not recognize this new kosovo and would work to stop its independence in its tracks .
" serbia has reacted and will react with all peaceful , diplomatic and legal means to annul this act committed by kosovo 's institutions , " he said . serbia 's main ally , russia , soon threw its considerable weight behind tadic 's message by calling a special meeting of the united nations security council to discuss the issue late sunday , but failed to secure backing for its call to declare kosovo 's declaration " null and void . " china expressed concern about the effects kosovo 's declaration would have on peace in the balkans , urging the two governments to work out their problems through dialogue .
" kosovo 's unilateral act can produce a series of results that will lead to seriously negative influence on peace and stability in the balkan region and on the realization of building a multiethnic society in kosovo , which china is deeply concerned about , " foreign affairs ministry spokesman liu jianchao said . " china calls on the two sides of serbia and kosovo to continue to seek a proper solution through negotiation within the framework of international law , and the international community should create favorable conditions for this , " he added . concerns over wave of separatist declarations sri lanka , a country with its own problems with separatism , said it was concerned about kosovo 's unilateral declaration of independence , as it could set a precedent in other parts of the world and hurt nations . " the unilateral declaration of independence by kosovo could set an unmanageable precedent in the conduct of international relations , the established global order of sovereign states and could thus pose a grave threat to international peace and security , " the foreign ministry said in a statement .
" this action by kosovo is a violation of the charter of the united nations , which enshrines the sovereignty and territorial integrity of member states . " sri lankan forces have been fighting a 25-year insurgency by tamil separatists , who want an independent homeland in the east and north of the island . new zealand 's prime minister helen clark announced that her country would not recognize an independent kosovo , saying it was never the government 's position to offer diplomatic recognition in such circumstances .

" we are not intending to make a formal statement .

" the sorry history of kosovo means that we 've got to do whatever we can do to ensure the citizens of that part of the world are protected into the future , " rudd said .

that 's why diplomatically we would extend diplomatic recognition at the earliest opportunity . " taiwan 's independence-leaning government echoed australia 's stance .
" self-determination is a right recognized by the united nations , and it is the people who are masters of their nation 's future , " the foreign ministry said in a statement .
" in no way should the independence of one nation be denied by another .

britain , france , germany and italy are expected to officially give recognition , but greece , cyprus , romania , slovakia , spain and bulgaria have all expressed their opposition .
slovenia 's foreign minister dimitrij rupel , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , told reporters that he understood that " many eu member states " would recognize kosovo 's independence .

but real peace in the balkans is still in the distant future , says dw 's verica spasovska . " calm and moderation " was berlin 's first cautious reaction .
for good reason , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier is calling on all involved parties in the region to keep a sober mind .
the cries of joy in pristina can not hide the fact that kosovo 's independence is n't solving all the problems of the balkans .
in reality , they 've only just begun . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verica spasovska first off , the high-flying expectations of many a citizen of kosovo that independence will automatically bring masses of foreign investors to the country will not be fulfilled that quickly .
on the contrary , a possible economic embargo by the serbian government - cutting off electricity , food and water supplies , internet and telephone connections - could make daily life harder for people in kosovo .
without generous eu support , the country will not be able to free itself from years of economic agony .
considering previous foreign aid worth billions , expectations should n't be too high that the money will lead to a rapid economic upswing . but the question whether the international community will manage to erect a truly democratic state that can integrate all its citizens is far more complicated than the economic situation .
it 's certainly possible that the 120,000 serbs in kosovo - backed by belgrade - will refuse to cooperate with the government in pristina and build parallel structures .
in the worst case , a similar situation to the " frozen conflict " in northern cyprus could develop in the long term . pristina 's declaration of independence is a tough test for the fragile coalition in belgrade .
national-conservative premier kostunica has already announced that he will reject all agreements that bring serbia closer to the eu in case of the recognition of kosovo by eu states .
president tadic meanwhile does not want to give up his pro-european stance .
at the same time , the serbian radical party is strengthening its position as the strongest fraction in parliament .
the municipal elections in may will - at the latest - force serbia to once more decide whether it wants to choose a path towards the eu or russia . the controversial step towards independence also adds oil to the fire in neighboring republics , such as the serbian entity in bosnia .
bosnians serbs are unlikely to call for independence and accession to serbia - there 's too much international pressure .
but citing kosovo , they 'll continue to test to what extent they can block the central government in sarajevo . bosnia , which has been under international control for more than a decade , also shows quite clearly the limits of " controlled independence . "
some are already beginning to ask how long kosovo albanians will put up with the semi-protectorate dictated by the eu .

but real peace in the balkans is still in the distant future , says dw 's verica spasovska . " calm and moderation " was berlin 's first cautious reaction .
for good reason , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier is calling on all involved parties in the region to keep a sober mind .
the cries of joy in pristina can not hide the fact that kosovo 's independence is n't solving all the problems of the balkans .
in reality , they 've only just begun . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verica spasovska first off , the high-flying expectations of many a citizen of kosovo that independence will automatically bring masses of foreign investors to the country will not be fulfilled that quickly .
on the contrary , a possible economic embargo by the serbian government - cutting off electricity , food and water supplies , internet and telephone connections - could make daily life harder for people in kosovo .
without generous eu support , the country will not be able to free itself from years of economic agony .
considering previous foreign aid worth billions , expectations should n't be too high that the money will lead to a rapid economic upswing . but the question whether the international community will manage to erect a truly democratic state that can integrate all its citizens is far more complicated than the economic situation .
it 's certainly possible that the 120,000 serbs in kosovo - backed by belgrade - will refuse to cooperate with the government in pristina and build parallel structures .
in the worst case , a similar situation to the " frozen conflict " in northern cyprus could develop in the long term . pristina 's declaration of independence is a tough test for the fragile coalition in belgrade .
national-conservative premier kostunica has already announced that he will reject all agreements that bring serbia closer to the eu in case of the recognition of kosovo by eu states .
president tadic meanwhile does not want to give up his pro-european stance .
at the same time , the serbian radical party is strengthening its position as the strongest fraction in parliament .
the municipal elections in may will - at the latest - force serbia to once more decide whether it wants to choose a path towards the eu or russia . the controversial step towards independence also adds oil to the fire in neighboring republics , such as the serbian entity in bosnia .
bosnians serbs are unlikely to call for independence and accession to serbia - there 's too much international pressure .
but citing kosovo , they 'll continue to test to what extent they can block the central government in sarajevo . bosnia , which has been under international control for more than a decade , also shows quite clearly the limits of " controlled independence . "
some are already beginning to ask how long kosovo albanians will put up with the semi-protectorate dictated by the eu .
the presence of 16,000 nato soldiers , who are meant to be able to prevent major unrest , brings some comfort in that respect . eu member states , a large majority of which will recognize kosovo diplomatically , know that the balkan peace process will remain a mammoth task .
the only way out of the dilemma may be a future in which national borders play a subordinate role .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 18.02.2008 berlin film festival winner courts controversy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " tropa de elite " has divided viewers both at home , in brazil , and abroad brazilian director jose padilha won the berlin film festival 's top prize for his controversial movie , " tropa de elite " -lrb- " elite squad " -rrb- .
dw-world.de spoke to him about the film 's reception , brazil and on-screen violence . dw-world.de : you decided on a first-person narrator who tells the story off-camera .
it 's a means to make the viewer identify with the main character , a brutal police officer .
were you conscious of the possibility that the protagonist could also be understood as the hero ? jose padilha : the movie 's main character is n't seen that way at all .
some newspapers wrote that the brazilians had found a hero in captain nascimento and that that would mean the brazilian people were in favor of violence .
that 's not the case .
that 's a distortion of brazilian reality . narration in the first-person form is common in film .
indeed , it does create a relationship between the viewer and the character who 's telling the story .
the viewer sees the movie through the eyes of this character .
but i do n't see it as a problem to do that with a police officer in order to understand his point of view .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : padilha certainly got people talking in the same manner , i do n't have a problem with scorsese 's choice in " good fellas . "
the main character is a mafioso .
as the viewer , you 're on his side the whole time , and that certainly does n't mean that you think the mafia is good .
the viewer has the ability to keep fiction and reality separate .
many critics underestimate that , but i believe that the viewer is smart enough to understand what he sees . the depiction of the brazilian middle class in your film was very controversial in brazil - the same middle and upper class that place the entire blame for social problems on the governments , without bearing in mind that they exploit their domestic help .
is your movie the beginning of a consciousness in that respect ? urban violence in brazil is viewed as a private war between criminals and drug dealers .
the middle class thus counts itself out .
but it goes without saying that it 's involved .
it takes part in this war .
when a drug user buys his dope from an armed group that controls a poor neighborhood , he 's backing the drug dealer 's weapons .
the user is aware of it all .
he 's part of this societal process . the hypocrisy is enormous among the brazilian middle class .
many of the people who have money take advantage of police corruption .
someone from the middle class who 's committed an offense can bribe a police officer and wo n't even be arrested .
there 's complicity between this middle class and the current situation in brazil , which causes violence . bildunterschrift : padilha did not shy away from showing violence your movie is debated both in brazil as well as abroad .
there 's been serious criticism as well as much praise , but people are not neutral about it .
did you expect the film 's reception to be so contentious outside of brazil too ? it was clear that the discussion would come to berlin .
it was brought here by brazilian critics .
whether the polemic would have developed here , i ca n't say , maybe .
in any case , the discussion is interesting .
part of this debate developed because many people viewed interrelations with dated concepts .
the idea that one must observe a societal process from the right or the left is dead for me . my film sees reality through the metaphor of a game .
if you want to understand an individual 's behavior , you have to take into account that this person makes decisions according to the rules of a society .
that 's clear in the film .
what rules must a police officer from rio submit to ?
he earns $ 400 -lrb- 275 euros -rrb- a month , is poorly educated and must find his way within a completely corrupt structure .
and on top of that we want him to take a stand against heavily armed opponents in the favela -lsb- slums -rsb- in the name of the law .
he 's supposed to risk his life and for the long term . " tropa de elite " shows brazil as an unscrupulous country , whether in the callousness of the middle class or in the brutality of the police .
is there a way out of this situation ? the result of the game depends on the rules .
that means that if you change the rules , you can get a different result .
the players themselves determine these societal rules .
we can change a lot : the law that controls the drug trade , the police structures .
we can stop sending a violent police force into the slums , and instead we can build a school there .
one can change a lot .
my aim is to show that we have created this situation ourselves .
and so , we can change it to .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : padilha aimed to depict brazilian reality you worked together with one of the scriptwriters from " city of god . "
the two films have certain similarities : the unsteady camera , the editing and , to a certain extent , the soundtrack .
is there a new genre in brazilian film that favors violence packaged in a fast rhythm ? in those days , the prevailing opinion was that one could only make a critical film by using a distanced approach .
it was important not to involve the viewer emotionally .
that 's not been the case for ages .
in " city of god , " fernando meirelles saw precisely that .
i do n't need any slow sequences , which - referring to brecht - take the viewer out of the events and tell him : " now think about it . "
that 's not necessary . if i involve the viewer emotionally throughout the entire film , i create an even bigger debate in the end . i 'm not saying in any way that you should n't make slow films anymore .
for me , it 's about stressing that a movie that uses emotion to involve the viewer does n't need to preclude reason .
on the contrary , emotion brings reason into the film , much more so than a critical and distanced approach .
people may love or hate " tropa de elite , " but they are talking about the film .

appel , a long-time protégé of zumwinkel , said he would continue the policies of his former boss . deutsche post delivers mail in germany and is a major worldwide player in the express delivery and logistical services business through its dhl unit . rolling raids on wealthy germans the announcement came as police swooped on the homes of wealthy germans monday , using a list of tax evaders bought for millions of euros by german spies from an informer . the rolling raids are set to continue throughout the week , with mixed teams of police , revenue officers and prosecutors knocking on doors at dawn at the homes of the rich .

opinion : long road to normalcy in kosovo european ties -pipe- 18.02.2008 major eu powers , us recognize kosovo independence großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people in kosovo celebrated the independence of their nation with a new flag the four major european powers and the majority of its other member states have said they will soon formally accept kosovo as an independent state , following the us ' lead . us secretary of state condoleeza rice congratulated the people of kosovo on monday on becoming the world 's newest state .
" as kosovo today begins its life as an independent state , the united states pledges to continue to be its close friend and partner , " she said , while also calling serbia to reaffirm the us 's ties with serbia , an ally during two world wars .
germany , france , britain and italy were among the countries that announced their intention to recognize kosovo at an eu foreign ministers ' meeting in brussels on monday .
spain and several other european countries have vowed not to do so .
nevertheless , the 27 ministers managed to unite behind a statement that left each member state free to make up its mind on the issue of recognition , but authorized the european union to use bloc funds and staff to " promote economic and political development " in kosovo .
germany to take step in two days ' time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's action against serbia in kosovo was its first post-world war ii military engagement german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier told reporters that berlin would formally recognize the state on wednesday and french foreign minister bernard kouchner said president nicolas sarkozy had written a letter of recognition which would be sent to the president of the new state on monday .
the danish news agendy ritzau reported that danish foreign minister per stig moeller said 12 to 15 eu states would also take this step on thursday or friday .
british foreign minister david miliband described the move " as the last piece of the yugoslav jigsaw . "
the ministers said kosovo was a unique case because of the yugoslav wars of the 1990s and did not set a precedent for other breakaway regions around the world or undermine international legal principles .
spain , cyprus , slovakia and romania - which all have concerns about the legal precedent or minority rights - opposed an independent kosovo .
spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos said secession needed either the agreement of both serbia and kosovo , or a un security council resolution to be legal .
slovenia , which holds the eu 's rotating presidency , played down the differences .
the eu has already taken an important decision to help guarantee kosovo 's future .
at the weekend , it launched a mission to send police , justice and administrative officials to the balkans .
serbia , which claims sovereignty over the territory , vowed to blockade kosovo and launched a criminal action against its leaders for their declaration of independence .
russia , serbia 's closest ally , stopped the un security council from adopting a blueprint for supervised independence last year .
serbia said on monday it was recalling its ambasssador to the united states after washington recognised serbia 's breakaway province of kosovo as independent . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

18 , it was the differences of their clean-up operations which summed up the feelings not only of their country folk but those of the international community at large . in kosovo 's capital , the detritus of celebration littered the streets as the sun rose on the country 's first full day of self-declared independence from serbia .
tens of thousands of people celebrated long into the night in central pristina on sunday in recognition of the kosovo parliament 's formal vote to break from serbia , a move that completed the conflict-strewn breakup of the former yugoslavia . however , as the first rays of light settled on belgrade , the night 's events in the serbian capital told a different story . the rubble , broken glass and spent tear gas canisters spoke volumes about the serbian response : riots in protest against kosovo 's declaration had swept through the streets for several hours , with the wrath of the crowd focused on the symbols of those they perceived as helping tear serbian 's heartland province away .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the streets of belgrade erupted in violence riot police battled hundreds of youths with batons after the baying mob had smashed two mcdonald 's restaurants and attacked the us and slovenian embassies with stones .
hospital officials said at least 50 people , including 20 policemen , were injured during the rioting , but none seriously . earlier , in the south of serbia , members of the kosovo police service stopped several hundred former serbian army reservists dressed in military uniforms from crossing into the province ahead of the declaration . international reactions reflect divide away from the streets , the international community soon began positioning itself in the two camps of " for " and " against . "
the trickle of responses began early , with those opposing the move striking quickly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia 's reaction would be peaceful but forceful said tadic serbia 's president boris tadic attempted to calm fears of escalating violence by speaking diplomatically , but the message was clear : serbia would not recognize this new kosovo and would work to stop its independence in its tracks .
" serbia has reacted and will react with all peaceful , diplomatic and legal means to annul this act committed by kosovo 's institutions , " he said . serbia 's main ally , russia , soon threw its considerable weight behind tadic 's message by calling a special meeting of the united nations security council to discuss the issue late sunday , but failed to secure backing for its call to declare kosovo 's declaration " null and void . " china expressed concern about the effects kosovo 's declaration would have on peace in the balkans , urging the two governments to work out their problems through dialogue .
" kosovo 's unilateral act can produce a series of results that will lead to seriously negative influence on peace and stability in the balkan region and on the realization of building a multiethnic society in kosovo , which china is deeply concerned about , " foreign affairs ministry spokesman liu jianchao said . " china calls on the two sides of serbia and kosovo to continue to seek a proper solution through negotiation within the framework of international law , and the international community should create favorable conditions for this , " he added . concerns over wave of separatist declarations sri lanka , a country with its own problems with separatism , said it was concerned about kosovo 's unilateral declaration of independence , as it could set a precedent in other parts of the world and hurt nations . " the unilateral declaration of independence by kosovo could set an unmanageable precedent in the conduct of international relations , the established global order of sovereign states and could thus pose a grave threat to international peace and security , " the foreign ministry said in a statement .
" this action by kosovo is a violation of the charter of the united nations , which enshrines the sovereignty and territorial integrity of member states . " sri lankan forces have been fighting a 25-year insurgency by tamil separatists , who want an independent homeland in the east and north of the island . new zealand 's prime minister helen clark announced that her country would not recognize an independent kosovo , saying it was never the government 's position to offer diplomatic recognition in such circumstances .
" we neither recognize nor not recognize , " she said .
" we are not intending to make a formal statement . " supporters say stability comes from recognition bildunterschrift : kosovo thanks its supporters but not everyone is in favor australia led the early calls of support for independent kosovo , with prime minister kevin rudd announcing that australia would recognize the new state .
" the sorry history of kosovo means that we 've got to do whatever we can do to ensure the citizens of that part of the world are protected into the future , " rudd said .
" this would appear to be the right course of action .
that 's why diplomatically we would extend diplomatic recognition at the earliest opportunity . " taiwan 's independence-leaning government echoed australia 's stance .
" self-determination is a right recognized by the united nations , and it is the people who are masters of their nation 's future , " the foreign ministry said in a statement .
" in no way should the independence of one nation be denied by another . " taiwan is a member of the international community that cherishes democracy and freedom , and the government is delighted that the people of kosovo have the fruits of independence , democracy and freedom to look forward to , " it said . western powers biding their time the united states and the european union were to make formal statements later in the day , but were both expected to recognize the new kosovo , despite a split over independence in the eu .
britain , france , germany and italy are expected to officially give recognition , but greece , cyprus , romania , slovakia , spain and bulgaria have all expressed their opposition .
slovenia 's foreign minister dimitrij rupel , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , told reporters that he understood that " many eu member states " would recognize kosovo 's independence . " recognition is not a matter for the eu as a whole - it 's member states who will decide , " rupel said said as he arrived for a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels , adding that there was likely to be " a lively discussion . "
" i can not tell you what we shall conclude at the end , but certainly i expect that we shall continue with this tradition of unity that we have established " with the creation of a new eu justice mission to kosovo , rupel said . german chancellor angela merkel said that germany would not make a decision on the recognition of kosovo yet , as the main priority was for the european union to act together on kosovo .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de kosovo -pipe- 18.02.2008 international community divided over recognition of kosovo großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo is born , but not everyone is rushing to celebrate the birth the divisions over kosovo 's independence , clearly seen in the different reactions on the streets of pristina and belgrade , are forcing members of the international community to choose sides . while the street sweepers of belgrade and pristina had very similar tasks on the morning of monday , feb .
18 , it was the differences of their clean-up operations which summed up the feelings not only of their country folk but those of the international community at large . in kosovo 's capital , the detritus of celebration littered the streets as the sun rose on the country 's first full day of self-declared independence from serbia .
tens of thousands of people celebrated long into the night in central pristina on sunday in recognition of the kosovo parliament 's formal vote to break from serbia , a move that completed the conflict-strewn breakup of the former yugoslavia . however , as the first rays of light settled on belgrade , the night 's events in the serbian capital told a different story . the rubble , broken glass and spent tear gas canisters spoke volumes about the serbian response : riots in protest against kosovo 's declaration had swept through the streets for several hours , with the wrath of the crowd focused on the symbols of those they perceived as helping tear serbian 's heartland province away .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the streets of belgrade erupted in violence riot police battled hundreds of youths with batons after the baying mob had smashed two mcdonald 's restaurants and attacked the us and slovenian embassies with stones .
hospital officials said at least 50 people , including 20 policemen , were injured during the rioting , but none seriously . earlier , in the south of serbia , members of the kosovo police service stopped several hundred former serbian army reservists dressed in military uniforms from crossing into the province ahead of the declaration . international reactions reflect divide away from the streets , the international community soon began positioning itself in the two camps of " for " and " against . "
the trickle of responses began early , with those opposing the move striking quickly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia 's reaction would be peaceful but forceful said tadic serbia 's president boris tadic attempted to calm fears of escalating violence by speaking diplomatically , but the message was clear : serbia would not recognize this new kosovo and would work to stop its independence in its tracks .
" serbia has reacted and will react with all peaceful , diplomatic and legal means to annul this act committed by kosovo 's institutions , " he said . serbia 's main ally , russia , soon threw its considerable weight behind tadic 's message by calling a special meeting of the united nations security council to discuss the issue late sunday , but failed to secure backing for its call to declare kosovo 's declaration " null and void . " china expressed concern about the effects kosovo 's declaration would have on peace in the balkans , urging the two governments to work out their problems through dialogue .
" kosovo 's unilateral act can produce a series of results that will lead to seriously negative influence on peace and stability in the balkan region and on the realization of building a multiethnic society in kosovo , which china is deeply concerned about , " foreign affairs ministry spokesman liu jianchao said . " china calls on the two sides of serbia and kosovo to continue to seek a proper solution through negotiation within the framework of international law , and the international community should create favorable conditions for this , " he added . concerns over wave of separatist declarations sri lanka , a country with its own problems with separatism , said it was concerned about kosovo 's unilateral declaration of independence , as it could set a precedent in other parts of the world and hurt nations . " the unilateral declaration of independence by kosovo could set an unmanageable precedent in the conduct of international relations , the established global order of sovereign states and could thus pose a grave threat to international peace and security , " the foreign ministry said in a statement .
" this action by kosovo is a violation of the charter of the united nations , which enshrines the sovereignty and territorial integrity of member states . " sri lankan forces have been fighting a 25-year insurgency by tamil separatists , who want an independent homeland in the east and north of the island . new zealand 's prime minister helen clark announced that her country would not recognize an independent kosovo , saying it was never the government 's position to offer diplomatic recognition in such circumstances .
" we neither recognize nor not recognize , " she said .
" we are not intending to make a formal statement . " supporters say stability comes from recognition bildunterschrift : kosovo thanks its supporters but not everyone is in favor australia led the early calls of support for independent kosovo , with prime minister kevin rudd announcing that australia would recognize the new state .

opinion : long road to normalcy in kosovo kosovo -pipe- 18.02.2008 us , germany cautious on kosovo as separatists call for action großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and merkel are playing the waiting game over kosovo the united states and germany issued statements suggesting they would recognize kosovo 's independence but gave no official blessing .
meanwhile , fears of knock-on separatist action increased with unrest in bosnia . while not officially recognizing kosovo as an independent state , us president george w. bush said monday that the kosovars " are now independent " but added that us recognition would be guided by the un-supported ahtisaari plan .
" the ahtisaari plan is our blueprint forward , " bush said when asked in an interview if washington will officially recognize kosovo as a country .
but , bush added , " the kosovars are now independent .
it 's something i 've advocated along with my government . "
in berlin , german chancellor angela merkel said germany would not take an immediate decision on recognizing kosovo 's independence but wait for the european union to spell out its position .
" we will not take a decision today on recognizing kosovo 's independence .
ministers from the eu will meet today to put in place a platform that will allow each member to take a position on the declaration of independence , " she told reporters in berlin .
" so taking a decision on recognition is not on the order of the day .
the order of the day is first of all to answers questions of substance as to the eu 's platform . "
germany had been expected to formally recognize kosovo on monday along with britain , france , italy and the united states .
merkel added that kosovo was an isolated case not comparable with that in other countries and she stressed that the future of both kosovo and serbia lay with the european union .
" the whole situation in the western balkans can only be kept calm and peaceful from my point of view if we keep the european perspective as the perspective for the future for both serbia and kosovo , " merkel said .
chancellor calls for protection of minorities merkel stressed that kosovo and other countries in the region had to respect their minorities if they were to have a future in the european union .
" all must live with their minorities , " she said , acknowledging difficulties that stretched back over centuries .
without a european future for the countries of the former yugoslavia , she added , " the prospects for free democracy and securing economic development are much , much worse . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said the eu 's relations with russia were stable asked whether differences over kosovo would hurt eu-russian relations , merkel said the russian objections were of a principled nature and its attitude would not change .
but she added that eu relations with russia were " of a strategic nature and ... very stable . "
" we should in as far as possible try to come to the best diplomatic conclusions , " she said .
" we have strategic relations with russia that are capable of surviving differences of opinion because they are very stable . "
eu foreign ministers were locked in a crisis meeting in brussels monday to discuss the response to kosovo 's split from serbia on sunday amid signs of intense behind-the-scenes wrangling over recognition of the new state .
while some of the larger member states support the declaration , many others refuse to accept kosovo 's decision .
eu divisions exacerbated by separatist concerns the already difficult situation of presenting a united front on kosovo was made worse when spain announced that the socialist government will not give diplomatic recognition to the new state , and that spain 's conservative opposition had agreed with the government 's position .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain fears action by eta , the armed basque separatists spain fears that the serbian province 's declaration of independence could inspire its basque separatists to take a similar step .
these fears gained some credibility when it was revealed that the main opposition bosnian serb party had called for the independence of the serb-run half of bosnia monday , citing kosovo as a precedent .
" the serb democratic party -lsb- sds -rsb- is demanding republika srpska 's institutions provide -lsb- bosnian serbs -rsb- the same rights being given to kosovo albanians , " said the party , which was founded by war crimes fugitive radovan karadzic .
" we expect the -lsb- bosnian serb -rsb- government to meet previous promises and check the will of republika srpska citizens in a referendum , " the sds said in a statement .
since its 1992-1995 war , bosnia has consisted of two entities , the serb-run republika srpska -lsb- rs -rsb- and the muslim-croat federation , each with their own government , parliament and police force .
the sds was established in the early 1990s by karadzic , who remains at large around 12 years after the un war crimes tribunal charged him with genocide over the srebrenica massacre and siege of sarajevo .
bosnian serbs cite kosovo as precedent many bosnian serbs feel that their entity should follow kosovo 's lead and be allowed to secede from bosnia to be eventually attached to serbia , which they see as their motherland .
some local politicians have hinted that the rs could try such a move .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests in banja luka had xenophobic undertones meanwhile , up to 3,000 bosnian serbs gathered in banja luka to protest against kosovo 's independence .
" europe shame on you , world shame on you " and " hashim murderer " , the protestors chanted in a reference to kosovo prime minister hashim thaci .
they also chanted offensive slogans using derogatory terms for albanians .
the protest , organized by students , started with a minute 's silence , followed by another minute of hissing to voice disagreement with kosovo 's unilateral move .
banners in the crowd carried such slogans as " europe respect international law , " " kosovo = rs , " and " we do n't give up kosovo . "
" we are disappointed with the fate of -lsb- serbian -rsb- people in kosovo and we will continue to support them , " representative of students dejan kragulj told journalists .
" it 's clear that republika srpska now has the right to secede from bosnia , " zeljko , a 23-year-old student , told reporters . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 18.02.2008 berlin film festival winner courts controversy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " tropa de elite " has divided viewers both at home , in brazil , and abroad brazilian director jose padilha won the berlin film festival 's top prize for his controversial movie , " tropa de elite " -lrb- " elite squad " -rrb- .
dw-world.de spoke to him about the film 's reception , brazil and on-screen violence . dw-world.de : you decided on a first-person narrator who tells the story off-camera .
it 's a means to make the viewer identify with the main character , a brutal police officer .
were you conscious of the possibility that the protagonist could also be understood as the hero ? jose padilha : the movie 's main character is n't seen that way at all .
some newspapers wrote that the brazilians had found a hero in captain nascimento and that that would mean the brazilian people were in favor of violence .
that 's not the case .
that 's a distortion of brazilian reality . narration in the first-person form is common in film .
indeed , it does create a relationship between the viewer and the character who 's telling the story .
the viewer sees the movie through the eyes of this character .
but i do n't see it as a problem to do that with a police officer in order to understand his point of view .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : padilha certainly got people talking in the same manner , i do n't have a problem with scorsese 's choice in " good fellas . "
the main character is a mafioso .
as the viewer , you 're on his side the whole time , and that certainly does n't mean that you think the mafia is good .
the viewer has the ability to keep fiction and reality separate .
many critics underestimate that , but i believe that the viewer is smart enough to understand what he sees . the depiction of the brazilian middle class in your film was very controversial in brazil - the same middle and upper class that place the entire blame for social problems on the governments , without bearing in mind that they exploit their domestic help .
is your movie the beginning of a consciousness in that respect ? urban violence in brazil is viewed as a private war between criminals and drug dealers .
the middle class thus counts itself out .
but it goes without saying that it 's involved .
it takes part in this war .
when a drug user buys his dope from an armed group that controls a poor neighborhood , he 's backing the drug dealer 's weapons .
the user is aware of it all .
he 's part of this societal process . the hypocrisy is enormous among the brazilian middle class .
many of the people who have money take advantage of police corruption .
someone from the middle class who 's committed an offense can bribe a police officer and wo n't even be arrested .
there 's complicity between this middle class and the current situation in brazil , which causes violence . bildunterschrift : padilha did not shy away from showing violence your movie is debated both in brazil as well as abroad .
there 's been serious criticism as well as much praise , but people are not neutral about it .
did you expect the film 's reception to be so contentious outside of brazil too ? it was clear that the discussion would come to berlin .
it was brought here by brazilian critics .
whether the polemic would have developed here , i ca n't say , maybe .
in any case , the discussion is interesting .
part of this debate developed because many people viewed interrelations with dated concepts .
the idea that one must observe a societal process from the right or the left is dead for me . my film sees reality through the metaphor of a game .
if you want to understand an individual 's behavior , you have to take into account that this person makes decisions according to the rules of a society .
that 's clear in the film .
what rules must a police officer from rio submit to ?
he earns $ 400 -lrb- 275 euros -rrb- a month , is poorly educated and must find his way within a completely corrupt structure .
and on top of that we want him to take a stand against heavily armed opponents in the favela -lsb- slums -rsb- in the name of the law .
he 's supposed to risk his life and for the long term . " tropa de elite " shows brazil as an unscrupulous country , whether in the callousness of the middle class or in the brutality of the police .
is there a way out of this situation ? the result of the game depends on the rules .
that means that if you change the rules , you can get a different result .
the players themselves determine these societal rules .
we can change a lot : the law that controls the drug trade , the police structures .
we can stop sending a violent police force into the slums , and instead we can build a school there .
one can change a lot .
my aim is to show that we have created this situation ourselves .
and so , we can change it to .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : padilha aimed to depict brazilian reality you worked together with one of the scriptwriters from " city of god . "
the two films have certain similarities : the unsteady camera , the editing and , to a certain extent , the soundtrack .
is there a new genre in brazilian film that favors violence packaged in a fast rhythm ? in those days , the prevailing opinion was that one could only make a critical film by using a distanced approach .
it was important not to involve the viewer emotionally .
that 's not been the case for ages .
in " city of god , " fernando meirelles saw precisely that .
i do n't need any slow sequences , which - referring to brecht - take the viewer out of the events and tell him : " now think about it . "
that 's not necessary . if i involve the viewer emotionally throughout the entire film , i create an even bigger debate in the end . i 'm not saying in any way that you should n't make slow films anymore .
for me , it 's about stressing that a movie that uses emotion to involve the viewer does n't need to preclude reason .
on the contrary , emotion brings reason into the film , much more so than a critical and distanced approach .

opinion : long road to normalcy in kosovo kosovo -pipe- 18.02.2008 us , germany cautious on kosovo as separatists call for action großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and merkel are playing the waiting game over kosovo the united states and germany issued statements suggesting they would recognize kosovo 's independence but gave no official blessing .
meanwhile , fears of knock-on separatist action increased with unrest in bosnia . while not officially recognizing kosovo as an independent state , us president george w. bush said monday that the kosovars " are now independent " but added that us recognition would be guided by the un-supported ahtisaari plan .
" the ahtisaari plan is our blueprint forward , " bush said when asked in an interview if washington will officially recognize kosovo as a country .
but , bush added , " the kosovars are now independent .
it 's something i 've advocated along with my government . "
in berlin , german chancellor angela merkel said germany would not take an immediate decision on recognizing kosovo 's independence but wait for the european union to spell out its position .
" we will not take a decision today on recognizing kosovo 's independence .
ministers from the eu will meet today to put in place a platform that will allow each member to take a position on the declaration of independence , " she told reporters in berlin .
" so taking a decision on recognition is not on the order of the day .
the order of the day is first of all to answers questions of substance as to the eu 's platform . "
germany had been expected to formally recognize kosovo on monday along with britain , france , italy and the united states .
merkel added that kosovo was an isolated case not comparable with that in other countries and she stressed that the future of both kosovo and serbia lay with the european union .
" the whole situation in the western balkans can only be kept calm and peaceful from my point of view if we keep the european perspective as the perspective for the future for both serbia and kosovo , " merkel said .
chancellor calls for protection of minorities merkel stressed that kosovo and other countries in the region had to respect their minorities if they were to have a future in the european union .
" all must live with their minorities , " she said , acknowledging difficulties that stretched back over centuries .
without a european future for the countries of the former yugoslavia , she added , " the prospects for free democracy and securing economic development are much , much worse . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said the eu 's relations with russia were stable asked whether differences over kosovo would hurt eu-russian relations , merkel said the russian objections were of a principled nature and its attitude would not change .
but she added that eu relations with russia were " of a strategic nature and ... very stable . "
" we should in as far as possible try to come to the best diplomatic conclusions , " she said .
" we have strategic relations with russia that are capable of surviving differences of opinion because they are very stable . "
eu foreign ministers were locked in a crisis meeting in brussels monday to discuss the response to kosovo 's split from serbia on sunday amid signs of intense behind-the-scenes wrangling over recognition of the new state .
while some of the larger member states support the declaration , many others refuse to accept kosovo 's decision .
eu divisions exacerbated by separatist concerns the already difficult situation of presenting a united front on kosovo was made worse when spain announced that the socialist government will not give diplomatic recognition to the new state , and that spain 's conservative opposition had agreed with the government 's position .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain fears action by eta , the armed basque separatists spain fears that the serbian province 's declaration of independence could inspire its basque separatists to take a similar step .
these fears gained some credibility when it was revealed that the main opposition bosnian serb party had called for the independence of the serb-run half of bosnia monday , citing kosovo as a precedent .
" the serb democratic party -lsb- sds -rsb- is demanding republika srpska 's institutions provide -lsb- bosnian serbs -rsb- the same rights being given to kosovo albanians , " said the party , which was founded by war crimes fugitive radovan karadzic .
" we expect the -lsb- bosnian serb -rsb- government to meet previous promises and check the will of republika srpska citizens in a referendum , " the sds said in a statement .
since its 1992-1995 war , bosnia has consisted of two entities , the serb-run republika srpska -lsb- rs -rsb- and the muslim-croat federation , each with their own government , parliament and police force .
the sds was established in the early 1990s by karadzic , who remains at large around 12 years after the un war crimes tribunal charged him with genocide over the srebrenica massacre and siege of sarajevo .
bosnian serbs cite kosovo as precedent many bosnian serbs feel that their entity should follow kosovo 's lead and be allowed to secede from bosnia to be eventually attached to serbia , which they see as their motherland .
some local politicians have hinted that the rs could try such a move .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests in banja luka had xenophobic undertones meanwhile , up to 3,000 bosnian serbs gathered in banja luka to protest against kosovo 's independence .
" europe shame on you , world shame on you " and " hashim murderer " , the protestors chanted in a reference to kosovo prime minister hashim thaci .
they also chanted offensive slogans using derogatory terms for albanians .
the protest , organized by students , started with a minute 's silence , followed by another minute of hissing to voice disagreement with kosovo 's unilateral move .
banners in the crowd carried such slogans as " europe respect international law , " " kosovo = rs , " and " we do n't give up kosovo . "
" we are disappointed with the fate of -lsb- serbian -rsb- people in kosovo and we will continue to support them , " representative of students dejan kragulj told journalists .
" it 's clear that republika srpska now has the right to secede from bosnia , " zeljko , a 23-year-old student , told reporters . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke to balkans expert stefan wolff about what kosovo and the world can expect in the near future . stefan wolff is a professor of political science and director of the centre for international crisis management and conflict resolution at nottingham university in the uk .
he has extensive expertise in northern ireland , the balkans and central and eastern europe , and has also worked on a wide range of other conflicts elsewhere , including the middle east , africa , and central , south and southeast asia . dw-world.de : is kosovo prepared for independence in terms of infrastructure , governance , security and stability ? stefan wolff : kosovo has most of the important institutions of statehood and democratic governance in place , but at the same time these institutions will require continued international support for some time .
this is accepted by both the kosovars and the west and is the background against which we need to understand the eu mission for kosovo - as external assistance to consolidate existing institutional structures to enable kosovars to take care of developing their economy , infrastructure and ensure security and stability . the decision to declare independence is not a unanimous one within the population .
what minorities in kosovo have most to lose from this independence ? in principle , all minorities and the majority albanian population can gain from the clarification of kosovo 's international status , not least in the sense that they will all benefit from economic development .
prime minister thaci made some very important gestures yesterday towards reconciliation with serbs in kosovo .
the arthisaari plan offers important mechanisms to serbs to preserve and develop their identity , gives them opportunities to play a meaningful part in the political process in kosovo and retain ties with serbia .
from this perspective , there is no need for conflict between the two main population groups , but that does not mean that extremists on either side will refrain from violence and provocations .
so far , this risk has been contained , but not eliminated . what can we expect in terms of reaction and action from kosovo 's balkan neighbors ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few of the region 's conflicts are fully resolved the balkan region as a whole remains quite vulnerable to the threat of ethnic conflict .
we must bear in mind that few , if any , of the conflicts that led to bloodshed throughout the 1990s have really been resolved .
we have institutions in place now that help manage these conflicts politically , but tensions in bosnia and macedonia , for example , remain .
apart from albania and slovenia , i do n't think that any of the other balkan countries will find it a very easy decision to recognize kosovo .
eventually , however , macedonia , bosnia , croatia and montenegro will recognize the independence of kosovo , but this will not be a process free from domestic debate .
how will kosovo 's independence affect the wider balkan region ?
because of the close links between kosovo and two other major previous secessionist conflicts - bosnia , the serbs , and macedonia , the albanians - there is a danger that violence in and around kosovo could spread and create instability across the balkans .
there also remains an open question in relation to the future of albanians in southern serbia .
the overall hope , of course , remains that with kosovo 's independence the last major unresolved issue has been tackled and that the region as a whole can now move forward to closer integration with the eu .
while this will not be easy over the coming months , eventually a sense of reality will set in , and people will realize that this is there only real hope for the future .
serbia has vowed not to recognize an independent kosovo and has spoken of economic and diplomatic sanctions .
what can we expect from serbia in the coming days ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riots broke out in belgrade after kosovo 's declaration there are already signs of serbia backing down from the quite exaggerated threats of cutting diplomatic ties with any country recognizing kosovo .
this is simply not feasible for serbia , especially as the population there still has clear aspirations of eu membership and very strong economic interests both in the eu and the neighboring region .
we will , however , see further declarations and statements against kosovo 's independence and against its recognition by other states .
together with russia , serbia is most likely to try and mobilize the un against kosovo 's unilateral declaration of independence , and membership in the un and other international organizations will be very difficult to obtain for kosovo because of serbian resistance .
while the likelihood of a military conflict is close to zero , there remains a threat of localized violence in and around kosovo , but serious escalation is in nobody 's interest .
moreover , serbia has to think carefully about how to manage its relations with serbs in kosovo .
the arthisaari plan offers many important opportunities to do so , opportunities that kosovo albanians are ready to accept .
discouraging kosovo serb political participation in pristina will not be in the interests of serbs living there , and might further encourage them to leave rather than to stay .
what action do you expect to be taken by the international community in the coming days ?
we will gradually see recognition of kosovo as an independent state from major countries in the eu and the west more generally .
we should also expect support from the arab league and member countries of the organization of the islamic conference .
nato will have to be very alert towards any risk of violence in kosovo , not least in order to assure serbs that they can remain in kosovo and participate in building a democratic state .
russian opposition , on the other hand , also remains a clear fact , and russia will use its membership in the un , and possibly the osce and council of europe , to mobilize against kosovo 's independence .
this , in turn , could have a further negative impact on relations between russia and the west as a whole , again not something in either russia 's or the west 's interests .
is kosovo becoming a pawn in the current power games between the west and russia ?
if so , how will an independent kosovo affect relations ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia , serbia 's ally , remains in opposition to the west kosovo has , for some time , been one among several pawns in these power games .
now that independence has been declared , the issue has come to a head , but at the same time kosovo will gradually become less of an issue , precisely because a decision has been made .
russia may choose not to recognize it and bring it up before the security council and elsewhere , but it was in particular kosovo 's unresolved status that gave russia a certain degree of leverage .
in the long term , i think interest in kosovo will fade , especially if the transition to independence is smooth , no major violence occurs , and kosovo quickly gains recognition from a large number of countries beyond the core western powers .
what will the newly independent kosovo 's view be towards the european union and the west ?
kosovo albanians remain the most pro-european and pro-atlanticist of all the balkan people .
the challenge for prime minister thaci and president sejdiu will be to prepare kosovo politically , economically and socially for closer links with the eu and to overcome resistance within the eu from countries like cyprus , greece , romania , slovakia and spain who fear that kosovo sets an unwelcome precedent for secessionist threats that they themselves perceive .
from that perspective , kosovo and its supporters in the eu have a unique responsibility and opportunity to demonstrate that kosovo can develop into a full european , democratic state and that its independence does not lead to the instability and insecurity feared by some .
not all eu countries are in favor of an independent kosovo - how is the declaration likely to affect relations within the european bloc when the official eu line will be one of overall support ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some eu nations , like germany , will recognize kosovo some countries have expressed concern and reservations , primarily because of their own domestic situation .
on the other hand , none of them can have a real interest in risking the eu 's ability to act swiftly and decisively over the kosovo issue .
this is not least the case because , apart from the eu in cooperation with nato , there really is no other international actor willing and able to manage kosovo 's transition to independence .
thus , my hope is that despite some countries ' reluctance to recognize kosovo , none of them will be foolish enough to sabotage the eu 's efforts to maintain stability in kosovo and the wider region and enable the region to forge ever closer ties with the bloc as a whole .
what are the best and worst scenarios arising from this declaration of independence : for kosovo , for the balkans , for the eu and for the relationship between east and west ?
the worst-case scenario would be one of wide-spread violence in kosovo , triggering instability in macedonia and bosnia and an eu and nato unable to manage these threats .
also , a prolonged delay in sufficient levels of international recognition of kosovo leading to insufficient economic recovery there , and continuing strains between serbs and albanians in kosovo are unlikely to be helpful to demonstrate that kosovo as an independent state can succeed politically , economically and socially without destabilizing its neighborhood .
the more negative local developments , the more likely also is it that relations between east and west will remain difficult and impact on other major challenges in the international arena - from the middle east conflict , to nuclear proliferation in iran and north korea , to continuing bloodshed in africa .
as a best-case scenario , kosovo will remain stable , its development will take off , serbs will gradually begin to participate in the political process , the balkans will become more integrated into the eu , and the current level of international tensions over kosovo will quickly die down .
this is a tall order , and one would have to be very optimistic to see any , let alone all of this , happen very soon , but neither is there any reason to see the future as bleak as the worst-case scenario . interview : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

18 with both countries calling emergency sessions of parliament to discuss their next moves . russian deputies gathered to finalize a text on the " consequences " of kosovo 's declaration while preparing an official condemnation of the act and urging un chief ban ki-moon to take a tougher stance . " the kosovo example could plunge the world into chaos , " senior parliamentarian mikhail margelov was quoted by itar-tass as saying .
the independence declaration goes against " international law and morality .
this is a dangerous precedent , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and kostunica stand side by side on kosovo ahead of further discussion at the united nations , russian foreign ministry official alexander botsan-kharchenko urged the un secretary general ban to stand up for un resolutions and rules that he said backed moscow 's stance .

whe should remain loyal to the united nations ' charter and to the security council 's resolution 1244 on kosovo . " a veto-wielding permanent member of the un security council , russia has consistently opposed kosovo 's bid for independence , siding with serbia .
however , despite its power within the un , russia failed to secure security council backing for a bid to declare the independence declaration by kosovo 's ethnic albanian majority " null and void . " russia balancing kosovo stance with own separatist issues russian newspapers on monday said russia was also likely to use kosovo 's declaration to put more pressure on neighboring georgia , which has two separatist provinces - abkhazia and south ossetia - that adjoin russia and have moscow 's de facto backing . despite opposing kosovo 's independence , russia has said that it could serve as a precedent for the separatist provinces .
at the same time moscow has said it does not plan to recognize independence for the two provinces , reflecting worries about separatism within russia 's own borders . south ossetia and abkhazia plan to ask russia and the un to recognize their independence following kosovo ’ s declaration of independence . " in the near future abkhazia will appeal to the russian parliament and the un security council with a request to recognize its independence , " self-declared abkhaz president sergei bagapsh was quoted as saying by the interfax news agency . " south ossetia will in the near future appeal to the commonwealth of independent states and the un with a request to recognize our independence , " south ossetian president eduard kokoity was also quoted as saying by the news agency , referring to a grouping of ex-soviet states that includes russia . moscow could open representative offices in the capitals of the two georgian provinces , a step just short of formal recognition of independence , kommersant newspaper said , quoting unnamed government sources . analysts say russia is balancing its position as it seeks to use its separatist allies in georgia to gain diplomatic advantage over the georgian leadership , which is seeking to join western institutions such as nato . serbia moves to counter " violation of sovereignty " meanwhile , the serbian parliament will convene in belgrade later monday to adopt a decision to " annul " kosovo 's independence proclamation on the grounds that it " violates the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the republic of serbia . " " the parliament of serbia should confirm the serbian government 's decision to annul illegal acts by interim kosovo authorities to unilaterally proclaim independence , " the tanjug state-run news agency reported . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kostunica 's government pursues its annulment plan president boris tadic and prime minister vojislav kostunica said serbia would " never recognize an independent kosovo " after the province 's declaration on sunday . serbia also announced that police had filed criminal charges against kosovo albanian leaders for " organizing the proclamation of a phony state on serbian territory , " according to tanjug . the charges were laid against kosovo president fatmir sejdiu , prime minister hashim thaci and parliament speaker jakup krasniqi , the state-run agency said , citing an interior ministry statement . the serbian government also decided to proclaim as " null and void " all decisions by the european union to send a mission to kosovo .
" these decisions have no legal foundation for serbia and produce no obligation of serbia towards the european union , " the government statement read . the eu is preparing a kosovo mission dubbed eulex , which is designed to help the 90-percent ethnic albanian territory on its road to independence by deploying some 2,000 personnel . kosovo has been run by the united nations since mid-1999 , after a nato air assault drove out serbian forces waging a brutal crackdown on separatist ethnic albanian guerrillas and their civilian supporters . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but real peace in the balkans is still in the distant future , says dw 's verica spasovska . " calm and moderation " was berlin 's first cautious reaction .
for good reason , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier is calling on all involved parties in the region to keep a sober mind .
the cries of joy in pristina can not hide the fact that kosovo 's independence is n't solving all the problems of the balkans .
in reality , they 've only just begun . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verica spasovska first off , the high-flying expectations of many a citizen of kosovo that independence will automatically bring masses of foreign investors to the country will not be fulfilled that quickly .
on the contrary , a possible economic embargo by the serbian government - cutting off electricity , food and water supplies , internet and telephone connections - could make daily life harder for people in kosovo .
without generous eu support , the country will not be able to free itself from years of economic agony .
considering previous foreign aid worth billions , expectations should n't be too high that the money will lead to a rapid economic upswing . but the question whether the international community will manage to erect a truly democratic state that can integrate all its citizens is far more complicated than the economic situation .
it 's certainly possible that the 120,000 serbs in kosovo - backed by belgrade - will refuse to cooperate with the government in pristina and build parallel structures .
in the worst case , a similar situation to the " frozen conflict " in northern cyprus could develop in the long term . pristina 's declaration of independence is a tough test for the fragile coalition in belgrade .
national-conservative premier kostunica has already announced that he will reject all agreements that bring serbia closer to the eu in case of the recognition of kosovo by eu states .
president tadic meanwhile does not want to give up his pro-european stance .
at the same time , the serbian radical party is strengthening its position as the strongest fraction in parliament .
the municipal elections in may will - at the latest - force serbia to once more decide whether it wants to choose a path towards the eu or russia . the controversial step towards independence also adds oil to the fire in neighboring republics , such as the serbian entity in bosnia .
bosnians serbs are unlikely to call for independence and accession to serbia - there 's too much international pressure .
but citing kosovo , they 'll continue to test to what extent they can block the central government in sarajevo . bosnia , which has been under international control for more than a decade , also shows quite clearly the limits of " controlled independence . "
some are already beginning to ask how long kosovo albanians will put up with the semi-protectorate dictated by the eu .
the presence of 16,000 nato soldiers , who are meant to be able to prevent major unrest , brings some comfort in that respect . eu member states , a large majority of which will recognize kosovo diplomatically , know that the balkan peace process will remain a mammoth task .
the only way out of the dilemma may be a future in which national borders play a subordinate role .
only when kosovo and serbia are eu members , will the balkan find long-term peace .
it 's still a long way to go . verica spasovska heads dw-radio 's central and south-eastern european programs . -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the allegations have led the japanese government to lodge a complaint with the us ambassador to japan thomas schieffer . over half of the roughly 40,000 us troops in japan are based on okinawa .
their presence is controversial .
local residents often complain of noise , pollution and crime related to the us bases .
crime has increased in recent weeks .
at the weekend , two marines were arrested ; one for drunken driving , the other for trespassing , after being found asleep on a local resident ’ s couch .
just one week before , another marine was arrested for allegedly raping a 14-year-old girl in a car .
officials say the 38-year-old has denied rape but admits forcing the girl to kiss him .
the case has brought back memories of the gang-rape of a 12-year-old girl , which triggered mass rallies against the us troops in 1995 .
promises of greater discipline last week , us officials flew to japan to offer their personal apologies and promise stricter discipline in the military .
the commander of the us forces in japan also announced the military had set up a task force to review and develop existing programmes to prevent sexual harassment and assault .
the most recent arrests have provoked further outrage across japan .
a top government spokesman said the us troops should not be drinking in the middle of the night and committing crimes just as people call for stricter discipline .
meanwhile , the us ambassador to japan , thomas schieffer , has said all the incidents are deeply regrettable and has promised once again that washington will make every effort to prevent such incidents from reoccurring .
when us secretary of state condoleezza rice flies into japan next week , she is widely expected to be grilled on this matter .
angry local residents but local residents think there will always be such incidents so long as there are the us military bases on okinawa .
lawmakers on the island have called for a reduction in the us military presence there .
however , this does not seem to be on the cards .
the us military is currently planning to move one air-base from the crowded city of ginowan to the coastal city of nago .
us and japanese officials have expressed their doubts that the incidents will have any impact on the plans .
us troops have been stationed on okinawa since the end of the second world war .
they occupy about 10 percent of the southern prefecture ’ s land .
at several times in post-war history , us forces have launched major operations from japan , most recently during the first gulf war . anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

the gap between german rhetoric and reality is likely to increase as elections near . the german army 's afghanistan mission is testing berlin 's long-held prohibition against involvement in foreign combat missions like never before .
yet germany 's resistance has more to do with politics than moral qualms , experts say . the german government has spent recent weeks insisting that it has no plans to significantly increase its involvement in afghanistan .
it stood firm even as nato allies , particularly the united states , pressured germany to increase involvement in fighting taliban forces in southern afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has a very strong pacificst movement with national elections scheduled for 2009 , elected officials are n't going to commit political suicide by proposing germany fight alongside nato allies in southern afghanistan , said thomas bauer of the center for applied policy research at the university of munich and an expert in german foreign affairs . " the moment this government decides to send in combat troops to the southern part of afghanistan , they will lose the next election , " bauer said . germany : a reluctant warrior the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , will try to win the next elections by portraying their coalition partners , chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , as pro-military .

this force will be based in the north , but will assist allies in other regions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 18.02.2008 germany faces political dilemma in afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are uneasy about combat missions while experts say germany will likely increase its military involvement in afghanistan , the subject remains politically taboo .
the gap between german rhetoric and reality is likely to increase as elections near . the german army 's afghanistan mission is testing berlin 's long-held prohibition against involvement in foreign combat missions like never before .
yet germany 's resistance has more to do with politics than moral qualms , experts say . the german government has spent recent weeks insisting that it has no plans to significantly increase its involvement in afghanistan .
it stood firm even as nato allies , particularly the united states , pressured germany to increase involvement in fighting taliban forces in southern afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has a very strong pacificst movement with national elections scheduled for 2009 , elected officials are n't going to commit political suicide by proposing germany fight alongside nato allies in southern afghanistan , said thomas bauer of the center for applied policy research at the university of munich and an expert in german foreign affairs . " the moment this government decides to send in combat troops to the southern part of afghanistan , they will lose the next election , " bauer said . germany : a reluctant warrior the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , will try to win the next elections by portraying their coalition partners , chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , as pro-military .
to win votes , the left party will try to portray both the spd and cdu as warmongers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party will use afghanistan to score points with german pacifists " pushing this pacifist button " wins elections , bauer said . all of germany 's main political parties , with the exception of the left party , understand germany has a global responsibility which includes sending forces abroad and want to increase participation in nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
but they are afraid of voter backlash , experts say . germans remain deeply uneasy about taking part in military missions .
there 's the specter of world war ii and a long tradition of pacifism born during the cold war . this unease is shown by the limited scope parliament gave the bundeswehr in afghanistan .
the military can send a maximum of 3,500 soldiers to work out of the relatively peaceful north of the country where it is involved in rebuilding as well as peacekeeping and stabilization efforts . " it is important for nato to be seen as a community that implements its security strategy as a whole , " german defense minister franz-josef jung said recently , while insisting that germany will not participate in fighting in the south . increased involvement a tough sell bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some have questioned whether a political strategy exists in afghanistan the german public is overwhelmingly opposed to increasing the presence in afghanistan .
two out of every three say they want germany out of afghanistan as soon as possible . this has led to a certain amount of dishonesty in the political discourse surrounding afghanistan .
germany 's troop contribution to a quick reaction force is a perfect example of the divide between rhetoric and reality , said citha maass , the afghanistan expert at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs . germany agreed to send an additional 200 combat troops in july to take over for a norwegian contingent .
this force will be based in the north , but will assist allies in other regions .
these troops will have a combat component , maass said . " instead of discussing publically that you need some combat function , the government tries to hide it , " she said . on friday , feb .
15 , after denying press reports for days , the german government admitted it will discuss raising the number of troops in afghanistan when the parliamentary mandate comes up for renewal in the fall .
there 's also the possibility of changing the length of the mandate so that it does n't require renewal during election campaigning , according to press reports .
germany is , however , expected to stand firm on refusing to join fighting in the south . germany shirking its duties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has refused to join combat missions in southern afghanistan norine macdonald has spent most of the past three years doing field research in afghanistan as the president of the senlis council , a security and development think tank .
she said germany 's reluctance to get involved with fighting the taliban and al qaeda forces in southern afghanistan is outrageous and incomprehensible . german politicians lack the political will and the political skill to speak about the reality of the threat in afghanistan , macdonald said , something which she feels is " deeply irresponsible . " " germany is trying to create an alternate version of reality about afghanistan , " she said .
" unless you are going to go fight in the south , you are not part of the nato efforts to stabilize afghanistan . " unclear political goals in afghanistan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been focused on humanitarian aid the taliban and al qaeda forces control secondary roads in afghanistan 's south and are moving closer to kabul each month , . of nato members , only the united states , canada , the netherlands and great britain currently have troops are currently fighting in the south . there 's increasing worry among experts that the nato mission could fail to contain the taliban . part of the problem is that no one really knows what the ultimate goal is in afghanistan , said andreas heinemann-grüder , a senior researcher at the bonn-based bicc , an organization which focuses on peace building and conflict resolution issues .

but real peace in the balkans is still in the distant future , says dw 's verica spasovska . " calm and moderation " was berlin 's first cautious reaction .
for good reason , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier is calling on all involved parties in the region to keep a sober mind .
the cries of joy in pristina can not hide the fact that kosovo 's independence is n't solving all the problems of the balkans .
in reality , they 've only just begun . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verica spasovska first off , the high-flying expectations of many a citizen of kosovo that independence will automatically bring masses of foreign investors to the country will not be fulfilled that quickly .
on the contrary , a possible economic embargo by the serbian government - cutting off electricity , food and water supplies , internet and telephone connections - could make daily life harder for people in kosovo .
without generous eu support , the country will not be able to free itself from years of economic agony .
considering previous foreign aid worth billions , expectations should n't be too high that the money will lead to a rapid economic upswing . but the question whether the international community will manage to erect a truly democratic state that can integrate all its citizens is far more complicated than the economic situation .
it 's certainly possible that the 120,000 serbs in kosovo - backed by belgrade - will refuse to cooperate with the government in pristina and build parallel structures .
in the worst case , a similar situation to the " frozen conflict " in northern cyprus could develop in the long term . pristina 's declaration of independence is a tough test for the fragile coalition in belgrade .
national-conservative premier kostunica has already announced that he will reject all agreements that bring serbia closer to the eu in case of the recognition of kosovo by eu states .
president tadic meanwhile does not want to give up his pro-european stance .
at the same time , the serbian radical party is strengthening its position as the strongest fraction in parliament .
the municipal elections in may will - at the latest - force serbia to once more decide whether it wants to choose a path towards the eu or russia . the controversial step towards independence also adds oil to the fire in neighboring republics , such as the serbian entity in bosnia .
bosnians serbs are unlikely to call for independence and accession to serbia - there 's too much international pressure .
but citing kosovo , they 'll continue to test to what extent they can block the central government in sarajevo . bosnia , which has been under international control for more than a decade , also shows quite clearly the limits of " controlled independence . "
some are already beginning to ask how long kosovo albanians will put up with the semi-protectorate dictated by the eu .
the presence of 16,000 nato soldiers , who are meant to be able to prevent major unrest , brings some comfort in that respect . eu member states , a large majority of which will recognize kosovo diplomatically , know that the balkan peace process will remain a mammoth task .
the only way out of the dilemma may be a future in which national borders play a subordinate role .

18 , it was the differences of their clean-up operations which summed up the feelings not only of their country folk but those of the international community at large . in kosovo 's capital , the detritus of celebration littered the streets as the sun rose on the country 's first full day of self-declared independence from serbia .
tens of thousands of people celebrated long into the night in central pristina on sunday in recognition of the kosovo parliament 's formal vote to break from serbia , a move that completed the conflict-strewn breakup of the former yugoslavia . however , as the first rays of light settled on belgrade , the night 's events in the serbian capital told a different story . the rubble , broken glass and spent tear gas canisters spoke volumes about the serbian response : riots in protest against kosovo 's declaration had swept through the streets for several hours , with the wrath of the crowd focused on the symbols of those they perceived as helping tear serbian 's heartland province away .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the streets of belgrade erupted in violence riot police battled hundreds of youths with batons after the baying mob had smashed two mcdonald 's restaurants and attacked the us and slovenian embassies with stones .
hospital officials said at least 50 people , including 20 policemen , were injured during the rioting , but none seriously . earlier , in the south of serbia , members of the kosovo police service stopped several hundred former serbian army reservists dressed in military uniforms from crossing into the province ahead of the declaration . international reactions reflect divide away from the streets , the international community soon began positioning itself in the two camps of " for " and " against . "
the trickle of responses began early , with those opposing the move striking quickly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia 's reaction would be peaceful but forceful said tadic serbia 's president boris tadic attempted to calm fears of escalating violence by speaking diplomatically , but the message was clear : serbia would not recognize this new kosovo and would work to stop its independence in its tracks .
" serbia has reacted and will react with all peaceful , diplomatic and legal means to annul this act committed by kosovo 's institutions , " he said . serbia 's main ally , russia , soon threw its considerable weight behind tadic 's message by calling a special meeting of the united nations security council to discuss the issue late sunday , but failed to secure backing for its call to declare kosovo 's declaration " null and void . " china expressed concern about the effects kosovo 's declaration would have on peace in the balkans , urging the two governments to work out their problems through dialogue .
" kosovo 's unilateral act can produce a series of results that will lead to seriously negative influence on peace and stability in the balkan region and on the realization of building a multiethnic society in kosovo , which china is deeply concerned about , " foreign affairs ministry spokesman liu jianchao said . " china calls on the two sides of serbia and kosovo to continue to seek a proper solution through negotiation within the framework of international law , and the international community should create favorable conditions for this , " he added . concerns over wave of separatist declarations sri lanka , a country with its own problems with separatism , said it was concerned about kosovo 's unilateral declaration of independence , as it could set a precedent in other parts of the world and hurt nations . " the unilateral declaration of independence by kosovo could set an unmanageable precedent in the conduct of international relations , the established global order of sovereign states and could thus pose a grave threat to international peace and security , " the foreign ministry said in a statement .
" this action by kosovo is a violation of the charter of the united nations , which enshrines the sovereignty and territorial integrity of member states . " sri lankan forces have been fighting a 25-year insurgency by tamil separatists , who want an independent homeland in the east and north of the island . new zealand 's prime minister helen clark announced that her country would not recognize an independent kosovo , saying it was never the government 's position to offer diplomatic recognition in such circumstances .
" we neither recognize nor not recognize , " she said .
" we are not intending to make a formal statement . " supporters say stability comes from recognition bildunterschrift : kosovo thanks its supporters but not everyone is in favor australia led the early calls of support for independent kosovo , with prime minister kevin rudd announcing that australia would recognize the new state .
" the sorry history of kosovo means that we 've got to do whatever we can do to ensure the citizens of that part of the world are protected into the future , " rudd said .
" this would appear to be the right course of action .
that 's why diplomatically we would extend diplomatic recognition at the earliest opportunity . " taiwan 's independence-leaning government echoed australia 's stance .
" self-determination is a right recognized by the united nations , and it is the people who are masters of their nation 's future , " the foreign ministry said in a statement .
" in no way should the independence of one nation be denied by another . " taiwan is a member of the international community that cherishes democracy and freedom , and the government is delighted that the people of kosovo have the fruits of independence , democracy and freedom to look forward to , " it said . western powers biding their time the united states and the european union were to make formal statements later in the day , but were both expected to recognize the new kosovo , despite a split over independence in the eu .
britain , france , germany and italy are expected to officially give recognition , but greece , cyprus , romania , slovakia , spain and bulgaria have all expressed their opposition .
slovenia 's foreign minister dimitrij rupel , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , told reporters that he understood that " many eu member states " would recognize kosovo 's independence . " recognition is not a matter for the eu as a whole - it 's member states who will decide , " rupel said said as he arrived for a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels , adding that there was likely to be " a lively discussion . "
" i can not tell you what we shall conclude at the end , but certainly i expect that we shall continue with this tradition of unity that we have established " with the creation of a new eu justice mission to kosovo , rupel said . german chancellor angela merkel said that germany would not make a decision on the recognition of kosovo yet , as the main priority was for the european union to act together on kosovo . " germany will not take a decision -lsb- on the recognition of kosovo -rsb- today , " merkel told germany 's foreign press association -lrb- vap -rrb- .

18 , it was the differences of their clean-up operations which summed up the feelings not only of their country folk but those of the international community at large . in kosovo 's capital , the detritus of celebration littered the streets as the sun rose on the country 's first full day of self-declared independence from serbia .
tens of thousands of people celebrated long into the night in central pristina on sunday in recognition of the kosovo parliament 's formal vote to break from serbia , a move that completed the conflict-strewn breakup of the former yugoslavia . however , as the first rays of light settled on belgrade , the night 's events in the serbian capital told a different story . the rubble , broken glass and spent tear gas canisters spoke volumes about the serbian response : riots in protest against kosovo 's declaration had swept through the streets for several hours , with the wrath of the crowd focused on the symbols of those they perceived as helping tear serbian 's heartland province away .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the streets of belgrade erupted in violence riot police battled hundreds of youths with batons after the baying mob had smashed two mcdonald 's restaurants and attacked the us and slovenian embassies with stones .
hospital officials said at least 50 people , including 20 policemen , were injured during the rioting , but none seriously . earlier , in the south of serbia , members of the kosovo police service stopped several hundred former serbian army reservists dressed in military uniforms from crossing into the province ahead of the declaration . international reactions reflect divide away from the streets , the international community soon began positioning itself in the two camps of " for " and " against . "
the trickle of responses began early , with those opposing the move striking quickly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia 's reaction would be peaceful but forceful said tadic serbia 's president boris tadic attempted to calm fears of escalating violence by speaking diplomatically , but the message was clear : serbia would not recognize this new kosovo and would work to stop its independence in its tracks .
" serbia has reacted and will react with all peaceful , diplomatic and legal means to annul this act committed by kosovo 's institutions , " he said . serbia 's main ally , russia , soon threw its considerable weight behind tadic 's message by calling a special meeting of the united nations security council to discuss the issue late sunday , but failed to secure backing for its call to declare kosovo 's declaration " null and void . " china expressed concern about the effects kosovo 's declaration would have on peace in the balkans , urging the two governments to work out their problems through dialogue .
" kosovo 's unilateral act can produce a series of results that will lead to seriously negative influence on peace and stability in the balkan region and on the realization of building a multiethnic society in kosovo , which china is deeply concerned about , " foreign affairs ministry spokesman liu jianchao said . " china calls on the two sides of serbia and kosovo to continue to seek a proper solution through negotiation within the framework of international law , and the international community should create favorable conditions for this , " he added . concerns over wave of separatist declarations sri lanka , a country with its own problems with separatism , said it was concerned about kosovo 's unilateral declaration of independence , as it could set a precedent in other parts of the world and hurt nations . " the unilateral declaration of independence by kosovo could set an unmanageable precedent in the conduct of international relations , the established global order of sovereign states and could thus pose a grave threat to international peace and security , " the foreign ministry said in a statement .
" this action by kosovo is a violation of the charter of the united nations , which enshrines the sovereignty and territorial integrity of member states . " sri lankan forces have been fighting a 25-year insurgency by tamil separatists , who want an independent homeland in the east and north of the island . new zealand 's prime minister helen clark announced that her country would not recognize an independent kosovo , saying it was never the government 's position to offer diplomatic recognition in such circumstances .
" we neither recognize nor not recognize , " she said .
" we are not intending to make a formal statement . " supporters say stability comes from recognition bildunterschrift : kosovo thanks its supporters but not everyone is in favor australia led the early calls of support for independent kosovo , with prime minister kevin rudd announcing that australia would recognize the new state .
" the sorry history of kosovo means that we 've got to do whatever we can do to ensure the citizens of that part of the world are protected into the future , " rudd said .
" this would appear to be the right course of action .
that 's why diplomatically we would extend diplomatic recognition at the earliest opportunity . " taiwan 's independence-leaning government echoed australia 's stance .
" self-determination is a right recognized by the united nations , and it is the people who are masters of their nation 's future , " the foreign ministry said in a statement .
" in no way should the independence of one nation be denied by another . " taiwan is a member of the international community that cherishes democracy and freedom , and the government is delighted that the people of kosovo have the fruits of independence , democracy and freedom to look forward to , " it said . western powers biding their time the united states and the european union were to make formal statements later in the day , but were both expected to recognize the new kosovo , despite a split over independence in the eu .
britain , france , germany and italy are expected to officially give recognition , but greece , cyprus , romania , slovakia , spain and bulgaria have all expressed their opposition .
slovenia 's foreign minister dimitrij rupel , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , told reporters that he understood that " many eu member states " would recognize kosovo 's independence . " recognition is not a matter for the eu as a whole - it 's member states who will decide , " rupel said said as he arrived for a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels , adding that there was likely to be " a lively discussion . "
" i can not tell you what we shall conclude at the end , but certainly i expect that we shall continue with this tradition of unity that we have established " with the creation of a new eu justice mission to kosovo , rupel said . german chancellor angela merkel said that germany would not make a decision on the recognition of kosovo yet , as the main priority was for the european union to act together on kosovo . " germany will not take a decision -lsb- on the recognition of kosovo -rsb- today , " merkel told germany 's foreign press association -lrb- vap -rrb- .

18 , it was the differences of their clean-up operations which summed up the feelings not only of their country folk but those of the international community at large . in kosovo 's capital , the detritus of celebration littered the streets as the sun rose on the country 's first full day of self-declared independence from serbia .
tens of thousands of people celebrated long into the night in central pristina on sunday in recognition of the kosovo parliament 's formal vote to break from serbia , a move that completed the conflict-strewn breakup of the former yugoslavia . however , as the first rays of light settled on belgrade , the night 's events in the serbian capital told a different story . the rubble , broken glass and spent tear gas canisters spoke volumes about the serbian response : riots in protest against kosovo 's declaration had swept through the streets for several hours , with the wrath of the crowd focused on the symbols of those they perceived as helping tear serbian 's heartland province away .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the streets of belgrade erupted in violence riot police battled hundreds of youths with batons after the baying mob had smashed two mcdonald 's restaurants and attacked the us and slovenian embassies with stones .
hospital officials said at least 50 people , including 20 policemen , were injured during the rioting , but none seriously . earlier , in the south of serbia , members of the kosovo police service stopped several hundred former serbian army reservists dressed in military uniforms from crossing into the province ahead of the declaration . international reactions reflect divide away from the streets , the international community soon began positioning itself in the two camps of " for " and " against . "
the trickle of responses began early , with those opposing the move striking quickly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia 's reaction would be peaceful but forceful said tadic serbia 's president boris tadic attempted to calm fears of escalating violence by speaking diplomatically , but the message was clear : serbia would not recognize this new kosovo and would work to stop its independence in its tracks .
" serbia has reacted and will react with all peaceful , diplomatic and legal means to annul this act committed by kosovo 's institutions , " he said . serbia 's main ally , russia , soon threw its considerable weight behind tadic 's message by calling a special meeting of the united nations security council to discuss the issue late sunday , but failed to secure backing for its call to declare kosovo 's declaration " null and void . " china expressed concern about the effects kosovo 's declaration would have on peace in the balkans , urging the two governments to work out their problems through dialogue .
" kosovo 's unilateral act can produce a series of results that will lead to seriously negative influence on peace and stability in the balkan region and on the realization of building a multiethnic society in kosovo , which china is deeply concerned about , " foreign affairs ministry spokesman liu jianchao said . " china calls on the two sides of serbia and kosovo to continue to seek a proper solution through negotiation within the framework of international law , and the international community should create favorable conditions for this , " he added . concerns over wave of separatist declarations sri lanka , a country with its own problems with separatism , said it was concerned about kosovo 's unilateral declaration of independence , as it could set a precedent in other parts of the world and hurt nations . " the unilateral declaration of independence by kosovo could set an unmanageable precedent in the conduct of international relations , the established global order of sovereign states and could thus pose a grave threat to international peace and security , " the foreign ministry said in a statement .
" this action by kosovo is a violation of the charter of the united nations , which enshrines the sovereignty and territorial integrity of member states . " sri lankan forces have been fighting a 25-year insurgency by tamil separatists , who want an independent homeland in the east and north of the island . new zealand 's prime minister helen clark announced that her country would not recognize an independent kosovo , saying it was never the government 's position to offer diplomatic recognition in such circumstances .
" we neither recognize nor not recognize , " she said .
" we are not intending to make a formal statement . " supporters say stability comes from recognition bildunterschrift : kosovo thanks its supporters but not everyone is in favor australia led the early calls of support for independent kosovo , with prime minister kevin rudd announcing that australia would recognize the new state .
" the sorry history of kosovo means that we 've got to do whatever we can do to ensure the citizens of that part of the world are protected into the future , " rudd said .
" this would appear to be the right course of action .
that 's why diplomatically we would extend diplomatic recognition at the earliest opportunity . " taiwan 's independence-leaning government echoed australia 's stance .
" self-determination is a right recognized by the united nations , and it is the people who are masters of their nation 's future , " the foreign ministry said in a statement .
" in no way should the independence of one nation be denied by another . " taiwan is a member of the international community that cherishes democracy and freedom , and the government is delighted that the people of kosovo have the fruits of independence , democracy and freedom to look forward to , " it said . western powers biding their time the united states and the european union were to make formal statements later in the day , but were both expected to recognize the new kosovo , despite a split over independence in the eu .
britain , france , germany and italy are expected to officially give recognition , but greece , cyprus , romania , slovakia , spain and bulgaria have all expressed their opposition .
slovenia 's foreign minister dimitrij rupel , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , told reporters that he understood that " many eu member states " would recognize kosovo 's independence . " recognition is not a matter for the eu as a whole - it 's member states who will decide , " rupel said said as he arrived for a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels , adding that there was likely to be " a lively discussion . "
" i can not tell you what we shall conclude at the end , but certainly i expect that we shall continue with this tradition of unity that we have established " with the creation of a new eu justice mission to kosovo , rupel said . german chancellor angela merkel said that germany would not make a decision on the recognition of kosovo yet , as the main priority was for the european union to act together on kosovo .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 18.02.2008 berlin film festival winner courts controversy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " tropa de elite " has divided viewers both at home , in brazil , and abroad brazilian director jose padilha won the berlin film festival 's top prize for his controversial movie , " tropa de elite " -lrb- " elite squad " -rrb- .
dw-world.de spoke to him about the film 's reception , brazil and on-screen violence . dw-world.de : you decided on a first-person narrator who tells the story off-camera .
it 's a means to make the viewer identify with the main character , a brutal police officer .
were you conscious of the possibility that the protagonist could also be understood as the hero ? jose padilha : the movie 's main character is n't seen that way at all .
some newspapers wrote that the brazilians had found a hero in captain nascimento and that that would mean the brazilian people were in favor of violence .
that 's not the case .
that 's a distortion of brazilian reality . narration in the first-person form is common in film .
indeed , it does create a relationship between the viewer and the character who 's telling the story .
the viewer sees the movie through the eyes of this character .
but i do n't see it as a problem to do that with a police officer in order to understand his point of view .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : padilha certainly got people talking in the same manner , i do n't have a problem with scorsese 's choice in " good fellas . "
the main character is a mafioso .
as the viewer , you 're on his side the whole time , and that certainly does n't mean that you think the mafia is good .
the viewer has the ability to keep fiction and reality separate .
many critics underestimate that , but i believe that the viewer is smart enough to understand what he sees . the depiction of the brazilian middle class in your film was very controversial in brazil - the same middle and upper class that place the entire blame for social problems on the governments , without bearing in mind that they exploit their domestic help .
is your movie the beginning of a consciousness in that respect ? urban violence in brazil is viewed as a private war between criminals and drug dealers .
the middle class thus counts itself out .
but it goes without saying that it 's involved .
it takes part in this war .
when a drug user buys his dope from an armed group that controls a poor neighborhood , he 's backing the drug dealer 's weapons .
the user is aware of it all .
he 's part of this societal process . the hypocrisy is enormous among the brazilian middle class .
many of the people who have money take advantage of police corruption .
someone from the middle class who 's committed an offense can bribe a police officer and wo n't even be arrested .
there 's complicity between this middle class and the current situation in brazil , which causes violence . bildunterschrift : padilha did not shy away from showing violence your movie is debated both in brazil as well as abroad .
there 's been serious criticism as well as much praise , but people are not neutral about it .
did you expect the film 's reception to be so contentious outside of brazil too ? it was clear that the discussion would come to berlin .
it was brought here by brazilian critics .
whether the polemic would have developed here , i ca n't say , maybe .
in any case , the discussion is interesting .
part of this debate developed because many people viewed interrelations with dated concepts .
the idea that one must observe a societal process from the right or the left is dead for me . my film sees reality through the metaphor of a game .
if you want to understand an individual 's behavior , you have to take into account that this person makes decisions according to the rules of a society .
that 's clear in the film .
what rules must a police officer from rio submit to ?
he earns $ 400 -lrb- 275 euros -rrb- a month , is poorly educated and must find his way within a completely corrupt structure .
and on top of that we want him to take a stand against heavily armed opponents in the favela -lsb- slums -rsb- in the name of the law .
he 's supposed to risk his life and for the long term . " tropa de elite " shows brazil as an unscrupulous country , whether in the callousness of the middle class or in the brutality of the police .
is there a way out of this situation ? the result of the game depends on the rules .
that means that if you change the rules , you can get a different result .
the players themselves determine these societal rules .
we can change a lot : the law that controls the drug trade , the police structures .
we can stop sending a violent police force into the slums , and instead we can build a school there .
one can change a lot .
my aim is to show that we have created this situation ourselves .
and so , we can change it to .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : padilha aimed to depict brazilian reality you worked together with one of the scriptwriters from " city of god . "
the two films have certain similarities : the unsteady camera , the editing and , to a certain extent , the soundtrack .
is there a new genre in brazilian film that favors violence packaged in a fast rhythm ? in those days , the prevailing opinion was that one could only make a critical film by using a distanced approach .
it was important not to involve the viewer emotionally .
that 's not been the case for ages .
in " city of god , " fernando meirelles saw precisely that .
i do n't need any slow sequences , which - referring to brecht - take the viewer out of the events and tell him : " now think about it . "
that 's not necessary . if i involve the viewer emotionally throughout the entire film , i create an even bigger debate in the end . i 'm not saying in any way that you should n't make slow films anymore .
for me , it 's about stressing that a movie that uses emotion to involve the viewer does n't need to preclude reason .
on the contrary , emotion brings reason into the film , much more so than a critical and distanced approach .
people may love or hate " tropa de elite , " but they are talking about the film .
that 's exactly what we wanted . interview : soraia vilela -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the main character is a mafioso .
as the viewer , you 're on his side the whole time , and that certainly does n't mean that you think the mafia is good .
the viewer has the ability to keep fiction and reality separate .
many critics underestimate that , but i believe that the viewer is smart enough to understand what he sees . the depiction of the brazilian middle class in your film was very controversial in brazil - the same middle and upper class that place the entire blame for social problems on the governments , without bearing in mind that they exploit their domestic help .
is your movie the beginning of a consciousness in that respect ? urban violence in brazil is viewed as a private war between criminals and drug dealers .

it takes part in this war .

he 's part of this societal process . the hypocrisy is enormous among the brazilian middle class .

there 's been serious criticism as well as much praise , but people are not neutral about it .

it was brought here by brazilian critics .

in any case , the discussion is interesting .
part of this debate developed because many people viewed interrelations with dated concepts .
the idea that one must observe a societal process from the right or the left is dead for me . my film sees reality through the metaphor of a game .
if you want to understand an individual 's behavior , you have to take into account that this person makes decisions according to the rules of a society .
that 's clear in the film .
what rules must a police officer from rio submit to ?
he earns $ 400 -lrb- 275 euros -rrb- a month , is poorly educated and must find his way within a completely corrupt structure .
and on top of that we want him to take a stand against heavily armed opponents in the favela -lsb- slums -rsb- in the name of the law .
he 's supposed to risk his life and for the long term . " tropa de elite " shows brazil as an unscrupulous country , whether in the callousness of the middle class or in the brutality of the police .
is there a way out of this situation ? the result of the game depends on the rules .
that means that if you change the rules , you can get a different result .
the players themselves determine these societal rules .
we can change a lot : the law that controls the drug trade , the police structures .
we can stop sending a violent police force into the slums , and instead we can build a school there .
one can change a lot .
my aim is to show that we have created this situation ourselves .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 18.02.2008 berlin film festival winner courts controversy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " tropa de elite " has divided viewers both at home , in brazil , and abroad brazilian director jose padilha won the berlin film festival 's top prize for his controversial movie , " tropa de elite " -lrb- " elite squad " -rrb- .
dw-world.de spoke to him about the film 's reception , brazil and on-screen violence . dw-world.de : you decided on a first-person narrator who tells the story off-camera .
it 's a means to make the viewer identify with the main character , a brutal police officer .
were you conscious of the possibility that the protagonist could also be understood as the hero ? jose padilha : the movie 's main character is n't seen that way at all .
some newspapers wrote that the brazilians had found a hero in captain nascimento and that that would mean the brazilian people were in favor of violence .
that 's not the case .
that 's a distortion of brazilian reality . narration in the first-person form is common in film .
indeed , it does create a relationship between the viewer and the character who 's telling the story .
the viewer sees the movie through the eyes of this character .
but i do n't see it as a problem to do that with a police officer in order to understand his point of view .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : padilha certainly got people talking in the same manner , i do n't have a problem with scorsese 's choice in " good fellas . "
the main character is a mafioso .
as the viewer , you 're on his side the whole time , and that certainly does n't mean that you think the mafia is good .
the viewer has the ability to keep fiction and reality separate .
many critics underestimate that , but i believe that the viewer is smart enough to understand what he sees . the depiction of the brazilian middle class in your film was very controversial in brazil - the same middle and upper class that place the entire blame for social problems on the governments , without bearing in mind that they exploit their domestic help .
is your movie the beginning of a consciousness in that respect ? urban violence in brazil is viewed as a private war between criminals and drug dealers .
the middle class thus counts itself out .
but it goes without saying that it 's involved .
it takes part in this war .
when a drug user buys his dope from an armed group that controls a poor neighborhood , he 's backing the drug dealer 's weapons .
the user is aware of it all .
he 's part of this societal process . the hypocrisy is enormous among the brazilian middle class .
many of the people who have money take advantage of police corruption .
someone from the middle class who 's committed an offense can bribe a police officer and wo n't even be arrested .
there 's complicity between this middle class and the current situation in brazil , which causes violence . bildunterschrift : padilha did not shy away from showing violence your movie is debated both in brazil as well as abroad .
there 's been serious criticism as well as much praise , but people are not neutral about it .
did you expect the film 's reception to be so contentious outside of brazil too ? it was clear that the discussion would come to berlin .
it was brought here by brazilian critics .
whether the polemic would have developed here , i ca n't say , maybe .
in any case , the discussion is interesting .
part of this debate developed because many people viewed interrelations with dated concepts .
the idea that one must observe a societal process from the right or the left is dead for me . my film sees reality through the metaphor of a game .
if you want to understand an individual 's behavior , you have to take into account that this person makes decisions according to the rules of a society .
that 's clear in the film .
what rules must a police officer from rio submit to ?
he earns $ 400 -lrb- 275 euros -rrb- a month , is poorly educated and must find his way within a completely corrupt structure .
and on top of that we want him to take a stand against heavily armed opponents in the favela -lsb- slums -rsb- in the name of the law .
he 's supposed to risk his life and for the long term . " tropa de elite " shows brazil as an unscrupulous country , whether in the callousness of the middle class or in the brutality of the police .
is there a way out of this situation ? the result of the game depends on the rules .
that means that if you change the rules , you can get a different result .
the players themselves determine these societal rules .
we can change a lot : the law that controls the drug trade , the police structures .
we can stop sending a violent police force into the slums , and instead we can build a school there .
one can change a lot .
my aim is to show that we have created this situation ourselves .
and so , we can change it to .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : padilha aimed to depict brazilian reality you worked together with one of the scriptwriters from " city of god . "
the two films have certain similarities : the unsteady camera , the editing and , to a certain extent , the soundtrack .
is there a new genre in brazilian film that favors violence packaged in a fast rhythm ? in those days , the prevailing opinion was that one could only make a critical film by using a distanced approach .
it was important not to involve the viewer emotionally .
that 's not been the case for ages .
in " city of god , " fernando meirelles saw precisely that .
i do n't need any slow sequences , which - referring to brecht - take the viewer out of the events and tell him : " now think about it . "

17 . the two front-runners have vowed to change course and find a solution to the " cyprus problem " which has kept the island divided for three decades . conservative ioannis kassoulidis and general secretary of the communist party demetris christofias will vie for the presidency in the final round of voting on feb .
24 .
both have pledged to resume peace talks , which were stalled after papadopoulos urged the rejection of a united nations peace plan in 2004 . surprising defeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demetris christofias wants reunification president papadopoulos was expected to easily make it into the final round of voting , as he was ahead in opinion polls .
during campaigning papadopoulos said his political rivals would " sell out " the republic of cyprus if they won . after his surprising third-place finish sunday , kassoulidis and christofias began aggressively courting papadopoulos supporters . kassoulidis , the country 's former foreign minister , won 33.5 percent of the vote .
christofias , who is parliament speaker and left the government coalition led by papadopoulos to run for president , won 33.3 percent of the vote .

" now is the time to overcome all that has divided the people on the cyprus problem these past years . " cyprus , which gained independence from britain in 1960 , is one of the most popular mediterranean tourist destinations . cyprus was split along ethnic lines in 1974 after turkey responded to an effort to unite the island with greece by invading the northern part of the country .
turkish cypriots have a breakaway state in the north which is recognized only by ankara . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president papadopoulos was ousted in the voting “ our goal is to reunite the people of this tragic , afflicted country , ” christofias , 61 , said . papadopoulos , 74 , is seen as responsible for the failure of a un blueprint in 2004 to unite the country before it entered the eu .
after the plan failed , the southern republic of cyprus joined the eu in 2004 .

one of hitler 's " divinely gifted " artists heesters has been a popular german-language singer since the 1930s , becoming a favorite of the nazis and one of the " divinely gifted " artists who took part in performances to boost the morale of soldiers during the war .
heesters claims he did not know what was happening to jews during the war despite visiting the dachau concentration camp in 1941 .
" honestly , i was too busy working , " heesters said in an interview after a tv gala celebrating his 100th birthday in 2003 .
" i could n't do anything about politics . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heesters is considered a musical legend in germany while germans have taken heesters at his word and continue to watch his old films such as " always you " and " illusion , " many of his dutch countrymen have never forgiven him for his acceptance of the nazi regime during world war ii .
after the nazi defeat , heesters continued his career in germany , settling in bavaria .
heesters is considered to be the oldest living performer .
at the concert saturday , heesters performed hits such as " the merry widow " and " there by the windmill " despite breaking several ribs on jan .

at the concert he occasionally needed help from his wife to remember the lines , but otherwise sang with a steady voice , according to media reports . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke to balkans expert stefan wolff about what kosovo and the world can expect in the near future . stefan wolff is a professor of political science and director of the centre for international crisis management and conflict resolution at nottingham university in the uk .
he has extensive expertise in northern ireland , the balkans and central and eastern europe , and has also worked on a wide range of other conflicts elsewhere , including the middle east , africa , and central , south and southeast asia . dw-world.de : is kosovo prepared for independence in terms of infrastructure , governance , security and stability ? stefan wolff : kosovo has most of the important institutions of statehood and democratic governance in place , but at the same time these institutions will require continued international support for some time .
this is accepted by both the kosovars and the west and is the background against which we need to understand the eu mission for kosovo - as external assistance to consolidate existing institutional structures to enable kosovars to take care of developing their economy , infrastructure and ensure security and stability . the decision to declare independence is not a unanimous one within the population .
what minorities in kosovo have most to lose from this independence ? in principle , all minorities and the majority albanian population can gain from the clarification of kosovo 's international status , not least in the sense that they will all benefit from economic development .
prime minister thaci made some very important gestures yesterday towards reconciliation with serbs in kosovo .
the arthisaari plan offers important mechanisms to serbs to preserve and develop their identity , gives them opportunities to play a meaningful part in the political process in kosovo and retain ties with serbia .
from this perspective , there is no need for conflict between the two main population groups , but that does not mean that extremists on either side will refrain from violence and provocations .
so far , this risk has been contained , but not eliminated . what can we expect in terms of reaction and action from kosovo 's balkan neighbors ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few of the region 's conflicts are fully resolved the balkan region as a whole remains quite vulnerable to the threat of ethnic conflict .
we must bear in mind that few , if any , of the conflicts that led to bloodshed throughout the 1990s have really been resolved .
we have institutions in place now that help manage these conflicts politically , but tensions in bosnia and macedonia , for example , remain .
apart from albania and slovenia , i do n't think that any of the other balkan countries will find it a very easy decision to recognize kosovo .
eventually , however , macedonia , bosnia , croatia and montenegro will recognize the independence of kosovo , but this will not be a process free from domestic debate .
how will kosovo 's independence affect the wider balkan region ?
because of the close links between kosovo and two other major previous secessionist conflicts - bosnia , the serbs , and macedonia , the albanians - there is a danger that violence in and around kosovo could spread and create instability across the balkans .
there also remains an open question in relation to the future of albanians in southern serbia .
the overall hope , of course , remains that with kosovo 's independence the last major unresolved issue has been tackled and that the region as a whole can now move forward to closer integration with the eu .
while this will not be easy over the coming months , eventually a sense of reality will set in , and people will realize that this is there only real hope for the future .
serbia has vowed not to recognize an independent kosovo and has spoken of economic and diplomatic sanctions .
what can we expect from serbia in the coming days ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riots broke out in belgrade after kosovo 's declaration there are already signs of serbia backing down from the quite exaggerated threats of cutting diplomatic ties with any country recognizing kosovo .
this is simply not feasible for serbia , especially as the population there still has clear aspirations of eu membership and very strong economic interests both in the eu and the neighboring region .
we will , however , see further declarations and statements against kosovo 's independence and against its recognition by other states .
together with russia , serbia is most likely to try and mobilize the un against kosovo 's unilateral declaration of independence , and membership in the un and other international organizations will be very difficult to obtain for kosovo because of serbian resistance .
while the likelihood of a military conflict is close to zero , there remains a threat of localized violence in and around kosovo , but serious escalation is in nobody 's interest .
moreover , serbia has to think carefully about how to manage its relations with serbs in kosovo .
the arthisaari plan offers many important opportunities to do so , opportunities that kosovo albanians are ready to accept .
discouraging kosovo serb political participation in pristina will not be in the interests of serbs living there , and might further encourage them to leave rather than to stay .
what action do you expect to be taken by the international community in the coming days ?
we will gradually see recognition of kosovo as an independent state from major countries in the eu and the west more generally .
we should also expect support from the arab league and member countries of the organization of the islamic conference .
nato will have to be very alert towards any risk of violence in kosovo , not least in order to assure serbs that they can remain in kosovo and participate in building a democratic state .
russian opposition , on the other hand , also remains a clear fact , and russia will use its membership in the un , and possibly the osce and council of europe , to mobilize against kosovo 's independence .
this , in turn , could have a further negative impact on relations between russia and the west as a whole , again not something in either russia 's or the west 's interests .
is kosovo becoming a pawn in the current power games between the west and russia ?
if so , how will an independent kosovo affect relations ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia , serbia 's ally , remains in opposition to the west kosovo has , for some time , been one among several pawns in these power games .
now that independence has been declared , the issue has come to a head , but at the same time kosovo will gradually become less of an issue , precisely because a decision has been made .
russia may choose not to recognize it and bring it up before the security council and elsewhere , but it was in particular kosovo 's unresolved status that gave russia a certain degree of leverage .
in the long term , i think interest in kosovo will fade , especially if the transition to independence is smooth , no major violence occurs , and kosovo quickly gains recognition from a large number of countries beyond the core western powers .
what will the newly independent kosovo 's view be towards the european union and the west ?
kosovo albanians remain the most pro-european and pro-atlanticist of all the balkan people .
the challenge for prime minister thaci and president sejdiu will be to prepare kosovo politically , economically and socially for closer links with the eu and to overcome resistance within the eu from countries like cyprus , greece , romania , slovakia and spain who fear that kosovo sets an unwelcome precedent for secessionist threats that they themselves perceive .
from that perspective , kosovo and its supporters in the eu have a unique responsibility and opportunity to demonstrate that kosovo can develop into a full european , democratic state and that its independence does not lead to the instability and insecurity feared by some .
not all eu countries are in favor of an independent kosovo - how is the declaration likely to affect relations within the european bloc when the official eu line will be one of overall support ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some eu nations , like germany , will recognize kosovo some countries have expressed concern and reservations , primarily because of their own domestic situation .
on the other hand , none of them can have a real interest in risking the eu 's ability to act swiftly and decisively over the kosovo issue .
this is not least the case because , apart from the eu in cooperation with nato , there really is no other international actor willing and able to manage kosovo 's transition to independence .
thus , my hope is that despite some countries ' reluctance to recognize kosovo , none of them will be foolish enough to sabotage the eu 's efforts to maintain stability in kosovo and the wider region and enable the region to forge ever closer ties with the bloc as a whole .
what are the best and worst scenarios arising from this declaration of independence : for kosovo , for the balkans , for the eu and for the relationship between east and west ?
the worst-case scenario would be one of wide-spread violence in kosovo , triggering instability in macedonia and bosnia and an eu and nato unable to manage these threats .
also , a prolonged delay in sufficient levels of international recognition of kosovo leading to insufficient economic recovery there , and continuing strains between serbs and albanians in kosovo are unlikely to be helpful to demonstrate that kosovo as an independent state can succeed politically , economically and socially without destabilizing its neighborhood .
the more negative local developments , the more likely also is it that relations between east and west will remain difficult and impact on other major challenges in the international arena - from the middle east conflict , to nuclear proliferation in iran and north korea , to continuing bloodshed in africa .
as a best-case scenario , kosovo will remain stable , its development will take off , serbs will gradually begin to participate in the political process , the balkans will become more integrated into the eu , and the current level of international tensions over kosovo will quickly die down .
this is a tall order , and one would have to be very optimistic to see any , let alone all of this , happen very soon , but neither is there any reason to see the future as bleak as the worst-case scenario . interview : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

so far , this risk has been contained , but not eliminated . what can we expect in terms of reaction and action from kosovo 's balkan neighbors ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few of the region 's conflicts are fully resolved the balkan region as a whole remains quite vulnerable to the threat of ethnic conflict .
we must bear in mind that few , if any , of the conflicts that led to bloodshed throughout the 1990s have really been resolved .
we have institutions in place now that help manage these conflicts politically , but tensions in bosnia and macedonia , for example , remain .
apart from albania and slovenia , i do n't think that any of the other balkan countries will find it a very easy decision to recognize kosovo .
eventually , however , macedonia , bosnia , croatia and montenegro will recognize the independence of kosovo , but this will not be a process free from domestic debate .
how will kosovo 's independence affect the wider balkan region ?
because of the close links between kosovo and two other major previous secessionist conflicts - bosnia , the serbs , and macedonia , the albanians - there is a danger that violence in and around kosovo could spread and create instability across the balkans .
there also remains an open question in relation to the future of albanians in southern serbia .
the overall hope , of course , remains that with kosovo 's independence the last major unresolved issue has been tackled and that the region as a whole can now move forward to closer integration with the eu .
while this will not be easy over the coming months , eventually a sense of reality will set in , and people will realize that this is there only real hope for the future .
serbia has vowed not to recognize an independent kosovo and has spoken of economic and diplomatic sanctions .
what can we expect from serbia in the coming days ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riots broke out in belgrade after kosovo 's declaration there are already signs of serbia backing down from the quite exaggerated threats of cutting diplomatic ties with any country recognizing kosovo .
this is simply not feasible for serbia , especially as the population there still has clear aspirations of eu membership and very strong economic interests both in the eu and the neighboring region .
we will , however , see further declarations and statements against kosovo 's independence and against its recognition by other states .
together with russia , serbia is most likely to try and mobilize the un against kosovo 's unilateral declaration of independence , and membership in the un and other international organizations will be very difficult to obtain for kosovo because of serbian resistance .
while the likelihood of a military conflict is close to zero , there remains a threat of localized violence in and around kosovo , but serious escalation is in nobody 's interest .
moreover , serbia has to think carefully about how to manage its relations with serbs in kosovo .
the arthisaari plan offers many important opportunities to do so , opportunities that kosovo albanians are ready to accept .
discouraging kosovo serb political participation in pristina will not be in the interests of serbs living there , and might further encourage them to leave rather than to stay .
what action do you expect to be taken by the international community in the coming days ?
we will gradually see recognition of kosovo as an independent state from major countries in the eu and the west more generally .
we should also expect support from the arab league and member countries of the organization of the islamic conference .
nato will have to be very alert towards any risk of violence in kosovo , not least in order to assure serbs that they can remain in kosovo and participate in building a democratic state .
russian opposition , on the other hand , also remains a clear fact , and russia will use its membership in the un , and possibly the osce and council of europe , to mobilize against kosovo 's independence .
this , in turn , could have a further negative impact on relations between russia and the west as a whole , again not something in either russia 's or the west 's interests .
is kosovo becoming a pawn in the current power games between the west and russia ?
if so , how will an independent kosovo affect relations ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia , serbia 's ally , remains in opposition to the west kosovo has , for some time , been one among several pawns in these power games .
now that independence has been declared , the issue has come to a head , but at the same time kosovo will gradually become less of an issue , precisely because a decision has been made .
russia may choose not to recognize it and bring it up before the security council and elsewhere , but it was in particular kosovo 's unresolved status that gave russia a certain degree of leverage .
in the long term , i think interest in kosovo will fade , especially if the transition to independence is smooth , no major violence occurs , and kosovo quickly gains recognition from a large number of countries beyond the core western powers .
what will the newly independent kosovo 's view be towards the european union and the west ?
kosovo albanians remain the most pro-european and pro-atlanticist of all the balkan people .
the challenge for prime minister thaci and president sejdiu will be to prepare kosovo politically , economically and socially for closer links with the eu and to overcome resistance within the eu from countries like cyprus , greece , romania , slovakia and spain who fear that kosovo sets an unwelcome precedent for secessionist threats that they themselves perceive .
from that perspective , kosovo and its supporters in the eu have a unique responsibility and opportunity to demonstrate that kosovo can develop into a full european , democratic state and that its independence does not lead to the instability and insecurity feared by some .
not all eu countries are in favor of an independent kosovo - how is the declaration likely to affect relations within the european bloc when the official eu line will be one of overall support ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some eu nations , like germany , will recognize kosovo some countries have expressed concern and reservations , primarily because of their own domestic situation .
on the other hand , none of them can have a real interest in risking the eu 's ability to act swiftly and decisively over the kosovo issue .
this is not least the case because , apart from the eu in cooperation with nato , there really is no other international actor willing and able to manage kosovo 's transition to independence .
thus , my hope is that despite some countries ' reluctance to recognize kosovo , none of them will be foolish enough to sabotage the eu 's efforts to maintain stability in kosovo and the wider region and enable the region to forge ever closer ties with the bloc as a whole .
what are the best and worst scenarios arising from this declaration of independence : for kosovo , for the balkans , for the eu and for the relationship between east and west ?
the worst-case scenario would be one of wide-spread violence in kosovo , triggering instability in macedonia and bosnia and an eu and nato unable to manage these threats .
also , a prolonged delay in sufficient levels of international recognition of kosovo leading to insufficient economic recovery there , and continuing strains between serbs and albanians in kosovo are unlikely to be helpful to demonstrate that kosovo as an independent state can succeed politically , economically and socially without destabilizing its neighborhood .
the more negative local developments , the more likely also is it that relations between east and west will remain difficult and impact on other major challenges in the international arena - from the middle east conflict , to nuclear proliferation in iran and north korea , to continuing bloodshed in africa .
as a best-case scenario , kosovo will remain stable , its development will take off , serbs will gradually begin to participate in the political process , the balkans will become more integrated into the eu , and the current level of international tensions over kosovo will quickly die down .
this is a tall order , and one would have to be very optimistic to see any , let alone all of this , happen very soon , but neither is there any reason to see the future as bleak as the worst-case scenario . interview : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke to balkans expert stefan wolff about what kosovo and the world can expect in the near future . stefan wolff is a professor of political science and director of the centre for international crisis management and conflict resolution at nottingham university in the uk .
he has extensive expertise in northern ireland , the balkans and central and eastern europe , and has also worked on a wide range of other conflicts elsewhere , including the middle east , africa , and central , south and southeast asia . dw-world.de : is kosovo prepared for independence in terms of infrastructure , governance , security and stability ? stefan wolff : kosovo has most of the important institutions of statehood and democratic governance in place , but at the same time these institutions will require continued international support for some time .
this is accepted by both the kosovars and the west and is the background against which we need to understand the eu mission for kosovo - as external assistance to consolidate existing institutional structures to enable kosovars to take care of developing their economy , infrastructure and ensure security and stability . the decision to declare independence is not a unanimous one within the population .
what minorities in kosovo have most to lose from this independence ? in principle , all minorities and the majority albanian population can gain from the clarification of kosovo 's international status , not least in the sense that they will all benefit from economic development .
prime minister thaci made some very important gestures yesterday towards reconciliation with serbs in kosovo .
the arthisaari plan offers important mechanisms to serbs to preserve and develop their identity , gives them opportunities to play a meaningful part in the political process in kosovo and retain ties with serbia .
from this perspective , there is no need for conflict between the two main population groups , but that does not mean that extremists on either side will refrain from violence and provocations .

kosovo albanians remain the most pro-european and pro-atlanticist of all the balkan people .
the challenge for prime minister thaci and president sejdiu will be to prepare kosovo politically , economically and socially for closer links with the eu and to overcome resistance within the eu from countries like cyprus , greece , romania , slovakia and spain who fear that kosovo sets an unwelcome precedent for secessionist threats that they themselves perceive .

what are the best and worst scenarios arising from this declaration of independence : for kosovo , for the balkans , for the eu and for the relationship between east and west ?
the worst-case scenario would be one of wide-spread violence in kosovo , triggering instability in macedonia and bosnia and an eu and nato unable to manage these threats .
also , a prolonged delay in sufficient levels of international recognition of kosovo leading to insufficient economic recovery there , and continuing strains between serbs and albanians in kosovo are unlikely to be helpful to demonstrate that kosovo as an independent state can succeed politically , economically and socially without destabilizing its neighborhood .
the more negative local developments , the more likely also is it that relations between east and west will remain difficult and impact on other major challenges in the international arena - from the middle east conflict , to nuclear proliferation in iran and north korea , to continuing bloodshed in africa .
as a best-case scenario , kosovo will remain stable , its development will take off , serbs will gradually begin to participate in the political process , the balkans will become more integrated into the eu , and the current level of international tensions over kosovo will quickly die down .
this is a tall order , and one would have to be very optimistic to see any , let alone all of this , happen very soon , but neither is there any reason to see the future as bleak as the worst-case scenario . interview : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

opinion : long road to normalcy in kosovo kosovo -pipe- 18.02.2008 us , germany cautious on kosovo as separatists call for action großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and merkel are playing the waiting game over kosovo the united states and germany issued statements suggesting they would recognize kosovo 's independence but gave no official blessing .
meanwhile , fears of knock-on separatist action increased with unrest in bosnia . while not officially recognizing kosovo as an independent state , us president george w. bush said monday that the kosovars " are now independent " but added that us recognition would be guided by the un-supported ahtisaari plan .
" the ahtisaari plan is our blueprint forward , " bush said when asked in an interview if washington will officially recognize kosovo as a country .
but , bush added , " the kosovars are now independent .
it 's something i 've advocated along with my government . "
in berlin , german chancellor angela merkel said germany would not take an immediate decision on recognizing kosovo 's independence but wait for the european union to spell out its position .
" we will not take a decision today on recognizing kosovo 's independence .
ministers from the eu will meet today to put in place a platform that will allow each member to take a position on the declaration of independence , " she told reporters in berlin .
" so taking a decision on recognition is not on the order of the day .
the order of the day is first of all to answers questions of substance as to the eu 's platform . "
germany had been expected to formally recognize kosovo on monday along with britain , france , italy and the united states .
merkel added that kosovo was an isolated case not comparable with that in other countries and she stressed that the future of both kosovo and serbia lay with the european union .
" the whole situation in the western balkans can only be kept calm and peaceful from my point of view if we keep the european perspective as the perspective for the future for both serbia and kosovo , " merkel said .
chancellor calls for protection of minorities merkel stressed that kosovo and other countries in the region had to respect their minorities if they were to have a future in the european union .
" all must live with their minorities , " she said , acknowledging difficulties that stretched back over centuries .
without a european future for the countries of the former yugoslavia , she added , " the prospects for free democracy and securing economic development are much , much worse . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said the eu 's relations with russia were stable asked whether differences over kosovo would hurt eu-russian relations , merkel said the russian objections were of a principled nature and its attitude would not change .
but she added that eu relations with russia were " of a strategic nature and ... very stable . "
" we should in as far as possible try to come to the best diplomatic conclusions , " she said .
" we have strategic relations with russia that are capable of surviving differences of opinion because they are very stable . "
eu foreign ministers were locked in a crisis meeting in brussels monday to discuss the response to kosovo 's split from serbia on sunday amid signs of intense behind-the-scenes wrangling over recognition of the new state .
while some of the larger member states support the declaration , many others refuse to accept kosovo 's decision .
eu divisions exacerbated by separatist concerns the already difficult situation of presenting a united front on kosovo was made worse when spain announced that the socialist government will not give diplomatic recognition to the new state , and that spain 's conservative opposition had agreed with the government 's position .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain fears action by eta , the armed basque separatists spain fears that the serbian province 's declaration of independence could inspire its basque separatists to take a similar step .
these fears gained some credibility when it was revealed that the main opposition bosnian serb party had called for the independence of the serb-run half of bosnia monday , citing kosovo as a precedent .
" the serb democratic party -lsb- sds -rsb- is demanding republika srpska 's institutions provide -lsb- bosnian serbs -rsb- the same rights being given to kosovo albanians , " said the party , which was founded by war crimes fugitive radovan karadzic .
" we expect the -lsb- bosnian serb -rsb- government to meet previous promises and check the will of republika srpska citizens in a referendum , " the sds said in a statement .
since its 1992-1995 war , bosnia has consisted of two entities , the serb-run republika srpska -lsb- rs -rsb- and the muslim-croat federation , each with their own government , parliament and police force .
the sds was established in the early 1990s by karadzic , who remains at large around 12 years after the un war crimes tribunal charged him with genocide over the srebrenica massacre and siege of sarajevo .
bosnian serbs cite kosovo as precedent many bosnian serbs feel that their entity should follow kosovo 's lead and be allowed to secede from bosnia to be eventually attached to serbia , which they see as their motherland .
some local politicians have hinted that the rs could try such a move .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests in banja luka had xenophobic undertones meanwhile , up to 3,000 bosnian serbs gathered in banja luka to protest against kosovo 's independence .
" europe shame on you , world shame on you " and " hashim murderer " , the protestors chanted in a reference to kosovo prime minister hashim thaci .
they also chanted offensive slogans using derogatory terms for albanians .
the protest , organized by students , started with a minute 's silence , followed by another minute of hissing to voice disagreement with kosovo 's unilateral move .
banners in the crowd carried such slogans as " europe respect international law , " " kosovo = rs , " and " we do n't give up kosovo . "
" we are disappointed with the fate of -lsb- serbian -rsb- people in kosovo and we will continue to support them , " representative of students dejan kragulj told journalists .

opinion : long road to normalcy in kosovo kosovo -pipe- 18.02.2008 us , germany cautious on kosovo as separatists call for action großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and merkel are playing the waiting game over kosovo the united states and germany issued statements suggesting they would recognize kosovo 's independence but gave no official blessing .
meanwhile , fears of knock-on separatist action increased with unrest in bosnia . while not officially recognizing kosovo as an independent state , us president george w. bush said monday that the kosovars " are now independent " but added that us recognition would be guided by the un-supported ahtisaari plan .
" the ahtisaari plan is our blueprint forward , " bush said when asked in an interview if washington will officially recognize kosovo as a country .
but , bush added , " the kosovars are now independent .
it 's something i 've advocated along with my government . "
in berlin , german chancellor angela merkel said germany would not take an immediate decision on recognizing kosovo 's independence but wait for the european union to spell out its position .
" we will not take a decision today on recognizing kosovo 's independence .
ministers from the eu will meet today to put in place a platform that will allow each member to take a position on the declaration of independence , " she told reporters in berlin .
" so taking a decision on recognition is not on the order of the day .
the order of the day is first of all to answers questions of substance as to the eu 's platform . "
germany had been expected to formally recognize kosovo on monday along with britain , france , italy and the united states .
merkel added that kosovo was an isolated case not comparable with that in other countries and she stressed that the future of both kosovo and serbia lay with the european union .
" the whole situation in the western balkans can only be kept calm and peaceful from my point of view if we keep the european perspective as the perspective for the future for both serbia and kosovo , " merkel said .
chancellor calls for protection of minorities merkel stressed that kosovo and other countries in the region had to respect their minorities if they were to have a future in the european union .
" all must live with their minorities , " she said , acknowledging difficulties that stretched back over centuries .
without a european future for the countries of the former yugoslavia , she added , " the prospects for free democracy and securing economic development are much , much worse . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said the eu 's relations with russia were stable asked whether differences over kosovo would hurt eu-russian relations , merkel said the russian objections were of a principled nature and its attitude would not change .
but she added that eu relations with russia were " of a strategic nature and ... very stable . "
" we should in as far as possible try to come to the best diplomatic conclusions , " she said .
" we have strategic relations with russia that are capable of surviving differences of opinion because they are very stable . "
eu foreign ministers were locked in a crisis meeting in brussels monday to discuss the response to kosovo 's split from serbia on sunday amid signs of intense behind-the-scenes wrangling over recognition of the new state .
while some of the larger member states support the declaration , many others refuse to accept kosovo 's decision .
eu divisions exacerbated by separatist concerns the already difficult situation of presenting a united front on kosovo was made worse when spain announced that the socialist government will not give diplomatic recognition to the new state , and that spain 's conservative opposition had agreed with the government 's position .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain fears action by eta , the armed basque separatists spain fears that the serbian province 's declaration of independence could inspire its basque separatists to take a similar step .
these fears gained some credibility when it was revealed that the main opposition bosnian serb party had called for the independence of the serb-run half of bosnia monday , citing kosovo as a precedent .
" the serb democratic party -lsb- sds -rsb- is demanding republika srpska 's institutions provide -lsb- bosnian serbs -rsb- the same rights being given to kosovo albanians , " said the party , which was founded by war crimes fugitive radovan karadzic .
" we expect the -lsb- bosnian serb -rsb- government to meet previous promises and check the will of republika srpska citizens in a referendum , " the sds said in a statement .
since its 1992-1995 war , bosnia has consisted of two entities , the serb-run republika srpska -lsb- rs -rsb- and the muslim-croat federation , each with their own government , parliament and police force .
the sds was established in the early 1990s by karadzic , who remains at large around 12 years after the un war crimes tribunal charged him with genocide over the srebrenica massacre and siege of sarajevo .
bosnian serbs cite kosovo as precedent many bosnian serbs feel that their entity should follow kosovo 's lead and be allowed to secede from bosnia to be eventually attached to serbia , which they see as their motherland .
some local politicians have hinted that the rs could try such a move .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests in banja luka had xenophobic undertones meanwhile , up to 3,000 bosnian serbs gathered in banja luka to protest against kosovo 's independence .
" europe shame on you , world shame on you " and " hashim murderer " , the protestors chanted in a reference to kosovo prime minister hashim thaci .
they also chanted offensive slogans using derogatory terms for albanians .
the protest , organized by students , started with a minute 's silence , followed by another minute of hissing to voice disagreement with kosovo 's unilateral move .
banners in the crowd carried such slogans as " europe respect international law , " " kosovo = rs , " and " we do n't give up kosovo . "
" we are disappointed with the fate of -lsb- serbian -rsb- people in kosovo and we will continue to support them , " representative of students dejan kragulj told journalists .

" we should in as far as possible try to come to the best diplomatic conclusions , " she said .
" we have strategic relations with russia that are capable of surviving differences of opinion because they are very stable . "
eu foreign ministers were locked in a crisis meeting in brussels monday to discuss the response to kosovo 's split from serbia on sunday amid signs of intense behind-the-scenes wrangling over recognition of the new state .
while some of the larger member states support the declaration , many others refuse to accept kosovo 's decision .
eu divisions exacerbated by separatist concerns the already difficult situation of presenting a united front on kosovo was made worse when spain announced that the socialist government will not give diplomatic recognition to the new state , and that spain 's conservative opposition had agreed with the government 's position .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain fears action by eta , the armed basque separatists spain fears that the serbian province 's declaration of independence could inspire its basque separatists to take a similar step .
these fears gained some credibility when it was revealed that the main opposition bosnian serb party had called for the independence of the serb-run half of bosnia monday , citing kosovo as a precedent .
" the serb democratic party -lsb- sds -rsb- is demanding republika srpska 's institutions provide -lsb- bosnian serbs -rsb- the same rights being given to kosovo albanians , " said the party , which was founded by war crimes fugitive radovan karadzic .
" we expect the -lsb- bosnian serb -rsb- government to meet previous promises and check the will of republika srpska citizens in a referendum , " the sds said in a statement .
since its 1992-1995 war , bosnia has consisted of two entities , the serb-run republika srpska -lsb- rs -rsb- and the muslim-croat federation , each with their own government , parliament and police force .
the sds was established in the early 1990s by karadzic , who remains at large around 12 years after the un war crimes tribunal charged him with genocide over the srebrenica massacre and siege of sarajevo .
bosnian serbs cite kosovo as precedent many bosnian serbs feel that their entity should follow kosovo 's lead and be allowed to secede from bosnia to be eventually attached to serbia , which they see as their motherland .
some local politicians have hinted that the rs could try such a move .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests in banja luka had xenophobic undertones meanwhile , up to 3,000 bosnian serbs gathered in banja luka to protest against kosovo 's independence .
" europe shame on you , world shame on you " and " hashim murderer " , the protestors chanted in a reference to kosovo prime minister hashim thaci .
they also chanted offensive slogans using derogatory terms for albanians .
the protest , organized by students , started with a minute 's silence , followed by another minute of hissing to voice disagreement with kosovo 's unilateral move .
banners in the crowd carried such slogans as " europe respect international law , " " kosovo = rs , " and " we do n't give up kosovo . "
" we are disappointed with the fate of -lsb- serbian -rsb- people in kosovo and we will continue to support them , " representative of students dejan kragulj told journalists .
" it 's clear that republika srpska now has the right to secede from bosnia , " zeljko , a 23-year-old student , told reporters . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

board members in listed companies received anything from 40,000 to over seven million euros -lrb- $ 58,000 to over $ 10 million -rrb- . the release of the survey comes at a particularly sensitive time in germany .
a huge tax evasion scandal involving senior executives is currently unfolding , and concerns are growing about the gulf between the haves and the have-nots .
the kienbaum management consultancy firm said it had arrived at its results after questioning 4,300 executives at 1,300 companies .
top managers in dax-listed companies came out best in the survey with an average increase in earnings of 23.3 percent , while executive pay in privately owned firms climbed by 12.6 percent .
performance-related pay shot up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans feel the gulf between the poor and the wealthy is getting too wide most of the increase was accounted for in the form of bonuses , according to the study .
" this clear rise is due above all to the increase in the variable parts of their saleries indexed on their company results , while base salaries generally remained constant , " said kienbaum 's managing director alexander von preen .
among those surveyed , some 350 companies gave their board members more than 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 732,635 -rrb- , 128 of them rewarded them with over a million and 44 paid more than two million euros .
according to kienbaum , the number of staff and the state of a firm 's finances were the main factors determining pay levels .
on average , board chairmans received 50 percent more than other board members , but the difference in practice ranged from 10 to 300 percent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 18.02.2008 germany faces political dilemma in afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are uneasy about combat missions while experts say germany will likely increase its military involvement in afghanistan , the subject remains politically taboo .
the gap between german rhetoric and reality is likely to increase as elections near . the german army 's afghanistan mission is testing berlin 's long-held prohibition against involvement in foreign combat missions like never before .
yet germany 's resistance has more to do with politics than moral qualms , experts say . the german government has spent recent weeks insisting that it has no plans to significantly increase its involvement in afghanistan .
it stood firm even as nato allies , particularly the united states , pressured germany to increase involvement in fighting taliban forces in southern afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has a very strong pacificst movement with national elections scheduled for 2009 , elected officials are n't going to commit political suicide by proposing germany fight alongside nato allies in southern afghanistan , said thomas bauer of the center for applied policy research at the university of munich and an expert in german foreign affairs . " the moment this government decides to send in combat troops to the southern part of afghanistan , they will lose the next election , " bauer said . germany : a reluctant warrior the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , will try to win the next elections by portraying their coalition partners , chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , as pro-military .
to win votes , the left party will try to portray both the spd and cdu as warmongers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party will use afghanistan to score points with german pacifists " pushing this pacifist button " wins elections , bauer said . all of germany 's main political parties , with the exception of the left party , understand germany has a global responsibility which includes sending forces abroad and want to increase participation in nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
but they are afraid of voter backlash , experts say . germans remain deeply uneasy about taking part in military missions .
there 's the specter of world war ii and a long tradition of pacifism born during the cold war . this unease is shown by the limited scope parliament gave the bundeswehr in afghanistan .
the military can send a maximum of 3,500 soldiers to work out of the relatively peaceful north of the country where it is involved in rebuilding as well as peacekeeping and stabilization efforts . " it is important for nato to be seen as a community that implements its security strategy as a whole , " german defense minister franz-josef jung said recently , while insisting that germany will not participate in fighting in the south . increased involvement a tough sell bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some have questioned whether a political strategy exists in afghanistan the german public is overwhelmingly opposed to increasing the presence in afghanistan .
two out of every three say they want germany out of afghanistan as soon as possible . this has led to a certain amount of dishonesty in the political discourse surrounding afghanistan .
germany 's troop contribution to a quick reaction force is a perfect example of the divide between rhetoric and reality , said citha maass , the afghanistan expert at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs . germany agreed to send an additional 200 combat troops in july to take over for a norwegian contingent .
this force will be based in the north , but will assist allies in other regions .
these troops will have a combat component , maass said . " instead of discussing publically that you need some combat function , the government tries to hide it , " she said . on friday , feb .
15 , after denying press reports for days , the german government admitted it will discuss raising the number of troops in afghanistan when the parliamentary mandate comes up for renewal in the fall .
there 's also the possibility of changing the length of the mandate so that it does n't require renewal during election campaigning , according to press reports .
germany is , however , expected to stand firm on refusing to join fighting in the south . germany shirking its duties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has refused to join combat missions in southern afghanistan norine macdonald has spent most of the past three years doing field research in afghanistan as the president of the senlis council , a security and development think tank .
she said germany 's reluctance to get involved with fighting the taliban and al qaeda forces in southern afghanistan is outrageous and incomprehensible . german politicians lack the political will and the political skill to speak about the reality of the threat in afghanistan , macdonald said , something which she feels is " deeply irresponsible . " " germany is trying to create an alternate version of reality about afghanistan , " she said .
" unless you are going to go fight in the south , you are not part of the nato efforts to stabilize afghanistan . " unclear political goals in afghanistan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been focused on humanitarian aid the taliban and al qaeda forces control secondary roads in afghanistan 's south and are moving closer to kabul each month , . of nato members , only the united states , canada , the netherlands and great britain currently have troops are currently fighting in the south . there 's increasing worry among experts that the nato mission could fail to contain the taliban . part of the problem is that no one really knows what the ultimate goal is in afghanistan , said andreas heinemann-grüder , a senior researcher at the bonn-based bicc , an organization which focuses on peace building and conflict resolution issues . " the point is that they do n't know what they 're striving for , " heinemann-grüder said .
" what is ultimate goal for these combat missions ?
i do n't see any political strategy behind the military effort . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : canada has called on nato members to send more troops to southern afghanistan for many germans , the messier the situation in afghanistan gets , the more reason for germany to end its involvement .
but it should n't take a terrorist attack on german soil for the country to realize that isolation is not an option , said bauer of the center for applied policy research .
having the taliban destabilize afghanistan puts germany at risk , even if it seems intangible to many people . macdonald agreed , calling afghanistan germany 's " new back yard . " " the world has shrunk so much we know that what happens in southern afghanistan is happening on the border of every western country , " macdonald said . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 18.02.2008 germany faces political dilemma in afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are uneasy about combat missions while experts say germany will likely increase its military involvement in afghanistan , the subject remains politically taboo .
the gap between german rhetoric and reality is likely to increase as elections near . the german army 's afghanistan mission is testing berlin 's long-held prohibition against involvement in foreign combat missions like never before .
yet germany 's resistance has more to do with politics than moral qualms , experts say . the german government has spent recent weeks insisting that it has no plans to significantly increase its involvement in afghanistan .
it stood firm even as nato allies , particularly the united states , pressured germany to increase involvement in fighting taliban forces in southern afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has a very strong pacificst movement with national elections scheduled for 2009 , elected officials are n't going to commit political suicide by proposing germany fight alongside nato allies in southern afghanistan , said thomas bauer of the center for applied policy research at the university of munich and an expert in german foreign affairs . " the moment this government decides to send in combat troops to the southern part of afghanistan , they will lose the next election , " bauer said . germany : a reluctant warrior the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , will try to win the next elections by portraying their coalition partners , chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , as pro-military .
to win votes , the left party will try to portray both the spd and cdu as warmongers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party will use afghanistan to score points with german pacifists " pushing this pacifist button " wins elections , bauer said . all of germany 's main political parties , with the exception of the left party , understand germany has a global responsibility which includes sending forces abroad and want to increase participation in nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
but they are afraid of voter backlash , experts say . germans remain deeply uneasy about taking part in military missions .
there 's the specter of world war ii and a long tradition of pacifism born during the cold war . this unease is shown by the limited scope parliament gave the bundeswehr in afghanistan .
the military can send a maximum of 3,500 soldiers to work out of the relatively peaceful north of the country where it is involved in rebuilding as well as peacekeeping and stabilization efforts . " it is important for nato to be seen as a community that implements its security strategy as a whole , " german defense minister franz-josef jung said recently , while insisting that germany will not participate in fighting in the south . increased involvement a tough sell bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some have questioned whether a political strategy exists in afghanistan the german public is overwhelmingly opposed to increasing the presence in afghanistan .
two out of every three say they want germany out of afghanistan as soon as possible . this has led to a certain amount of dishonesty in the political discourse surrounding afghanistan .
germany 's troop contribution to a quick reaction force is a perfect example of the divide between rhetoric and reality , said citha maass , the afghanistan expert at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs . germany agreed to send an additional 200 combat troops in july to take over for a norwegian contingent .
this force will be based in the north , but will assist allies in other regions .
these troops will have a combat component , maass said . " instead of discussing publically that you need some combat function , the government tries to hide it , " she said . on friday , feb .
15 , after denying press reports for days , the german government admitted it will discuss raising the number of troops in afghanistan when the parliamentary mandate comes up for renewal in the fall .
there 's also the possibility of changing the length of the mandate so that it does n't require renewal during election campaigning , according to press reports .
germany is , however , expected to stand firm on refusing to join fighting in the south . germany shirking its duties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has refused to join combat missions in southern afghanistan norine macdonald has spent most of the past three years doing field research in afghanistan as the president of the senlis council , a security and development think tank .
she said germany 's reluctance to get involved with fighting the taliban and al qaeda forces in southern afghanistan is outrageous and incomprehensible . german politicians lack the political will and the political skill to speak about the reality of the threat in afghanistan , macdonald said , something which she feels is " deeply irresponsible . " " germany is trying to create an alternate version of reality about afghanistan , " she said .
" unless you are going to go fight in the south , you are not part of the nato efforts to stabilize afghanistan . " unclear political goals in afghanistan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been focused on humanitarian aid the taliban and al qaeda forces control secondary roads in afghanistan 's south and are moving closer to kabul each month , . of nato members , only the united states , canada , the netherlands and great britain currently have troops are currently fighting in the south . there 's increasing worry among experts that the nato mission could fail to contain the taliban . part of the problem is that no one really knows what the ultimate goal is in afghanistan , said andreas heinemann-grüder , a senior researcher at the bonn-based bicc , an organization which focuses on peace building and conflict resolution issues . " the point is that they do n't know what they 're striving for , " heinemann-grüder said .
" what is ultimate goal for these combat missions ?
i do n't see any political strategy behind the military effort . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : canada has called on nato members to send more troops to southern afghanistan for many germans , the messier the situation in afghanistan gets , the more reason for germany to end its involvement .
but it should n't take a terrorist attack on german soil for the country to realize that isolation is not an option , said bauer of the center for applied policy research .
having the taliban destabilize afghanistan puts germany at risk , even if it seems intangible to many people . macdonald agreed , calling afghanistan germany 's " new back yard . " " the world has shrunk so much we know that what happens in southern afghanistan is happening on the border of every western country , " macdonald said . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 18.02.2008 berlin film festival winner courts controversy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " tropa de elite " has divided viewers both at home , in brazil , and abroad brazilian director jose padilha won the berlin film festival 's top prize for his controversial movie , " tropa de elite " -lrb- " elite squad " -rrb- .
dw-world.de spoke to him about the film 's reception , brazil and on-screen violence . dw-world.de : you decided on a first-person narrator who tells the story off-camera .
it 's a means to make the viewer identify with the main character , a brutal police officer .
were you conscious of the possibility that the protagonist could also be understood as the hero ? jose padilha : the movie 's main character is n't seen that way at all .
some newspapers wrote that the brazilians had found a hero in captain nascimento and that that would mean the brazilian people were in favor of violence .
that 's not the case .
that 's a distortion of brazilian reality . narration in the first-person form is common in film .
indeed , it does create a relationship between the viewer and the character who 's telling the story .
the viewer sees the movie through the eyes of this character .
but i do n't see it as a problem to do that with a police officer in order to understand his point of view .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : padilha certainly got people talking in the same manner , i do n't have a problem with scorsese 's choice in " good fellas . "
the main character is a mafioso .
as the viewer , you 're on his side the whole time , and that certainly does n't mean that you think the mafia is good .
the viewer has the ability to keep fiction and reality separate .
many critics underestimate that , but i believe that the viewer is smart enough to understand what he sees . the depiction of the brazilian middle class in your film was very controversial in brazil - the same middle and upper class that place the entire blame for social problems on the governments , without bearing in mind that they exploit their domestic help .
is your movie the beginning of a consciousness in that respect ? urban violence in brazil is viewed as a private war between criminals and drug dealers .
the middle class thus counts itself out .
but it goes without saying that it 's involved .
it takes part in this war .
when a drug user buys his dope from an armed group that controls a poor neighborhood , he 's backing the drug dealer 's weapons .
the user is aware of it all .
he 's part of this societal process . the hypocrisy is enormous among the brazilian middle class .
many of the people who have money take advantage of police corruption .
someone from the middle class who 's committed an offense can bribe a police officer and wo n't even be arrested .
there 's complicity between this middle class and the current situation in brazil , which causes violence . bildunterschrift : padilha did not shy away from showing violence your movie is debated both in brazil as well as abroad .
there 's been serious criticism as well as much praise , but people are not neutral about it .
did you expect the film 's reception to be so contentious outside of brazil too ? it was clear that the discussion would come to berlin .
it was brought here by brazilian critics .
whether the polemic would have developed here , i ca n't say , maybe .
in any case , the discussion is interesting .
part of this debate developed because many people viewed interrelations with dated concepts .
the idea that one must observe a societal process from the right or the left is dead for me . my film sees reality through the metaphor of a game .
if you want to understand an individual 's behavior , you have to take into account that this person makes decisions according to the rules of a society .
that 's clear in the film .
what rules must a police officer from rio submit to ?
he earns $ 400 -lrb- 275 euros -rrb- a month , is poorly educated and must find his way within a completely corrupt structure .
and on top of that we want him to take a stand against heavily armed opponents in the favela -lsb- slums -rsb- in the name of the law .
he 's supposed to risk his life and for the long term . " tropa de elite " shows brazil as an unscrupulous country , whether in the callousness of the middle class or in the brutality of the police .
is there a way out of this situation ? the result of the game depends on the rules .
that means that if you change the rules , you can get a different result .
the players themselves determine these societal rules .
we can change a lot : the law that controls the drug trade , the police structures .
we can stop sending a violent police force into the slums , and instead we can build a school there .
one can change a lot .
my aim is to show that we have created this situation ourselves .
and so , we can change it to .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : padilha aimed to depict brazilian reality you worked together with one of the scriptwriters from " city of god . "
the two films have certain similarities : the unsteady camera , the editing and , to a certain extent , the soundtrack .
is there a new genre in brazilian film that favors violence packaged in a fast rhythm ? in those days , the prevailing opinion was that one could only make a critical film by using a distanced approach .
it was important not to involve the viewer emotionally .
that 's not been the case for ages .
in " city of god , " fernando meirelles saw precisely that .
i do n't need any slow sequences , which - referring to brecht - take the viewer out of the events and tell him : " now think about it . "
that 's not necessary . if i involve the viewer emotionally throughout the entire film , i create an even bigger debate in the end . i 'm not saying in any way that you should n't make slow films anymore .
for me , it 's about stressing that a movie that uses emotion to involve the viewer does n't need to preclude reason .
on the contrary , emotion brings reason into the film , much more so than a critical and distanced approach .
people may love or hate " tropa de elite , " but they are talking about the film .
that 's exactly what we wanted . interview : soraia vilela -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 18.02.2008 germany faces political dilemma in afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are uneasy about combat missions while experts say germany will likely increase its military involvement in afghanistan , the subject remains politically taboo .
the gap between german rhetoric and reality is likely to increase as elections near . the german army 's afghanistan mission is testing berlin 's long-held prohibition against involvement in foreign combat missions like never before .
yet germany 's resistance has more to do with politics than moral qualms , experts say . the german government has spent recent weeks insisting that it has no plans to significantly increase its involvement in afghanistan .
it stood firm even as nato allies , particularly the united states , pressured germany to increase involvement in fighting taliban forces in southern afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has a very strong pacificst movement with national elections scheduled for 2009 , elected officials are n't going to commit political suicide by proposing germany fight alongside nato allies in southern afghanistan , said thomas bauer of the center for applied policy research at the university of munich and an expert in german foreign affairs . " the moment this government decides to send in combat troops to the southern part of afghanistan , they will lose the next election , " bauer said . germany : a reluctant warrior the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , will try to win the next elections by portraying their coalition partners , chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , as pro-military .
to win votes , the left party will try to portray both the spd and cdu as warmongers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party will use afghanistan to score points with german pacifists " pushing this pacifist button " wins elections , bauer said . all of germany 's main political parties , with the exception of the left party , understand germany has a global responsibility which includes sending forces abroad and want to increase participation in nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
but they are afraid of voter backlash , experts say . germans remain deeply uneasy about taking part in military missions .
there 's the specter of world war ii and a long tradition of pacifism born during the cold war . this unease is shown by the limited scope parliament gave the bundeswehr in afghanistan .
the military can send a maximum of 3,500 soldiers to work out of the relatively peaceful north of the country where it is involved in rebuilding as well as peacekeeping and stabilization efforts . " it is important for nato to be seen as a community that implements its security strategy as a whole , " german defense minister franz-josef jung said recently , while insisting that germany will not participate in fighting in the south . increased involvement a tough sell bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some have questioned whether a political strategy exists in afghanistan the german public is overwhelmingly opposed to increasing the presence in afghanistan .
two out of every three say they want germany out of afghanistan as soon as possible . this has led to a certain amount of dishonesty in the political discourse surrounding afghanistan .
germany 's troop contribution to a quick reaction force is a perfect example of the divide between rhetoric and reality , said citha maass , the afghanistan expert at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs . germany agreed to send an additional 200 combat troops in july to take over for a norwegian contingent .
this force will be based in the north , but will assist allies in other regions .
these troops will have a combat component , maass said . " instead of discussing publically that you need some combat function , the government tries to hide it , " she said . on friday , feb .
15 , after denying press reports for days , the german government admitted it will discuss raising the number of troops in afghanistan when the parliamentary mandate comes up for renewal in the fall .
there 's also the possibility of changing the length of the mandate so that it does n't require renewal during election campaigning , according to press reports .
germany is , however , expected to stand firm on refusing to join fighting in the south . germany shirking its duties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has refused to join combat missions in southern afghanistan norine macdonald has spent most of the past three years doing field research in afghanistan as the president of the senlis council , a security and development think tank .
she said germany 's reluctance to get involved with fighting the taliban and al qaeda forces in southern afghanistan is outrageous and incomprehensible . german politicians lack the political will and the political skill to speak about the reality of the threat in afghanistan , macdonald said , something which she feels is " deeply irresponsible . " " germany is trying to create an alternate version of reality about afghanistan , " she said .
" unless you are going to go fight in the south , you are not part of the nato efforts to stabilize afghanistan . " unclear political goals in afghanistan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been focused on humanitarian aid the taliban and al qaeda forces control secondary roads in afghanistan 's south and are moving closer to kabul each month , . of nato members , only the united states , canada , the netherlands and great britain currently have troops are currently fighting in the south . there 's increasing worry among experts that the nato mission could fail to contain the taliban . part of the problem is that no one really knows what the ultimate goal is in afghanistan , said andreas heinemann-grüder , a senior researcher at the bonn-based bicc , an organization which focuses on peace building and conflict resolution issues . " the point is that they do n't know what they 're striving for , " heinemann-grüder said .
" what is ultimate goal for these combat missions ?

the concert brought both applause and protests . heesters is a controversial figure in the netherlands because of his cozy relationship with the nazi occupiers .
security was tight at the de flint theater in heester 's hometown of amersfoort , where he put on a concert for the first time since 1963 on saturday , feb .
16 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors equate the singer with fascism police said several dozen protesters as well as a few neo-nazis showed up outside the concert hall , but the performance went on undisturbed .
the last time heesters tried to peform in the netherlands , he was booed off the stage by the audience , who stood up and gave nazi salutes .
heesters was born in amersfoort , a town 50 kilometers -lrb- 35 miles -rrb- east of amsterdam in 1903 .
yet he made his fortune in germany .
the artist is revered by generations of germans for his operettas and film performances .
one of hitler 's " divinely gifted " artists heesters has been a popular german-language singer since the 1930s , becoming a favorite of the nazis and one of the " divinely gifted " artists who took part in performances to boost the morale of soldiers during the war .
heesters claims he did not know what was happening to jews during the war despite visiting the dachau concentration camp in 1941 .
" honestly , i was too busy working , " heesters said in an interview after a tv gala celebrating his 100th birthday in 2003 .
" i could n't do anything about politics . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heesters is considered a musical legend in germany while germans have taken heesters at his word and continue to watch his old films such as " always you " and " illusion , " many of his dutch countrymen have never forgiven him for his acceptance of the nazi regime during world war ii .
after the nazi defeat , heesters continued his career in germany , settling in bavaria .
heesters is considered to be the oldest living performer .
at the concert saturday , heesters performed hits such as " the merry widow " and " there by the windmill " despite breaking several ribs on jan .

dw-world.de spoke to him about the film 's reception , brazil and on-screen violence . dw-world.de : you decided on a first-person narrator who tells the story off-camera .
it 's a means to make the viewer identify with the main character , a brutal police officer .
were you conscious of the possibility that the protagonist could also be understood as the hero ? jose padilha : the movie 's main character is n't seen that way at all .
some newspapers wrote that the brazilians had found a hero in captain nascimento and that that would mean the brazilian people were in favor of violence .
that 's not the case .
that 's a distortion of brazilian reality . narration in the first-person form is common in film .
indeed , it does create a relationship between the viewer and the character who 's telling the story .
the viewer sees the movie through the eyes of this character .
but i do n't see it as a problem to do that with a police officer in order to understand his point of view .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : padilha certainly got people talking in the same manner , i do n't have a problem with scorsese 's choice in " good fellas . "
the main character is a mafioso .
as the viewer , you 're on his side the whole time , and that certainly does n't mean that you think the mafia is good .
the viewer has the ability to keep fiction and reality separate .
many critics underestimate that , but i believe that the viewer is smart enough to understand what he sees . the depiction of the brazilian middle class in your film was very controversial in brazil - the same middle and upper class that place the entire blame for social problems on the governments , without bearing in mind that they exploit their domestic help .
is your movie the beginning of a consciousness in that respect ? urban violence in brazil is viewed as a private war between criminals and drug dealers .
the middle class thus counts itself out .
but it goes without saying that it 's involved .
it takes part in this war .

there 's been serious criticism as well as much praise , but people are not neutral about it .
did you expect the film 's reception to be so contentious outside of brazil too ? it was clear that the discussion would come to berlin .
it was brought here by brazilian critics .
whether the polemic would have developed here , i ca n't say , maybe .
in any case , the discussion is interesting .
part of this debate developed because many people viewed interrelations with dated concepts .
the idea that one must observe a societal process from the right or the left is dead for me . my film sees reality through the metaphor of a game .
if you want to understand an individual 's behavior , you have to take into account that this person makes decisions according to the rules of a society .
that 's clear in the film .
what rules must a police officer from rio submit to ?
he earns $ 400 -lrb- 275 euros -rrb- a month , is poorly educated and must find his way within a completely corrupt structure .
and on top of that we want him to take a stand against heavily armed opponents in the favela -lsb- slums -rsb- in the name of the law .
he 's supposed to risk his life and for the long term . " tropa de elite " shows brazil as an unscrupulous country , whether in the callousness of the middle class or in the brutality of the police .
is there a way out of this situation ? the result of the game depends on the rules .
that means that if you change the rules , you can get a different result .
the players themselves determine these societal rules .
we can change a lot : the law that controls the drug trade , the police structures .
we can stop sending a violent police force into the slums , and instead we can build a school there .

for me , it 's about stressing that a movie that uses emotion to involve the viewer does n't need to preclude reason .
on the contrary , emotion brings reason into the film , much more so than a critical and distanced approach .

18 , it was the differences of their clean-up operations which summed up the feelings not only of their country folk but those of the international community at large . in kosovo 's capital , the detritus of celebration littered the streets as the sun rose on the country 's first full day of self-declared independence from serbia .
tens of thousands of people celebrated long into the night in central pristina on sunday in recognition of the kosovo parliament 's formal vote to break from serbia , a move that completed the conflict-strewn breakup of the former yugoslavia . however , as the first rays of light settled on belgrade , the night 's events in the serbian capital told a different story . the rubble , broken glass and spent tear gas canisters spoke volumes about the serbian response : riots in protest against kosovo 's declaration had swept through the streets for several hours , with the wrath of the crowd focused on the symbols of those they perceived as helping tear serbian 's heartland province away .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the streets of belgrade erupted in violence riot police battled hundreds of youths with batons after the baying mob had smashed two mcdonald 's restaurants and attacked the us and slovenian embassies with stones .
hospital officials said at least 50 people , including 20 policemen , were injured during the rioting , but none seriously . earlier , in the south of serbia , members of the kosovo police service stopped several hundred former serbian army reservists dressed in military uniforms from crossing into the province ahead of the declaration . international reactions reflect divide away from the streets , the international community soon began positioning itself in the two camps of " for " and " against . "
the trickle of responses began early , with those opposing the move striking quickly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia 's reaction would be peaceful but forceful said tadic serbia 's president boris tadic attempted to calm fears of escalating violence by speaking diplomatically , but the message was clear : serbia would not recognize this new kosovo and would work to stop its independence in its tracks .
" serbia has reacted and will react with all peaceful , diplomatic and legal means to annul this act committed by kosovo 's institutions , " he said . serbia 's main ally , russia , soon threw its considerable weight behind tadic 's message by calling a special meeting of the united nations security council to discuss the issue late sunday , but failed to secure backing for its call to declare kosovo 's declaration " null and void . " china expressed concern about the effects kosovo 's declaration would have on peace in the balkans , urging the two governments to work out their problems through dialogue .
" kosovo 's unilateral act can produce a series of results that will lead to seriously negative influence on peace and stability in the balkan region and on the realization of building a multiethnic society in kosovo , which china is deeply concerned about , " foreign affairs ministry spokesman liu jianchao said . " china calls on the two sides of serbia and kosovo to continue to seek a proper solution through negotiation within the framework of international law , and the international community should create favorable conditions for this , " he added . concerns over wave of separatist declarations sri lanka , a country with its own problems with separatism , said it was concerned about kosovo 's unilateral declaration of independence , as it could set a precedent in other parts of the world and hurt nations . " the unilateral declaration of independence by kosovo could set an unmanageable precedent in the conduct of international relations , the established global order of sovereign states and could thus pose a grave threat to international peace and security , " the foreign ministry said in a statement .
" this action by kosovo is a violation of the charter of the united nations , which enshrines the sovereignty and territorial integrity of member states . " sri lankan forces have been fighting a 25-year insurgency by tamil separatists , who want an independent homeland in the east and north of the island . new zealand 's prime minister helen clark announced that her country would not recognize an independent kosovo , saying it was never the government 's position to offer diplomatic recognition in such circumstances .
" we neither recognize nor not recognize , " she said .
" we are not intending to make a formal statement . " supporters say stability comes from recognition bildunterschrift : kosovo thanks its supporters but not everyone is in favor australia led the early calls of support for independent kosovo , with prime minister kevin rudd announcing that australia would recognize the new state .
" the sorry history of kosovo means that we 've got to do whatever we can do to ensure the citizens of that part of the world are protected into the future , " rudd said .
" this would appear to be the right course of action .
that 's why diplomatically we would extend diplomatic recognition at the earliest opportunity . " taiwan 's independence-leaning government echoed australia 's stance .
" self-determination is a right recognized by the united nations , and it is the people who are masters of their nation 's future , " the foreign ministry said in a statement .
" in no way should the independence of one nation be denied by another . " taiwan is a member of the international community that cherishes democracy and freedom , and the government is delighted that the people of kosovo have the fruits of independence , democracy and freedom to look forward to , " it said . western powers biding their time the united states and the european union were to make formal statements later in the day , but were both expected to recognize the new kosovo , despite a split over independence in the eu .
britain , france , germany and italy are expected to officially give recognition , but greece , cyprus , romania , slovakia , spain and bulgaria have all expressed their opposition .
slovenia 's foreign minister dimitrij rupel , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , told reporters that he understood that " many eu member states " would recognize kosovo 's independence . " recognition is not a matter for the eu as a whole - it 's member states who will decide , " rupel said said as he arrived for a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels , adding that there was likely to be " a lively discussion . "
" i can not tell you what we shall conclude at the end , but certainly i expect that we shall continue with this tradition of unity that we have established " with the creation of a new eu justice mission to kosovo , rupel said . german chancellor angela merkel said that germany would not make a decision on the recognition of kosovo yet , as the main priority was for the european union to act together on kosovo . " germany will not take a decision -lsb- on the recognition of kosovo -rsb- today , " merkel told germany 's foreign press association -lrb- vap -rrb- .

but real peace in the balkans is still in the distant future , says dw 's verica spasovska . " calm and moderation " was berlin 's first cautious reaction .
for good reason , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier is calling on all involved parties in the region to keep a sober mind .
the cries of joy in pristina can not hide the fact that kosovo 's independence is n't solving all the problems of the balkans .
in reality , they 've only just begun . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verica spasovska first off , the high-flying expectations of many a citizen of kosovo that independence will automatically bring masses of foreign investors to the country will not be fulfilled that quickly .
on the contrary , a possible economic embargo by the serbian government - cutting off electricity , food and water supplies , internet and telephone connections - could make daily life harder for people in kosovo .
without generous eu support , the country will not be able to free itself from years of economic agony .
considering previous foreign aid worth billions , expectations should n't be too high that the money will lead to a rapid economic upswing . but the question whether the international community will manage to erect a truly democratic state that can integrate all its citizens is far more complicated than the economic situation .
it 's certainly possible that the 120,000 serbs in kosovo - backed by belgrade - will refuse to cooperate with the government in pristina and build parallel structures .
in the worst case , a similar situation to the " frozen conflict " in northern cyprus could develop in the long term . pristina 's declaration of independence is a tough test for the fragile coalition in belgrade .
national-conservative premier kostunica has already announced that he will reject all agreements that bring serbia closer to the eu in case of the recognition of kosovo by eu states .
president tadic meanwhile does not want to give up his pro-european stance .
at the same time , the serbian radical party is strengthening its position as the strongest fraction in parliament .
the municipal elections in may will - at the latest - force serbia to once more decide whether it wants to choose a path towards the eu or russia . the controversial step towards independence also adds oil to the fire in neighboring republics , such as the serbian entity in bosnia .
bosnians serbs are unlikely to call for independence and accession to serbia - there 's too much international pressure .
but citing kosovo , they 'll continue to test to what extent they can block the central government in sarajevo . bosnia , which has been under international control for more than a decade , also shows quite clearly the limits of " controlled independence . "
some are already beginning to ask how long kosovo albanians will put up with the semi-protectorate dictated by the eu .
the presence of 16,000 nato soldiers , who are meant to be able to prevent major unrest , brings some comfort in that respect . eu member states , a large majority of which will recognize kosovo diplomatically , know that the balkan peace process will remain a mammoth task .
the only way out of the dilemma may be a future in which national borders play a subordinate role .
only when kosovo and serbia are eu members , will the balkan find long-term peace .
it 's still a long way to go . verica spasovska heads dw-radio 's central and south-eastern european programs . -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke to balkans expert stefan wolff about what kosovo and the world can expect in the near future . stefan wolff is a professor of political science and director of the centre for international crisis management and conflict resolution at nottingham university in the uk .
he has extensive expertise in northern ireland , the balkans and central and eastern europe , and has also worked on a wide range of other conflicts elsewhere , including the middle east , africa , and central , south and southeast asia . dw-world.de : is kosovo prepared for independence in terms of infrastructure , governance , security and stability ? stefan wolff : kosovo has most of the important institutions of statehood and democratic governance in place , but at the same time these institutions will require continued international support for some time .
this is accepted by both the kosovars and the west and is the background against which we need to understand the eu mission for kosovo - as external assistance to consolidate existing institutional structures to enable kosovars to take care of developing their economy , infrastructure and ensure security and stability . the decision to declare independence is not a unanimous one within the population .
what minorities in kosovo have most to lose from this independence ? in principle , all minorities and the majority albanian population can gain from the clarification of kosovo 's international status , not least in the sense that they will all benefit from economic development .
prime minister thaci made some very important gestures yesterday towards reconciliation with serbs in kosovo .
the arthisaari plan offers important mechanisms to serbs to preserve and develop their identity , gives them opportunities to play a meaningful part in the political process in kosovo and retain ties with serbia .
from this perspective , there is no need for conflict between the two main population groups , but that does not mean that extremists on either side will refrain from violence and provocations .
so far , this risk has been contained , but not eliminated . what can we expect in terms of reaction and action from kosovo 's balkan neighbors ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few of the region 's conflicts are fully resolved the balkan region as a whole remains quite vulnerable to the threat of ethnic conflict .
we must bear in mind that few , if any , of the conflicts that led to bloodshed throughout the 1990s have really been resolved .
we have institutions in place now that help manage these conflicts politically , but tensions in bosnia and macedonia , for example , remain .
apart from albania and slovenia , i do n't think that any of the other balkan countries will find it a very easy decision to recognize kosovo .
eventually , however , macedonia , bosnia , croatia and montenegro will recognize the independence of kosovo , but this will not be a process free from domestic debate .
how will kosovo 's independence affect the wider balkan region ?
because of the close links between kosovo and two other major previous secessionist conflicts - bosnia , the serbs , and macedonia , the albanians - there is a danger that violence in and around kosovo could spread and create instability across the balkans .
there also remains an open question in relation to the future of albanians in southern serbia .
the overall hope , of course , remains that with kosovo 's independence the last major unresolved issue has been tackled and that the region as a whole can now move forward to closer integration with the eu .
while this will not be easy over the coming months , eventually a sense of reality will set in , and people will realize that this is there only real hope for the future .
serbia has vowed not to recognize an independent kosovo and has spoken of economic and diplomatic sanctions .
what can we expect from serbia in the coming days ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riots broke out in belgrade after kosovo 's declaration there are already signs of serbia backing down from the quite exaggerated threats of cutting diplomatic ties with any country recognizing kosovo .
this is simply not feasible for serbia , especially as the population there still has clear aspirations of eu membership and very strong economic interests both in the eu and the neighboring region .
we will , however , see further declarations and statements against kosovo 's independence and against its recognition by other states .
together with russia , serbia is most likely to try and mobilize the un against kosovo 's unilateral declaration of independence , and membership in the un and other international organizations will be very difficult to obtain for kosovo because of serbian resistance .
while the likelihood of a military conflict is close to zero , there remains a threat of localized violence in and around kosovo , but serious escalation is in nobody 's interest .
moreover , serbia has to think carefully about how to manage its relations with serbs in kosovo .
the arthisaari plan offers many important opportunities to do so , opportunities that kosovo albanians are ready to accept .
discouraging kosovo serb political participation in pristina will not be in the interests of serbs living there , and might further encourage them to leave rather than to stay .
what action do you expect to be taken by the international community in the coming days ?
we will gradually see recognition of kosovo as an independent state from major countries in the eu and the west more generally .
we should also expect support from the arab league and member countries of the organization of the islamic conference .
nato will have to be very alert towards any risk of violence in kosovo , not least in order to assure serbs that they can remain in kosovo and participate in building a democratic state .
russian opposition , on the other hand , also remains a clear fact , and russia will use its membership in the un , and possibly the osce and council of europe , to mobilize against kosovo 's independence .
this , in turn , could have a further negative impact on relations between russia and the west as a whole , again not something in either russia 's or the west 's interests .
is kosovo becoming a pawn in the current power games between the west and russia ?
if so , how will an independent kosovo affect relations ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia , serbia 's ally , remains in opposition to the west kosovo has , for some time , been one among several pawns in these power games .
now that independence has been declared , the issue has come to a head , but at the same time kosovo will gradually become less of an issue , precisely because a decision has been made .
russia may choose not to recognize it and bring it up before the security council and elsewhere , but it was in particular kosovo 's unresolved status that gave russia a certain degree of leverage .
in the long term , i think interest in kosovo will fade , especially if the transition to independence is smooth , no major violence occurs , and kosovo quickly gains recognition from a large number of countries beyond the core western powers .
what will the newly independent kosovo 's view be towards the european union and the west ?
kosovo albanians remain the most pro-european and pro-atlanticist of all the balkan people .
the challenge for prime minister thaci and president sejdiu will be to prepare kosovo politically , economically and socially for closer links with the eu and to overcome resistance within the eu from countries like cyprus , greece , romania , slovakia and spain who fear that kosovo sets an unwelcome precedent for secessionist threats that they themselves perceive .
from that perspective , kosovo and its supporters in the eu have a unique responsibility and opportunity to demonstrate that kosovo can develop into a full european , democratic state and that its independence does not lead to the instability and insecurity feared by some .
not all eu countries are in favor of an independent kosovo - how is the declaration likely to affect relations within the european bloc when the official eu line will be one of overall support ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some eu nations , like germany , will recognize kosovo some countries have expressed concern and reservations , primarily because of their own domestic situation .
on the other hand , none of them can have a real interest in risking the eu 's ability to act swiftly and decisively over the kosovo issue .
this is not least the case because , apart from the eu in cooperation with nato , there really is no other international actor willing and able to manage kosovo 's transition to independence .
thus , my hope is that despite some countries ' reluctance to recognize kosovo , none of them will be foolish enough to sabotage the eu 's efforts to maintain stability in kosovo and the wider region and enable the region to forge ever closer ties with the bloc as a whole .
what are the best and worst scenarios arising from this declaration of independence : for kosovo , for the balkans , for the eu and for the relationship between east and west ?
the worst-case scenario would be one of wide-spread violence in kosovo , triggering instability in macedonia and bosnia and an eu and nato unable to manage these threats .
also , a prolonged delay in sufficient levels of international recognition of kosovo leading to insufficient economic recovery there , and continuing strains between serbs and albanians in kosovo are unlikely to be helpful to demonstrate that kosovo as an independent state can succeed politically , economically and socially without destabilizing its neighborhood .
the more negative local developments , the more likely also is it that relations between east and west will remain difficult and impact on other major challenges in the international arena - from the middle east conflict , to nuclear proliferation in iran and north korea , to continuing bloodshed in africa .
as a best-case scenario , kosovo will remain stable , its development will take off , serbs will gradually begin to participate in the political process , the balkans will become more integrated into the eu , and the current level of international tensions over kosovo will quickly die down .
this is a tall order , and one would have to be very optimistic to see any , let alone all of this , happen very soon , but neither is there any reason to see the future as bleak as the worst-case scenario . interview : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

top managers in dax-listed companies came out best in the survey with an average increase in earnings of 23.3 percent , while executive pay in privately owned firms climbed by 12.6 percent .
performance-related pay shot up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans feel the gulf between the poor and the wealthy is getting too wide most of the increase was accounted for in the form of bonuses , according to the study .
" this clear rise is due above all to the increase in the variable parts of their saleries indexed on their company results , while base salaries generally remained constant , " said kienbaum 's managing director alexander von preen .
among those surveyed , some 350 companies gave their board members more than 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 732,635 -rrb- , 128 of them rewarded them with over a million and 44 paid more than two million euros .
according to kienbaum , the number of staff and the state of a firm 's finances were the main factors determining pay levels .
on average , board chairmans received 50 percent more than other board members , but the difference in practice ranged from 10 to 300 percent .

dw-world.de spoke to balkans expert stefan wolff about what kosovo and the world can expect in the near future . stefan wolff is a professor of political science and director of the centre for international crisis management and conflict resolution at nottingham university in the uk .
he has extensive expertise in northern ireland , the balkans and central and eastern europe , and has also worked on a wide range of other conflicts elsewhere , including the middle east , africa , and central , south and southeast asia . dw-world.de : is kosovo prepared for independence in terms of infrastructure , governance , security and stability ? stefan wolff : kosovo has most of the important institutions of statehood and democratic governance in place , but at the same time these institutions will require continued international support for some time .
this is accepted by both the kosovars and the west and is the background against which we need to understand the eu mission for kosovo - as external assistance to consolidate existing institutional structures to enable kosovars to take care of developing their economy , infrastructure and ensure security and stability . the decision to declare independence is not a unanimous one within the population .
what minorities in kosovo have most to lose from this independence ? in principle , all minorities and the majority albanian population can gain from the clarification of kosovo 's international status , not least in the sense that they will all benefit from economic development .
prime minister thaci made some very important gestures yesterday towards reconciliation with serbs in kosovo .
the arthisaari plan offers important mechanisms to serbs to preserve and develop their identity , gives them opportunities to play a meaningful part in the political process in kosovo and retain ties with serbia .
from this perspective , there is no need for conflict between the two main population groups , but that does not mean that extremists on either side will refrain from violence and provocations .
so far , this risk has been contained , but not eliminated . what can we expect in terms of reaction and action from kosovo 's balkan neighbors ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few of the region 's conflicts are fully resolved the balkan region as a whole remains quite vulnerable to the threat of ethnic conflict .
we must bear in mind that few , if any , of the conflicts that led to bloodshed throughout the 1990s have really been resolved .
we have institutions in place now that help manage these conflicts politically , but tensions in bosnia and macedonia , for example , remain .
apart from albania and slovenia , i do n't think that any of the other balkan countries will find it a very easy decision to recognize kosovo .
eventually , however , macedonia , bosnia , croatia and montenegro will recognize the independence of kosovo , but this will not be a process free from domestic debate .
how will kosovo 's independence affect the wider balkan region ?
because of the close links between kosovo and two other major previous secessionist conflicts - bosnia , the serbs , and macedonia , the albanians - there is a danger that violence in and around kosovo could spread and create instability across the balkans .
there also remains an open question in relation to the future of albanians in southern serbia .
the overall hope , of course , remains that with kosovo 's independence the last major unresolved issue has been tackled and that the region as a whole can now move forward to closer integration with the eu .
while this will not be easy over the coming months , eventually a sense of reality will set in , and people will realize that this is there only real hope for the future .
serbia has vowed not to recognize an independent kosovo and has spoken of economic and diplomatic sanctions .
what can we expect from serbia in the coming days ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riots broke out in belgrade after kosovo 's declaration there are already signs of serbia backing down from the quite exaggerated threats of cutting diplomatic ties with any country recognizing kosovo .
this is simply not feasible for serbia , especially as the population there still has clear aspirations of eu membership and very strong economic interests both in the eu and the neighboring region .
we will , however , see further declarations and statements against kosovo 's independence and against its recognition by other states .
together with russia , serbia is most likely to try and mobilize the un against kosovo 's unilateral declaration of independence , and membership in the un and other international organizations will be very difficult to obtain for kosovo because of serbian resistance .
while the likelihood of a military conflict is close to zero , there remains a threat of localized violence in and around kosovo , but serious escalation is in nobody 's interest .
moreover , serbia has to think carefully about how to manage its relations with serbs in kosovo .
the arthisaari plan offers many important opportunities to do so , opportunities that kosovo albanians are ready to accept .
discouraging kosovo serb political participation in pristina will not be in the interests of serbs living there , and might further encourage them to leave rather than to stay .
what action do you expect to be taken by the international community in the coming days ?
we will gradually see recognition of kosovo as an independent state from major countries in the eu and the west more generally .
we should also expect support from the arab league and member countries of the organization of the islamic conference .
nato will have to be very alert towards any risk of violence in kosovo , not least in order to assure serbs that they can remain in kosovo and participate in building a democratic state .
russian opposition , on the other hand , also remains a clear fact , and russia will use its membership in the un , and possibly the osce and council of europe , to mobilize against kosovo 's independence .
this , in turn , could have a further negative impact on relations between russia and the west as a whole , again not something in either russia 's or the west 's interests .
is kosovo becoming a pawn in the current power games between the west and russia ?
if so , how will an independent kosovo affect relations ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia , serbia 's ally , remains in opposition to the west kosovo has , for some time , been one among several pawns in these power games .
now that independence has been declared , the issue has come to a head , but at the same time kosovo will gradually become less of an issue , precisely because a decision has been made .
russia may choose not to recognize it and bring it up before the security council and elsewhere , but it was in particular kosovo 's unresolved status that gave russia a certain degree of leverage .
in the long term , i think interest in kosovo will fade , especially if the transition to independence is smooth , no major violence occurs , and kosovo quickly gains recognition from a large number of countries beyond the core western powers .
what will the newly independent kosovo 's view be towards the european union and the west ?
kosovo albanians remain the most pro-european and pro-atlanticist of all the balkan people .
the challenge for prime minister thaci and president sejdiu will be to prepare kosovo politically , economically and socially for closer links with the eu and to overcome resistance within the eu from countries like cyprus , greece , romania , slovakia and spain who fear that kosovo sets an unwelcome precedent for secessionist threats that they themselves perceive .
from that perspective , kosovo and its supporters in the eu have a unique responsibility and opportunity to demonstrate that kosovo can develop into a full european , democratic state and that its independence does not lead to the instability and insecurity feared by some .
not all eu countries are in favor of an independent kosovo - how is the declaration likely to affect relations within the european bloc when the official eu line will be one of overall support ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some eu nations , like germany , will recognize kosovo some countries have expressed concern and reservations , primarily because of their own domestic situation .
on the other hand , none of them can have a real interest in risking the eu 's ability to act swiftly and decisively over the kosovo issue .
this is not least the case because , apart from the eu in cooperation with nato , there really is no other international actor willing and able to manage kosovo 's transition to independence .
thus , my hope is that despite some countries ' reluctance to recognize kosovo , none of them will be foolish enough to sabotage the eu 's efforts to maintain stability in kosovo and the wider region and enable the region to forge ever closer ties with the bloc as a whole .
what are the best and worst scenarios arising from this declaration of independence : for kosovo , for the balkans , for the eu and for the relationship between east and west ?
the worst-case scenario would be one of wide-spread violence in kosovo , triggering instability in macedonia and bosnia and an eu and nato unable to manage these threats .
also , a prolonged delay in sufficient levels of international recognition of kosovo leading to insufficient economic recovery there , and continuing strains between serbs and albanians in kosovo are unlikely to be helpful to demonstrate that kosovo as an independent state can succeed politically , economically and socially without destabilizing its neighborhood .
the more negative local developments , the more likely also is it that relations between east and west will remain difficult and impact on other major challenges in the international arena - from the middle east conflict , to nuclear proliferation in iran and north korea , to continuing bloodshed in africa .
as a best-case scenario , kosovo will remain stable , its development will take off , serbs will gradually begin to participate in the political process , the balkans will become more integrated into the eu , and the current level of international tensions over kosovo will quickly die down .
this is a tall order , and one would have to be very optimistic to see any , let alone all of this , happen very soon , but neither is there any reason to see the future as bleak as the worst-case scenario . interview : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

also , a prolonged delay in sufficient levels of international recognition of kosovo leading to insufficient economic recovery there , and continuing strains between serbs and albanians in kosovo are unlikely to be helpful to demonstrate that kosovo as an independent state can succeed politically , economically and socially without destabilizing its neighborhood .
the more negative local developments , the more likely also is it that relations between east and west will remain difficult and impact on other major challenges in the international arena - from the middle east conflict , to nuclear proliferation in iran and north korea , to continuing bloodshed in africa .
as a best-case scenario , kosovo will remain stable , its development will take off , serbs will gradually begin to participate in the political process , the balkans will become more integrated into the eu , and the current level of international tensions over kosovo will quickly die down .
this is a tall order , and one would have to be very optimistic to see any , let alone all of this , happen very soon , but neither is there any reason to see the future as bleak as the worst-case scenario . interview : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke to balkans expert stefan wolff about what kosovo and the world can expect in the near future . stefan wolff is a professor of political science and director of the centre for international crisis management and conflict resolution at nottingham university in the uk .
he has extensive expertise in northern ireland , the balkans and central and eastern europe , and has also worked on a wide range of other conflicts elsewhere , including the middle east , africa , and central , south and southeast asia . dw-world.de : is kosovo prepared for independence in terms of infrastructure , governance , security and stability ? stefan wolff : kosovo has most of the important institutions of statehood and democratic governance in place , but at the same time these institutions will require continued international support for some time .
this is accepted by both the kosovars and the west and is the background against which we need to understand the eu mission for kosovo - as external assistance to consolidate existing institutional structures to enable kosovars to take care of developing their economy , infrastructure and ensure security and stability . the decision to declare independence is not a unanimous one within the population .
what minorities in kosovo have most to lose from this independence ? in principle , all minorities and the majority albanian population can gain from the clarification of kosovo 's international status , not least in the sense that they will all benefit from economic development .
prime minister thaci made some very important gestures yesterday towards reconciliation with serbs in kosovo .
the arthisaari plan offers important mechanisms to serbs to preserve and develop their identity , gives them opportunities to play a meaningful part in the political process in kosovo and retain ties with serbia .
from this perspective , there is no need for conflict between the two main population groups , but that does not mean that extremists on either side will refrain from violence and provocations .
so far , this risk has been contained , but not eliminated . what can we expect in terms of reaction and action from kosovo 's balkan neighbors ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few of the region 's conflicts are fully resolved the balkan region as a whole remains quite vulnerable to the threat of ethnic conflict .
we must bear in mind that few , if any , of the conflicts that led to bloodshed throughout the 1990s have really been resolved .
we have institutions in place now that help manage these conflicts politically , but tensions in bosnia and macedonia , for example , remain .
apart from albania and slovenia , i do n't think that any of the other balkan countries will find it a very easy decision to recognize kosovo .
eventually , however , macedonia , bosnia , croatia and montenegro will recognize the independence of kosovo , but this will not be a process free from domestic debate .
how will kosovo 's independence affect the wider balkan region ?
because of the close links between kosovo and two other major previous secessionist conflicts - bosnia , the serbs , and macedonia , the albanians - there is a danger that violence in and around kosovo could spread and create instability across the balkans .
there also remains an open question in relation to the future of albanians in southern serbia .
the overall hope , of course , remains that with kosovo 's independence the last major unresolved issue has been tackled and that the region as a whole can now move forward to closer integration with the eu .
while this will not be easy over the coming months , eventually a sense of reality will set in , and people will realize that this is there only real hope for the future .
serbia has vowed not to recognize an independent kosovo and has spoken of economic and diplomatic sanctions .
what can we expect from serbia in the coming days ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riots broke out in belgrade after kosovo 's declaration there are already signs of serbia backing down from the quite exaggerated threats of cutting diplomatic ties with any country recognizing kosovo .
this is simply not feasible for serbia , especially as the population there still has clear aspirations of eu membership and very strong economic interests both in the eu and the neighboring region .
we will , however , see further declarations and statements against kosovo 's independence and against its recognition by other states .
together with russia , serbia is most likely to try and mobilize the un against kosovo 's unilateral declaration of independence , and membership in the un and other international organizations will be very difficult to obtain for kosovo because of serbian resistance .
while the likelihood of a military conflict is close to zero , there remains a threat of localized violence in and around kosovo , but serious escalation is in nobody 's interest .
moreover , serbia has to think carefully about how to manage its relations with serbs in kosovo .
the arthisaari plan offers many important opportunities to do so , opportunities that kosovo albanians are ready to accept .
discouraging kosovo serb political participation in pristina will not be in the interests of serbs living there , and might further encourage them to leave rather than to stay .
what action do you expect to be taken by the international community in the coming days ?
we will gradually see recognition of kosovo as an independent state from major countries in the eu and the west more generally .
we should also expect support from the arab league and member countries of the organization of the islamic conference .
nato will have to be very alert towards any risk of violence in kosovo , not least in order to assure serbs that they can remain in kosovo and participate in building a democratic state .
russian opposition , on the other hand , also remains a clear fact , and russia will use its membership in the un , and possibly the osce and council of europe , to mobilize against kosovo 's independence .
this , in turn , could have a further negative impact on relations between russia and the west as a whole , again not something in either russia 's or the west 's interests .
is kosovo becoming a pawn in the current power games between the west and russia ?
if so , how will an independent kosovo affect relations ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia , serbia 's ally , remains in opposition to the west kosovo has , for some time , been one among several pawns in these power games .
now that independence has been declared , the issue has come to a head , but at the same time kosovo will gradually become less of an issue , precisely because a decision has been made .
russia may choose not to recognize it and bring it up before the security council and elsewhere , but it was in particular kosovo 's unresolved status that gave russia a certain degree of leverage .
in the long term , i think interest in kosovo will fade , especially if the transition to independence is smooth , no major violence occurs , and kosovo quickly gains recognition from a large number of countries beyond the core western powers .
what will the newly independent kosovo 's view be towards the european union and the west ?
kosovo albanians remain the most pro-european and pro-atlanticist of all the balkan people .
the challenge for prime minister thaci and president sejdiu will be to prepare kosovo politically , economically and socially for closer links with the eu and to overcome resistance within the eu from countries like cyprus , greece , romania , slovakia and spain who fear that kosovo sets an unwelcome precedent for secessionist threats that they themselves perceive .
from that perspective , kosovo and its supporters in the eu have a unique responsibility and opportunity to demonstrate that kosovo can develop into a full european , democratic state and that its independence does not lead to the instability and insecurity feared by some .
not all eu countries are in favor of an independent kosovo - how is the declaration likely to affect relations within the european bloc when the official eu line will be one of overall support ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some eu nations , like germany , will recognize kosovo some countries have expressed concern and reservations , primarily because of their own domestic situation .
on the other hand , none of them can have a real interest in risking the eu 's ability to act swiftly and decisively over the kosovo issue .
this is not least the case because , apart from the eu in cooperation with nato , there really is no other international actor willing and able to manage kosovo 's transition to independence .
thus , my hope is that despite some countries ' reluctance to recognize kosovo , none of them will be foolish enough to sabotage the eu 's efforts to maintain stability in kosovo and the wider region and enable the region to forge ever closer ties with the bloc as a whole .
what are the best and worst scenarios arising from this declaration of independence : for kosovo , for the balkans , for the eu and for the relationship between east and west ?
the worst-case scenario would be one of wide-spread violence in kosovo , triggering instability in macedonia and bosnia and an eu and nato unable to manage these threats .
also , a prolonged delay in sufficient levels of international recognition of kosovo leading to insufficient economic recovery there , and continuing strains between serbs and albanians in kosovo are unlikely to be helpful to demonstrate that kosovo as an independent state can succeed politically , economically and socially without destabilizing its neighborhood .
the more negative local developments , the more likely also is it that relations between east and west will remain difficult and impact on other major challenges in the international arena - from the middle east conflict , to nuclear proliferation in iran and north korea , to continuing bloodshed in africa .
as a best-case scenario , kosovo will remain stable , its development will take off , serbs will gradually begin to participate in the political process , the balkans will become more integrated into the eu , and the current level of international tensions over kosovo will quickly die down .
this is a tall order , and one would have to be very optimistic to see any , let alone all of this , happen very soon , but neither is there any reason to see the future as bleak as the worst-case scenario . interview : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but real peace in the balkans is still in the distant future , says dw 's verica spasovska . " calm and moderation " was berlin 's first cautious reaction .
for good reason , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier is calling on all involved parties in the region to keep a sober mind .
the cries of joy in pristina can not hide the fact that kosovo 's independence is n't solving all the problems of the balkans .
in reality , they 've only just begun . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verica spasovska first off , the high-flying expectations of many a citizen of kosovo that independence will automatically bring masses of foreign investors to the country will not be fulfilled that quickly .
on the contrary , a possible economic embargo by the serbian government - cutting off electricity , food and water supplies , internet and telephone connections - could make daily life harder for people in kosovo .
without generous eu support , the country will not be able to free itself from years of economic agony .
considering previous foreign aid worth billions , expectations should n't be too high that the money will lead to a rapid economic upswing . but the question whether the international community will manage to erect a truly democratic state that can integrate all its citizens is far more complicated than the economic situation .
it 's certainly possible that the 120,000 serbs in kosovo - backed by belgrade - will refuse to cooperate with the government in pristina and build parallel structures .
in the worst case , a similar situation to the " frozen conflict " in northern cyprus could develop in the long term . pristina 's declaration of independence is a tough test for the fragile coalition in belgrade .
national-conservative premier kostunica has already announced that he will reject all agreements that bring serbia closer to the eu in case of the recognition of kosovo by eu states .
president tadic meanwhile does not want to give up his pro-european stance .
at the same time , the serbian radical party is strengthening its position as the strongest fraction in parliament .
the municipal elections in may will - at the latest - force serbia to once more decide whether it wants to choose a path towards the eu or russia . the controversial step towards independence also adds oil to the fire in neighboring republics , such as the serbian entity in bosnia .
bosnians serbs are unlikely to call for independence and accession to serbia - there 's too much international pressure .
but citing kosovo , they 'll continue to test to what extent they can block the central government in sarajevo . bosnia , which has been under international control for more than a decade , also shows quite clearly the limits of " controlled independence . "
some are already beginning to ask how long kosovo albanians will put up with the semi-protectorate dictated by the eu .
the presence of 16,000 nato soldiers , who are meant to be able to prevent major unrest , brings some comfort in that respect . eu member states , a large majority of which will recognize kosovo diplomatically , know that the balkan peace process will remain a mammoth task .
the only way out of the dilemma may be a future in which national borders play a subordinate role .
only when kosovo and serbia are eu members , will the balkan find long-term peace .
it 's still a long way to go . verica spasovska heads dw-radio 's central and south-eastern european programs . -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

eventually , however , macedonia , bosnia , croatia and montenegro will recognize the independence of kosovo , but this will not be a process free from domestic debate .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia , serbia 's ally , remains in opposition to the west kosovo has , for some time , been one among several pawns in these power games .

this is not least the case because , apart from the eu in cooperation with nato , there really is no other international actor willing and able to manage kosovo 's transition to independence .
thus , my hope is that despite some countries ' reluctance to recognize kosovo , none of them will be foolish enough to sabotage the eu 's efforts to maintain stability in kosovo and the wider region and enable the region to forge ever closer ties with the bloc as a whole .
what are the best and worst scenarios arising from this declaration of independence : for kosovo , for the balkans , for the eu and for the relationship between east and west ?
the worst-case scenario would be one of wide-spread violence in kosovo , triggering instability in macedonia and bosnia and an eu and nato unable to manage these threats .
also , a prolonged delay in sufficient levels of international recognition of kosovo leading to insufficient economic recovery there , and continuing strains between serbs and albanians in kosovo are unlikely to be helpful to demonstrate that kosovo as an independent state can succeed politically , economically and socially without destabilizing its neighborhood .
the more negative local developments , the more likely also is it that relations between east and west will remain difficult and impact on other major challenges in the international arena - from the middle east conflict , to nuclear proliferation in iran and north korea , to continuing bloodshed in africa .
as a best-case scenario , kosovo will remain stable , its development will take off , serbs will gradually begin to participate in the political process , the balkans will become more integrated into the eu , and the current level of international tensions over kosovo will quickly die down .
this is a tall order , and one would have to be very optimistic to see any , let alone all of this , happen very soon , but neither is there any reason to see the future as bleak as the worst-case scenario . interview : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

opinion : long road to normalcy in kosovo kosovo -pipe- 18.02.2008 us , germany cautious on kosovo as separatists call for action großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and merkel are playing the waiting game over kosovo the united states and germany issued statements suggesting they would recognize kosovo 's independence but gave no official blessing .
meanwhile , fears of knock-on separatist action increased with unrest in bosnia . while not officially recognizing kosovo as an independent state , us president george w. bush said monday that the kosovars " are now independent " but added that us recognition would be guided by the un-supported ahtisaari plan .
" the ahtisaari plan is our blueprint forward , " bush said when asked in an interview if washington will officially recognize kosovo as a country .
but , bush added , " the kosovars are now independent .
it 's something i 've advocated along with my government . "
in berlin , german chancellor angela merkel said germany would not take an immediate decision on recognizing kosovo 's independence but wait for the european union to spell out its position .
" we will not take a decision today on recognizing kosovo 's independence .
ministers from the eu will meet today to put in place a platform that will allow each member to take a position on the declaration of independence , " she told reporters in berlin .
" so taking a decision on recognition is not on the order of the day .
the order of the day is first of all to answers questions of substance as to the eu 's platform . "
germany had been expected to formally recognize kosovo on monday along with britain , france , italy and the united states .
merkel added that kosovo was an isolated case not comparable with that in other countries and she stressed that the future of both kosovo and serbia lay with the european union .
" the whole situation in the western balkans can only be kept calm and peaceful from my point of view if we keep the european perspective as the perspective for the future for both serbia and kosovo , " merkel said .
chancellor calls for protection of minorities merkel stressed that kosovo and other countries in the region had to respect their minorities if they were to have a future in the european union .
" all must live with their minorities , " she said , acknowledging difficulties that stretched back over centuries .
without a european future for the countries of the former yugoslavia , she added , " the prospects for free democracy and securing economic development are much , much worse . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said the eu 's relations with russia were stable asked whether differences over kosovo would hurt eu-russian relations , merkel said the russian objections were of a principled nature and its attitude would not change .
but she added that eu relations with russia were " of a strategic nature and ... very stable . "
" we should in as far as possible try to come to the best diplomatic conclusions , " she said .
" we have strategic relations with russia that are capable of surviving differences of opinion because they are very stable . "
eu foreign ministers were locked in a crisis meeting in brussels monday to discuss the response to kosovo 's split from serbia on sunday amid signs of intense behind-the-scenes wrangling over recognition of the new state .
while some of the larger member states support the declaration , many others refuse to accept kosovo 's decision .
eu divisions exacerbated by separatist concerns the already difficult situation of presenting a united front on kosovo was made worse when spain announced that the socialist government will not give diplomatic recognition to the new state , and that spain 's conservative opposition had agreed with the government 's position .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain fears action by eta , the armed basque separatists spain fears that the serbian province 's declaration of independence could inspire its basque separatists to take a similar step .
these fears gained some credibility when it was revealed that the main opposition bosnian serb party had called for the independence of the serb-run half of bosnia monday , citing kosovo as a precedent .
" the serb democratic party -lsb- sds -rsb- is demanding republika srpska 's institutions provide -lsb- bosnian serbs -rsb- the same rights being given to kosovo albanians , " said the party , which was founded by war crimes fugitive radovan karadzic .
" we expect the -lsb- bosnian serb -rsb- government to meet previous promises and check the will of republika srpska citizens in a referendum , " the sds said in a statement .
since its 1992-1995 war , bosnia has consisted of two entities , the serb-run republika srpska -lsb- rs -rsb- and the muslim-croat federation , each with their own government , parliament and police force .
the sds was established in the early 1990s by karadzic , who remains at large around 12 years after the un war crimes tribunal charged him with genocide over the srebrenica massacre and siege of sarajevo .
bosnian serbs cite kosovo as precedent many bosnian serbs feel that their entity should follow kosovo 's lead and be allowed to secede from bosnia to be eventually attached to serbia , which they see as their motherland .
some local politicians have hinted that the rs could try such a move .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests in banja luka had xenophobic undertones meanwhile , up to 3,000 bosnian serbs gathered in banja luka to protest against kosovo 's independence .
" europe shame on you , world shame on you " and " hashim murderer " , the protestors chanted in a reference to kosovo prime minister hashim thaci .
they also chanted offensive slogans using derogatory terms for albanians .
the protest , organized by students , started with a minute 's silence , followed by another minute of hissing to voice disagreement with kosovo 's unilateral move .
banners in the crowd carried such slogans as " europe respect international law , " " kosovo = rs , " and " we do n't give up kosovo . "
" we are disappointed with the fate of -lsb- serbian -rsb- people in kosovo and we will continue to support them , " representative of students dejan kragulj told journalists .

opinion : long road to normalcy in kosovo kosovo -pipe- 18.02.2008 us , germany cautious on kosovo as separatists call for action großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and merkel are playing the waiting game over kosovo the united states and germany issued statements suggesting they would recognize kosovo 's independence but gave no official blessing .
meanwhile , fears of knock-on separatist action increased with unrest in bosnia . while not officially recognizing kosovo as an independent state , us president george w. bush said monday that the kosovars " are now independent " but added that us recognition would be guided by the un-supported ahtisaari plan .
" the ahtisaari plan is our blueprint forward , " bush said when asked in an interview if washington will officially recognize kosovo as a country .
but , bush added , " the kosovars are now independent .
it 's something i 've advocated along with my government . "
in berlin , german chancellor angela merkel said germany would not take an immediate decision on recognizing kosovo 's independence but wait for the european union to spell out its position .
" we will not take a decision today on recognizing kosovo 's independence .
ministers from the eu will meet today to put in place a platform that will allow each member to take a position on the declaration of independence , " she told reporters in berlin .
" so taking a decision on recognition is not on the order of the day .
the order of the day is first of all to answers questions of substance as to the eu 's platform . "
germany had been expected to formally recognize kosovo on monday along with britain , france , italy and the united states .
merkel added that kosovo was an isolated case not comparable with that in other countries and she stressed that the future of both kosovo and serbia lay with the european union .
" the whole situation in the western balkans can only be kept calm and peaceful from my point of view if we keep the european perspective as the perspective for the future for both serbia and kosovo , " merkel said .
chancellor calls for protection of minorities merkel stressed that kosovo and other countries in the region had to respect their minorities if they were to have a future in the european union .
" all must live with their minorities , " she said , acknowledging difficulties that stretched back over centuries .
without a european future for the countries of the former yugoslavia , she added , " the prospects for free democracy and securing economic development are much , much worse . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said the eu 's relations with russia were stable asked whether differences over kosovo would hurt eu-russian relations , merkel said the russian objections were of a principled nature and its attitude would not change .
but she added that eu relations with russia were " of a strategic nature and ... very stable . "
" we should in as far as possible try to come to the best diplomatic conclusions , " she said .
" we have strategic relations with russia that are capable of surviving differences of opinion because they are very stable . "
eu foreign ministers were locked in a crisis meeting in brussels monday to discuss the response to kosovo 's split from serbia on sunday amid signs of intense behind-the-scenes wrangling over recognition of the new state .
while some of the larger member states support the declaration , many others refuse to accept kosovo 's decision .
eu divisions exacerbated by separatist concerns the already difficult situation of presenting a united front on kosovo was made worse when spain announced that the socialist government will not give diplomatic recognition to the new state , and that spain 's conservative opposition had agreed with the government 's position .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain fears action by eta , the armed basque separatists spain fears that the serbian province 's declaration of independence could inspire its basque separatists to take a similar step .
these fears gained some credibility when it was revealed that the main opposition bosnian serb party had called for the independence of the serb-run half of bosnia monday , citing kosovo as a precedent .
" the serb democratic party -lsb- sds -rsb- is demanding republika srpska 's institutions provide -lsb- bosnian serbs -rsb- the same rights being given to kosovo albanians , " said the party , which was founded by war crimes fugitive radovan karadzic .
" we expect the -lsb- bosnian serb -rsb- government to meet previous promises and check the will of republika srpska citizens in a referendum , " the sds said in a statement .
since its 1992-1995 war , bosnia has consisted of two entities , the serb-run republika srpska -lsb- rs -rsb- and the muslim-croat federation , each with their own government , parliament and police force .
the sds was established in the early 1990s by karadzic , who remains at large around 12 years after the un war crimes tribunal charged him with genocide over the srebrenica massacre and siege of sarajevo .
bosnian serbs cite kosovo as precedent many bosnian serbs feel that their entity should follow kosovo 's lead and be allowed to secede from bosnia to be eventually attached to serbia , which they see as their motherland .
some local politicians have hinted that the rs could try such a move .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests in banja luka had xenophobic undertones meanwhile , up to 3,000 bosnian serbs gathered in banja luka to protest against kosovo 's independence .
" europe shame on you , world shame on you " and " hashim murderer " , the protestors chanted in a reference to kosovo prime minister hashim thaci .
they also chanted offensive slogans using derogatory terms for albanians .
the protest , organized by students , started with a minute 's silence , followed by another minute of hissing to voice disagreement with kosovo 's unilateral move .
banners in the crowd carried such slogans as " europe respect international law , " " kosovo = rs , " and " we do n't give up kosovo . "
" we are disappointed with the fate of -lsb- serbian -rsb- people in kosovo and we will continue to support them , " representative of students dejan kragulj told journalists .
" it 's clear that republika srpska now has the right to secede from bosnia , " zeljko , a 23-year-old student , told reporters . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 18.02.2008 berlin film festival winner courts controversy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " tropa de elite " has divided viewers both at home , in brazil , and abroad brazilian director jose padilha won the berlin film festival 's top prize for his controversial movie , " tropa de elite " -lrb- " elite squad " -rrb- .
dw-world.de spoke to him about the film 's reception , brazil and on-screen violence . dw-world.de : you decided on a first-person narrator who tells the story off-camera .
it 's a means to make the viewer identify with the main character , a brutal police officer .
were you conscious of the possibility that the protagonist could also be understood as the hero ? jose padilha : the movie 's main character is n't seen that way at all .
some newspapers wrote that the brazilians had found a hero in captain nascimento and that that would mean the brazilian people were in favor of violence .
that 's not the case .
that 's a distortion of brazilian reality . narration in the first-person form is common in film .
indeed , it does create a relationship between the viewer and the character who 's telling the story .
the viewer sees the movie through the eyes of this character .
but i do n't see it as a problem to do that with a police officer in order to understand his point of view .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : padilha certainly got people talking in the same manner , i do n't have a problem with scorsese 's choice in " good fellas . "
the main character is a mafioso .
as the viewer , you 're on his side the whole time , and that certainly does n't mean that you think the mafia is good .
the viewer has the ability to keep fiction and reality separate .
many critics underestimate that , but i believe that the viewer is smart enough to understand what he sees . the depiction of the brazilian middle class in your film was very controversial in brazil - the same middle and upper class that place the entire blame for social problems on the governments , without bearing in mind that they exploit their domestic help .
is your movie the beginning of a consciousness in that respect ? urban violence in brazil is viewed as a private war between criminals and drug dealers .
the middle class thus counts itself out .
but it goes without saying that it 's involved .
it takes part in this war .
when a drug user buys his dope from an armed group that controls a poor neighborhood , he 's backing the drug dealer 's weapons .
the user is aware of it all .

dw-world.de spoke to him about the film 's reception , brazil and on-screen violence . dw-world.de : you decided on a first-person narrator who tells the story off-camera .
it 's a means to make the viewer identify with the main character , a brutal police officer .
were you conscious of the possibility that the protagonist could also be understood as the hero ? jose padilha : the movie 's main character is n't seen that way at all .
some newspapers wrote that the brazilians had found a hero in captain nascimento and that that would mean the brazilian people were in favor of violence .
that 's not the case .
that 's a distortion of brazilian reality . narration in the first-person form is common in film .
indeed , it does create a relationship between the viewer and the character who 's telling the story .
the viewer sees the movie through the eyes of this character .
but i do n't see it as a problem to do that with a police officer in order to understand his point of view .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : padilha certainly got people talking in the same manner , i do n't have a problem with scorsese 's choice in " good fellas . "
the main character is a mafioso .
as the viewer , you 're on his side the whole time , and that certainly does n't mean that you think the mafia is good .
the viewer has the ability to keep fiction and reality separate .
many critics underestimate that , but i believe that the viewer is smart enough to understand what he sees . the depiction of the brazilian middle class in your film was very controversial in brazil - the same middle and upper class that place the entire blame for social problems on the governments , without bearing in mind that they exploit their domestic help .
is your movie the beginning of a consciousness in that respect ? urban violence in brazil is viewed as a private war between criminals and drug dealers .
the middle class thus counts itself out .
but it goes without saying that it 's involved .
it takes part in this war .
when a drug user buys his dope from an armed group that controls a poor neighborhood , he 's backing the drug dealer 's weapons .
the user is aware of it all .
he 's part of this societal process . the hypocrisy is enormous among the brazilian middle class .
many of the people who have money take advantage of police corruption .
someone from the middle class who 's committed an offense can bribe a police officer and wo n't even be arrested .

opinion : long road to normalcy in kosovo kosovo -pipe- 18.02.2008 us , germany cautious on kosovo as separatists call for action großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and merkel are playing the waiting game over kosovo the united states and germany issued statements suggesting they would recognize kosovo 's independence but gave no official blessing .
meanwhile , fears of knock-on separatist action increased with unrest in bosnia . while not officially recognizing kosovo as an independent state , us president george w. bush said monday that the kosovars " are now independent " but added that us recognition would be guided by the un-supported ahtisaari plan .
" the ahtisaari plan is our blueprint forward , " bush said when asked in an interview if washington will officially recognize kosovo as a country .
but , bush added , " the kosovars are now independent .
it 's something i 've advocated along with my government . "
in berlin , german chancellor angela merkel said germany would not take an immediate decision on recognizing kosovo 's independence but wait for the european union to spell out its position .
" we will not take a decision today on recognizing kosovo 's independence .
ministers from the eu will meet today to put in place a platform that will allow each member to take a position on the declaration of independence , " she told reporters in berlin .
" so taking a decision on recognition is not on the order of the day .
the order of the day is first of all to answers questions of substance as to the eu 's platform . "
germany had been expected to formally recognize kosovo on monday along with britain , france , italy and the united states .
merkel added that kosovo was an isolated case not comparable with that in other countries and she stressed that the future of both kosovo and serbia lay with the european union .
" the whole situation in the western balkans can only be kept calm and peaceful from my point of view if we keep the european perspective as the perspective for the future for both serbia and kosovo , " merkel said .
chancellor calls for protection of minorities merkel stressed that kosovo and other countries in the region had to respect their minorities if they were to have a future in the european union .
" all must live with their minorities , " she said , acknowledging difficulties that stretched back over centuries .
without a european future for the countries of the former yugoslavia , she added , " the prospects for free democracy and securing economic development are much , much worse . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said the eu 's relations with russia were stable asked whether differences over kosovo would hurt eu-russian relations , merkel said the russian objections were of a principled nature and its attitude would not change .
but she added that eu relations with russia were " of a strategic nature and ... very stable . "
" we should in as far as possible try to come to the best diplomatic conclusions , " she said .
" we have strategic relations with russia that are capable of surviving differences of opinion because they are very stable . "
eu foreign ministers were locked in a crisis meeting in brussels monday to discuss the response to kosovo 's split from serbia on sunday amid signs of intense behind-the-scenes wrangling over recognition of the new state .
while some of the larger member states support the declaration , many others refuse to accept kosovo 's decision .
eu divisions exacerbated by separatist concerns the already difficult situation of presenting a united front on kosovo was made worse when spain announced that the socialist government will not give diplomatic recognition to the new state , and that spain 's conservative opposition had agreed with the government 's position .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain fears action by eta , the armed basque separatists spain fears that the serbian province 's declaration of independence could inspire its basque separatists to take a similar step .
these fears gained some credibility when it was revealed that the main opposition bosnian serb party had called for the independence of the serb-run half of bosnia monday , citing kosovo as a precedent .
" the serb democratic party -lsb- sds -rsb- is demanding republika srpska 's institutions provide -lsb- bosnian serbs -rsb- the same rights being given to kosovo albanians , " said the party , which was founded by war crimes fugitive radovan karadzic .
" we expect the -lsb- bosnian serb -rsb- government to meet previous promises and check the will of republika srpska citizens in a referendum , " the sds said in a statement .
since its 1992-1995 war , bosnia has consisted of two entities , the serb-run republika srpska -lsb- rs -rsb- and the muslim-croat federation , each with their own government , parliament and police force .
the sds was established in the early 1990s by karadzic , who remains at large around 12 years after the un war crimes tribunal charged him with genocide over the srebrenica massacre and siege of sarajevo .
bosnian serbs cite kosovo as precedent many bosnian serbs feel that their entity should follow kosovo 's lead and be allowed to secede from bosnia to be eventually attached to serbia , which they see as their motherland .
some local politicians have hinted that the rs could try such a move .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests in banja luka had xenophobic undertones meanwhile , up to 3,000 bosnian serbs gathered in banja luka to protest against kosovo 's independence .
" europe shame on you , world shame on you " and " hashim murderer " , the protestors chanted in a reference to kosovo prime minister hashim thaci .
they also chanted offensive slogans using derogatory terms for albanians .
the protest , organized by students , started with a minute 's silence , followed by another minute of hissing to voice disagreement with kosovo 's unilateral move .
banners in the crowd carried such slogans as " europe respect international law , " " kosovo = rs , " and " we do n't give up kosovo . "
" we are disappointed with the fate of -lsb- serbian -rsb- people in kosovo and we will continue to support them , " representative of students dejan kragulj told journalists .
" it 's clear that republika srpska now has the right to secede from bosnia , " zeljko , a 23-year-old student , told reporters . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de serbia , russia move to annul kosovo independence calling it " illegal , " russia and serbia stepped up their efforts to annul kosovo 's independence monday , feb .

17 . the two front-runners have vowed to change course and find a solution to the " cyprus problem " which has kept the island divided for three decades . conservative ioannis kassoulidis and general secretary of the communist party demetris christofias will vie for the presidency in the final round of voting on feb .
24 .
both have pledged to resume peace talks , which were stalled after papadopoulos urged the rejection of a united nations peace plan in 2004 . surprising defeat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demetris christofias wants reunification president papadopoulos was expected to easily make it into the final round of voting , as he was ahead in opinion polls .
during campaigning papadopoulos said his political rivals would " sell out " the republic of cyprus if they won . after his surprising third-place finish sunday , kassoulidis and christofias began aggressively courting papadopoulos supporters . kassoulidis , the country 's former foreign minister , won 33.5 percent of the vote .
christofias , who is parliament speaker and left the government coalition led by papadopoulos to run for president , won 33.3 percent of the vote .
less than 1,000 votes separated the two candidates . both candidates are appealing to the socialist party edek , center-right diko and the greens to join their ticket in the general elections .
in cyprus , where voting is obligatory , the president has to clinch at least 50 percent plus one vote . politicians will spend the next week strengthening party alliances and making political promises in exchange for support in the presidential race , european university of cyprus research executive pambos papageorgiou told afp . " in the end it will come down to party alliances and horse trading , “ papageorgiou said . both candidates want dialogue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ioannis kasoulides wants an end to the " cyprus problem " " all those who believe that cyprus should become a modern european state , now is the time to join together , " kasoulides , 59 , said sunday outside his campaign headquarters .
" now is the time to overcome all that has divided the people on the cyprus problem these past years . " cyprus , which gained independence from britain in 1960 , is one of the most popular mediterranean tourist destinations . cyprus was split along ethnic lines in 1974 after turkey responded to an effort to unite the island with greece by invading the northern part of the country .
turkish cypriots have a breakaway state in the north which is recognized only by ankara . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president papadopoulos was ousted in the voting “ our goal is to reunite the people of this tragic , afflicted country , ” christofias , 61 , said . papadopoulos , 74 , is seen as responsible for the failure of a un blueprint in 2004 to unite the country before it entered the eu .
after the plan failed , the southern republic of cyprus joined the eu in 2004 .
turkey has repeatedly accused greek cypriots of trying to stop its own efforts to join the eu . turkish prime minister recep tayyib erdogan said ahead of the vote that he remained hopeful of a cyprus settlement . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for good reason , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier is calling on all involved parties in the region to keep a sober mind .
the cries of joy in pristina can not hide the fact that kosovo 's independence is n't solving all the problems of the balkans .
in reality , they 've only just begun . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verica spasovska first off , the high-flying expectations of many a citizen of kosovo that independence will automatically bring masses of foreign investors to the country will not be fulfilled that quickly .
on the contrary , a possible economic embargo by the serbian government - cutting off electricity , food and water supplies , internet and telephone connections - could make daily life harder for people in kosovo .
without generous eu support , the country will not be able to free itself from years of economic agony .
considering previous foreign aid worth billions , expectations should n't be too high that the money will lead to a rapid economic upswing . but the question whether the international community will manage to erect a truly democratic state that can integrate all its citizens is far more complicated than the economic situation .
it 's certainly possible that the 120,000 serbs in kosovo - backed by belgrade - will refuse to cooperate with the government in pristina and build parallel structures .
in the worst case , a similar situation to the " frozen conflict " in northern cyprus could develop in the long term . pristina 's declaration of independence is a tough test for the fragile coalition in belgrade .
national-conservative premier kostunica has already announced that he will reject all agreements that bring serbia closer to the eu in case of the recognition of kosovo by eu states .
president tadic meanwhile does not want to give up his pro-european stance .
at the same time , the serbian radical party is strengthening its position as the strongest fraction in parliament .
the municipal elections in may will - at the latest - force serbia to once more decide whether it wants to choose a path towards the eu or russia . the controversial step towards independence also adds oil to the fire in neighboring republics , such as the serbian entity in bosnia .
bosnians serbs are unlikely to call for independence and accession to serbia - there 's too much international pressure .
but citing kosovo , they 'll continue to test to what extent they can block the central government in sarajevo . bosnia , which has been under international control for more than a decade , also shows quite clearly the limits of " controlled independence . "
some are already beginning to ask how long kosovo albanians will put up with the semi-protectorate dictated by the eu .
the presence of 16,000 nato soldiers , who are meant to be able to prevent major unrest , brings some comfort in that respect . eu member states , a large majority of which will recognize kosovo diplomatically , know that the balkan peace process will remain a mammoth task .
the only way out of the dilemma may be a future in which national borders play a subordinate role .

on the contrary , a possible economic embargo by the serbian government - cutting off electricity , food and water supplies , internet and telephone connections - could make daily life harder for people in kosovo .
without generous eu support , the country will not be able to free itself from years of economic agony .
considering previous foreign aid worth billions , expectations should n't be too high that the money will lead to a rapid economic upswing . but the question whether the international community will manage to erect a truly democratic state that can integrate all its citizens is far more complicated than the economic situation .
it 's certainly possible that the 120,000 serbs in kosovo - backed by belgrade - will refuse to cooperate with the government in pristina and build parallel structures .
in the worst case , a similar situation to the " frozen conflict " in northern cyprus could develop in the long term . pristina 's declaration of independence is a tough test for the fragile coalition in belgrade .
national-conservative premier kostunica has already announced that he will reject all agreements that bring serbia closer to the eu in case of the recognition of kosovo by eu states .
president tadic meanwhile does not want to give up his pro-european stance .
at the same time , the serbian radical party is strengthening its position as the strongest fraction in parliament .
the municipal elections in may will - at the latest - force serbia to once more decide whether it wants to choose a path towards the eu or russia . the controversial step towards independence also adds oil to the fire in neighboring republics , such as the serbian entity in bosnia .
bosnians serbs are unlikely to call for independence and accession to serbia - there 's too much international pressure .
but citing kosovo , they 'll continue to test to what extent they can block the central government in sarajevo . bosnia , which has been under international control for more than a decade , also shows quite clearly the limits of " controlled independence . "
some are already beginning to ask how long kosovo albanians will put up with the semi-protectorate dictated by the eu .
the presence of 16,000 nato soldiers , who are meant to be able to prevent major unrest , brings some comfort in that respect . eu member states , a large majority of which will recognize kosovo diplomatically , know that the balkan peace process will remain a mammoth task .
the only way out of the dilemma may be a future in which national borders play a subordinate role .
only when kosovo and serbia are eu members , will the balkan find long-term peace .
it 's still a long way to go . verica spasovska heads dw-radio 's central and south-eastern european programs . -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

18 , it was the differences of their clean-up operations which summed up the feelings not only of their country folk but those of the international community at large . in kosovo 's capital , the detritus of celebration littered the streets as the sun rose on the country 's first full day of self-declared independence from serbia .
tens of thousands of people celebrated long into the night in central pristina on sunday in recognition of the kosovo parliament 's formal vote to break from serbia , a move that completed the conflict-strewn breakup of the former yugoslavia . however , as the first rays of light settled on belgrade , the night 's events in the serbian capital told a different story . the rubble , broken glass and spent tear gas canisters spoke volumes about the serbian response : riots in protest against kosovo 's declaration had swept through the streets for several hours , with the wrath of the crowd focused on the symbols of those they perceived as helping tear serbian 's heartland province away .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the streets of belgrade erupted in violence riot police battled hundreds of youths with batons after the baying mob had smashed two mcdonald 's restaurants and attacked the us and slovenian embassies with stones .
hospital officials said at least 50 people , including 20 policemen , were injured during the rioting , but none seriously . earlier , in the south of serbia , members of the kosovo police service stopped several hundred former serbian army reservists dressed in military uniforms from crossing into the province ahead of the declaration . international reactions reflect divide away from the streets , the international community soon began positioning itself in the two camps of " for " and " against . "
the trickle of responses began early , with those opposing the move striking quickly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia 's reaction would be peaceful but forceful said tadic serbia 's president boris tadic attempted to calm fears of escalating violence by speaking diplomatically , but the message was clear : serbia would not recognize this new kosovo and would work to stop its independence in its tracks .
" serbia has reacted and will react with all peaceful , diplomatic and legal means to annul this act committed by kosovo 's institutions , " he said . serbia 's main ally , russia , soon threw its considerable weight behind tadic 's message by calling a special meeting of the united nations security council to discuss the issue late sunday , but failed to secure backing for its call to declare kosovo 's declaration " null and void . " china expressed concern about the effects kosovo 's declaration would have on peace in the balkans , urging the two governments to work out their problems through dialogue .
" kosovo 's unilateral act can produce a series of results that will lead to seriously negative influence on peace and stability in the balkan region and on the realization of building a multiethnic society in kosovo , which china is deeply concerned about , " foreign affairs ministry spokesman liu jianchao said . " china calls on the two sides of serbia and kosovo to continue to seek a proper solution through negotiation within the framework of international law , and the international community should create favorable conditions for this , " he added . concerns over wave of separatist declarations sri lanka , a country with its own problems with separatism , said it was concerned about kosovo 's unilateral declaration of independence , as it could set a precedent in other parts of the world and hurt nations . " the unilateral declaration of independence by kosovo could set an unmanageable precedent in the conduct of international relations , the established global order of sovereign states and could thus pose a grave threat to international peace and security , " the foreign ministry said in a statement .
" this action by kosovo is a violation of the charter of the united nations , which enshrines the sovereignty and territorial integrity of member states . " sri lankan forces have been fighting a 25-year insurgency by tamil separatists , who want an independent homeland in the east and north of the island . new zealand 's prime minister helen clark announced that her country would not recognize an independent kosovo , saying it was never the government 's position to offer diplomatic recognition in such circumstances .
" we neither recognize nor not recognize , " she said .
" we are not intending to make a formal statement . " supporters say stability comes from recognition bildunterschrift : kosovo thanks its supporters but not everyone is in favor australia led the early calls of support for independent kosovo , with prime minister kevin rudd announcing that australia would recognize the new state .
" the sorry history of kosovo means that we 've got to do whatever we can do to ensure the citizens of that part of the world are protected into the future , " rudd said .
" this would appear to be the right course of action .
that 's why diplomatically we would extend diplomatic recognition at the earliest opportunity . " taiwan 's independence-leaning government echoed australia 's stance .
" self-determination is a right recognized by the united nations , and it is the people who are masters of their nation 's future , " the foreign ministry said in a statement .
" in no way should the independence of one nation be denied by another . " taiwan is a member of the international community that cherishes democracy and freedom , and the government is delighted that the people of kosovo have the fruits of independence , democracy and freedom to look forward to , " it said . western powers biding their time the united states and the european union were to make formal statements later in the day , but were both expected to recognize the new kosovo , despite a split over independence in the eu .
britain , france , germany and italy are expected to officially give recognition , but greece , cyprus , romania , slovakia , spain and bulgaria have all expressed their opposition .
slovenia 's foreign minister dimitrij rupel , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , told reporters that he understood that " many eu member states " would recognize kosovo 's independence . " recognition is not a matter for the eu as a whole - it 's member states who will decide , " rupel said said as he arrived for a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels , adding that there was likely to be " a lively discussion . "
" i can not tell you what we shall conclude at the end , but certainly i expect that we shall continue with this tradition of unity that we have established " with the creation of a new eu justice mission to kosovo , rupel said . german chancellor angela merkel said that germany would not make a decision on the recognition of kosovo yet , as the main priority was for the european union to act together on kosovo .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 18.02.2008 berlin film festival winner courts controversy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " tropa de elite " has divided viewers both at home , in brazil , and abroad brazilian director jose padilha won the berlin film festival 's top prize for his controversial movie , " tropa de elite " -lrb- " elite squad " -rrb- .
dw-world.de spoke to him about the film 's reception , brazil and on-screen violence . dw-world.de : you decided on a first-person narrator who tells the story off-camera .
it 's a means to make the viewer identify with the main character , a brutal police officer .
were you conscious of the possibility that the protagonist could also be understood as the hero ? jose padilha : the movie 's main character is n't seen that way at all .
some newspapers wrote that the brazilians had found a hero in captain nascimento and that that would mean the brazilian people were in favor of violence .
that 's not the case .
that 's a distortion of brazilian reality . narration in the first-person form is common in film .
indeed , it does create a relationship between the viewer and the character who 's telling the story .
the viewer sees the movie through the eyes of this character .
but i do n't see it as a problem to do that with a police officer in order to understand his point of view .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : padilha certainly got people talking in the same manner , i do n't have a problem with scorsese 's choice in " good fellas . "
the main character is a mafioso .
as the viewer , you 're on his side the whole time , and that certainly does n't mean that you think the mafia is good .
the viewer has the ability to keep fiction and reality separate .
many critics underestimate that , but i believe that the viewer is smart enough to understand what he sees . the depiction of the brazilian middle class in your film was very controversial in brazil - the same middle and upper class that place the entire blame for social problems on the governments , without bearing in mind that they exploit their domestic help .
is your movie the beginning of a consciousness in that respect ? urban violence in brazil is viewed as a private war between criminals and drug dealers .
the middle class thus counts itself out .
but it goes without saying that it 's involved .
it takes part in this war .
when a drug user buys his dope from an armed group that controls a poor neighborhood , he 's backing the drug dealer 's weapons .
the user is aware of it all .
he 's part of this societal process . the hypocrisy is enormous among the brazilian middle class .
many of the people who have money take advantage of police corruption .
someone from the middle class who 's committed an offense can bribe a police officer and wo n't even be arrested .
there 's complicity between this middle class and the current situation in brazil , which causes violence . bildunterschrift : padilha did not shy away from showing violence your movie is debated both in brazil as well as abroad .
there 's been serious criticism as well as much praise , but people are not neutral about it .
did you expect the film 's reception to be so contentious outside of brazil too ? it was clear that the discussion would come to berlin .
it was brought here by brazilian critics .
whether the polemic would have developed here , i ca n't say , maybe .
in any case , the discussion is interesting .
part of this debate developed because many people viewed interrelations with dated concepts .
the idea that one must observe a societal process from the right or the left is dead for me . my film sees reality through the metaphor of a game .
if you want to understand an individual 's behavior , you have to take into account that this person makes decisions according to the rules of a society .
that 's clear in the film .
what rules must a police officer from rio submit to ?
he earns $ 400 -lrb- 275 euros -rrb- a month , is poorly educated and must find his way within a completely corrupt structure .
and on top of that we want him to take a stand against heavily armed opponents in the favela -lsb- slums -rsb- in the name of the law .
he 's supposed to risk his life and for the long term . " tropa de elite " shows brazil as an unscrupulous country , whether in the callousness of the middle class or in the brutality of the police .
is there a way out of this situation ? the result of the game depends on the rules .
that means that if you change the rules , you can get a different result .
the players themselves determine these societal rules .
we can change a lot : the law that controls the drug trade , the police structures .
we can stop sending a violent police force into the slums , and instead we can build a school there .
one can change a lot .
my aim is to show that we have created this situation ourselves .
and so , we can change it to .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : padilha aimed to depict brazilian reality you worked together with one of the scriptwriters from " city of god . "
the two films have certain similarities : the unsteady camera , the editing and , to a certain extent , the soundtrack .
is there a new genre in brazilian film that favors violence packaged in a fast rhythm ? in those days , the prevailing opinion was that one could only make a critical film by using a distanced approach .
it was important not to involve the viewer emotionally .
that 's not been the case for ages .
in " city of god , " fernando meirelles saw precisely that .
i do n't need any slow sequences , which - referring to brecht - take the viewer out of the events and tell him : " now think about it . "
that 's not necessary . if i involve the viewer emotionally throughout the entire film , i create an even bigger debate in the end . i 'm not saying in any way that you should n't make slow films anymore .
for me , it 's about stressing that a movie that uses emotion to involve the viewer does n't need to preclude reason .
on the contrary , emotion brings reason into the film , much more so than a critical and distanced approach .
people may love or hate " tropa de elite , " but they are talking about the film .
that 's exactly what we wanted . interview : soraia vilela -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the kosovo example could plunge the world into chaos , " senior parliamentarian mikhail margelov was quoted by itar-tass as saying .
the independence declaration goes against " international law and morality .
this is a dangerous precedent , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and kostunica stand side by side on kosovo ahead of further discussion at the united nations , russian foreign ministry official alexander botsan-kharchenko urged the un secretary general ban to stand up for un resolutions and rules that he said backed moscow 's stance . " we think he should clearly define his position , " botsan-kharchenko told reporters in new york .
whe should remain loyal to the united nations ' charter and to the security council 's resolution 1244 on kosovo . " a veto-wielding permanent member of the un security council , russia has consistently opposed kosovo 's bid for independence , siding with serbia .
however , despite its power within the un , russia failed to secure security council backing for a bid to declare the independence declaration by kosovo 's ethnic albanian majority " null and void . " russia balancing kosovo stance with own separatist issues russian newspapers on monday said russia was also likely to use kosovo 's declaration to put more pressure on neighboring georgia , which has two separatist provinces - abkhazia and south ossetia - that adjoin russia and have moscow 's de facto backing . despite opposing kosovo 's independence , russia has said that it could serve as a precedent for the separatist provinces .
at the same time moscow has said it does not plan to recognize independence for the two provinces , reflecting worries about separatism within russia 's own borders . south ossetia and abkhazia plan to ask russia and the un to recognize their independence following kosovo ’ s declaration of independence . " in the near future abkhazia will appeal to the russian parliament and the un security council with a request to recognize its independence , " self-declared abkhaz president sergei bagapsh was quoted as saying by the interfax news agency . " south ossetia will in the near future appeal to the commonwealth of independent states and the un with a request to recognize our independence , " south ossetian president eduard kokoity was also quoted as saying by the news agency , referring to a grouping of ex-soviet states that includes russia . moscow could open representative offices in the capitals of the two georgian provinces , a step just short of formal recognition of independence , kommersant newspaper said , quoting unnamed government sources . analysts say russia is balancing its position as it seeks to use its separatist allies in georgia to gain diplomatic advantage over the georgian leadership , which is seeking to join western institutions such as nato . serbia moves to counter " violation of sovereignty " meanwhile , the serbian parliament will convene in belgrade later monday to adopt a decision to " annul " kosovo 's independence proclamation on the grounds that it " violates the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the republic of serbia . " " the parliament of serbia should confirm the serbian government 's decision to annul illegal acts by interim kosovo authorities to unilaterally proclaim independence , " the tanjug state-run news agency reported . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kostunica 's government pursues its annulment plan president boris tadic and prime minister vojislav kostunica said serbia would " never recognize an independent kosovo " after the province 's declaration on sunday . serbia also announced that police had filed criminal charges against kosovo albanian leaders for " organizing the proclamation of a phony state on serbian territory , " according to tanjug . the charges were laid against kosovo president fatmir sejdiu , prime minister hashim thaci and parliament speaker jakup krasniqi , the state-run agency said , citing an interior ministry statement . the serbian government also decided to proclaim as " null and void " all decisions by the european union to send a mission to kosovo .
" these decisions have no legal foundation for serbia and produce no obligation of serbia towards the european union , " the government statement read . the eu is preparing a kosovo mission dubbed eulex , which is designed to help the 90-percent ethnic albanian territory on its road to independence by deploying some 2,000 personnel . kosovo has been run by the united nations since mid-1999 , after a nato air assault drove out serbian forces waging a brutal crackdown on separatist ethnic albanian guerrillas and their civilian supporters . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke to balkans expert stefan wolff about what kosovo and the world can expect in the near future . stefan wolff is a professor of political science and director of the centre for international crisis management and conflict resolution at nottingham university in the uk .
he has extensive expertise in northern ireland , the balkans and central and eastern europe , and has also worked on a wide range of other conflicts elsewhere , including the middle east , africa , and central , south and southeast asia . dw-world.de : is kosovo prepared for independence in terms of infrastructure , governance , security and stability ? stefan wolff : kosovo has most of the important institutions of statehood and democratic governance in place , but at the same time these institutions will require continued international support for some time .
this is accepted by both the kosovars and the west and is the background against which we need to understand the eu mission for kosovo - as external assistance to consolidate existing institutional structures to enable kosovars to take care of developing their economy , infrastructure and ensure security and stability . the decision to declare independence is not a unanimous one within the population .
what minorities in kosovo have most to lose from this independence ? in principle , all minorities and the majority albanian population can gain from the clarification of kosovo 's international status , not least in the sense that they will all benefit from economic development .
prime minister thaci made some very important gestures yesterday towards reconciliation with serbs in kosovo .
the arthisaari plan offers important mechanisms to serbs to preserve and develop their identity , gives them opportunities to play a meaningful part in the political process in kosovo and retain ties with serbia .
from this perspective , there is no need for conflict between the two main population groups , but that does not mean that extremists on either side will refrain from violence and provocations .
so far , this risk has been contained , but not eliminated . what can we expect in terms of reaction and action from kosovo 's balkan neighbors ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few of the region 's conflicts are fully resolved the balkan region as a whole remains quite vulnerable to the threat of ethnic conflict .
we must bear in mind that few , if any , of the conflicts that led to bloodshed throughout the 1990s have really been resolved .
we have institutions in place now that help manage these conflicts politically , but tensions in bosnia and macedonia , for example , remain .
apart from albania and slovenia , i do n't think that any of the other balkan countries will find it a very easy decision to recognize kosovo .
eventually , however , macedonia , bosnia , croatia and montenegro will recognize the independence of kosovo , but this will not be a process free from domestic debate .
how will kosovo 's independence affect the wider balkan region ?
because of the close links between kosovo and two other major previous secessionist conflicts - bosnia , the serbs , and macedonia , the albanians - there is a danger that violence in and around kosovo could spread and create instability across the balkans .
there also remains an open question in relation to the future of albanians in southern serbia .
the overall hope , of course , remains that with kosovo 's independence the last major unresolved issue has been tackled and that the region as a whole can now move forward to closer integration with the eu .
while this will not be easy over the coming months , eventually a sense of reality will set in , and people will realize that this is there only real hope for the future .
serbia has vowed not to recognize an independent kosovo and has spoken of economic and diplomatic sanctions .
what can we expect from serbia in the coming days ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riots broke out in belgrade after kosovo 's declaration there are already signs of serbia backing down from the quite exaggerated threats of cutting diplomatic ties with any country recognizing kosovo .
this is simply not feasible for serbia , especially as the population there still has clear aspirations of eu membership and very strong economic interests both in the eu and the neighboring region .
we will , however , see further declarations and statements against kosovo 's independence and against its recognition by other states .
together with russia , serbia is most likely to try and mobilize the un against kosovo 's unilateral declaration of independence , and membership in the un and other international organizations will be very difficult to obtain for kosovo because of serbian resistance .
while the likelihood of a military conflict is close to zero , there remains a threat of localized violence in and around kosovo , but serious escalation is in nobody 's interest .
moreover , serbia has to think carefully about how to manage its relations with serbs in kosovo .
the arthisaari plan offers many important opportunities to do so , opportunities that kosovo albanians are ready to accept .
discouraging kosovo serb political participation in pristina will not be in the interests of serbs living there , and might further encourage them to leave rather than to stay .
what action do you expect to be taken by the international community in the coming days ?
we will gradually see recognition of kosovo as an independent state from major countries in the eu and the west more generally .
we should also expect support from the arab league and member countries of the organization of the islamic conference .
nato will have to be very alert towards any risk of violence in kosovo , not least in order to assure serbs that they can remain in kosovo and participate in building a democratic state .
russian opposition , on the other hand , also remains a clear fact , and russia will use its membership in the un , and possibly the osce and council of europe , to mobilize against kosovo 's independence .
this , in turn , could have a further negative impact on relations between russia and the west as a whole , again not something in either russia 's or the west 's interests .
is kosovo becoming a pawn in the current power games between the west and russia ?
if so , how will an independent kosovo affect relations ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia , serbia 's ally , remains in opposition to the west kosovo has , for some time , been one among several pawns in these power games .
now that independence has been declared , the issue has come to a head , but at the same time kosovo will gradually become less of an issue , precisely because a decision has been made .
russia may choose not to recognize it and bring it up before the security council and elsewhere , but it was in particular kosovo 's unresolved status that gave russia a certain degree of leverage .
in the long term , i think interest in kosovo will fade , especially if the transition to independence is smooth , no major violence occurs , and kosovo quickly gains recognition from a large number of countries beyond the core western powers .
what will the newly independent kosovo 's view be towards the european union and the west ?
kosovo albanians remain the most pro-european and pro-atlanticist of all the balkan people .
the challenge for prime minister thaci and president sejdiu will be to prepare kosovo politically , economically and socially for closer links with the eu and to overcome resistance within the eu from countries like cyprus , greece , romania , slovakia and spain who fear that kosovo sets an unwelcome precedent for secessionist threats that they themselves perceive .
from that perspective , kosovo and its supporters in the eu have a unique responsibility and opportunity to demonstrate that kosovo can develop into a full european , democratic state and that its independence does not lead to the instability and insecurity feared by some .
not all eu countries are in favor of an independent kosovo - how is the declaration likely to affect relations within the european bloc when the official eu line will be one of overall support ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some eu nations , like germany , will recognize kosovo some countries have expressed concern and reservations , primarily because of their own domestic situation .
on the other hand , none of them can have a real interest in risking the eu 's ability to act swiftly and decisively over the kosovo issue .
this is not least the case because , apart from the eu in cooperation with nato , there really is no other international actor willing and able to manage kosovo 's transition to independence .
thus , my hope is that despite some countries ' reluctance to recognize kosovo , none of them will be foolish enough to sabotage the eu 's efforts to maintain stability in kosovo and the wider region and enable the region to forge ever closer ties with the bloc as a whole .
what are the best and worst scenarios arising from this declaration of independence : for kosovo , for the balkans , for the eu and for the relationship between east and west ?
the worst-case scenario would be one of wide-spread violence in kosovo , triggering instability in macedonia and bosnia and an eu and nato unable to manage these threats .
also , a prolonged delay in sufficient levels of international recognition of kosovo leading to insufficient economic recovery there , and continuing strains between serbs and albanians in kosovo are unlikely to be helpful to demonstrate that kosovo as an independent state can succeed politically , economically and socially without destabilizing its neighborhood .
the more negative local developments , the more likely also is it that relations between east and west will remain difficult and impact on other major challenges in the international arena - from the middle east conflict , to nuclear proliferation in iran and north korea , to continuing bloodshed in africa .
as a best-case scenario , kosovo will remain stable , its development will take off , serbs will gradually begin to participate in the political process , the balkans will become more integrated into the eu , and the current level of international tensions over kosovo will quickly die down .
this is a tall order , and one would have to be very optimistic to see any , let alone all of this , happen very soon , but neither is there any reason to see the future as bleak as the worst-case scenario . interview : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but real peace in the balkans is still in the distant future , says dw 's verica spasovska . " calm and moderation " was berlin 's first cautious reaction .
for good reason , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier is calling on all involved parties in the region to keep a sober mind .
the cries of joy in pristina can not hide the fact that kosovo 's independence is n't solving all the problems of the balkans .
in reality , they 've only just begun . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verica spasovska first off , the high-flying expectations of many a citizen of kosovo that independence will automatically bring masses of foreign investors to the country will not be fulfilled that quickly .
on the contrary , a possible economic embargo by the serbian government - cutting off electricity , food and water supplies , internet and telephone connections - could make daily life harder for people in kosovo .
without generous eu support , the country will not be able to free itself from years of economic agony .
considering previous foreign aid worth billions , expectations should n't be too high that the money will lead to a rapid economic upswing . but the question whether the international community will manage to erect a truly democratic state that can integrate all its citizens is far more complicated than the economic situation .
it 's certainly possible that the 120,000 serbs in kosovo - backed by belgrade - will refuse to cooperate with the government in pristina and build parallel structures .
in the worst case , a similar situation to the " frozen conflict " in northern cyprus could develop in the long term . pristina 's declaration of independence is a tough test for the fragile coalition in belgrade .
national-conservative premier kostunica has already announced that he will reject all agreements that bring serbia closer to the eu in case of the recognition of kosovo by eu states .
president tadic meanwhile does not want to give up his pro-european stance .
at the same time , the serbian radical party is strengthening its position as the strongest fraction in parliament .
the municipal elections in may will - at the latest - force serbia to once more decide whether it wants to choose a path towards the eu or russia . the controversial step towards independence also adds oil to the fire in neighboring republics , such as the serbian entity in bosnia .
bosnians serbs are unlikely to call for independence and accession to serbia - there 's too much international pressure .
but citing kosovo , they 'll continue to test to what extent they can block the central government in sarajevo . bosnia , which has been under international control for more than a decade , also shows quite clearly the limits of " controlled independence . "
some are already beginning to ask how long kosovo albanians will put up with the semi-protectorate dictated by the eu .
the presence of 16,000 nato soldiers , who are meant to be able to prevent major unrest , brings some comfort in that respect . eu member states , a large majority of which will recognize kosovo diplomatically , know that the balkan peace process will remain a mammoth task .
the only way out of the dilemma may be a future in which national borders play a subordinate role .
only when kosovo and serbia are eu members , will the balkan find long-term peace .
it 's still a long way to go . verica spasovska heads dw-radio 's central and south-eastern european programs . -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

18 , it was the differences of their clean-up operations which summed up the feelings not only of their country folk but those of the international community at large . in kosovo 's capital , the detritus of celebration littered the streets as the sun rose on the country 's first full day of self-declared independence from serbia .
tens of thousands of people celebrated long into the night in central pristina on sunday in recognition of the kosovo parliament 's formal vote to break from serbia , a move that completed the conflict-strewn breakup of the former yugoslavia . however , as the first rays of light settled on belgrade , the night 's events in the serbian capital told a different story . the rubble , broken glass and spent tear gas canisters spoke volumes about the serbian response : riots in protest against kosovo 's declaration had swept through the streets for several hours , with the wrath of the crowd focused on the symbols of those they perceived as helping tear serbian 's heartland province away .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the streets of belgrade erupted in violence riot police battled hundreds of youths with batons after the baying mob had smashed two mcdonald 's restaurants and attacked the us and slovenian embassies with stones .
hospital officials said at least 50 people , including 20 policemen , were injured during the rioting , but none seriously . earlier , in the south of serbia , members of the kosovo police service stopped several hundred former serbian army reservists dressed in military uniforms from crossing into the province ahead of the declaration . international reactions reflect divide away from the streets , the international community soon began positioning itself in the two camps of " for " and " against . "
the trickle of responses began early , with those opposing the move striking quickly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia 's reaction would be peaceful but forceful said tadic serbia 's president boris tadic attempted to calm fears of escalating violence by speaking diplomatically , but the message was clear : serbia would not recognize this new kosovo and would work to stop its independence in its tracks .
" serbia has reacted and will react with all peaceful , diplomatic and legal means to annul this act committed by kosovo 's institutions , " he said . serbia 's main ally , russia , soon threw its considerable weight behind tadic 's message by calling a special meeting of the united nations security council to discuss the issue late sunday , but failed to secure backing for its call to declare kosovo 's declaration " null and void . " china expressed concern about the effects kosovo 's declaration would have on peace in the balkans , urging the two governments to work out their problems through dialogue .
" kosovo 's unilateral act can produce a series of results that will lead to seriously negative influence on peace and stability in the balkan region and on the realization of building a multiethnic society in kosovo , which china is deeply concerned about , " foreign affairs ministry spokesman liu jianchao said . " china calls on the two sides of serbia and kosovo to continue to seek a proper solution through negotiation within the framework of international law , and the international community should create favorable conditions for this , " he added . concerns over wave of separatist declarations sri lanka , a country with its own problems with separatism , said it was concerned about kosovo 's unilateral declaration of independence , as it could set a precedent in other parts of the world and hurt nations . " the unilateral declaration of independence by kosovo could set an unmanageable precedent in the conduct of international relations , the established global order of sovereign states and could thus pose a grave threat to international peace and security , " the foreign ministry said in a statement .
" this action by kosovo is a violation of the charter of the united nations , which enshrines the sovereignty and territorial integrity of member states . " sri lankan forces have been fighting a 25-year insurgency by tamil separatists , who want an independent homeland in the east and north of the island . new zealand 's prime minister helen clark announced that her country would not recognize an independent kosovo , saying it was never the government 's position to offer diplomatic recognition in such circumstances .
" we neither recognize nor not recognize , " she said .
" we are not intending to make a formal statement . " supporters say stability comes from recognition bildunterschrift : kosovo thanks its supporters but not everyone is in favor australia led the early calls of support for independent kosovo , with prime minister kevin rudd announcing that australia would recognize the new state .
" the sorry history of kosovo means that we 've got to do whatever we can do to ensure the citizens of that part of the world are protected into the future , " rudd said .
" this would appear to be the right course of action .
that 's why diplomatically we would extend diplomatic recognition at the earliest opportunity . " taiwan 's independence-leaning government echoed australia 's stance .
" self-determination is a right recognized by the united nations , and it is the people who are masters of their nation 's future , " the foreign ministry said in a statement .
" in no way should the independence of one nation be denied by another . " taiwan is a member of the international community that cherishes democracy and freedom , and the government is delighted that the people of kosovo have the fruits of independence , democracy and freedom to look forward to , " it said . western powers biding their time the united states and the european union were to make formal statements later in the day , but were both expected to recognize the new kosovo , despite a split over independence in the eu .
britain , france , germany and italy are expected to officially give recognition , but greece , cyprus , romania , slovakia , spain and bulgaria have all expressed their opposition .
slovenia 's foreign minister dimitrij rupel , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , told reporters that he understood that " many eu member states " would recognize kosovo 's independence . " recognition is not a matter for the eu as a whole - it 's member states who will decide , " rupel said said as he arrived for a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels , adding that there was likely to be " a lively discussion . "
" i can not tell you what we shall conclude at the end , but certainly i expect that we shall continue with this tradition of unity that we have established " with the creation of a new eu justice mission to kosovo , rupel said . german chancellor angela merkel said that germany would not make a decision on the recognition of kosovo yet , as the main priority was for the european union to act together on kosovo . " germany will not take a decision -lsb- on the recognition of kosovo -rsb- today , " merkel told germany 's foreign press association -lrb- vap -rrb- .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 18.02.2008 germany faces political dilemma in afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are uneasy about combat missions while experts say germany will likely increase its military involvement in afghanistan , the subject remains politically taboo .
the gap between german rhetoric and reality is likely to increase as elections near . the german army 's afghanistan mission is testing berlin 's long-held prohibition against involvement in foreign combat missions like never before .
yet germany 's resistance has more to do with politics than moral qualms , experts say . the german government has spent recent weeks insisting that it has no plans to significantly increase its involvement in afghanistan .
it stood firm even as nato allies , particularly the united states , pressured germany to increase involvement in fighting taliban forces in southern afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has a very strong pacificst movement with national elections scheduled for 2009 , elected officials are n't going to commit political suicide by proposing germany fight alongside nato allies in southern afghanistan , said thomas bauer of the center for applied policy research at the university of munich and an expert in german foreign affairs . " the moment this government decides to send in combat troops to the southern part of afghanistan , they will lose the next election , " bauer said . germany : a reluctant warrior the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , will try to win the next elections by portraying their coalition partners , chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , as pro-military .
to win votes , the left party will try to portray both the spd and cdu as warmongers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party will use afghanistan to score points with german pacifists " pushing this pacifist button " wins elections , bauer said . all of germany 's main political parties , with the exception of the left party , understand germany has a global responsibility which includes sending forces abroad and want to increase participation in nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
but they are afraid of voter backlash , experts say . germans remain deeply uneasy about taking part in military missions .
there 's the specter of world war ii and a long tradition of pacifism born during the cold war . this unease is shown by the limited scope parliament gave the bundeswehr in afghanistan .
the military can send a maximum of 3,500 soldiers to work out of the relatively peaceful north of the country where it is involved in rebuilding as well as peacekeeping and stabilization efforts . " it is important for nato to be seen as a community that implements its security strategy as a whole , " german defense minister franz-josef jung said recently , while insisting that germany will not participate in fighting in the south . increased involvement a tough sell bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some have questioned whether a political strategy exists in afghanistan the german public is overwhelmingly opposed to increasing the presence in afghanistan .
two out of every three say they want germany out of afghanistan as soon as possible . this has led to a certain amount of dishonesty in the political discourse surrounding afghanistan .
germany 's troop contribution to a quick reaction force is a perfect example of the divide between rhetoric and reality , said citha maass , the afghanistan expert at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs . germany agreed to send an additional 200 combat troops in july to take over for a norwegian contingent .
this force will be based in the north , but will assist allies in other regions .
these troops will have a combat component , maass said . " instead of discussing publically that you need some combat function , the government tries to hide it , " she said . on friday , feb .
15 , after denying press reports for days , the german government admitted it will discuss raising the number of troops in afghanistan when the parliamentary mandate comes up for renewal in the fall .
there 's also the possibility of changing the length of the mandate so that it does n't require renewal during election campaigning , according to press reports .
germany is , however , expected to stand firm on refusing to join fighting in the south . germany shirking its duties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has refused to join combat missions in southern afghanistan norine macdonald has spent most of the past three years doing field research in afghanistan as the president of the senlis council , a security and development think tank .
she said germany 's reluctance to get involved with fighting the taliban and al qaeda forces in southern afghanistan is outrageous and incomprehensible . german politicians lack the political will and the political skill to speak about the reality of the threat in afghanistan , macdonald said , something which she feels is " deeply irresponsible . " " germany is trying to create an alternate version of reality about afghanistan , " she said .
" unless you are going to go fight in the south , you are not part of the nato efforts to stabilize afghanistan . " unclear political goals in afghanistan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been focused on humanitarian aid the taliban and al qaeda forces control secondary roads in afghanistan 's south and are moving closer to kabul each month , . of nato members , only the united states , canada , the netherlands and great britain currently have troops are currently fighting in the south . there 's increasing worry among experts that the nato mission could fail to contain the taliban . part of the problem is that no one really knows what the ultimate goal is in afghanistan , said andreas heinemann-grüder , a senior researcher at the bonn-based bicc , an organization which focuses on peace building and conflict resolution issues . " the point is that they do n't know what they 're striving for , " heinemann-grüder said .
" what is ultimate goal for these combat missions ?
i do n't see any political strategy behind the military effort . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : canada has called on nato members to send more troops to southern afghanistan for many germans , the messier the situation in afghanistan gets , the more reason for germany to end its involvement .
but it should n't take a terrorist attack on german soil for the country to realize that isolation is not an option , said bauer of the center for applied policy research .
having the taliban destabilize afghanistan puts germany at risk , even if it seems intangible to many people . macdonald agreed , calling afghanistan germany 's " new back yard . " " the world has shrunk so much we know that what happens in southern afghanistan is happening on the border of every western country , " macdonald said . trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

opinion : long road to normalcy in kosovo kosovo -pipe- 18.02.2008 us , germany cautious on kosovo as separatists call for action großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and merkel are playing the waiting game over kosovo the united states and germany issued statements suggesting they would recognize kosovo 's independence but gave no official blessing .
meanwhile , fears of knock-on separatist action increased with unrest in bosnia . while not officially recognizing kosovo as an independent state , us president george w. bush said monday that the kosovars " are now independent " but added that us recognition would be guided by the un-supported ahtisaari plan .
" the ahtisaari plan is our blueprint forward , " bush said when asked in an interview if washington will officially recognize kosovo as a country .
but , bush added , " the kosovars are now independent .
it 's something i 've advocated along with my government . "
in berlin , german chancellor angela merkel said germany would not take an immediate decision on recognizing kosovo 's independence but wait for the european union to spell out its position .
" we will not take a decision today on recognizing kosovo 's independence .
ministers from the eu will meet today to put in place a platform that will allow each member to take a position on the declaration of independence , " she told reporters in berlin .
" so taking a decision on recognition is not on the order of the day .
the order of the day is first of all to answers questions of substance as to the eu 's platform . "
germany had been expected to formally recognize kosovo on monday along with britain , france , italy and the united states .
merkel added that kosovo was an isolated case not comparable with that in other countries and she stressed that the future of both kosovo and serbia lay with the european union .
" the whole situation in the western balkans can only be kept calm and peaceful from my point of view if we keep the european perspective as the perspective for the future for both serbia and kosovo , " merkel said .
chancellor calls for protection of minorities merkel stressed that kosovo and other countries in the region had to respect their minorities if they were to have a future in the european union .
" all must live with their minorities , " she said , acknowledging difficulties that stretched back over centuries .
without a european future for the countries of the former yugoslavia , she added , " the prospects for free democracy and securing economic development are much , much worse . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said the eu 's relations with russia were stable asked whether differences over kosovo would hurt eu-russian relations , merkel said the russian objections were of a principled nature and its attitude would not change .
but she added that eu relations with russia were " of a strategic nature and ... very stable . "
" we should in as far as possible try to come to the best diplomatic conclusions , " she said .
" we have strategic relations with russia that are capable of surviving differences of opinion because they are very stable . "
eu foreign ministers were locked in a crisis meeting in brussels monday to discuss the response to kosovo 's split from serbia on sunday amid signs of intense behind-the-scenes wrangling over recognition of the new state .
while some of the larger member states support the declaration , many others refuse to accept kosovo 's decision .
eu divisions exacerbated by separatist concerns the already difficult situation of presenting a united front on kosovo was made worse when spain announced that the socialist government will not give diplomatic recognition to the new state , and that spain 's conservative opposition had agreed with the government 's position .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain fears action by eta , the armed basque separatists spain fears that the serbian province 's declaration of independence could inspire its basque separatists to take a similar step .
these fears gained some credibility when it was revealed that the main opposition bosnian serb party had called for the independence of the serb-run half of bosnia monday , citing kosovo as a precedent .
" the serb democratic party -lsb- sds -rsb- is demanding republika srpska 's institutions provide -lsb- bosnian serbs -rsb- the same rights being given to kosovo albanians , " said the party , which was founded by war crimes fugitive radovan karadzic .
" we expect the -lsb- bosnian serb -rsb- government to meet previous promises and check the will of republika srpska citizens in a referendum , " the sds said in a statement .
since its 1992-1995 war , bosnia has consisted of two entities , the serb-run republika srpska -lsb- rs -rsb- and the muslim-croat federation , each with their own government , parliament and police force .
the sds was established in the early 1990s by karadzic , who remains at large around 12 years after the un war crimes tribunal charged him with genocide over the srebrenica massacre and siege of sarajevo .
bosnian serbs cite kosovo as precedent many bosnian serbs feel that their entity should follow kosovo 's lead and be allowed to secede from bosnia to be eventually attached to serbia , which they see as their motherland .
some local politicians have hinted that the rs could try such a move .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests in banja luka had xenophobic undertones meanwhile , up to 3,000 bosnian serbs gathered in banja luka to protest against kosovo 's independence .
" europe shame on you , world shame on you " and " hashim murderer " , the protestors chanted in a reference to kosovo prime minister hashim thaci .
they also chanted offensive slogans using derogatory terms for albanians .
the protest , organized by students , started with a minute 's silence , followed by another minute of hissing to voice disagreement with kosovo 's unilateral move .
banners in the crowd carried such slogans as " europe respect international law , " " kosovo = rs , " and " we do n't give up kosovo . "
" we are disappointed with the fate of -lsb- serbian -rsb- people in kosovo and we will continue to support them , " representative of students dejan kragulj told journalists .

dw-world.de spoke to balkans expert stefan wolff about what kosovo and the world can expect in the near future . stefan wolff is a professor of political science and director of the centre for international crisis management and conflict resolution at nottingham university in the uk .
he has extensive expertise in northern ireland , the balkans and central and eastern europe , and has also worked on a wide range of other conflicts elsewhere , including the middle east , africa , and central , south and southeast asia . dw-world.de : is kosovo prepared for independence in terms of infrastructure , governance , security and stability ? stefan wolff : kosovo has most of the important institutions of statehood and democratic governance in place , but at the same time these institutions will require continued international support for some time .
this is accepted by both the kosovars and the west and is the background against which we need to understand the eu mission for kosovo - as external assistance to consolidate existing institutional structures to enable kosovars to take care of developing their economy , infrastructure and ensure security and stability . the decision to declare independence is not a unanimous one within the population .
what minorities in kosovo have most to lose from this independence ? in principle , all minorities and the majority albanian population can gain from the clarification of kosovo 's international status , not least in the sense that they will all benefit from economic development .
prime minister thaci made some very important gestures yesterday towards reconciliation with serbs in kosovo .
the arthisaari plan offers important mechanisms to serbs to preserve and develop their identity , gives them opportunities to play a meaningful part in the political process in kosovo and retain ties with serbia .
from this perspective , there is no need for conflict between the two main population groups , but that does not mean that extremists on either side will refrain from violence and provocations .
so far , this risk has been contained , but not eliminated . what can we expect in terms of reaction and action from kosovo 's balkan neighbors ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few of the region 's conflicts are fully resolved the balkan region as a whole remains quite vulnerable to the threat of ethnic conflict .
we must bear in mind that few , if any , of the conflicts that led to bloodshed throughout the 1990s have really been resolved .
we have institutions in place now that help manage these conflicts politically , but tensions in bosnia and macedonia , for example , remain .
apart from albania and slovenia , i do n't think that any of the other balkan countries will find it a very easy decision to recognize kosovo .
eventually , however , macedonia , bosnia , croatia and montenegro will recognize the independence of kosovo , but this will not be a process free from domestic debate .
how will kosovo 's independence affect the wider balkan region ?
because of the close links between kosovo and two other major previous secessionist conflicts - bosnia , the serbs , and macedonia , the albanians - there is a danger that violence in and around kosovo could spread and create instability across the balkans .
there also remains an open question in relation to the future of albanians in southern serbia .
the overall hope , of course , remains that with kosovo 's independence the last major unresolved issue has been tackled and that the region as a whole can now move forward to closer integration with the eu .
while this will not be easy over the coming months , eventually a sense of reality will set in , and people will realize that this is there only real hope for the future .
serbia has vowed not to recognize an independent kosovo and has spoken of economic and diplomatic sanctions .
what can we expect from serbia in the coming days ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riots broke out in belgrade after kosovo 's declaration there are already signs of serbia backing down from the quite exaggerated threats of cutting diplomatic ties with any country recognizing kosovo .
this is simply not feasible for serbia , especially as the population there still has clear aspirations of eu membership and very strong economic interests both in the eu and the neighboring region .
we will , however , see further declarations and statements against kosovo 's independence and against its recognition by other states .
together with russia , serbia is most likely to try and mobilize the un against kosovo 's unilateral declaration of independence , and membership in the un and other international organizations will be very difficult to obtain for kosovo because of serbian resistance .
while the likelihood of a military conflict is close to zero , there remains a threat of localized violence in and around kosovo , but serious escalation is in nobody 's interest .
moreover , serbia has to think carefully about how to manage its relations with serbs in kosovo .
the arthisaari plan offers many important opportunities to do so , opportunities that kosovo albanians are ready to accept .
discouraging kosovo serb political participation in pristina will not be in the interests of serbs living there , and might further encourage them to leave rather than to stay .
what action do you expect to be taken by the international community in the coming days ?
we will gradually see recognition of kosovo as an independent state from major countries in the eu and the west more generally .
we should also expect support from the arab league and member countries of the organization of the islamic conference .
nato will have to be very alert towards any risk of violence in kosovo , not least in order to assure serbs that they can remain in kosovo and participate in building a democratic state .
russian opposition , on the other hand , also remains a clear fact , and russia will use its membership in the un , and possibly the osce and council of europe , to mobilize against kosovo 's independence .
this , in turn , could have a further negative impact on relations between russia and the west as a whole , again not something in either russia 's or the west 's interests .
is kosovo becoming a pawn in the current power games between the west and russia ?
if so , how will an independent kosovo affect relations ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia , serbia 's ally , remains in opposition to the west kosovo has , for some time , been one among several pawns in these power games .
now that independence has been declared , the issue has come to a head , but at the same time kosovo will gradually become less of an issue , precisely because a decision has been made .
russia may choose not to recognize it and bring it up before the security council and elsewhere , but it was in particular kosovo 's unresolved status that gave russia a certain degree of leverage .
in the long term , i think interest in kosovo will fade , especially if the transition to independence is smooth , no major violence occurs , and kosovo quickly gains recognition from a large number of countries beyond the core western powers .
what will the newly independent kosovo 's view be towards the european union and the west ?
kosovo albanians remain the most pro-european and pro-atlanticist of all the balkan people .
the challenge for prime minister thaci and president sejdiu will be to prepare kosovo politically , economically and socially for closer links with the eu and to overcome resistance within the eu from countries like cyprus , greece , romania , slovakia and spain who fear that kosovo sets an unwelcome precedent for secessionist threats that they themselves perceive .
from that perspective , kosovo and its supporters in the eu have a unique responsibility and opportunity to demonstrate that kosovo can develop into a full european , democratic state and that its independence does not lead to the instability and insecurity feared by some .
not all eu countries are in favor of an independent kosovo - how is the declaration likely to affect relations within the european bloc when the official eu line will be one of overall support ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some eu nations , like germany , will recognize kosovo some countries have expressed concern and reservations , primarily because of their own domestic situation .
on the other hand , none of them can have a real interest in risking the eu 's ability to act swiftly and decisively over the kosovo issue .
this is not least the case because , apart from the eu in cooperation with nato , there really is no other international actor willing and able to manage kosovo 's transition to independence .
thus , my hope is that despite some countries ' reluctance to recognize kosovo , none of them will be foolish enough to sabotage the eu 's efforts to maintain stability in kosovo and the wider region and enable the region to forge ever closer ties with the bloc as a whole .
what are the best and worst scenarios arising from this declaration of independence : for kosovo , for the balkans , for the eu and for the relationship between east and west ?
the worst-case scenario would be one of wide-spread violence in kosovo , triggering instability in macedonia and bosnia and an eu and nato unable to manage these threats .
also , a prolonged delay in sufficient levels of international recognition of kosovo leading to insufficient economic recovery there , and continuing strains between serbs and albanians in kosovo are unlikely to be helpful to demonstrate that kosovo as an independent state can succeed politically , economically and socially without destabilizing its neighborhood .
the more negative local developments , the more likely also is it that relations between east and west will remain difficult and impact on other major challenges in the international arena - from the middle east conflict , to nuclear proliferation in iran and north korea , to continuing bloodshed in africa .
as a best-case scenario , kosovo will remain stable , its development will take off , serbs will gradually begin to participate in the political process , the balkans will become more integrated into the eu , and the current level of international tensions over kosovo will quickly die down .
this is a tall order , and one would have to be very optimistic to see any , let alone all of this , happen very soon , but neither is there any reason to see the future as bleak as the worst-case scenario . interview : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke to balkans expert stefan wolff about what kosovo and the world can expect in the near future . stefan wolff is a professor of political science and director of the centre for international crisis management and conflict resolution at nottingham university in the uk .
he has extensive expertise in northern ireland , the balkans and central and eastern europe , and has also worked on a wide range of other conflicts elsewhere , including the middle east , africa , and central , south and southeast asia . dw-world.de : is kosovo prepared for independence in terms of infrastructure , governance , security and stability ? stefan wolff : kosovo has most of the important institutions of statehood and democratic governance in place , but at the same time these institutions will require continued international support for some time .
this is accepted by both the kosovars and the west and is the background against which we need to understand the eu mission for kosovo - as external assistance to consolidate existing institutional structures to enable kosovars to take care of developing their economy , infrastructure and ensure security and stability . the decision to declare independence is not a unanimous one within the population .
what minorities in kosovo have most to lose from this independence ? in principle , all minorities and the majority albanian population can gain from the clarification of kosovo 's international status , not least in the sense that they will all benefit from economic development .
prime minister thaci made some very important gestures yesterday towards reconciliation with serbs in kosovo .
the arthisaari plan offers important mechanisms to serbs to preserve and develop their identity , gives them opportunities to play a meaningful part in the political process in kosovo and retain ties with serbia .
from this perspective , there is no need for conflict between the two main population groups , but that does not mean that extremists on either side will refrain from violence and provocations .
so far , this risk has been contained , but not eliminated . what can we expect in terms of reaction and action from kosovo 's balkan neighbors ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few of the region 's conflicts are fully resolved the balkan region as a whole remains quite vulnerable to the threat of ethnic conflict .
we must bear in mind that few , if any , of the conflicts that led to bloodshed throughout the 1990s have really been resolved .
we have institutions in place now that help manage these conflicts politically , but tensions in bosnia and macedonia , for example , remain .

dw-world.de spoke to balkans expert stefan wolff about what kosovo and the world can expect in the near future . stefan wolff is a professor of political science and director of the centre for international crisis management and conflict resolution at nottingham university in the uk .
he has extensive expertise in northern ireland , the balkans and central and eastern europe , and has also worked on a wide range of other conflicts elsewhere , including the middle east , africa , and central , south and southeast asia . dw-world.de : is kosovo prepared for independence in terms of infrastructure , governance , security and stability ? stefan wolff : kosovo has most of the important institutions of statehood and democratic governance in place , but at the same time these institutions will require continued international support for some time .
this is accepted by both the kosovars and the west and is the background against which we need to understand the eu mission for kosovo - as external assistance to consolidate existing institutional structures to enable kosovars to take care of developing their economy , infrastructure and ensure security and stability . the decision to declare independence is not a unanimous one within the population .
what minorities in kosovo have most to lose from this independence ? in principle , all minorities and the majority albanian population can gain from the clarification of kosovo 's international status , not least in the sense that they will all benefit from economic development .
prime minister thaci made some very important gestures yesterday towards reconciliation with serbs in kosovo .
the arthisaari plan offers important mechanisms to serbs to preserve and develop their identity , gives them opportunities to play a meaningful part in the political process in kosovo and retain ties with serbia .
from this perspective , there is no need for conflict between the two main population groups , but that does not mean that extremists on either side will refrain from violence and provocations .
so far , this risk has been contained , but not eliminated . what can we expect in terms of reaction and action from kosovo 's balkan neighbors ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few of the region 's conflicts are fully resolved the balkan region as a whole remains quite vulnerable to the threat of ethnic conflict .
we must bear in mind that few , if any , of the conflicts that led to bloodshed throughout the 1990s have really been resolved .
we have institutions in place now that help manage these conflicts politically , but tensions in bosnia and macedonia , for example , remain .
apart from albania and slovenia , i do n't think that any of the other balkan countries will find it a very easy decision to recognize kosovo .
eventually , however , macedonia , bosnia , croatia and montenegro will recognize the independence of kosovo , but this will not be a process free from domestic debate .
how will kosovo 's independence affect the wider balkan region ?
because of the close links between kosovo and two other major previous secessionist conflicts - bosnia , the serbs , and macedonia , the albanians - there is a danger that violence in and around kosovo could spread and create instability across the balkans .
there also remains an open question in relation to the future of albanians in southern serbia .
the overall hope , of course , remains that with kosovo 's independence the last major unresolved issue has been tackled and that the region as a whole can now move forward to closer integration with the eu .
while this will not be easy over the coming months , eventually a sense of reality will set in , and people will realize that this is there only real hope for the future .
serbia has vowed not to recognize an independent kosovo and has spoken of economic and diplomatic sanctions .
what can we expect from serbia in the coming days ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riots broke out in belgrade after kosovo 's declaration there are already signs of serbia backing down from the quite exaggerated threats of cutting diplomatic ties with any country recognizing kosovo .
this is simply not feasible for serbia , especially as the population there still has clear aspirations of eu membership and very strong economic interests both in the eu and the neighboring region .
we will , however , see further declarations and statements against kosovo 's independence and against its recognition by other states .
together with russia , serbia is most likely to try and mobilize the un against kosovo 's unilateral declaration of independence , and membership in the un and other international organizations will be very difficult to obtain for kosovo because of serbian resistance .
while the likelihood of a military conflict is close to zero , there remains a threat of localized violence in and around kosovo , but serious escalation is in nobody 's interest .
moreover , serbia has to think carefully about how to manage its relations with serbs in kosovo .
the arthisaari plan offers many important opportunities to do so , opportunities that kosovo albanians are ready to accept .
discouraging kosovo serb political participation in pristina will not be in the interests of serbs living there , and might further encourage them to leave rather than to stay .
what action do you expect to be taken by the international community in the coming days ?
we will gradually see recognition of kosovo as an independent state from major countries in the eu and the west more generally .
we should also expect support from the arab league and member countries of the organization of the islamic conference .
nato will have to be very alert towards any risk of violence in kosovo , not least in order to assure serbs that they can remain in kosovo and participate in building a democratic state .
russian opposition , on the other hand , also remains a clear fact , and russia will use its membership in the un , and possibly the osce and council of europe , to mobilize against kosovo 's independence .
this , in turn , could have a further negative impact on relations between russia and the west as a whole , again not something in either russia 's or the west 's interests .
is kosovo becoming a pawn in the current power games between the west and russia ?
if so , how will an independent kosovo affect relations ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia , serbia 's ally , remains in opposition to the west kosovo has , for some time , been one among several pawns in these power games .
now that independence has been declared , the issue has come to a head , but at the same time kosovo will gradually become less of an issue , precisely because a decision has been made .
russia may choose not to recognize it and bring it up before the security council and elsewhere , but it was in particular kosovo 's unresolved status that gave russia a certain degree of leverage .
in the long term , i think interest in kosovo will fade , especially if the transition to independence is smooth , no major violence occurs , and kosovo quickly gains recognition from a large number of countries beyond the core western powers .
what will the newly independent kosovo 's view be towards the european union and the west ?
kosovo albanians remain the most pro-european and pro-atlanticist of all the balkan people .
the challenge for prime minister thaci and president sejdiu will be to prepare kosovo politically , economically and socially for closer links with the eu and to overcome resistance within the eu from countries like cyprus , greece , romania , slovakia and spain who fear that kosovo sets an unwelcome precedent for secessionist threats that they themselves perceive .
from that perspective , kosovo and its supporters in the eu have a unique responsibility and opportunity to demonstrate that kosovo can develop into a full european , democratic state and that its independence does not lead to the instability and insecurity feared by some .
not all eu countries are in favor of an independent kosovo - how is the declaration likely to affect relations within the european bloc when the official eu line will be one of overall support ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some eu nations , like germany , will recognize kosovo some countries have expressed concern and reservations , primarily because of their own domestic situation .
on the other hand , none of them can have a real interest in risking the eu 's ability to act swiftly and decisively over the kosovo issue .
this is not least the case because , apart from the eu in cooperation with nato , there really is no other international actor willing and able to manage kosovo 's transition to independence .
thus , my hope is that despite some countries ' reluctance to recognize kosovo , none of them will be foolish enough to sabotage the eu 's efforts to maintain stability in kosovo and the wider region and enable the region to forge ever closer ties with the bloc as a whole .
what are the best and worst scenarios arising from this declaration of independence : for kosovo , for the balkans , for the eu and for the relationship between east and west ?
the worst-case scenario would be one of wide-spread violence in kosovo , triggering instability in macedonia and bosnia and an eu and nato unable to manage these threats .
also , a prolonged delay in sufficient levels of international recognition of kosovo leading to insufficient economic recovery there , and continuing strains between serbs and albanians in kosovo are unlikely to be helpful to demonstrate that kosovo as an independent state can succeed politically , economically and socially without destabilizing its neighborhood .
the more negative local developments , the more likely also is it that relations between east and west will remain difficult and impact on other major challenges in the international arena - from the middle east conflict , to nuclear proliferation in iran and north korea , to continuing bloodshed in africa .
as a best-case scenario , kosovo will remain stable , its development will take off , serbs will gradually begin to participate in the political process , the balkans will become more integrated into the eu , and the current level of international tensions over kosovo will quickly die down .
this is a tall order , and one would have to be very optimistic to see any , let alone all of this , happen very soon , but neither is there any reason to see the future as bleak as the worst-case scenario . interview : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the concert brought both applause and protests . heesters is a controversial figure in the netherlands because of his cozy relationship with the nazi occupiers .
security was tight at the de flint theater in heester 's hometown of amersfoort , where he put on a concert for the first time since 1963 on saturday , feb .
16 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors equate the singer with fascism police said several dozen protesters as well as a few neo-nazis showed up outside the concert hall , but the performance went on undisturbed .
the last time heesters tried to peform in the netherlands , he was booed off the stage by the audience , who stood up and gave nazi salutes .
heesters was born in amersfoort , a town 50 kilometers -lrb- 35 miles -rrb- east of amsterdam in 1903 .
yet he made his fortune in germany .
the artist is revered by generations of germans for his operettas and film performances .
one of hitler 's " divinely gifted " artists heesters has been a popular german-language singer since the 1930s , becoming a favorite of the nazis and one of the " divinely gifted " artists who took part in performances to boost the morale of soldiers during the war .
heesters claims he did not know what was happening to jews during the war despite visiting the dachau concentration camp in 1941 .
" honestly , i was too busy working , " heesters said in an interview after a tv gala celebrating his 100th birthday in 2003 .
" i could n't do anything about politics . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heesters is considered a musical legend in germany while germans have taken heesters at his word and continue to watch his old films such as " always you " and " illusion , " many of his dutch countrymen have never forgiven him for his acceptance of the nazi regime during world war ii .
after the nazi defeat , heesters continued his career in germany , settling in bavaria .
heesters is considered to be the oldest living performer .
at the concert saturday , heesters performed hits such as " the merry widow " and " there by the windmill " despite breaking several ribs on jan .
1 during a fall .
at the concert he occasionally needed help from his wife to remember the lines , but otherwise sang with a steady voice , according to media reports . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" these decisions have no legal foundation for serbia and produce no obligation of serbia towards the european union , " the government statement read . the eu is preparing a kosovo mission dubbed eulex , which is designed to help the 90-percent ethnic albanian territory on its road to independence by deploying some 2,000 personnel . kosovo has been run by the united nations since mid-1999 , after a nato air assault drove out serbian forces waging a brutal crackdown on separatist ethnic albanian guerrillas and their civilian supporters . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 18.02.2008 berlin film festival winner courts controversy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " tropa de elite " has divided viewers both at home , in brazil , and abroad brazilian director jose padilha won the berlin film festival 's top prize for his controversial movie , " tropa de elite " -lrb- " elite squad " -rrb- .
dw-world.de spoke to him about the film 's reception , brazil and on-screen violence . dw-world.de : you decided on a first-person narrator who tells the story off-camera .
it 's a means to make the viewer identify with the main character , a brutal police officer .
were you conscious of the possibility that the protagonist could also be understood as the hero ? jose padilha : the movie 's main character is n't seen that way at all .
some newspapers wrote that the brazilians had found a hero in captain nascimento and that that would mean the brazilian people were in favor of violence .
that 's not the case .
that 's a distortion of brazilian reality . narration in the first-person form is common in film .
indeed , it does create a relationship between the viewer and the character who 's telling the story .
the viewer sees the movie through the eyes of this character .
but i do n't see it as a problem to do that with a police officer in order to understand his point of view .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : padilha certainly got people talking in the same manner , i do n't have a problem with scorsese 's choice in " good fellas . "
the main character is a mafioso .
as the viewer , you 're on his side the whole time , and that certainly does n't mean that you think the mafia is good .
the viewer has the ability to keep fiction and reality separate .
many critics underestimate that , but i believe that the viewer is smart enough to understand what he sees . the depiction of the brazilian middle class in your film was very controversial in brazil - the same middle and upper class that place the entire blame for social problems on the governments , without bearing in mind that they exploit their domestic help .
is your movie the beginning of a consciousness in that respect ? urban violence in brazil is viewed as a private war between criminals and drug dealers .
the middle class thus counts itself out .
but it goes without saying that it 's involved .
it takes part in this war .
when a drug user buys his dope from an armed group that controls a poor neighborhood , he 's backing the drug dealer 's weapons .
the user is aware of it all .
he 's part of this societal process . the hypocrisy is enormous among the brazilian middle class .
many of the people who have money take advantage of police corruption .
someone from the middle class who 's committed an offense can bribe a police officer and wo n't even be arrested .
there 's complicity between this middle class and the current situation in brazil , which causes violence . bildunterschrift : padilha did not shy away from showing violence your movie is debated both in brazil as well as abroad .
there 's been serious criticism as well as much praise , but people are not neutral about it .
did you expect the film 's reception to be so contentious outside of brazil too ? it was clear that the discussion would come to berlin .
it was brought here by brazilian critics .
whether the polemic would have developed here , i ca n't say , maybe .
in any case , the discussion is interesting .
part of this debate developed because many people viewed interrelations with dated concepts .
the idea that one must observe a societal process from the right or the left is dead for me . my film sees reality through the metaphor of a game .
if you want to understand an individual 's behavior , you have to take into account that this person makes decisions according to the rules of a society .
that 's clear in the film .
what rules must a police officer from rio submit to ?
he earns $ 400 -lrb- 275 euros -rrb- a month , is poorly educated and must find his way within a completely corrupt structure .
and on top of that we want him to take a stand against heavily armed opponents in the favela -lsb- slums -rsb- in the name of the law .
he 's supposed to risk his life and for the long term . " tropa de elite " shows brazil as an unscrupulous country , whether in the callousness of the middle class or in the brutality of the police .
is there a way out of this situation ? the result of the game depends on the rules .
that means that if you change the rules , you can get a different result .
the players themselves determine these societal rules .
we can change a lot : the law that controls the drug trade , the police structures .
we can stop sending a violent police force into the slums , and instead we can build a school there .
one can change a lot .
my aim is to show that we have created this situation ourselves .
and so , we can change it to .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : padilha aimed to depict brazilian reality you worked together with one of the scriptwriters from " city of god . "
the two films have certain similarities : the unsteady camera , the editing and , to a certain extent , the soundtrack .
is there a new genre in brazilian film that favors violence packaged in a fast rhythm ? in those days , the prevailing opinion was that one could only make a critical film by using a distanced approach .
it was important not to involve the viewer emotionally .
that 's not been the case for ages .
in " city of god , " fernando meirelles saw precisely that .
i do n't need any slow sequences , which - referring to brecht - take the viewer out of the events and tell him : " now think about it . "
that 's not necessary . if i involve the viewer emotionally throughout the entire film , i create an even bigger debate in the end . i 'm not saying in any way that you should n't make slow films anymore .
for me , it 's about stressing that a movie that uses emotion to involve the viewer does n't need to preclude reason .
on the contrary , emotion brings reason into the film , much more so than a critical and distanced approach .
people may love or hate " tropa de elite , " but they are talking about the film .
that 's exactly what we wanted . interview : soraia vilela -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke to him about the film 's reception , brazil and on-screen violence . dw-world.de : you decided on a first-person narrator who tells the story off-camera .
it 's a means to make the viewer identify with the main character , a brutal police officer .
were you conscious of the possibility that the protagonist could also be understood as the hero ? jose padilha : the movie 's main character is n't seen that way at all .
some newspapers wrote that the brazilians had found a hero in captain nascimento and that that would mean the brazilian people were in favor of violence .
that 's not the case .
that 's a distortion of brazilian reality . narration in the first-person form is common in film .
indeed , it does create a relationship between the viewer and the character who 's telling the story .
the viewer sees the movie through the eyes of this character .
but i do n't see it as a problem to do that with a police officer in order to understand his point of view .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : padilha certainly got people talking in the same manner , i do n't have a problem with scorsese 's choice in " good fellas . "
the main character is a mafioso .
as the viewer , you 're on his side the whole time , and that certainly does n't mean that you think the mafia is good .
the viewer has the ability to keep fiction and reality separate .
many critics underestimate that , but i believe that the viewer is smart enough to understand what he sees . the depiction of the brazilian middle class in your film was very controversial in brazil - the same middle and upper class that place the entire blame for social problems on the governments , without bearing in mind that they exploit their domestic help .
is your movie the beginning of a consciousness in that respect ? urban violence in brazil is viewed as a private war between criminals and drug dealers .
the middle class thus counts itself out .
but it goes without saying that it 's involved .
it takes part in this war .
when a drug user buys his dope from an armed group that controls a poor neighborhood , he 's backing the drug dealer 's weapons .
the user is aware of it all .
he 's part of this societal process . the hypocrisy is enormous among the brazilian middle class .
many of the people who have money take advantage of police corruption .
someone from the middle class who 's committed an offense can bribe a police officer and wo n't even be arrested .
there 's complicity between this middle class and the current situation in brazil , which causes violence . bildunterschrift : padilha did not shy away from showing violence your movie is debated both in brazil as well as abroad .
there 's been serious criticism as well as much praise , but people are not neutral about it .
did you expect the film 's reception to be so contentious outside of brazil too ? it was clear that the discussion would come to berlin .
it was brought here by brazilian critics .
whether the polemic would have developed here , i ca n't say , maybe .
in any case , the discussion is interesting .
part of this debate developed because many people viewed interrelations with dated concepts .
the idea that one must observe a societal process from the right or the left is dead for me . my film sees reality through the metaphor of a game .
if you want to understand an individual 's behavior , you have to take into account that this person makes decisions according to the rules of a society .
that 's clear in the film .
what rules must a police officer from rio submit to ?
he earns $ 400 -lrb- 275 euros -rrb- a month , is poorly educated and must find his way within a completely corrupt structure .
and on top of that we want him to take a stand against heavily armed opponents in the favela -lsb- slums -rsb- in the name of the law .
he 's supposed to risk his life and for the long term . " tropa de elite " shows brazil as an unscrupulous country , whether in the callousness of the middle class or in the brutality of the police .
is there a way out of this situation ? the result of the game depends on the rules .
that means that if you change the rules , you can get a different result .
the players themselves determine these societal rules .
we can change a lot : the law that controls the drug trade , the police structures .
we can stop sending a violent police force into the slums , and instead we can build a school there .
one can change a lot .
my aim is to show that we have created this situation ourselves .
and so , we can change it to .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 18.02.2008 berlin film festival winner courts controversy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " tropa de elite " has divided viewers both at home , in brazil , and abroad brazilian director jose padilha won the berlin film festival 's top prize for his controversial movie , " tropa de elite " -lrb- " elite squad " -rrb- .
dw-world.de spoke to him about the film 's reception , brazil and on-screen violence . dw-world.de : you decided on a first-person narrator who tells the story off-camera .
it 's a means to make the viewer identify with the main character , a brutal police officer .
were you conscious of the possibility that the protagonist could also be understood as the hero ? jose padilha : the movie 's main character is n't seen that way at all .
some newspapers wrote that the brazilians had found a hero in captain nascimento and that that would mean the brazilian people were in favor of violence .
that 's not the case .
that 's a distortion of brazilian reality . narration in the first-person form is common in film .
indeed , it does create a relationship between the viewer and the character who 's telling the story .
the viewer sees the movie through the eyes of this character .
but i do n't see it as a problem to do that with a police officer in order to understand his point of view .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : padilha certainly got people talking in the same manner , i do n't have a problem with scorsese 's choice in " good fellas . "
the main character is a mafioso .
as the viewer , you 're on his side the whole time , and that certainly does n't mean that you think the mafia is good .
the viewer has the ability to keep fiction and reality separate .
many critics underestimate that , but i believe that the viewer is smart enough to understand what he sees . the depiction of the brazilian middle class in your film was very controversial in brazil - the same middle and upper class that place the entire blame for social problems on the governments , without bearing in mind that they exploit their domestic help .
is your movie the beginning of a consciousness in that respect ? urban violence in brazil is viewed as a private war between criminals and drug dealers .
the middle class thus counts itself out .
but it goes without saying that it 's involved .
it takes part in this war .
when a drug user buys his dope from an armed group that controls a poor neighborhood , he 's backing the drug dealer 's weapons .
the user is aware of it all .
he 's part of this societal process . the hypocrisy is enormous among the brazilian middle class .
many of the people who have money take advantage of police corruption .
someone from the middle class who 's committed an offense can bribe a police officer and wo n't even be arrested .
there 's complicity between this middle class and the current situation in brazil , which causes violence . bildunterschrift : padilha did not shy away from showing violence your movie is debated both in brazil as well as abroad .
there 's been serious criticism as well as much praise , but people are not neutral about it .
did you expect the film 's reception to be so contentious outside of brazil too ? it was clear that the discussion would come to berlin .
it was brought here by brazilian critics .
whether the polemic would have developed here , i ca n't say , maybe .
in any case , the discussion is interesting .
part of this debate developed because many people viewed interrelations with dated concepts .
the idea that one must observe a societal process from the right or the left is dead for me . my film sees reality through the metaphor of a game .
if you want to understand an individual 's behavior , you have to take into account that this person makes decisions according to the rules of a society .
that 's clear in the film .
what rules must a police officer from rio submit to ?
he earns $ 400 -lrb- 275 euros -rrb- a month , is poorly educated and must find his way within a completely corrupt structure .
and on top of that we want him to take a stand against heavily armed opponents in the favela -lsb- slums -rsb- in the name of the law .
he 's supposed to risk his life and for the long term . " tropa de elite " shows brazil as an unscrupulous country , whether in the callousness of the middle class or in the brutality of the police .
is there a way out of this situation ? the result of the game depends on the rules .
that means that if you change the rules , you can get a different result .
the players themselves determine these societal rules .
we can change a lot : the law that controls the drug trade , the police structures .
we can stop sending a violent police force into the slums , and instead we can build a school there .
one can change a lot .
my aim is to show that we have created this situation ourselves .
and so , we can change it to .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : padilha aimed to depict brazilian reality you worked together with one of the scriptwriters from " city of god . "
the two films have certain similarities : the unsteady camera , the editing and , to a certain extent , the soundtrack .
is there a new genre in brazilian film that favors violence packaged in a fast rhythm ? in those days , the prevailing opinion was that one could only make a critical film by using a distanced approach .
it was important not to involve the viewer emotionally .
that 's not been the case for ages .
in " city of god , " fernando meirelles saw precisely that .
i do n't need any slow sequences , which - referring to brecht - take the viewer out of the events and tell him : " now think about it . "
that 's not necessary . if i involve the viewer emotionally throughout the entire film , i create an even bigger debate in the end . i 'm not saying in any way that you should n't make slow films anymore .
for me , it 's about stressing that a movie that uses emotion to involve the viewer does n't need to preclude reason .
on the contrary , emotion brings reason into the film , much more so than a critical and distanced approach .
people may love or hate " tropa de elite , " but they are talking about the film .
that 's exactly what we wanted . interview : soraia vilela -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

18 , it was the differences of their clean-up operations which summed up the feelings not only of their country folk but those of the international community at large . in kosovo 's capital , the detritus of celebration littered the streets as the sun rose on the country 's first full day of self-declared independence from serbia .
tens of thousands of people celebrated long into the night in central pristina on sunday in recognition of the kosovo parliament 's formal vote to break from serbia , a move that completed the conflict-strewn breakup of the former yugoslavia . however , as the first rays of light settled on belgrade , the night 's events in the serbian capital told a different story . the rubble , broken glass and spent tear gas canisters spoke volumes about the serbian response : riots in protest against kosovo 's declaration had swept through the streets for several hours , with the wrath of the crowd focused on the symbols of those they perceived as helping tear serbian 's heartland province away .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the streets of belgrade erupted in violence riot police battled hundreds of youths with batons after the baying mob had smashed two mcdonald 's restaurants and attacked the us and slovenian embassies with stones .
hospital officials said at least 50 people , including 20 policemen , were injured during the rioting , but none seriously . earlier , in the south of serbia , members of the kosovo police service stopped several hundred former serbian army reservists dressed in military uniforms from crossing into the province ahead of the declaration . international reactions reflect divide away from the streets , the international community soon began positioning itself in the two camps of " for " and " against . "
the trickle of responses began early , with those opposing the move striking quickly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia 's reaction would be peaceful but forceful said tadic serbia 's president boris tadic attempted to calm fears of escalating violence by speaking diplomatically , but the message was clear : serbia would not recognize this new kosovo and would work to stop its independence in its tracks .
" serbia has reacted and will react with all peaceful , diplomatic and legal means to annul this act committed by kosovo 's institutions , " he said . serbia 's main ally , russia , soon threw its considerable weight behind tadic 's message by calling a special meeting of the united nations security council to discuss the issue late sunday , but failed to secure backing for its call to declare kosovo 's declaration " null and void . " china expressed concern about the effects kosovo 's declaration would have on peace in the balkans , urging the two governments to work out their problems through dialogue .
" kosovo 's unilateral act can produce a series of results that will lead to seriously negative influence on peace and stability in the balkan region and on the realization of building a multiethnic society in kosovo , which china is deeply concerned about , " foreign affairs ministry spokesman liu jianchao said . " china calls on the two sides of serbia and kosovo to continue to seek a proper solution through negotiation within the framework of international law , and the international community should create favorable conditions for this , " he added . concerns over wave of separatist declarations sri lanka , a country with its own problems with separatism , said it was concerned about kosovo 's unilateral declaration of independence , as it could set a precedent in other parts of the world and hurt nations . " the unilateral declaration of independence by kosovo could set an unmanageable precedent in the conduct of international relations , the established global order of sovereign states and could thus pose a grave threat to international peace and security , " the foreign ministry said in a statement .
" this action by kosovo is a violation of the charter of the united nations , which enshrines the sovereignty and territorial integrity of member states . " sri lankan forces have been fighting a 25-year insurgency by tamil separatists , who want an independent homeland in the east and north of the island . new zealand 's prime minister helen clark announced that her country would not recognize an independent kosovo , saying it was never the government 's position to offer diplomatic recognition in such circumstances .

" the sorry history of kosovo means that we 've got to do whatever we can do to ensure the citizens of that part of the world are protected into the future , " rudd said .

that 's why diplomatically we would extend diplomatic recognition at the earliest opportunity . " taiwan 's independence-leaning government echoed australia 's stance .
" self-determination is a right recognized by the united nations , and it is the people who are masters of their nation 's future , " the foreign ministry said in a statement .
" in no way should the independence of one nation be denied by another .

britain , france , germany and italy are expected to officially give recognition , but greece , cyprus , romania , slovakia , spain and bulgaria have all expressed their opposition .
slovenia 's foreign minister dimitrij rupel , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , told reporters that he understood that " many eu member states " would recognize kosovo 's independence . " recognition is not a matter for the eu as a whole - it 's member states who will decide , " rupel said said as he arrived for a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels , adding that there was likely to be " a lively discussion .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the streets of belgrade erupted in violence riot police battled hundreds of youths with batons after the baying mob had smashed two mcdonald 's restaurants and attacked the us and slovenian embassies with stones .
hospital officials said at least 50 people , including 20 policemen , were injured during the rioting , but none seriously . earlier , in the south of serbia , members of the kosovo police service stopped several hundred former serbian army reservists dressed in military uniforms from crossing into the province ahead of the declaration . international reactions reflect divide away from the streets , the international community soon began positioning itself in the two camps of " for " and " against .

" serbia has reacted and will react with all peaceful , diplomatic and legal means to annul this act committed by kosovo 's institutions , " he said . serbia 's main ally , russia , soon threw its considerable weight behind tadic 's message by calling a special meeting of the united nations security council to discuss the issue late sunday , but failed to secure backing for its call to declare kosovo 's declaration " null and void . " china expressed concern about the effects kosovo 's declaration would have on peace in the balkans , urging the two governments to work out their problems through dialogue .
" kosovo 's unilateral act can produce a series of results that will lead to seriously negative influence on peace and stability in the balkan region and on the realization of building a multiethnic society in kosovo , which china is deeply concerned about , " foreign affairs ministry spokesman liu jianchao said . " china calls on the two sides of serbia and kosovo to continue to seek a proper solution through negotiation within the framework of international law , and the international community should create favorable conditions for this , " he added . concerns over wave of separatist declarations sri lanka , a country with its own problems with separatism , said it was concerned about kosovo 's unilateral declaration of independence , as it could set a precedent in other parts of the world and hurt nations . " the unilateral declaration of independence by kosovo could set an unmanageable precedent in the conduct of international relations , the established global order of sovereign states and could thus pose a grave threat to international peace and security , " the foreign ministry said in a statement .
" this action by kosovo is a violation of the charter of the united nations , which enshrines the sovereignty and territorial integrity of member states . " sri lankan forces have been fighting a 25-year insurgency by tamil separatists , who want an independent homeland in the east and north of the island . new zealand 's prime minister helen clark announced that her country would not recognize an independent kosovo , saying it was never the government 's position to offer diplomatic recognition in such circumstances .
" we neither recognize nor not recognize , " she said .
" we are not intending to make a formal statement . " supporters say stability comes from recognition bildunterschrift : kosovo thanks its supporters but not everyone is in favor australia led the early calls of support for independent kosovo , with prime minister kevin rudd announcing that australia would recognize the new state .
" the sorry history of kosovo means that we 've got to do whatever we can do to ensure the citizens of that part of the world are protected into the future , " rudd said .
" this would appear to be the right course of action .
that 's why diplomatically we would extend diplomatic recognition at the earliest opportunity . " taiwan 's independence-leaning government echoed australia 's stance .
" self-determination is a right recognized by the united nations , and it is the people who are masters of their nation 's future , " the foreign ministry said in a statement .
" in no way should the independence of one nation be denied by another . " taiwan is a member of the international community that cherishes democracy and freedom , and the government is delighted that the people of kosovo have the fruits of independence , democracy and freedom to look forward to , " it said . western powers biding their time the united states and the european union were to make formal statements later in the day , but were both expected to recognize the new kosovo , despite a split over independence in the eu .
britain , france , germany and italy are expected to officially give recognition , but greece , cyprus , romania , slovakia , spain and bulgaria have all expressed their opposition .
slovenia 's foreign minister dimitrij rupel , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , told reporters that he understood that " many eu member states " would recognize kosovo 's independence . " recognition is not a matter for the eu as a whole - it 's member states who will decide , " rupel said said as he arrived for a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels , adding that there was likely to be " a lively discussion . "
" i can not tell you what we shall conclude at the end , but certainly i expect that we shall continue with this tradition of unity that we have established " with the creation of a new eu justice mission to kosovo , rupel said . german chancellor angela merkel said that germany would not make a decision on the recognition of kosovo yet , as the main priority was for the european union to act together on kosovo .

on the contrary , a possible economic embargo by the serbian government - cutting off electricity , food and water supplies , internet and telephone connections - could make daily life harder for people in kosovo .
without generous eu support , the country will not be able to free itself from years of economic agony .
considering previous foreign aid worth billions , expectations should n't be too high that the money will lead to a rapid economic upswing . but the question whether the international community will manage to erect a truly democratic state that can integrate all its citizens is far more complicated than the economic situation .
it 's certainly possible that the 120,000 serbs in kosovo - backed by belgrade - will refuse to cooperate with the government in pristina and build parallel structures .
in the worst case , a similar situation to the " frozen conflict " in northern cyprus could develop in the long term . pristina 's declaration of independence is a tough test for the fragile coalition in belgrade .

the municipal elections in may will - at the latest - force serbia to once more decide whether it wants to choose a path towards the eu or russia . the controversial step towards independence also adds oil to the fire in neighboring republics , such as the serbian entity in bosnia .
bosnians serbs are unlikely to call for independence and accession to serbia - there 's too much international pressure .

the presence of 16,000 nato soldiers , who are meant to be able to prevent major unrest , brings some comfort in that respect . eu member states , a large majority of which will recognize kosovo diplomatically , know that the balkan peace process will remain a mammoth task .

opinion : long road to normalcy in kosovo kosovo -pipe- 18.02.2008 us , germany cautious on kosovo as separatists call for action großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and merkel are playing the waiting game over kosovo the united states and germany issued statements suggesting they would recognize kosovo 's independence but gave no official blessing .
meanwhile , fears of knock-on separatist action increased with unrest in bosnia . while not officially recognizing kosovo as an independent state , us president george w. bush said monday that the kosovars " are now independent " but added that us recognition would be guided by the un-supported ahtisaari plan .
" the ahtisaari plan is our blueprint forward , " bush said when asked in an interview if washington will officially recognize kosovo as a country .
but , bush added , " the kosovars are now independent .
it 's something i 've advocated along with my government . "
in berlin , german chancellor angela merkel said germany would not take an immediate decision on recognizing kosovo 's independence but wait for the european union to spell out its position .
" we will not take a decision today on recognizing kosovo 's independence .
ministers from the eu will meet today to put in place a platform that will allow each member to take a position on the declaration of independence , " she told reporters in berlin .
" so taking a decision on recognition is not on the order of the day .
the order of the day is first of all to answers questions of substance as to the eu 's platform . "
germany had been expected to formally recognize kosovo on monday along with britain , france , italy and the united states .
merkel added that kosovo was an isolated case not comparable with that in other countries and she stressed that the future of both kosovo and serbia lay with the european union .
" the whole situation in the western balkans can only be kept calm and peaceful from my point of view if we keep the european perspective as the perspective for the future for both serbia and kosovo , " merkel said .
chancellor calls for protection of minorities merkel stressed that kosovo and other countries in the region had to respect their minorities if they were to have a future in the european union .
" all must live with their minorities , " she said , acknowledging difficulties that stretched back over centuries .
without a european future for the countries of the former yugoslavia , she added , " the prospects for free democracy and securing economic development are much , much worse . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said the eu 's relations with russia were stable asked whether differences over kosovo would hurt eu-russian relations , merkel said the russian objections were of a principled nature and its attitude would not change .
but she added that eu relations with russia were " of a strategic nature and ... very stable . "
" we should in as far as possible try to come to the best diplomatic conclusions , " she said .
" we have strategic relations with russia that are capable of surviving differences of opinion because they are very stable . "
eu foreign ministers were locked in a crisis meeting in brussels monday to discuss the response to kosovo 's split from serbia on sunday amid signs of intense behind-the-scenes wrangling over recognition of the new state .
while some of the larger member states support the declaration , many others refuse to accept kosovo 's decision .
eu divisions exacerbated by separatist concerns the already difficult situation of presenting a united front on kosovo was made worse when spain announced that the socialist government will not give diplomatic recognition to the new state , and that spain 's conservative opposition had agreed with the government 's position .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain fears action by eta , the armed basque separatists spain fears that the serbian province 's declaration of independence could inspire its basque separatists to take a similar step .
these fears gained some credibility when it was revealed that the main opposition bosnian serb party had called for the independence of the serb-run half of bosnia monday , citing kosovo as a precedent .
" the serb democratic party -lsb- sds -rsb- is demanding republika srpska 's institutions provide -lsb- bosnian serbs -rsb- the same rights being given to kosovo albanians , " said the party , which was founded by war crimes fugitive radovan karadzic .
" we expect the -lsb- bosnian serb -rsb- government to meet previous promises and check the will of republika srpska citizens in a referendum , " the sds said in a statement .
since its 1992-1995 war , bosnia has consisted of two entities , the serb-run republika srpska -lsb- rs -rsb- and the muslim-croat federation , each with their own government , parliament and police force .
the sds was established in the early 1990s by karadzic , who remains at large around 12 years after the un war crimes tribunal charged him with genocide over the srebrenica massacre and siege of sarajevo .
bosnian serbs cite kosovo as precedent many bosnian serbs feel that their entity should follow kosovo 's lead and be allowed to secede from bosnia to be eventually attached to serbia , which they see as their motherland .
some local politicians have hinted that the rs could try such a move .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests in banja luka had xenophobic undertones meanwhile , up to 3,000 bosnian serbs gathered in banja luka to protest against kosovo 's independence .
" europe shame on you , world shame on you " and " hashim murderer " , the protestors chanted in a reference to kosovo prime minister hashim thaci .
they also chanted offensive slogans using derogatory terms for albanians .
the protest , organized by students , started with a minute 's silence , followed by another minute of hissing to voice disagreement with kosovo 's unilateral move .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 18.02.2008 germany faces political dilemma in afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are uneasy about combat missions while experts say germany will likely increase its military involvement in afghanistan , the subject remains politically taboo .
the gap between german rhetoric and reality is likely to increase as elections near . the german army 's afghanistan mission is testing berlin 's long-held prohibition against involvement in foreign combat missions like never before .
yet germany 's resistance has more to do with politics than moral qualms , experts say . the german government has spent recent weeks insisting that it has no plans to significantly increase its involvement in afghanistan .
it stood firm even as nato allies , particularly the united states , pressured germany to increase involvement in fighting taliban forces in southern afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has a very strong pacificst movement with national elections scheduled for 2009 , elected officials are n't going to commit political suicide by proposing germany fight alongside nato allies in southern afghanistan , said thomas bauer of the center for applied policy research at the university of munich and an expert in german foreign affairs . " the moment this government decides to send in combat troops to the southern part of afghanistan , they will lose the next election , " bauer said . germany : a reluctant warrior the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , will try to win the next elections by portraying their coalition partners , chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , as pro-military .
to win votes , the left party will try to portray both the spd and cdu as warmongers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party will use afghanistan to score points with german pacifists " pushing this pacifist button " wins elections , bauer said . all of germany 's main political parties , with the exception of the left party , understand germany has a global responsibility which includes sending forces abroad and want to increase participation in nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
but they are afraid of voter backlash , experts say . germans remain deeply uneasy about taking part in military missions .
there 's the specter of world war ii and a long tradition of pacifism born during the cold war . this unease is shown by the limited scope parliament gave the bundeswehr in afghanistan .
the military can send a maximum of 3,500 soldiers to work out of the relatively peaceful north of the country where it is involved in rebuilding as well as peacekeeping and stabilization efforts . " it is important for nato to be seen as a community that implements its security strategy as a whole , " german defense minister franz-josef jung said recently , while insisting that germany will not participate in fighting in the south . increased involvement a tough sell bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some have questioned whether a political strategy exists in afghanistan the german public is overwhelmingly opposed to increasing the presence in afghanistan .
two out of every three say they want germany out of afghanistan as soon as possible . this has led to a certain amount of dishonesty in the political discourse surrounding afghanistan .
germany 's troop contribution to a quick reaction force is a perfect example of the divide between rhetoric and reality , said citha maass , the afghanistan expert at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs . germany agreed to send an additional 200 combat troops in july to take over for a norwegian contingent .
this force will be based in the north , but will assist allies in other regions .
these troops will have a combat component , maass said . " instead of discussing publically that you need some combat function , the government tries to hide it , " she said . on friday , feb .
15 , after denying press reports for days , the german government admitted it will discuss raising the number of troops in afghanistan when the parliamentary mandate comes up for renewal in the fall .
there 's also the possibility of changing the length of the mandate so that it does n't require renewal during election campaigning , according to press reports .
germany is , however , expected to stand firm on refusing to join fighting in the south . germany shirking its duties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has refused to join combat missions in southern afghanistan norine macdonald has spent most of the past three years doing field research in afghanistan as the president of the senlis council , a security and development think tank .
she said germany 's reluctance to get involved with fighting the taliban and al qaeda forces in southern afghanistan is outrageous and incomprehensible . german politicians lack the political will and the political skill to speak about the reality of the threat in afghanistan , macdonald said , something which she feels is " deeply irresponsible . " " germany is trying to create an alternate version of reality about afghanistan , " she said .
" unless you are going to go fight in the south , you are not part of the nato efforts to stabilize afghanistan . " unclear political goals in afghanistan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been focused on humanitarian aid the taliban and al qaeda forces control secondary roads in afghanistan 's south and are moving closer to kabul each month , . of nato members , only the united states , canada , the netherlands and great britain currently have troops are currently fighting in the south . there 's increasing worry among experts that the nato mission could fail to contain the taliban . part of the problem is that no one really knows what the ultimate goal is in afghanistan , said andreas heinemann-grüder , a senior researcher at the bonn-based bicc , an organization which focuses on peace building and conflict resolution issues . " the point is that they do n't know what they 're striving for , " heinemann-grüder said .

the gap between german rhetoric and reality is likely to increase as elections near . the german army 's afghanistan mission is testing berlin 's long-held prohibition against involvement in foreign combat missions like never before .
yet germany 's resistance has more to do with politics than moral qualms , experts say . the german government has spent recent weeks insisting that it has no plans to significantly increase its involvement in afghanistan .
it stood firm even as nato allies , particularly the united states , pressured germany to increase involvement in fighting taliban forces in southern afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has a very strong pacificst movement with national elections scheduled for 2009 , elected officials are n't going to commit political suicide by proposing germany fight alongside nato allies in southern afghanistan , said thomas bauer of the center for applied policy research at the university of munich and an expert in german foreign affairs . " the moment this government decides to send in combat troops to the southern part of afghanistan , they will lose the next election , " bauer said . germany : a reluctant warrior the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , will try to win the next elections by portraying their coalition partners , chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , as pro-military .
to win votes , the left party will try to portray both the spd and cdu as warmongers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party will use afghanistan to score points with german pacifists " pushing this pacifist button " wins elections , bauer said . all of germany 's main political parties , with the exception of the left party , understand germany has a global responsibility which includes sending forces abroad and want to increase participation in nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
but they are afraid of voter backlash , experts say . germans remain deeply uneasy about taking part in military missions .
there 's the specter of world war ii and a long tradition of pacifism born during the cold war . this unease is shown by the limited scope parliament gave the bundeswehr in afghanistan .
the military can send a maximum of 3,500 soldiers to work out of the relatively peaceful north of the country where it is involved in rebuilding as well as peacekeeping and stabilization efforts . " it is important for nato to be seen as a community that implements its security strategy as a whole , " german defense minister franz-josef jung said recently , while insisting that germany will not participate in fighting in the south . increased involvement a tough sell bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some have questioned whether a political strategy exists in afghanistan the german public is overwhelmingly opposed to increasing the presence in afghanistan .
two out of every three say they want germany out of afghanistan as soon as possible . this has led to a certain amount of dishonesty in the political discourse surrounding afghanistan .
germany 's troop contribution to a quick reaction force is a perfect example of the divide between rhetoric and reality , said citha maass , the afghanistan expert at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs . germany agreed to send an additional 200 combat troops in july to take over for a norwegian contingent .
this force will be based in the north , but will assist allies in other regions .
these troops will have a combat component , maass said . " instead of discussing publically that you need some combat function , the government tries to hide it , " she said . on friday , feb .
15 , after denying press reports for days , the german government admitted it will discuss raising the number of troops in afghanistan when the parliamentary mandate comes up for renewal in the fall .
there 's also the possibility of changing the length of the mandate so that it does n't require renewal during election campaigning , according to press reports .
germany is , however , expected to stand firm on refusing to join fighting in the south . germany shirking its duties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has refused to join combat missions in southern afghanistan norine macdonald has spent most of the past three years doing field research in afghanistan as the president of the senlis council , a security and development think tank .
she said germany 's reluctance to get involved with fighting the taliban and al qaeda forces in southern afghanistan is outrageous and incomprehensible . german politicians lack the political will and the political skill to speak about the reality of the threat in afghanistan , macdonald said , something which she feels is " deeply irresponsible . " " germany is trying to create an alternate version of reality about afghanistan , " she said .
" unless you are going to go fight in the south , you are not part of the nato efforts to stabilize afghanistan . " unclear political goals in afghanistan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been focused on humanitarian aid the taliban and al qaeda forces control secondary roads in afghanistan 's south and are moving closer to kabul each month , . of nato members , only the united states , canada , the netherlands and great britain currently have troops are currently fighting in the south . there 's increasing worry among experts that the nato mission could fail to contain the taliban . part of the problem is that no one really knows what the ultimate goal is in afghanistan , said andreas heinemann-grüder , a senior researcher at the bonn-based bicc , an organization which focuses on peace building and conflict resolution issues . " the point is that they do n't know what they 're striving for , " heinemann-grüder said .

but real peace in the balkans is still in the distant future , says dw 's verica spasovska . " calm and moderation " was berlin 's first cautious reaction .
for good reason , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier is calling on all involved parties in the region to keep a sober mind .
the cries of joy in pristina can not hide the fact that kosovo 's independence is n't solving all the problems of the balkans .
in reality , they 've only just begun . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verica spasovska first off , the high-flying expectations of many a citizen of kosovo that independence will automatically bring masses of foreign investors to the country will not be fulfilled that quickly .
on the contrary , a possible economic embargo by the serbian government - cutting off electricity , food and water supplies , internet and telephone connections - could make daily life harder for people in kosovo .
without generous eu support , the country will not be able to free itself from years of economic agony .
considering previous foreign aid worth billions , expectations should n't be too high that the money will lead to a rapid economic upswing . but the question whether the international community will manage to erect a truly democratic state that can integrate all its citizens is far more complicated than the economic situation .
it 's certainly possible that the 120,000 serbs in kosovo - backed by belgrade - will refuse to cooperate with the government in pristina and build parallel structures .
in the worst case , a similar situation to the " frozen conflict " in northern cyprus could develop in the long term . pristina 's declaration of independence is a tough test for the fragile coalition in belgrade .
national-conservative premier kostunica has already announced that he will reject all agreements that bring serbia closer to the eu in case of the recognition of kosovo by eu states .
president tadic meanwhile does not want to give up his pro-european stance .
at the same time , the serbian radical party is strengthening its position as the strongest fraction in parliament .
the municipal elections in may will - at the latest - force serbia to once more decide whether it wants to choose a path towards the eu or russia . the controversial step towards independence also adds oil to the fire in neighboring republics , such as the serbian entity in bosnia .
bosnians serbs are unlikely to call for independence and accession to serbia - there 's too much international pressure .
but citing kosovo , they 'll continue to test to what extent they can block the central government in sarajevo . bosnia , which has been under international control for more than a decade , also shows quite clearly the limits of " controlled independence . "
some are already beginning to ask how long kosovo albanians will put up with the semi-protectorate dictated by the eu .
the presence of 16,000 nato soldiers , who are meant to be able to prevent major unrest , brings some comfort in that respect . eu member states , a large majority of which will recognize kosovo diplomatically , know that the balkan peace process will remain a mammoth task .
the only way out of the dilemma may be a future in which national borders play a subordinate role .
only when kosovo and serbia are eu members , will the balkan find long-term peace .

but real peace in the balkans is still in the distant future , says dw 's verica spasovska . " calm and moderation " was berlin 's first cautious reaction .
for good reason , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier is calling on all involved parties in the region to keep a sober mind .
the cries of joy in pristina can not hide the fact that kosovo 's independence is n't solving all the problems of the balkans .
in reality , they 've only just begun . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : verica spasovska first off , the high-flying expectations of many a citizen of kosovo that independence will automatically bring masses of foreign investors to the country will not be fulfilled that quickly .
on the contrary , a possible economic embargo by the serbian government - cutting off electricity , food and water supplies , internet and telephone connections - could make daily life harder for people in kosovo .
without generous eu support , the country will not be able to free itself from years of economic agony .
considering previous foreign aid worth billions , expectations should n't be too high that the money will lead to a rapid economic upswing . but the question whether the international community will manage to erect a truly democratic state that can integrate all its citizens is far more complicated than the economic situation .
it 's certainly possible that the 120,000 serbs in kosovo - backed by belgrade - will refuse to cooperate with the government in pristina and build parallel structures .
in the worst case , a similar situation to the " frozen conflict " in northern cyprus could develop in the long term . pristina 's declaration of independence is a tough test for the fragile coalition in belgrade .
national-conservative premier kostunica has already announced that he will reject all agreements that bring serbia closer to the eu in case of the recognition of kosovo by eu states .
president tadic meanwhile does not want to give up his pro-european stance .
at the same time , the serbian radical party is strengthening its position as the strongest fraction in parliament .
the municipal elections in may will - at the latest - force serbia to once more decide whether it wants to choose a path towards the eu or russia . the controversial step towards independence also adds oil to the fire in neighboring republics , such as the serbian entity in bosnia .
bosnians serbs are unlikely to call for independence and accession to serbia - there 's too much international pressure .
but citing kosovo , they 'll continue to test to what extent they can block the central government in sarajevo . bosnia , which has been under international control for more than a decade , also shows quite clearly the limits of " controlled independence . "
some are already beginning to ask how long kosovo albanians will put up with the semi-protectorate dictated by the eu .
the presence of 16,000 nato soldiers , who are meant to be able to prevent major unrest , brings some comfort in that respect . eu member states , a large majority of which will recognize kosovo diplomatically , know that the balkan peace process will remain a mammoth task .

18 , it was the differences of their clean-up operations which summed up the feelings not only of their country folk but those of the international community at large . in kosovo 's capital , the detritus of celebration littered the streets as the sun rose on the country 's first full day of self-declared independence from serbia .
tens of thousands of people celebrated long into the night in central pristina on sunday in recognition of the kosovo parliament 's formal vote to break from serbia , a move that completed the conflict-strewn breakup of the former yugoslavia . however , as the first rays of light settled on belgrade , the night 's events in the serbian capital told a different story . the rubble , broken glass and spent tear gas canisters spoke volumes about the serbian response : riots in protest against kosovo 's declaration had swept through the streets for several hours , with the wrath of the crowd focused on the symbols of those they perceived as helping tear serbian 's heartland province away .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the streets of belgrade erupted in violence riot police battled hundreds of youths with batons after the baying mob had smashed two mcdonald 's restaurants and attacked the us and slovenian embassies with stones .
hospital officials said at least 50 people , including 20 policemen , were injured during the rioting , but none seriously . earlier , in the south of serbia , members of the kosovo police service stopped several hundred former serbian army reservists dressed in military uniforms from crossing into the province ahead of the declaration . international reactions reflect divide away from the streets , the international community soon began positioning itself in the two camps of " for " and " against . "
the trickle of responses began early , with those opposing the move striking quickly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia 's reaction would be peaceful but forceful said tadic serbia 's president boris tadic attempted to calm fears of escalating violence by speaking diplomatically , but the message was clear : serbia would not recognize this new kosovo and would work to stop its independence in its tracks .
" serbia has reacted and will react with all peaceful , diplomatic and legal means to annul this act committed by kosovo 's institutions , " he said . serbia 's main ally , russia , soon threw its considerable weight behind tadic 's message by calling a special meeting of the united nations security council to discuss the issue late sunday , but failed to secure backing for its call to declare kosovo 's declaration " null and void . " china expressed concern about the effects kosovo 's declaration would have on peace in the balkans , urging the two governments to work out their problems through dialogue .
" kosovo 's unilateral act can produce a series of results that will lead to seriously negative influence on peace and stability in the balkan region and on the realization of building a multiethnic society in kosovo , which china is deeply concerned about , " foreign affairs ministry spokesman liu jianchao said . " china calls on the two sides of serbia and kosovo to continue to seek a proper solution through negotiation within the framework of international law , and the international community should create favorable conditions for this , " he added . concerns over wave of separatist declarations sri lanka , a country with its own problems with separatism , said it was concerned about kosovo 's unilateral declaration of independence , as it could set a precedent in other parts of the world and hurt nations . " the unilateral declaration of independence by kosovo could set an unmanageable precedent in the conduct of international relations , the established global order of sovereign states and could thus pose a grave threat to international peace and security , " the foreign ministry said in a statement .
" this action by kosovo is a violation of the charter of the united nations , which enshrines the sovereignty and territorial integrity of member states . " sri lankan forces have been fighting a 25-year insurgency by tamil separatists , who want an independent homeland in the east and north of the island . new zealand 's prime minister helen clark announced that her country would not recognize an independent kosovo , saying it was never the government 's position to offer diplomatic recognition in such circumstances .
" we neither recognize nor not recognize , " she said .
" we are not intending to make a formal statement . " supporters say stability comes from recognition bildunterschrift : kosovo thanks its supporters but not everyone is in favor australia led the early calls of support for independent kosovo , with prime minister kevin rudd announcing that australia would recognize the new state .
" the sorry history of kosovo means that we 've got to do whatever we can do to ensure the citizens of that part of the world are protected into the future , " rudd said .
" this would appear to be the right course of action .
that 's why diplomatically we would extend diplomatic recognition at the earliest opportunity . " taiwan 's independence-leaning government echoed australia 's stance .
" self-determination is a right recognized by the united nations , and it is the people who are masters of their nation 's future , " the foreign ministry said in a statement .
" in no way should the independence of one nation be denied by another . " taiwan is a member of the international community that cherishes democracy and freedom , and the government is delighted that the people of kosovo have the fruits of independence , democracy and freedom to look forward to , " it said . western powers biding their time the united states and the european union were to make formal statements later in the day , but were both expected to recognize the new kosovo , despite a split over independence in the eu .
britain , france , germany and italy are expected to officially give recognition , but greece , cyprus , romania , slovakia , spain and bulgaria have all expressed their opposition .
slovenia 's foreign minister dimitrij rupel , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , told reporters that he understood that " many eu member states " would recognize kosovo 's independence . " recognition is not a matter for the eu as a whole - it 's member states who will decide , " rupel said said as he arrived for a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels , adding that there was likely to be " a lively discussion . "
" i can not tell you what we shall conclude at the end , but certainly i expect that we shall continue with this tradition of unity that we have established " with the creation of a new eu justice mission to kosovo , rupel said . german chancellor angela merkel said that germany would not make a decision on the recognition of kosovo yet , as the main priority was for the european union to act together on kosovo .

tens of thousands of people celebrated long into the night in central pristina on sunday in recognition of the kosovo parliament 's formal vote to break from serbia , a move that completed the conflict-strewn breakup of the former yugoslavia . however , as the first rays of light settled on belgrade , the night 's events in the serbian capital told a different story . the rubble , broken glass and spent tear gas canisters spoke volumes about the serbian response : riots in protest against kosovo 's declaration had swept through the streets for several hours , with the wrath of the crowd focused on the symbols of those they perceived as helping tear serbian 's heartland province away .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the streets of belgrade erupted in violence riot police battled hundreds of youths with batons after the baying mob had smashed two mcdonald 's restaurants and attacked the us and slovenian embassies with stones .
hospital officials said at least 50 people , including 20 policemen , were injured during the rioting , but none seriously . earlier , in the south of serbia , members of the kosovo police service stopped several hundred former serbian army reservists dressed in military uniforms from crossing into the province ahead of the declaration . international reactions reflect divide away from the streets , the international community soon began positioning itself in the two camps of " for " and " against . "
the trickle of responses began early , with those opposing the move striking quickly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : serbia 's reaction would be peaceful but forceful said tadic serbia 's president boris tadic attempted to calm fears of escalating violence by speaking diplomatically , but the message was clear : serbia would not recognize this new kosovo and would work to stop its independence in its tracks .
" serbia has reacted and will react with all peaceful , diplomatic and legal means to annul this act committed by kosovo 's institutions , " he said . serbia 's main ally , russia , soon threw its considerable weight behind tadic 's message by calling a special meeting of the united nations security council to discuss the issue late sunday , but failed to secure backing for its call to declare kosovo 's declaration " null and void . " china expressed concern about the effects kosovo 's declaration would have on peace in the balkans , urging the two governments to work out their problems through dialogue .
" kosovo 's unilateral act can produce a series of results that will lead to seriously negative influence on peace and stability in the balkan region and on the realization of building a multiethnic society in kosovo , which china is deeply concerned about , " foreign affairs ministry spokesman liu jianchao said . " china calls on the two sides of serbia and kosovo to continue to seek a proper solution through negotiation within the framework of international law , and the international community should create favorable conditions for this , " he added . concerns over wave of separatist declarations sri lanka , a country with its own problems with separatism , said it was concerned about kosovo 's unilateral declaration of independence , as it could set a precedent in other parts of the world and hurt nations . " the unilateral declaration of independence by kosovo could set an unmanageable precedent in the conduct of international relations , the established global order of sovereign states and could thus pose a grave threat to international peace and security , " the foreign ministry said in a statement .
" this action by kosovo is a violation of the charter of the united nations , which enshrines the sovereignty and territorial integrity of member states . " sri lankan forces have been fighting a 25-year insurgency by tamil separatists , who want an independent homeland in the east and north of the island . new zealand 's prime minister helen clark announced that her country would not recognize an independent kosovo , saying it was never the government 's position to offer diplomatic recognition in such circumstances .
" we neither recognize nor not recognize , " she said .
" we are not intending to make a formal statement . " supporters say stability comes from recognition bildunterschrift : kosovo thanks its supporters but not everyone is in favor australia led the early calls of support for independent kosovo , with prime minister kevin rudd announcing that australia would recognize the new state .
" the sorry history of kosovo means that we 've got to do whatever we can do to ensure the citizens of that part of the world are protected into the future , " rudd said .
" this would appear to be the right course of action .
that 's why diplomatically we would extend diplomatic recognition at the earliest opportunity . " taiwan 's independence-leaning government echoed australia 's stance .
" self-determination is a right recognized by the united nations , and it is the people who are masters of their nation 's future , " the foreign ministry said in a statement .
" in no way should the independence of one nation be denied by another . " taiwan is a member of the international community that cherishes democracy and freedom , and the government is delighted that the people of kosovo have the fruits of independence , democracy and freedom to look forward to , " it said . western powers biding their time the united states and the european union were to make formal statements later in the day , but were both expected to recognize the new kosovo , despite a split over independence in the eu .
britain , france , germany and italy are expected to officially give recognition , but greece , cyprus , romania , slovakia , spain and bulgaria have all expressed their opposition .
slovenia 's foreign minister dimitrij rupel , whose country holds the eu 's rotating presidency , told reporters that he understood that " many eu member states " would recognize kosovo 's independence . " recognition is not a matter for the eu as a whole - it 's member states who will decide , " rupel said said as he arrived for a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels , adding that there was likely to be " a lively discussion . "
" i can not tell you what we shall conclude at the end , but certainly i expect that we shall continue with this tradition of unity that we have established " with the creation of a new eu justice mission to kosovo , rupel said . german chancellor angela merkel said that germany would not make a decision on the recognition of kosovo yet , as the main priority was for the european union to act together on kosovo . " germany will not take a decision -lsb- on the recognition of kosovo -rsb- today , " merkel told germany 's foreign press association -lrb- vap -rrb- .
" the aim is to have a platform of unity within the eu , on which each member state can act . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke to him about the film 's reception , brazil and on-screen violence . dw-world.de : you decided on a first-person narrator who tells the story off-camera .
it 's a means to make the viewer identify with the main character , a brutal police officer .
were you conscious of the possibility that the protagonist could also be understood as the hero ? jose padilha : the movie 's main character is n't seen that way at all .
some newspapers wrote that the brazilians had found a hero in captain nascimento and that that would mean the brazilian people were in favor of violence .
that 's not the case .
that 's a distortion of brazilian reality . narration in the first-person form is common in film .
indeed , it does create a relationship between the viewer and the character who 's telling the story .
the viewer sees the movie through the eyes of this character .
but i do n't see it as a problem to do that with a police officer in order to understand his point of view .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : padilha certainly got people talking in the same manner , i do n't have a problem with scorsese 's choice in " good fellas . "
the main character is a mafioso .
as the viewer , you 're on his side the whole time , and that certainly does n't mean that you think the mafia is good .
the viewer has the ability to keep fiction and reality separate .
many critics underestimate that , but i believe that the viewer is smart enough to understand what he sees . the depiction of the brazilian middle class in your film was very controversial in brazil - the same middle and upper class that place the entire blame for social problems on the governments , without bearing in mind that they exploit their domestic help .
is your movie the beginning of a consciousness in that respect ? urban violence in brazil is viewed as a private war between criminals and drug dealers .
the middle class thus counts itself out .
but it goes without saying that it 's involved .
it takes part in this war .
when a drug user buys his dope from an armed group that controls a poor neighborhood , he 's backing the drug dealer 's weapons .
the user is aware of it all .
he 's part of this societal process . the hypocrisy is enormous among the brazilian middle class .
many of the people who have money take advantage of police corruption .
someone from the middle class who 's committed an offense can bribe a police officer and wo n't even be arrested .
there 's complicity between this middle class and the current situation in brazil , which causes violence . bildunterschrift : padilha did not shy away from showing violence your movie is debated both in brazil as well as abroad .
there 's been serious criticism as well as much praise , but people are not neutral about it .
did you expect the film 's reception to be so contentious outside of brazil too ? it was clear that the discussion would come to berlin .
it was brought here by brazilian critics .
whether the polemic would have developed here , i ca n't say , maybe .
in any case , the discussion is interesting .
part of this debate developed because many people viewed interrelations with dated concepts .
the idea that one must observe a societal process from the right or the left is dead for me . my film sees reality through the metaphor of a game .
if you want to understand an individual 's behavior , you have to take into account that this person makes decisions according to the rules of a society .
that 's clear in the film .
what rules must a police officer from rio submit to ?
he earns $ 400 -lrb- 275 euros -rrb- a month , is poorly educated and must find his way within a completely corrupt structure .
and on top of that we want him to take a stand against heavily armed opponents in the favela -lsb- slums -rsb- in the name of the law .
he 's supposed to risk his life and for the long term . " tropa de elite " shows brazil as an unscrupulous country , whether in the callousness of the middle class or in the brutality of the police .
is there a way out of this situation ? the result of the game depends on the rules .
that means that if you change the rules , you can get a different result .
the players themselves determine these societal rules .
we can change a lot : the law that controls the drug trade , the police structures .
we can stop sending a violent police force into the slums , and instead we can build a school there .
one can change a lot .
my aim is to show that we have created this situation ourselves .
and so , we can change it to .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : padilha aimed to depict brazilian reality you worked together with one of the scriptwriters from " city of god . "
the two films have certain similarities : the unsteady camera , the editing and , to a certain extent , the soundtrack .
is there a new genre in brazilian film that favors violence packaged in a fast rhythm ? in those days , the prevailing opinion was that one could only make a critical film by using a distanced approach .
it was important not to involve the viewer emotionally .
that 's not been the case for ages .
in " city of god , " fernando meirelles saw precisely that .
i do n't need any slow sequences , which - referring to brecht - take the viewer out of the events and tell him : " now think about it . "
that 's not necessary . if i involve the viewer emotionally throughout the entire film , i create an even bigger debate in the end . i 'm not saying in any way that you should n't make slow films anymore .
for me , it 's about stressing that a movie that uses emotion to involve the viewer does n't need to preclude reason .
on the contrary , emotion brings reason into the film , much more so than a critical and distanced approach .
people may love or hate " tropa de elite , " but they are talking about the film .

the idea that one must observe a societal process from the right or the left is dead for me . my film sees reality through the metaphor of a game .
if you want to understand an individual 's behavior , you have to take into account that this person makes decisions according to the rules of a society .
that 's clear in the film .
what rules must a police officer from rio submit to ?
he earns $ 400 -lrb- 275 euros -rrb- a month , is poorly educated and must find his way within a completely corrupt structure .
and on top of that we want him to take a stand against heavily armed opponents in the favela -lsb- slums -rsb- in the name of the law .
he 's supposed to risk his life and for the long term . " tropa de elite " shows brazil as an unscrupulous country , whether in the callousness of the middle class or in the brutality of the police .
is there a way out of this situation ? the result of the game depends on the rules .
that means that if you change the rules , you can get a different result .
the players themselves determine these societal rules .
we can change a lot : the law that controls the drug trade , the police structures .
we can stop sending a violent police force into the slums , and instead we can build a school there .
one can change a lot .
my aim is to show that we have created this situation ourselves .
and so , we can change it to .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : padilha aimed to depict brazilian reality you worked together with one of the scriptwriters from " city of god . "
the two films have certain similarities : the unsteady camera , the editing and , to a certain extent , the soundtrack .
is there a new genre in brazilian film that favors violence packaged in a fast rhythm ? in those days , the prevailing opinion was that one could only make a critical film by using a distanced approach .
it was important not to involve the viewer emotionally .
that 's not been the case for ages .
in " city of god , " fernando meirelles saw precisely that .
i do n't need any slow sequences , which - referring to brecht - take the viewer out of the events and tell him : " now think about it . "
that 's not necessary . if i involve the viewer emotionally throughout the entire film , i create an even bigger debate in the end . i 'm not saying in any way that you should n't make slow films anymore .
for me , it 's about stressing that a movie that uses emotion to involve the viewer does n't need to preclude reason .
on the contrary , emotion brings reason into the film , much more so than a critical and distanced approach .
people may love or hate " tropa de elite , " but they are talking about the film .
that 's exactly what we wanted . interview : soraia vilela -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

18 with both countries calling emergency sessions of parliament to discuss their next moves . russian deputies gathered to finalize a text on the " consequences " of kosovo 's declaration while preparing an official condemnation of the act and urging un chief ban ki-moon to take a tougher stance . " the kosovo example could plunge the world into chaos , " senior parliamentarian mikhail margelov was quoted by itar-tass as saying .
the independence declaration goes against " international law and morality .
this is a dangerous precedent , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and kostunica stand side by side on kosovo ahead of further discussion at the united nations , russian foreign ministry official alexander botsan-kharchenko urged the un secretary general ban to stand up for un resolutions and rules that he said backed moscow 's stance . " we think he should clearly define his position , " botsan-kharchenko told reporters in new york .
whe should remain loyal to the united nations ' charter and to the security council 's resolution 1244 on kosovo . " a veto-wielding permanent member of the un security council , russia has consistently opposed kosovo 's bid for independence , siding with serbia .
however , despite its power within the un , russia failed to secure security council backing for a bid to declare the independence declaration by kosovo 's ethnic albanian majority " null and void . " russia balancing kosovo stance with own separatist issues russian newspapers on monday said russia was also likely to use kosovo 's declaration to put more pressure on neighboring georgia , which has two separatist provinces - abkhazia and south ossetia - that adjoin russia and have moscow 's de facto backing . despite opposing kosovo 's independence , russia has said that it could serve as a precedent for the separatist provinces .
at the same time moscow has said it does not plan to recognize independence for the two provinces , reflecting worries about separatism within russia 's own borders . south ossetia and abkhazia plan to ask russia and the un to recognize their independence following kosovo ’ s declaration of independence . " in the near future abkhazia will appeal to the russian parliament and the un security council with a request to recognize its independence , " self-declared abkhaz president sergei bagapsh was quoted as saying by the interfax news agency . " south ossetia will in the near future appeal to the commonwealth of independent states and the un with a request to recognize our independence , " south ossetian president eduard kokoity was also quoted as saying by the news agency , referring to a grouping of ex-soviet states that includes russia . moscow could open representative offices in the capitals of the two georgian provinces , a step just short of formal recognition of independence , kommersant newspaper said , quoting unnamed government sources . analysts say russia is balancing its position as it seeks to use its separatist allies in georgia to gain diplomatic advantage over the georgian leadership , which is seeking to join western institutions such as nato . serbia moves to counter " violation of sovereignty " meanwhile , the serbian parliament will convene in belgrade later monday to adopt a decision to " annul " kosovo 's independence proclamation on the grounds that it " violates the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the republic of serbia . " " the parliament of serbia should confirm the serbian government 's decision to annul illegal acts by interim kosovo authorities to unilaterally proclaim independence , " the tanjug state-run news agency reported . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kostunica 's government pursues its annulment plan president boris tadic and prime minister vojislav kostunica said serbia would " never recognize an independent kosovo " after the province 's declaration on sunday . serbia also announced that police had filed criminal charges against kosovo albanian leaders for " organizing the proclamation of a phony state on serbian territory , " according to tanjug . the charges were laid against kosovo president fatmir sejdiu , prime minister hashim thaci and parliament speaker jakup krasniqi , the state-run agency said , citing an interior ministry statement . the serbian government also decided to proclaim as " null and void " all decisions by the european union to send a mission to kosovo .
" these decisions have no legal foundation for serbia and produce no obligation of serbia towards the european union , " the government statement read . the eu is preparing a kosovo mission dubbed eulex , which is designed to help the 90-percent ethnic albanian territory on its road to independence by deploying some 2,000 personnel . kosovo has been run by the united nations since mid-1999 , after a nato air assault drove out serbian forces waging a brutal crackdown on separatist ethnic albanian guerrillas and their civilian supporters . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the concert brought both applause and protests . heesters is a controversial figure in the netherlands because of his cozy relationship with the nazi occupiers .
security was tight at the de flint theater in heester 's hometown of amersfoort , where he put on a concert for the first time since 1963 on saturday , feb .
16 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors equate the singer with fascism police said several dozen protesters as well as a few neo-nazis showed up outside the concert hall , but the performance went on undisturbed .
the last time heesters tried to peform in the netherlands , he was booed off the stage by the audience , who stood up and gave nazi salutes .
heesters was born in amersfoort , a town 50 kilometers -lrb- 35 miles -rrb- east of amsterdam in 1903 .
yet he made his fortune in germany .
the artist is revered by generations of germans for his operettas and film performances .
one of hitler 's " divinely gifted " artists heesters has been a popular german-language singer since the 1930s , becoming a favorite of the nazis and one of the " divinely gifted " artists who took part in performances to boost the morale of soldiers during the war .
heesters claims he did not know what was happening to jews during the war despite visiting the dachau concentration camp in 1941 .
" honestly , i was too busy working , " heesters said in an interview after a tv gala celebrating his 100th birthday in 2003 .
" i could n't do anything about politics . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heesters is considered a musical legend in germany while germans have taken heesters at his word and continue to watch his old films such as " always you " and " illusion , " many of his dutch countrymen have never forgiven him for his acceptance of the nazi regime during world war ii .
after the nazi defeat , heesters continued his career in germany , settling in bavaria .
heesters is considered to be the oldest living performer .
at the concert saturday , heesters performed hits such as " the merry widow " and " there by the windmill " despite breaking several ribs on jan .
1 during a fall .
at the concert he occasionally needed help from his wife to remember the lines , but otherwise sang with a steady voice , according to media reports . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke to balkans expert stefan wolff about what kosovo and the world can expect in the near future . stefan wolff is a professor of political science and director of the centre for international crisis management and conflict resolution at nottingham university in the uk .
he has extensive expertise in northern ireland , the balkans and central and eastern europe , and has also worked on a wide range of other conflicts elsewhere , including the middle east , africa , and central , south and southeast asia . dw-world.de : is kosovo prepared for independence in terms of infrastructure , governance , security and stability ? stefan wolff : kosovo has most of the important institutions of statehood and democratic governance in place , but at the same time these institutions will require continued international support for some time .
this is accepted by both the kosovars and the west and is the background against which we need to understand the eu mission for kosovo - as external assistance to consolidate existing institutional structures to enable kosovars to take care of developing their economy , infrastructure and ensure security and stability . the decision to declare independence is not a unanimous one within the population .
what minorities in kosovo have most to lose from this independence ? in principle , all minorities and the majority albanian population can gain from the clarification of kosovo 's international status , not least in the sense that they will all benefit from economic development .
prime minister thaci made some very important gestures yesterday towards reconciliation with serbs in kosovo .
the arthisaari plan offers important mechanisms to serbs to preserve and develop their identity , gives them opportunities to play a meaningful part in the political process in kosovo and retain ties with serbia .
from this perspective , there is no need for conflict between the two main population groups , but that does not mean that extremists on either side will refrain from violence and provocations .
so far , this risk has been contained , but not eliminated . what can we expect in terms of reaction and action from kosovo 's balkan neighbors ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few of the region 's conflicts are fully resolved the balkan region as a whole remains quite vulnerable to the threat of ethnic conflict .
we must bear in mind that few , if any , of the conflicts that led to bloodshed throughout the 1990s have really been resolved .
we have institutions in place now that help manage these conflicts politically , but tensions in bosnia and macedonia , for example , remain .
apart from albania and slovenia , i do n't think that any of the other balkan countries will find it a very easy decision to recognize kosovo .
eventually , however , macedonia , bosnia , croatia and montenegro will recognize the independence of kosovo , but this will not be a process free from domestic debate .
how will kosovo 's independence affect the wider balkan region ?
because of the close links between kosovo and two other major previous secessionist conflicts - bosnia , the serbs , and macedonia , the albanians - there is a danger that violence in and around kosovo could spread and create instability across the balkans .
there also remains an open question in relation to the future of albanians in southern serbia .
the overall hope , of course , remains that with kosovo 's independence the last major unresolved issue has been tackled and that the region as a whole can now move forward to closer integration with the eu .
while this will not be easy over the coming months , eventually a sense of reality will set in , and people will realize that this is there only real hope for the future .
serbia has vowed not to recognize an independent kosovo and has spoken of economic and diplomatic sanctions .
what can we expect from serbia in the coming days ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riots broke out in belgrade after kosovo 's declaration there are already signs of serbia backing down from the quite exaggerated threats of cutting diplomatic ties with any country recognizing kosovo .
this is simply not feasible for serbia , especially as the population there still has clear aspirations of eu membership and very strong economic interests both in the eu and the neighboring region .
we will , however , see further declarations and statements against kosovo 's independence and against its recognition by other states .
together with russia , serbia is most likely to try and mobilize the un against kosovo 's unilateral declaration of independence , and membership in the un and other international organizations will be very difficult to obtain for kosovo because of serbian resistance .
while the likelihood of a military conflict is close to zero , there remains a threat of localized violence in and around kosovo , but serious escalation is in nobody 's interest .
moreover , serbia has to think carefully about how to manage its relations with serbs in kosovo .
the arthisaari plan offers many important opportunities to do so , opportunities that kosovo albanians are ready to accept .
discouraging kosovo serb political participation in pristina will not be in the interests of serbs living there , and might further encourage them to leave rather than to stay .
what action do you expect to be taken by the international community in the coming days ?
we will gradually see recognition of kosovo as an independent state from major countries in the eu and the west more generally .
we should also expect support from the arab league and member countries of the organization of the islamic conference .
nato will have to be very alert towards any risk of violence in kosovo , not least in order to assure serbs that they can remain in kosovo and participate in building a democratic state .
russian opposition , on the other hand , also remains a clear fact , and russia will use its membership in the un , and possibly the osce and council of europe , to mobilize against kosovo 's independence .
this , in turn , could have a further negative impact on relations between russia and the west as a whole , again not something in either russia 's or the west 's interests .
is kosovo becoming a pawn in the current power games between the west and russia ?
if so , how will an independent kosovo affect relations ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia , serbia 's ally , remains in opposition to the west kosovo has , for some time , been one among several pawns in these power games .
now that independence has been declared , the issue has come to a head , but at the same time kosovo will gradually become less of an issue , precisely because a decision has been made .
russia may choose not to recognize it and bring it up before the security council and elsewhere , but it was in particular kosovo 's unresolved status that gave russia a certain degree of leverage .
in the long term , i think interest in kosovo will fade , especially if the transition to independence is smooth , no major violence occurs , and kosovo quickly gains recognition from a large number of countries beyond the core western powers .
what will the newly independent kosovo 's view be towards the european union and the west ?
kosovo albanians remain the most pro-european and pro-atlanticist of all the balkan people .
the challenge for prime minister thaci and president sejdiu will be to prepare kosovo politically , economically and socially for closer links with the eu and to overcome resistance within the eu from countries like cyprus , greece , romania , slovakia and spain who fear that kosovo sets an unwelcome precedent for secessionist threats that they themselves perceive .
from that perspective , kosovo and its supporters in the eu have a unique responsibility and opportunity to demonstrate that kosovo can develop into a full european , democratic state and that its independence does not lead to the instability and insecurity feared by some .

on the other hand , none of them can have a real interest in risking the eu 's ability to act swiftly and decisively over the kosovo issue .
this is not least the case because , apart from the eu in cooperation with nato , there really is no other international actor willing and able to manage kosovo 's transition to independence .

what are the best and worst scenarios arising from this declaration of independence : for kosovo , for the balkans , for the eu and for the relationship between east and west ?
the worst-case scenario would be one of wide-spread violence in kosovo , triggering instability in macedonia and bosnia and an eu and nato unable to manage these threats .
also , a prolonged delay in sufficient levels of international recognition of kosovo leading to insufficient economic recovery there , and continuing strains between serbs and albanians in kosovo are unlikely to be helpful to demonstrate that kosovo as an independent state can succeed politically , economically and socially without destabilizing its neighborhood .
the more negative local developments , the more likely also is it that relations between east and west will remain difficult and impact on other major challenges in the international arena - from the middle east conflict , to nuclear proliferation in iran and north korea , to continuing bloodshed in africa .
as a best-case scenario , kosovo will remain stable , its development will take off , serbs will gradually begin to participate in the political process , the balkans will become more integrated into the eu , and the current level of international tensions over kosovo will quickly die down .

dw-world.de spoke to balkans expert stefan wolff about what kosovo and the world can expect in the near future . stefan wolff is a professor of political science and director of the centre for international crisis management and conflict resolution at nottingham university in the uk .
he has extensive expertise in northern ireland , the balkans and central and eastern europe , and has also worked on a wide range of other conflicts elsewhere , including the middle east , africa , and central , south and southeast asia . dw-world.de : is kosovo prepared for independence in terms of infrastructure , governance , security and stability ? stefan wolff : kosovo has most of the important institutions of statehood and democratic governance in place , but at the same time these institutions will require continued international support for some time .
this is accepted by both the kosovars and the west and is the background against which we need to understand the eu mission for kosovo - as external assistance to consolidate existing institutional structures to enable kosovars to take care of developing their economy , infrastructure and ensure security and stability . the decision to declare independence is not a unanimous one within the population .
what minorities in kosovo have most to lose from this independence ? in principle , all minorities and the majority albanian population can gain from the clarification of kosovo 's international status , not least in the sense that they will all benefit from economic development .
prime minister thaci made some very important gestures yesterday towards reconciliation with serbs in kosovo .
the arthisaari plan offers important mechanisms to serbs to preserve and develop their identity , gives them opportunities to play a meaningful part in the political process in kosovo and retain ties with serbia .
from this perspective , there is no need for conflict between the two main population groups , but that does not mean that extremists on either side will refrain from violence and provocations .
so far , this risk has been contained , but not eliminated . what can we expect in terms of reaction and action from kosovo 's balkan neighbors ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : few of the region 's conflicts are fully resolved the balkan region as a whole remains quite vulnerable to the threat of ethnic conflict .
we must bear in mind that few , if any , of the conflicts that led to bloodshed throughout the 1990s have really been resolved .
we have institutions in place now that help manage these conflicts politically , but tensions in bosnia and macedonia , for example , remain .
apart from albania and slovenia , i do n't think that any of the other balkan countries will find it a very easy decision to recognize kosovo .
eventually , however , macedonia , bosnia , croatia and montenegro will recognize the independence of kosovo , but this will not be a process free from domestic debate .
how will kosovo 's independence affect the wider balkan region ?
because of the close links between kosovo and two other major previous secessionist conflicts - bosnia , the serbs , and macedonia , the albanians - there is a danger that violence in and around kosovo could spread and create instability across the balkans .
there also remains an open question in relation to the future of albanians in southern serbia .
the overall hope , of course , remains that with kosovo 's independence the last major unresolved issue has been tackled and that the region as a whole can now move forward to closer integration with the eu .
while this will not be easy over the coming months , eventually a sense of reality will set in , and people will realize that this is there only real hope for the future .
serbia has vowed not to recognize an independent kosovo and has spoken of economic and diplomatic sanctions .
what can we expect from serbia in the coming days ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riots broke out in belgrade after kosovo 's declaration there are already signs of serbia backing down from the quite exaggerated threats of cutting diplomatic ties with any country recognizing kosovo .
this is simply not feasible for serbia , especially as the population there still has clear aspirations of eu membership and very strong economic interests both in the eu and the neighboring region .
we will , however , see further declarations and statements against kosovo 's independence and against its recognition by other states .
together with russia , serbia is most likely to try and mobilize the un against kosovo 's unilateral declaration of independence , and membership in the un and other international organizations will be very difficult to obtain for kosovo because of serbian resistance .
while the likelihood of a military conflict is close to zero , there remains a threat of localized violence in and around kosovo , but serious escalation is in nobody 's interest .
moreover , serbia has to think carefully about how to manage its relations with serbs in kosovo .
the arthisaari plan offers many important opportunities to do so , opportunities that kosovo albanians are ready to accept .
discouraging kosovo serb political participation in pristina will not be in the interests of serbs living there , and might further encourage them to leave rather than to stay .
what action do you expect to be taken by the international community in the coming days ?
we will gradually see recognition of kosovo as an independent state from major countries in the eu and the west more generally .
we should also expect support from the arab league and member countries of the organization of the islamic conference .
nato will have to be very alert towards any risk of violence in kosovo , not least in order to assure serbs that they can remain in kosovo and participate in building a democratic state .
russian opposition , on the other hand , also remains a clear fact , and russia will use its membership in the un , and possibly the osce and council of europe , to mobilize against kosovo 's independence .
this , in turn , could have a further negative impact on relations between russia and the west as a whole , again not something in either russia 's or the west 's interests .
is kosovo becoming a pawn in the current power games between the west and russia ?
if so , how will an independent kosovo affect relations ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia , serbia 's ally , remains in opposition to the west kosovo has , for some time , been one among several pawns in these power games .
now that independence has been declared , the issue has come to a head , but at the same time kosovo will gradually become less of an issue , precisely because a decision has been made .
russia may choose not to recognize it and bring it up before the security council and elsewhere , but it was in particular kosovo 's unresolved status that gave russia a certain degree of leverage .
in the long term , i think interest in kosovo will fade , especially if the transition to independence is smooth , no major violence occurs , and kosovo quickly gains recognition from a large number of countries beyond the core western powers .
what will the newly independent kosovo 's view be towards the european union and the west ?
kosovo albanians remain the most pro-european and pro-atlanticist of all the balkan people .
the challenge for prime minister thaci and president sejdiu will be to prepare kosovo politically , economically and socially for closer links with the eu and to overcome resistance within the eu from countries like cyprus , greece , romania , slovakia and spain who fear that kosovo sets an unwelcome precedent for secessionist threats that they themselves perceive .
from that perspective , kosovo and its supporters in the eu have a unique responsibility and opportunity to demonstrate that kosovo can develop into a full european , democratic state and that its independence does not lead to the instability and insecurity feared by some .

the worst-case scenario would be one of wide-spread violence in kosovo , triggering instability in macedonia and bosnia and an eu and nato unable to manage these threats .
also , a prolonged delay in sufficient levels of international recognition of kosovo leading to insufficient economic recovery there , and continuing strains between serbs and albanians in kosovo are unlikely to be helpful to demonstrate that kosovo as an independent state can succeed politically , economically and socially without destabilizing its neighborhood .
the more negative local developments , the more likely also is it that relations between east and west will remain difficult and impact on other major challenges in the international arena - from the middle east conflict , to nuclear proliferation in iran and north korea , to continuing bloodshed in africa .
as a best-case scenario , kosovo will remain stable , its development will take off , serbs will gradually begin to participate in the political process , the balkans will become more integrated into the eu , and the current level of international tensions over kosovo will quickly die down .

ministers from the eu will meet today to put in place a platform that will allow each member to take a position on the declaration of independence , " she told reporters in berlin .
" so taking a decision on recognition is not on the order of the day .
the order of the day is first of all to answers questions of substance as to the eu 's platform . "
germany had been expected to formally recognize kosovo on monday along with britain , france , italy and the united states .
merkel added that kosovo was an isolated case not comparable with that in other countries and she stressed that the future of both kosovo and serbia lay with the european union .
" the whole situation in the western balkans can only be kept calm and peaceful from my point of view if we keep the european perspective as the perspective for the future for both serbia and kosovo , " merkel said .
chancellor calls for protection of minorities merkel stressed that kosovo and other countries in the region had to respect their minorities if they were to have a future in the european union .
" all must live with their minorities , " she said , acknowledging difficulties that stretched back over centuries .
without a european future for the countries of the former yugoslavia , she added , " the prospects for free democracy and securing economic development are much , much worse . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel said the eu 's relations with russia were stable asked whether differences over kosovo would hurt eu-russian relations , merkel said the russian objections were of a principled nature and its attitude would not change .
but she added that eu relations with russia were " of a strategic nature and ... very stable . "
" we should in as far as possible try to come to the best diplomatic conclusions , " she said .
" we have strategic relations with russia that are capable of surviving differences of opinion because they are very stable . "
eu foreign ministers were locked in a crisis meeting in brussels monday to discuss the response to kosovo 's split from serbia on sunday amid signs of intense behind-the-scenes wrangling over recognition of the new state .
while some of the larger member states support the declaration , many others refuse to accept kosovo 's decision .
eu divisions exacerbated by separatist concerns the already difficult situation of presenting a united front on kosovo was made worse when spain announced that the socialist government will not give diplomatic recognition to the new state , and that spain 's conservative opposition had agreed with the government 's position .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain fears action by eta , the armed basque separatists spain fears that the serbian province 's declaration of independence could inspire its basque separatists to take a similar step .
these fears gained some credibility when it was revealed that the main opposition bosnian serb party had called for the independence of the serb-run half of bosnia monday , citing kosovo as a precedent .
" the serb democratic party -lsb- sds -rsb- is demanding republika srpska 's institutions provide -lsb- bosnian serbs -rsb- the same rights being given to kosovo albanians , " said the party , which was founded by war crimes fugitive radovan karadzic .
" we expect the -lsb- bosnian serb -rsb- government to meet previous promises and check the will of republika srpska citizens in a referendum , " the sds said in a statement .
since its 1992-1995 war , bosnia has consisted of two entities , the serb-run republika srpska -lsb- rs -rsb- and the muslim-croat federation , each with their own government , parliament and police force .
the sds was established in the early 1990s by karadzic , who remains at large around 12 years after the un war crimes tribunal charged him with genocide over the srebrenica massacre and siege of sarajevo .
bosnian serbs cite kosovo as precedent many bosnian serbs feel that their entity should follow kosovo 's lead and be allowed to secede from bosnia to be eventually attached to serbia , which they see as their motherland .
some local politicians have hinted that the rs could try such a move .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests in banja luka had xenophobic undertones meanwhile , up to 3,000 bosnian serbs gathered in banja luka to protest against kosovo 's independence .
" europe shame on you , world shame on you " and " hashim murderer " , the protestors chanted in a reference to kosovo prime minister hashim thaci .
they also chanted offensive slogans using derogatory terms for albanians .
the protest , organized by students , started with a minute 's silence , followed by another minute of hissing to voice disagreement with kosovo 's unilateral move .
banners in the crowd carried such slogans as " europe respect international law , " " kosovo = rs , " and " we do n't give up kosovo . "
" we are disappointed with the fate of -lsb- serbian -rsb- people in kosovo and we will continue to support them , " representative of students dejan kragulj told journalists .

a huge tax evasion scandal involving senior executives is currently unfolding , and concerns are growing about the gulf between the haves and the have-nots .
the kienbaum management consultancy firm said it had arrived at its results after questioning 4,300 executives at 1,300 companies .
top managers in dax-listed companies came out best in the survey with an average increase in earnings of 23.3 percent , while executive pay in privately owned firms climbed by 12.6 percent .
performance-related pay shot up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans feel the gulf between the poor and the wealthy is getting too wide most of the increase was accounted for in the form of bonuses , according to the study .
" this clear rise is due above all to the increase in the variable parts of their saleries indexed on their company results , while base salaries generally remained constant , " said kienbaum 's managing director alexander von preen .
among those surveyed , some 350 companies gave their board members more than 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 732,635 -rrb- , 128 of them rewarded them with over a million and 44 paid more than two million euros .
according to kienbaum , the number of staff and the state of a firm 's finances were the main factors determining pay levels .

" as kosovo today begins its life as an independent state , the united states pledges to continue to be its close friend and partner , " she said , while also calling serbia to reaffirm the us 's ties with serbia , an ally during two world wars .
germany , france , britain and italy were among the countries that announced their intention to recognize kosovo at an eu foreign ministers ' meeting in brussels on monday .
spain and several other european countries have vowed not to do so .
nevertheless , the 27 ministers managed to unite behind a statement that left each member state free to make up its mind on the issue of recognition , but authorized the european union to use bloc funds and staff to " promote economic and political development " in kosovo .
germany to take step in two days ' time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's action against serbia in kosovo was its first post-world war ii military engagement german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier told reporters that berlin would formally recognize the state on wednesday and french foreign minister bernard kouchner said president nicolas sarkozy had written a letter of recognition which would be sent to the president of the new state on monday .
the danish news agendy ritzau reported that danish foreign minister per stig moeller said 12 to 15 eu states would also take this step on thursday or friday .
british foreign minister david miliband described the move " as the last piece of the yugoslav jigsaw . "
the ministers said kosovo was a unique case because of the yugoslav wars of the 1990s and did not set a precedent for other breakaway regions around the world or undermine international legal principles .
spain , cyprus , slovakia and romania - which all have concerns about the legal precedent or minority rights - opposed an independent kosovo .
spanish foreign minister miguel angel moratinos said secession needed either the agreement of both serbia and kosovo , or a un security council resolution to be legal .
slovenia , which holds the eu 's rotating presidency , played down the differences .
the eu has already taken an important decision to help guarantee kosovo 's future .
at the weekend , it launched a mission to send police , justice and administrative officials to the balkans .
serbia , which claims sovereignty over the territory , vowed to blockade kosovo and launched a criminal action against its leaders for their declaration of independence .
russia , serbia 's closest ally , stopped the un security council from adopting a blueprint for supervised independence last year .
serbia said on monday it was recalling its ambasssador to the united states after washington recognised serbia 's breakaway province of kosovo as independent . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 18.02.2008 germany faces political dilemma in afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are uneasy about combat missions while experts say germany will likely increase its military involvement in afghanistan , the subject remains politically taboo .
the gap between german rhetoric and reality is likely to increase as elections near . the german army 's afghanistan mission is testing berlin 's long-held prohibition against involvement in foreign combat missions like never before .
yet germany 's resistance has more to do with politics than moral qualms , experts say . the german government has spent recent weeks insisting that it has no plans to significantly increase its involvement in afghanistan .
it stood firm even as nato allies , particularly the united states , pressured germany to increase involvement in fighting taliban forces in southern afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has a very strong pacificst movement with national elections scheduled for 2009 , elected officials are n't going to commit political suicide by proposing germany fight alongside nato allies in southern afghanistan , said thomas bauer of the center for applied policy research at the university of munich and an expert in german foreign affairs . " the moment this government decides to send in combat troops to the southern part of afghanistan , they will lose the next election , " bauer said . germany : a reluctant warrior the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , will try to win the next elections by portraying their coalition partners , chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , as pro-military .
to win votes , the left party will try to portray both the spd and cdu as warmongers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party will use afghanistan to score points with german pacifists " pushing this pacifist button " wins elections , bauer said . all of germany 's main political parties , with the exception of the left party , understand germany has a global responsibility which includes sending forces abroad and want to increase participation in nato 's international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
but they are afraid of voter backlash , experts say . germans remain deeply uneasy about taking part in military missions .
there 's the specter of world war ii and a long tradition of pacifism born during the cold war . this unease is shown by the limited scope parliament gave the bundeswehr in afghanistan .
the military can send a maximum of 3,500 soldiers to work out of the relatively peaceful north of the country where it is involved in rebuilding as well as peacekeeping and stabilization efforts . " it is important for nato to be seen as a community that implements its security strategy as a whole , " german defense minister franz-josef jung said recently , while insisting that germany will not participate in fighting in the south . increased involvement a tough sell bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some have questioned whether a political strategy exists in afghanistan the german public is overwhelmingly opposed to increasing the presence in afghanistan .
two out of every three say they want germany out of afghanistan as soon as possible . this has led to a certain amount of dishonesty in the political discourse surrounding afghanistan .
germany 's troop contribution to a quick reaction force is a perfect example of the divide between rhetoric and reality , said citha maass , the afghanistan expert at the berlin-based german institute for international and security affairs . germany agreed to send an additional 200 combat troops in july to take over for a norwegian contingent .
this force will be based in the north , but will assist allies in other regions .
these troops will have a combat component , maass said . " instead of discussing publically that you need some combat function , the government tries to hide it , " she said . on friday , feb .
15 , after denying press reports for days , the german government admitted it will discuss raising the number of troops in afghanistan when the parliamentary mandate comes up for renewal in the fall .
there 's also the possibility of changing the length of the mandate so that it does n't require renewal during election campaigning , according to press reports .
germany is , however , expected to stand firm on refusing to join fighting in the south . germany shirking its duties bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has refused to join combat missions in southern afghanistan norine macdonald has spent most of the past three years doing field research in afghanistan as the president of the senlis council , a security and development think tank .
she said germany 's reluctance to get involved with fighting the taliban and al qaeda forces in southern afghanistan is outrageous and incomprehensible . german politicians lack the political will and the political skill to speak about the reality of the threat in afghanistan , macdonald said , something which she feels is " deeply irresponsible . " " germany is trying to create an alternate version of reality about afghanistan , " she said .
" unless you are going to go fight in the south , you are not part of the nato efforts to stabilize afghanistan . " unclear political goals in afghanistan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has been focused on humanitarian aid the taliban and al qaeda forces control secondary roads in afghanistan 's south and are moving closer to kabul each month , . of nato members , only the united states , canada , the netherlands and great britain currently have troops are currently fighting in the south . there 's increasing worry among experts that the nato mission could fail to contain the taliban . part of the problem is that no one really knows what the ultimate goal is in afghanistan , said andreas heinemann-grüder , a senior researcher at the bonn-based bicc , an organization which focuses on peace building and conflict resolution issues . " the point is that they do n't know what they 're striving for , " heinemann-grüder said .
" what is ultimate goal for these combat missions ?
i do n't see any political strategy behind the military effort . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : canada has called on nato members to send more troops to southern afghanistan for many germans , the messier the situation in afghanistan gets , the more reason for germany to end its involvement .

dw-world.de spoke to him about the film 's reception , brazil and on-screen violence . dw-world.de : you decided on a first-person narrator who tells the story off-camera .
it 's a means to make the viewer identify with the main character , a brutal police officer .
were you conscious of the possibility that the protagonist could also be understood as the hero ? jose padilha : the movie 's main character is n't seen that way at all .
some newspapers wrote that the brazilians had found a hero in captain nascimento and that that would mean the brazilian people were in favor of violence .
that 's not the case .
that 's a distortion of brazilian reality . narration in the first-person form is common in film .
indeed , it does create a relationship between the viewer and the character who 's telling the story .
the viewer sees the movie through the eyes of this character .
but i do n't see it as a problem to do that with a police officer in order to understand his point of view .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : padilha certainly got people talking in the same manner , i do n't have a problem with scorsese 's choice in " good fellas . "
the main character is a mafioso .
as the viewer , you 're on his side the whole time , and that certainly does n't mean that you think the mafia is good .
the viewer has the ability to keep fiction and reality separate .
many critics underestimate that , but i believe that the viewer is smart enough to understand what he sees . the depiction of the brazilian middle class in your film was very controversial in brazil - the same middle and upper class that place the entire blame for social problems on the governments , without bearing in mind that they exploit their domestic help .
is your movie the beginning of a consciousness in that respect ? urban violence in brazil is viewed as a private war between criminals and drug dealers .
the middle class thus counts itself out .
but it goes without saying that it 's involved .
it takes part in this war .
when a drug user buys his dope from an armed group that controls a poor neighborhood , he 's backing the drug dealer 's weapons .
the user is aware of it all .
he 's part of this societal process . the hypocrisy is enormous among the brazilian middle class .
many of the people who have money take advantage of police corruption .
someone from the middle class who 's committed an offense can bribe a police officer and wo n't even be arrested .
there 's complicity between this middle class and the current situation in brazil , which causes violence . bildunterschrift : padilha did not shy away from showing violence your movie is debated both in brazil as well as abroad .
there 's been serious criticism as well as much praise , but people are not neutral about it .
did you expect the film 's reception to be so contentious outside of brazil too ? it was clear that the discussion would come to berlin .
it was brought here by brazilian critics .
whether the polemic would have developed here , i ca n't say , maybe .
in any case , the discussion is interesting .
part of this debate developed because many people viewed interrelations with dated concepts .
the idea that one must observe a societal process from the right or the left is dead for me . my film sees reality through the metaphor of a game .
if you want to understand an individual 's behavior , you have to take into account that this person makes decisions according to the rules of a society .
that 's clear in the film .
what rules must a police officer from rio submit to ?
he earns $ 400 -lrb- 275 euros -rrb- a month , is poorly educated and must find his way within a completely corrupt structure .
and on top of that we want him to take a stand against heavily armed opponents in the favela -lsb- slums -rsb- in the name of the law .
he 's supposed to risk his life and for the long term . " tropa de elite " shows brazil as an unscrupulous country , whether in the callousness of the middle class or in the brutality of the police .
is there a way out of this situation ? the result of the game depends on the rules .
that means that if you change the rules , you can get a different result .
the players themselves determine these societal rules .
we can change a lot : the law that controls the drug trade , the police structures .
we can stop sending a violent police force into the slums , and instead we can build a school there .
one can change a lot .
my aim is to show that we have created this situation ourselves .
and so , we can change it to .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : padilha aimed to depict brazilian reality you worked together with one of the scriptwriters from " city of god . "
the two films have certain similarities : the unsteady camera , the editing and , to a certain extent , the soundtrack .
is there a new genre in brazilian film that favors violence packaged in a fast rhythm ? in those days , the prevailing opinion was that one could only make a critical film by using a distanced approach .
it was important not to involve the viewer emotionally .
that 's not been the case for ages .
in " city of god , " fernando meirelles saw precisely that .
i do n't need any slow sequences , which - referring to brecht - take the viewer out of the events and tell him : " now think about it . "
that 's not necessary . if i involve the viewer emotionally throughout the entire film , i create an even bigger debate in the end . i 'm not saying in any way that you should n't make slow films anymore .
for me , it 's about stressing that a movie that uses emotion to involve the viewer does n't need to preclude reason .
on the contrary , emotion brings reason into the film , much more so than a critical and distanced approach .
people may love or hate " tropa de elite , " but they are talking about the film .
that 's exactly what we wanted . interview : soraia vilela -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the concert brought both applause and protests . heesters is a controversial figure in the netherlands because of his cozy relationship with the nazi occupiers .
security was tight at the de flint theater in heester 's hometown of amersfoort , where he put on a concert for the first time since 1963 on saturday , feb .
16 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors equate the singer with fascism police said several dozen protesters as well as a few neo-nazis showed up outside the concert hall , but the performance went on undisturbed .
the last time heesters tried to peform in the netherlands , he was booed off the stage by the audience , who stood up and gave nazi salutes .
heesters was born in amersfoort , a town 50 kilometers -lrb- 35 miles -rrb- east of amsterdam in 1903 .
yet he made his fortune in germany .
the artist is revered by generations of germans for his operettas and film performances .
one of hitler 's " divinely gifted " artists heesters has been a popular german-language singer since the 1930s , becoming a favorite of the nazis and one of the " divinely gifted " artists who took part in performances to boost the morale of soldiers during the war .
heesters claims he did not know what was happening to jews during the war despite visiting the dachau concentration camp in 1941 .
" honestly , i was too busy working , " heesters said in an interview after a tv gala celebrating his 100th birthday in 2003 .
" i could n't do anything about politics . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heesters is considered a musical legend in germany while germans have taken heesters at his word and continue to watch his old films such as " always you " and " illusion , " many of his dutch countrymen have never forgiven him for his acceptance of the nazi regime during world war ii .
after the nazi defeat , heesters continued his career in germany , settling in bavaria .
heesters is considered to be the oldest living performer .
at the concert saturday , heesters performed hits such as " the merry widow " and " there by the windmill " despite breaking several ribs on jan .
1 during a fall .
at the concert he occasionally needed help from his wife to remember the lines , but otherwise sang with a steady voice , according to media reports . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

board members in listed companies received anything from 40,000 to over seven million euros -lrb- $ 58,000 to over $ 10 million -rrb- . the release of the survey comes at a particularly sensitive time in germany .
a huge tax evasion scandal involving senior executives is currently unfolding , and concerns are growing about the gulf between the haves and the have-nots .
the kienbaum management consultancy firm said it had arrived at its results after questioning 4,300 executives at 1,300 companies .
top managers in dax-listed companies came out best in the survey with an average increase in earnings of 23.3 percent , while executive pay in privately owned firms climbed by 12.6 percent .
performance-related pay shot up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans feel the gulf between the poor and the wealthy is getting too wide most of the increase was accounted for in the form of bonuses , according to the study .
" this clear rise is due above all to the increase in the variable parts of their saleries indexed on their company results , while base salaries generally remained constant , " said kienbaum 's managing director alexander von preen .
among those surveyed , some 350 companies gave their board members more than 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 732,635 -rrb- , 128 of them rewarded them with over a million and 44 paid more than two million euros .
according to kienbaum , the number of staff and the state of a firm 's finances were the main factors determining pay levels .
on average , board chairmans received 50 percent more than other board members , but the difference in practice ranged from 10 to 300 percent .

that would put carmarthenshire 20th in a bottled water expenditure list after a survey of most welsh and english councils for the bbc 's panorama .
the council said its estimated figures to the bbc may include other costs .
the programme , bottled water - who needs it ? found councils had a bill totalling more than £ 5m , although some , such as merthyr , spent nothing on it .
if carmarthenshire 's figures were accurate , that would mean it spent more on bottled water than any other council in wales .
the programme , to be broadcast on bbc1 on monday , investigates the monetary and environmental costs of bottled water consumption in the uk .
the programme made a freedom of information request to many of the councils in england and wales to find out how much they had spent on bottled water in the previous financial year .

it reported that the approximate number of bottles consumed per year was 14,000 , at an average cost of £ 4.95 per 19-litre bottle .
in a statement , the council said it was not possible to calculate the exact amount it spent on bottled water because it was not allocated a specific cost code in its records .
a spokesperson said it was recorded in the council 's general ledger against headings such as " administrative and office equipment " , " stationery / general " and " other hired and contracted services " .
" to isolate truly accurate figures for expenditure on bottled water would require a manual search of many hundreds of invoices in relation to every transaction , " the council said in a statement .
" it would be necessary to look not only at invoices received from known suppliers of bottled water and extract the data , but also to identify any other companies that may have supplied water to the authority . "
some of the councils asked for the information admitted the figures given might not be accurate because their accounts did not differentiate between payments for bottled water supplies and payment for other supplies .

the oscar-nominated star of alien love triangle will see the film 's debut finally bring down the curtain on la charrette , in gorseinon , near swansea .
wear and tear means the cinema has become too costly to maintain .
saturday 's premiere of the danny boyle film has been organised by critic mark kermode for bbc2 's the culture show .
the 30-minute movie was made in 2002 by boyle , director of trainspotting , 28 days later and sunshine and also features courtney cox and heather graham . "
they deserved a memorable send-off , and -lrb- in a rash moment -rrb- the culture show promised to give them one " film critic mark kermode the film , about a scientist who discovers his wife is a male alien , was intended to be one of three 30-minute short films shown together .
but it was never released , and the two other films , mimic and imposter , were turned into full-length features and the project was cancelled .
la charrette had already played host to what should have been its last screening - ocean 's 13 - in october and it was due to be dismantled in november .
but the cinema 's regulars jumped at the chance to give it a rousing finale .
" it is the end of an era and we wanted to go out with a bang , " said the chairman of the club ron williams , who has been visiting the cinema for the last 47 years .
la charrette founded by the late gwyn phillips , who fell in love with the silver screen while working in local cinemas as a teenager he built la charrette in his back garden and invited family and friends to screenings after his death in 1996 , his family allowed the 70 cinema members to screen films there the british film institute recognised la charrette as the smallest cinema in wales classics including gone with the wind and the sound of music have been screened there writing in the guardian , mr kermode said he fell in love with la charrette and its patrons after visiting it for the culture show before christmas .
" they deserved a memorable send-off , and -lrb- in a rash moment -rrb- the culture show promised to give them one .
a world premiere !
with stars ! , " he wrote .
after contacting all of the uk 's major film distributors and sending them pictures of la charrette , mr kermode said offers of several upcoming movies were made for the premiere .
but he decided to ask alien love triangle 's producer andrew macdonald for the film because he wanted " something special , something unique , something unattainable " .
the premiere in la charrette will be a black tie event .
as well as branagh 's appearance , courtney cox is expected to send a video message .
after the premiere la charrette will be dismantled and may be moved to a heritage park in gower .
the event will be filmed for the culture show and screened on bbc2 on saturday , 1 march .

the chancellor had always said it was an option but it was certainly the least favourite .
so after four months of searching for a commercial buyer , it must have been a very difficult moment for alistair darling having to admit that the two private proposals on the table were just not good enough and did n't offer the taxpayer value for money .
at sunday 's press conference mr darling could hardly bring himself to use the dreaded n-word , opting to talk about public ownership instead .
why such reluctance ?
because it is too much an echo of the past - an association with labour governments from another era .
1970s socialism ?
the government 's decision to nationalise a bank can hardly be seen as a return to socialist dogma but it has given the conservatives the opportunity to call it a throwback to the 1970s and repeat their charge of ministers dithering .
the shadow chancellor george osborne has called the decision " catastrophic " , although until now they had not been forthcoming about what they would have done over the past four months .
it is clear though they will oppose the government 's plans for nationalisation when they are presented on monday in legislation to mps on their return from a week 's break .
alistair darling will make a statement followed no doubt by vigorous debate and ultimately a vote on the proposed measure .
even with conservative opposition , the bill will go through with the support of the liberal democrats who have been in favour of nationalisation all along .
the tories have also made it clear that they will not slow down the passage of the legislation .
in control ?
so what of alistair darling 's reputation ?
yvette cooper , chief secretary to the treasury has said he made a cool , rational decision that will in the end prove to be the best option for the taxpayer .
it is true the public may get its money back with interest , but the very fact that a british bank has had to be nationalised could well tarnish the reputation of the city abroad and the credibility of the man , once viewed as a safe pair of hands in charge of the treasury .
when alistair darling stands up in the house of commons on monday it will be difficult for him to look like he 's a man in control of events .

the chancellor had always said it was an option but it was certainly the least favourite .
so after four months of searching for a commercial buyer , it must have been a very difficult moment for alistair darling having to admit that the two private proposals on the table were just not good enough and did n't offer the taxpayer value for money .
at sunday 's press conference mr darling could hardly bring himself to use the dreaded n-word , opting to talk about public ownership instead .
why such reluctance ?
because it is too much an echo of the past - an association with labour governments from another era .
1970s socialism ?
the government 's decision to nationalise a bank can hardly be seen as a return to socialist dogma but it has given the conservatives the opportunity to call it a throwback to the 1970s and repeat their charge of ministers dithering .
the shadow chancellor george osborne has called the decision " catastrophic " , although until now they had not been forthcoming about what they would have done over the past four months .
it is clear though they will oppose the government 's plans for nationalisation when they are presented on monday in legislation to mps on their return from a week 's break .
alistair darling will make a statement followed no doubt by vigorous debate and ultimately a vote on the proposed measure .
even with conservative opposition , the bill will go through with the support of the liberal democrats who have been in favour of nationalisation all along .
the tories have also made it clear that they will not slow down the passage of the legislation .
in control ?
so what of alistair darling 's reputation ?
yvette cooper , chief secretary to the treasury has said he made a cool , rational decision that will in the end prove to be the best option for the taxpayer .
it is true the public may get its money back with interest , but the very fact that a british bank has had to be nationalised could well tarnish the reputation of the city abroad and the credibility of the man , once viewed as a safe pair of hands in charge of the treasury .
when alistair darling stands up in the house of commons on monday it will be difficult for him to look like he 's a man in control of events .

the chancellor had always said it was an option but it was certainly the least favourite .
so after four months of searching for a commercial buyer , it must have been a very difficult moment for alistair darling having to admit that the two private proposals on the table were just not good enough and did n't offer the taxpayer value for money .
at sunday 's press conference mr darling could hardly bring himself to use the dreaded n-word , opting to talk about public ownership instead .
why such reluctance ?
because it is too much an echo of the past - an association with labour governments from another era .
1970s socialism ?
the government 's decision to nationalise a bank can hardly be seen as a return to socialist dogma but it has given the conservatives the opportunity to call it a throwback to the 1970s and repeat their charge of ministers dithering .
the shadow chancellor george osborne has called the decision " catastrophic " , although until now they had not been forthcoming about what they would have done over the past four months .
it is clear though they will oppose the government 's plans for nationalisation when they are presented on monday in legislation to mps on their return from a week 's break .
alistair darling will make a statement followed no doubt by vigorous debate and ultimately a vote on the proposed measure .
even with conservative opposition , the bill will go through with the support of the liberal democrats who have been in favour of nationalisation all along .
the tories have also made it clear that they will not slow down the passage of the legislation .
in control ?
so what of alistair darling 's reputation ?
yvette cooper , chief secretary to the treasury has said he made a cool , rational decision that will in the end prove to be the best option for the taxpayer .
it is true the public may get its money back with interest , but the very fact that a british bank has had to be nationalised could well tarnish the reputation of the city abroad and the credibility of the man , once viewed as a safe pair of hands in charge of the treasury .
when alistair darling stands up in the house of commons on monday it will be difficult for him to look like he 's a man in control of events .
