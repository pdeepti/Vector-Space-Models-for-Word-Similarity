berlin views the proposals as too interventionist and running foul of eu competition laws .
german leaders have long seen french calls for greater government control of financial markets as an attempt to undermine the independence of the european central bank . in addition , there are fears that coordinated action in the euro zone would put the 12 eu countries that do not use the common european currency at a disadvantage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos has been germany 's most vocal opponent to french plans german economy minister michael glos strongly resisted sarkozy 's latest proposals , saying they " go against the successful principles of our economic policy .

" i believe that if this government is in charge of the presidency -lrb- ... -rrb- it will have a more rational opinion on the financial crisis than most other european countries , " said klaus who had called sarkozy 's steps in the crisis " old socialism " earlier this week . in recent days , german media have also reported that germany 's neighbors are looking to chancellor angela merkel to rein sarkozy in . " several influential politicians are counting on germany to persuade sarkozy to back off and agree emergency regulations for the euro zone instead , " newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung said in an editorial .
the paper added that sarkozy 's euro zone " economic government " was yet another move that would bypass existing eu institutions . citing diplomatic sources , business daily financial times deutschland said leaders including italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , spain 's jose luis zapatero and european commission cheif jose manuel barroso tended to avoid confronting sarkozy themselves .

share values have been skyrocketing as porsche prepares to take over the company . the increases briefly made vw the world 's biggest company by market value with 296.06 billion euros -lrb- $ 370.4 billion -rrb- based on ordinary stock .
exxon mobil has about $ 343 billion in value , at monday 's closing price .
vw shares then eased back from the peak to 652 euros in midday trading on tuesday . vw 's tuesday spike followed big gains on monday that at one point reached 200 percent .
the carmaker 's gigantic gains put the entire dax index of leading german companies in positive territory , even though most other firms had posted losses on tuesday . only a small portion of vw shares are traded freely on the stock exchanges .
the government of lower saxony holds a 20 percent stake and porsche has recently gone on a buying spree . on sunday , porsche announced it directly owns 42.6 percent of vw stock and has options on another 31.5 percent .
that leaves less than 10 percent of shares free-floating , which exacerbates volatility in the share price , traders told the afp news agency . porsche poised for takeover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw was quite the shiny number on the german stock exchange on tuesday porsche said it aims to increase its direct equity stake to over 50 percent by the end of 2008 .
the luxury carmaker had previously said it had a 35 percent stake .
if it secures more than 75 percent , porsche would gain full financial control and access to vw 's cash flow . investors had targeted vw shares for short selling , which is essentially a bet that a share 's price will fall , then found themselves obliged to buy shares on the open market to cover those they had borrowed initially when the stock rose . german regulator bafin was investigating the vw share movement to see if any insider trading or market manipulation had taken place , according to a report from reuters news agency . " each and any short seller in the world is trying to close up their position and there is no way they can do it except for trying to buy like mad , " frankfurtfinanz analyst heino ruland told reuters .

karadzic complained he had been unable to prepare himself due to the fact he had received the serb translation of the indictment against him only on monday .
" i did not even have time to study it , " karadzic told the court .
chaotic day in court the revised indictment , the english version of which was released on september 22 , showed that the prosecution had reduced the number of charges from 41 to 27 , in a bid to speed up the trial .
at the hearing , scottish judge bonomy said he was " extremely disappointed " about the slow speed of the trial preparations .
he said there had been little progress in the preparations since the former serb leader 's arrest in july .
emotions reached a boiling point when prosecutor alan tieger could not inform the court how many pages of the prosecution 's evidence had not yet been transferred to karadzic in the serb language .
bonomy , visibly annoyed , temporarily adjourned the hearing and left the court room .
upon his return in the trial chamber , tieger told the court a total of 60 pages of evidence had not yet been given to karadzic in serb translation .
karadzic also complained he had insufficient resources to prepare his defence .
the former serb leader is defending himself but has one legal adviser , american attorney peter robinson , appointed by the tribunal earlier this month .
karadzic faces charges of war crimes , crimes against humanity and genocide .
he was arrested in serbia in july after being on the run for more than 12 years .
karadzic has appeared before the court in pre-trial hearings .

27 , leading to calls for help to the country 's nordic neighbors . " we are going to get through this crisis and move on , " prime minister geir haarde told reporters before a meeting of nordic prime ministers in finland .
haarde said he hoped the cash-strapped north atlantic nation will be able to get loans from its nordic neighbours .
the global financial crisis that has battered iceland was one of the main topics at the meeting of the nordic council organization that groups denmark , finland , iceland , norway and sweden as well as three self-ruling territories including greenland .
haarde said many of iceland 's 320,000 inhabitants will be hit by the crisis that has seen the collapse of its three largest commercial banks .
it will be " painful , " he said , stating that some will lose their jobs , others will lose their savings , and that the crisis will set iceland back some five years .
on friday , reykjavik and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- signed a deal for a 2.1-billion-dollar emergency loan from the imf to help stabilize iceland 's economy .
the deal with the imf , that needs approval by the imf board , was the first by a western country since the mid-1970s when britain signed a similar deal .
however , it is estimated that iceland needs an additional 4 billion dollars in loans although haarde did not specify the sum monday .
haarde said a possible deal with the nordics would not rule out a possible deal with russia , referring to recent talks held in moscow .
the central banks of denmark , norway and sweden in may signed a swap facility arrangement with the icelandic central bank which recently drew 400 million euros -lrb- 543 million dollars -rrb- from denmark and norway .
the financial unrest has fuelled support in iceland for joining the european union , according to a poll commissioned by the frettabladid newspaper .
the weekend poll of some 800 people suggested more than two in three supported an eu application , up from one in two in february .
haarde , whose independence party has opposed joining the bloc , said discussions about membership would have to await the resolution of the crisis . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bosch said it was idling a key plant and sending 400 workers home . germany 's venerable zf , which specializes in driveline and chassis technology , said it was doing everything possible to protect permanent staff during the slowdown , including stopping all overtime , abolishing flex time and planning temporary closures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both bmw and mercedes will temporarily halt production unless the government steps in , up to 20 percent of auto suppliers will go bankrupt in the next two years , endangering 50,000 jobs , ferdinand dudenhoeffer , director of the center of automotive research -lrb- car -rrb- in gelsenkirchen , told the bild newspaper on tuesday , oct .
28 . he suggested that the government set up a credit assistance program specifically for the car suppliers industry , which would make it easier for companies to get the credit they need to continue operating . entire economy will hurt the pain will likely be felt beyond the automobile industry and suppliers , warned bremen economist rudolf hickel . " when the auto industry coughs , engineers , artisans and retailers all get pneumonia , " hickel said . he criticized the approach of the car industry to the difficult economic times , criticizing their decision to lay off workers and stop production at the first sign of economic distress , which he said sets a bad precedent . carmakers look for bailout carmakers have said that they , like ailing german banks , should get a bailout . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will tax breaks make people want to buy new cars ?
on tuesday , german economy minister michael glos announced a plan for tax incentives aimed at encouraging germans to buy new cars .
the proposed tax breaks will be part of a package aimed at strengthen the economy during the current financial crisis , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- minister said . the industry needs " our backing and very concrete help to stimulate the demand for new cars , " european union industry commissioner guenter verheugen said . if demand continues to lag , it will lead to a massive reduction in jobs in the european auto industry and beyond , verheugen told hannover 's neuen presse .
unless the situation changes quickly , " massive job reductions will be unavoidable , " he said . while germany has not yet agreed to any specific bailout measures , the united states is reportedly considering making around $ 10 billion available to general motors so that it can merge with chrysler . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

karadzic complained he had been unable to prepare himself due to the fact he had received the serb translation of the indictment against him only on monday .
" i did not even have time to study it , " karadzic told the court .
chaotic day in court the revised indictment , the english version of which was released on september 22 , showed that the prosecution had reduced the number of charges from 41 to 27 , in a bid to speed up the trial .
at the hearing , scottish judge bonomy said he was " extremely disappointed " about the slow speed of the trial preparations .
he said there had been little progress in the preparations since the former serb leader 's arrest in july .
emotions reached a boiling point when prosecutor alan tieger could not inform the court how many pages of the prosecution 's evidence had not yet been transferred to karadzic in the serb language .
bonomy , visibly annoyed , temporarily adjourned the hearing and left the court room .
upon his return in the trial chamber , tieger told the court a total of 60 pages of evidence had not yet been given to karadzic in serb translation .
karadzic also complained he had insufficient resources to prepare his defence .

as the us presidential election enters its final week , the vast majority of the world is rooting for barack obama .
but analysts say that high global expectations of the democrat will lead to disappointment , if he wins . on monday , barack obama picked up another big endorsement , this time from the daily financial times in london - a conservative-leaning newspaper usually sceptical of democrats .
the ft 's support is a measure of how much europeans would prefer obama over his republican rival john mccain in the white house .
yet the wording of the paper 's endorsement also hints that , whatever the election outcome , everything will not be hunky-dory .
" rest assured that , should he win , mr obama is bound to disappoint , " wrote the ft .
" he is expected to heal the country 's racial divisions , reverse the trend of rising inequality , improve middle-class living standards , cut almost everybody 's taxes , transform the image of the united states abroad , end the losses in iraq , deal with the mess in afghanistan and much more besides . "
pools show anywhere from 60 to 80 percent of continental europeans support obama 's bid for the oval office - compared to single-digit figures for mccain .
in many parts of the media , obama has acquired a quasi-messianic aura .
but experts say european would inevitably be let down by aspects of an obama presidency .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama style is different ; his policies are n't necessarily disappointments would likely result , in part , from political constraints . james goldgeier of the council of the council on foreign relations uses the example of russia to illustrate .
" no president of the united states can tell the russians : yes , you can just do whatever you want in georgia , " goldgeier told the afp .
and political expediency is n't the only potential source of disappointment .
europeans tend to see obama as the candidate of peace , the leader most likely to end the iraq war .

the raids were backed up by turkish army artillery fire .
the statement said the only aim of the raids were pkk targets and that precautions were taken not to harm civilians in the hakurk region .
turkey has conducted numerous airstrikes on pkk positions inside northern iraq since a pkk attack earlier this month on a military border post left 17 turkish soldiers dead .
the pkk uses mountainous northern iraq as a base from which to launch attacks inside turkey .
ankara blames the separatist group for the deaths of more than 35,000 people since the early 1980s when the pkk began its fight for independence or autonomy for the mainly kurdish-populated south-east of turkey .
the pkk is considered by the united states and the european union to be a terrorist group . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

27 , leading to calls for help to the country 's nordic neighbors . " we are going to get through this crisis and move on , " prime minister geir haarde told reporters before a meeting of nordic prime ministers in finland .
haarde said he hoped the cash-strapped north atlantic nation will be able to get loans from its nordic neighbours .
the global financial crisis that has battered iceland was one of the main topics at the meeting of the nordic council organization that groups denmark , finland , iceland , norway and sweden as well as three self-ruling territories including greenland .
haarde said many of iceland 's 320,000 inhabitants will be hit by the crisis that has seen the collapse of its three largest commercial banks .
it will be " painful , " he said , stating that some will lose their jobs , others will lose their savings , and that the crisis will set iceland back some five years .
on friday , reykjavik and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- signed a deal for a 2.1-billion-dollar emergency loan from the imf to help stabilize iceland 's economy .
the deal with the imf , that needs approval by the imf board , was the first by a western country since the mid-1970s when britain signed a similar deal .
however , it is estimated that iceland needs an additional 4 billion dollars in loans although haarde did not specify the sum monday .
haarde said a possible deal with the nordics would not rule out a possible deal with russia , referring to recent talks held in moscow .
the central banks of denmark , norway and sweden in may signed a swap facility arrangement with the icelandic central bank which recently drew 400 million euros -lrb- 543 million dollars -rrb- from denmark and norway .
the financial unrest has fuelled support in iceland for joining the european union , according to a poll commissioned by the frettabladid newspaper .
the weekend poll of some 800 people suggested more than two in three supported an eu application , up from one in two in february .

former national keeper timo hildebrand may be on his way out at valencia .
the question now : where 's he going next ? valencia thought they had landed a major coup in july 2007 , when they signed timo hildebrand , who was coming off a spirited world cup campaign as a substitute in the german national team and a league title with stuttgart as the teams number 1 .
but just 18 months later , the spanish newspaper marca has reported that valencia 's bosses are so eager to get rid of hildebrand that they would consider letting him go on a free transfer during the winter break .
the reason is mounting tension between the 29-year-old keeper and valencia coach unai emry . " the goalkeeper is no longer satisfied with his role at valencia , and the coaching staff is unhappy with the german 's attitude in training , " reported the internet edition of the spanish newspaper las provincias .
if hildebrand is history in spain , he 'll likely head back to germany .

from bundesliga to bench bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hildebrand and loew are no longer making ads together hildebrand is a victim of a bad valencia season and a coaching change .
the german gradually fought his way in valencia 's starting line-up last season , but the club spent a good portion of its time fighting relegation .
they eventually finished tenth - an unacceptable result for a team whose fans expected them to qualify for the champions league .
valaencia and hildebrand did win the king 's cup , but that was n't enough to save then-coach ronald koeman 's job .
nor was it sufficient to convince german national coach joachim loew to include hildebrand in his euro 2008 squad .
in the off-season , emry insisted the club bring in brazilian keeper renan , who became the team 's new number 1 .
valencia currently tops the spanish first division .
meanwhile , hildebrand was n't even nominated for valencia 's most recent cup match - an affront to a keeper once tipped to be in line for the top job in the german national side .
which way will he go ?

hildebrand 's dream-turned-nightmare stint in spain has probably made him less attractive to clubs around europe , but he is positively remembered in germany .
so he could be headed home .
the big question is where .
three names keep cropping up on the rumor mill - dortmund , hoffenheim and stuttgart .
dortmund was linked with hildebrand at the start of the season amidst concerns about keeper roman weidenfeller 's fitness .
but bringing the former in now would create potentially divisive competition .
hoffenheim would no doubt have been eager to sign up hildebrand in july , just as the keeper probably would n't object to joining the surprise club of the season now .
but would hoffenheim , which was on top of the table after 9 rounds , really want to shake up its successful formula ?
finally , stuttgart would make sense since hildebrand has already had success there , and current keeper jens lehmann is rapidly approaching his 40s .
but while it might be an option for next season , it 's hard to see stuttgart replacing the high-profile lehmann in february .

but that does not mean moscow and the bloc have settled their differences over the caucasus . french foreign minister bernard kouchner announced the resumption of talks on a new partnership and cooperation agreement after a meeting with his russian counterpart sergei lavrov in st. petersburg .
those talks had been put on hold , after russia launched military action against georgia 's attempt to retake control of the breakaway provinces of south ossetia and abkhazia in late summer .
" i want to underline the eu-russian partnership talks were never suspended , they were simply delayed , " kouchner told journalists after his talks with lavrov .
kouchner added that negotiations would resume at an eu-russia summit on november 14 .
but france , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , must first get the go-ahead of all eu foreign ministers , when they meet on novermber 10 .
the new agreement is aimed at updating the partnership and cooperation agreement of 1997 , which encompassed political , commercial and cultural projects .
georgia still on their minds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian troops have withdrawn from georgia proper , but not from the breakaway regions critics of russia 's military operations against georgia had objected that moscow had not done enough to merit a resumption of the talks .
in particular , they criticized moscow for not allowing eu monitors access to the two disputed regions .
but russia 's foreign minister was not striking a conciliatory tone on the issue .
" security in south ossetia and abkhazia is assured by russian military contingents after the recognition of their independence by russia , " lavrov said at the press conference with kouchner .
he added that russia felt itself to be in line with the french-brokered ceasefire agreement in so far as it was allowing observers into areas bordering on south ossetia and abkhazia .
moscow has recognized the independence of the two regions , which have ethnic russian majorities , while the eu insisted that they are part of georgia .
kouchner said the eu would seek moscow 's cooperation with an international commission that will investigate how the conflict in the caucasus escalated .

27 , leading to calls for help to the country 's nordic neighbors . " we are going to get through this crisis and move on , " prime minister geir haarde told reporters before a meeting of nordic prime ministers in finland .
haarde said he hoped the cash-strapped north atlantic nation will be able to get loans from its nordic neighbours .
the global financial crisis that has battered iceland was one of the main topics at the meeting of the nordic council organization that groups denmark , finland , iceland , norway and sweden as well as three self-ruling territories including greenland .
haarde said many of iceland 's 320,000 inhabitants will be hit by the crisis that has seen the collapse of its three largest commercial banks .
it will be " painful , " he said , stating that some will lose their jobs , others will lose their savings , and that the crisis will set iceland back some five years .
on friday , reykjavik and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- signed a deal for a 2.1-billion-dollar emergency loan from the imf to help stabilize iceland 's economy .
the deal with the imf , that needs approval by the imf board , was the first by a western country since the mid-1970s when britain signed a similar deal .
however , it is estimated that iceland needs an additional 4 billion dollars in loans although haarde did not specify the sum monday .
haarde said a possible deal with the nordics would not rule out a possible deal with russia , referring to recent talks held in moscow .
the central banks of denmark , norway and sweden in may signed a swap facility arrangement with the icelandic central bank which recently drew 400 million euros -lrb- 543 million dollars -rrb- from denmark and norway .
the financial unrest has fuelled support in iceland for joining the european union , according to a poll commissioned by the frettabladid newspaper .
the weekend poll of some 800 people suggested more than two in three supported an eu application , up from one in two in february .
haarde , whose independence party has opposed joining the bloc , said discussions about membership would have to await the resolution of the crisis . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the raids were backed up by turkish army artillery fire .
the statement said the only aim of the raids were pkk targets and that precautions were taken not to harm civilians in the hakurk region .
turkey has conducted numerous airstrikes on pkk positions inside northern iraq since a pkk attack earlier this month on a military border post left 17 turkish soldiers dead .
the pkk uses mountainous northern iraq as a base from which to launch attacks inside turkey .
ankara blames the separatist group for the deaths of more than 35,000 people since the early 1980s when the pkk began its fight for independence or autonomy for the mainly kurdish-populated south-east of turkey .
the pkk is considered by the united states and the european union to be a terrorist group . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 28.10.2008 experts : obama presidency likely to disappoint foreign fans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this could be obama 's autumn , but will he live up to high hopes ?
as the us presidential election enters its final week , the vast majority of the world is rooting for barack obama .
but analysts say that high global expectations of the democrat will lead to disappointment , if he wins . on monday , barack obama picked up another big endorsement , this time from the daily financial times in london - a conservative-leaning newspaper usually sceptical of democrats .
the ft 's support is a measure of how much europeans would prefer obama over his republican rival john mccain in the white house .
yet the wording of the paper 's endorsement also hints that , whatever the election outcome , everything will not be hunky-dory .
" rest assured that , should he win , mr obama is bound to disappoint , " wrote the ft .
" he is expected to heal the country 's racial divisions , reverse the trend of rising inequality , improve middle-class living standards , cut almost everybody 's taxes , transform the image of the united states abroad , end the losses in iraq , deal with the mess in afghanistan and much more besides . "
pools show anywhere from 60 to 80 percent of continental europeans support obama 's bid for the oval office - compared to single-digit figures for mccain .
in many parts of the media , obama has acquired a quasi-messianic aura .
but experts say european would inevitably be let down by aspects of an obama presidency .
change in style only ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama style is different ; his policies are n't necessarily disappointments would likely result , in part , from political constraints . james goldgeier of the council of the council on foreign relations uses the example of russia to illustrate .
" no president of the united states can tell the russians : yes , you can just do whatever you want in georgia , " goldgeier told the afp .
and political expediency is n't the only potential source of disappointment .
europeans tend to see obama as the candidate of peace , the leader most likely to end the iraq war .
but they often overlook hints from the democrat that he wants to bring military pressure to bear on afghanistan and pakistan - a shift with major implications for europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans could be asked to do more , militarily , on the afghan-pakastani border " barack obama and joe biden will expect allies to commit more resources to this common mission and to remove some of the limits on what their troops in country can do , " obama 's compaign has stated on the candidate 's website .
but experts agree that despite potential conflicts of interest , obama would bring a change in diplomatic style and an improvement in us foreign relations .
" if he were to win , we would see a huge change in just the whole tone of american foreign policy , " said goldgeier , a former diplomat .
justin vaisse , a european expert at the brookings institute , concurs .
" there is a risk of unmet expectations but goodwill should generate more positive responses , " vaisse told afp .
hope for european minorities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hype was huge when obama visited europe this summer an obama presidency would represent a landmark change in race relations in the us - a fact not lost of europeans from minority ethnic backgrounds .
christiana taubira , a french member of parliament from french guyana who ran for her counrtry 's presidency in 2002 , hopes what an obama win could inspire a similar sea change in europe .
" i think very sincerely , given my own experience in 2002 , that french society is ready to enjoy the beautiful adventure that obama has offered americans , " taubira told afp .
but others say the far more institutionalized role of european political parties , in which potential candidates have to work their way up the pecking order , would restrict the chances of a relative outsider like obama .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but it could be a long time before countries like france elect a leader from an immigrant background " the french themselves are ready , but our political system would stop an obama appearing , " french human rights minister rama yade told the french news magazine le figaro .
" not because he 's black , but because he comes from a background of recent immigration , " yade added .
" here , integration is much more difficult . "
europeans will be watching americans go to the polls on nov .
4 with an especially keen , pro-obama eye , even though there are no guarantees that he will do what they want or that they would elect a similar candidates to lead their own societies . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de russians prefer the more " approachable " obama both john mccain and barack obama have been critical of russia , particularly in light of the georgian crisis .

as the us presidential election enters its final week , the vast majority of the world is rooting for barack obama .
but analysts say that high global expectations of the democrat will lead to disappointment , if he wins . on monday , barack obama picked up another big endorsement , this time from the daily financial times in london - a conservative-leaning newspaper usually sceptical of democrats .
the ft 's support is a measure of how much europeans would prefer obama over his republican rival john mccain in the white house .
yet the wording of the paper 's endorsement also hints that , whatever the election outcome , everything will not be hunky-dory .
" rest assured that , should he win , mr obama is bound to disappoint , " wrote the ft .
" he is expected to heal the country 's racial divisions , reverse the trend of rising inequality , improve middle-class living standards , cut almost everybody 's taxes , transform the image of the united states abroad , end the losses in iraq , deal with the mess in afghanistan and much more besides . "
pools show anywhere from 60 to 80 percent of continental europeans support obama 's bid for the oval office - compared to single-digit figures for mccain .
in many parts of the media , obama has acquired a quasi-messianic aura .
but experts say european would inevitably be let down by aspects of an obama presidency .

" no president of the united states can tell the russians : yes , you can just do whatever you want in georgia , " goldgeier told the afp .
and political expediency is n't the only potential source of disappointment .
europeans tend to see obama as the candidate of peace , the leader most likely to end the iraq war .

karadzic complained he had been unable to prepare himself due to the fact he had received the serb translation of the indictment against him only on monday .
" i did not even have time to study it , " karadzic told the court .
chaotic day in court the revised indictment , the english version of which was released on september 22 , showed that the prosecution had reduced the number of charges from 41 to 27 , in a bid to speed up the trial .
at the hearing , scottish judge bonomy said he was " extremely disappointed " about the slow speed of the trial preparations .
he said there had been little progress in the preparations since the former serb leader 's arrest in july .
emotions reached a boiling point when prosecutor alan tieger could not inform the court how many pages of the prosecution 's evidence had not yet been transferred to karadzic in the serb language .
bonomy , visibly annoyed , temporarily adjourned the hearing and left the court room .
upon his return in the trial chamber , tieger told the court a total of 60 pages of evidence had not yet been given to karadzic in serb translation .
karadzic also complained he had insufficient resources to prepare his defence .
the former serb leader is defending himself but has one legal adviser , american attorney peter robinson , appointed by the tribunal earlier this month .
karadzic faces charges of war crimes , crimes against humanity and genocide .
he was arrested in serbia in july after being on the run for more than 12 years .
karadzic has appeared before the court in pre-trial hearings .

but that does not mean moscow and the bloc have settled their differences over the caucasus . french foreign minister bernard kouchner announced the resumption of talks on a new partnership and cooperation agreement after a meeting with his russian counterpart sergei lavrov in st. petersburg .
those talks had been put on hold , after russia launched military action against georgia 's attempt to retake control of the breakaway provinces of south ossetia and abkhazia in late summer .
" i want to underline the eu-russian partnership talks were never suspended , they were simply delayed , " kouchner told journalists after his talks with lavrov .
kouchner added that negotiations would resume at an eu-russia summit on november 14 .
but france , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , must first get the go-ahead of all eu foreign ministers , when they meet on novermber 10 .
the new agreement is aimed at updating the partnership and cooperation agreement of 1997 , which encompassed political , commercial and cultural projects .
georgia still on their minds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian troops have withdrawn from georgia proper , but not from the breakaway regions critics of russia 's military operations against georgia had objected that moscow had not done enough to merit a resumption of the talks .

but russia 's foreign minister was not striking a conciliatory tone on the issue .
" security in south ossetia and abkhazia is assured by russian military contingents after the recognition of their independence by russia , " lavrov said at the press conference with kouchner .
he added that russia felt itself to be in line with the french-brokered ceasefire agreement in so far as it was allowing observers into areas bordering on south ossetia and abkhazia .
moscow has recognized the independence of the two regions , which have ethnic russian majorities , while the eu insisted that they are part of georgia .

share values have been skyrocketing as porsche prepares to take over the company . the increases briefly made vw the world 's biggest company by market value with 296.06 billion euros -lrb- $ 370.4 billion -rrb- based on ordinary stock .
exxon mobil has about $ 343 billion in value , at monday 's closing price .
vw shares then eased back from the peak to 652 euros in midday trading on tuesday . vw 's tuesday spike followed big gains on monday that at one point reached 200 percent .
the carmaker 's gigantic gains put the entire dax index of leading german companies in positive territory , even though most other firms had posted losses on tuesday . only a small portion of vw shares are traded freely on the stock exchanges .
the government of lower saxony holds a 20 percent stake and porsche has recently gone on a buying spree . on sunday , porsche announced it directly owns 42.6 percent of vw stock and has options on another 31.5 percent .

workers who make the axles and transmissions that go into the luxury sedans and sporty convertibles are also worried about their jobs . just weeks after german carmakers warned that they would temporarily halt production due to falling demand , companies such as bosch and continental have begun planning similar moves . continental said it plans to have shut downs around christmas at its plant in regensburg that will mean a loss of income for about 1,500 employees .
bosch said it was idling a key plant and sending 400 workers home . germany 's venerable zf , which specializes in driveline and chassis technology , said it was doing everything possible to protect permanent staff during the slowdown , including stopping all overtime , abolishing flex time and planning temporary closures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both bmw and mercedes will temporarily halt production unless the government steps in , up to 20 percent of auto suppliers will go bankrupt in the next two years , endangering 50,000 jobs , ferdinand dudenhoeffer , director of the center of automotive research -lrb- car -rrb- in gelsenkirchen , told the bild newspaper on tuesday , oct .
28 . he suggested that the government set up a credit assistance program specifically for the car suppliers industry , which would make it easier for companies to get the credit they need to continue operating . entire economy will hurt the pain will likely be felt beyond the automobile industry and suppliers , warned bremen economist rudolf hickel . " when the auto industry coughs , engineers , artisans and retailers all get pneumonia , " hickel said . he criticized the approach of the car industry to the difficult economic times , criticizing their decision to lay off workers and stop production at the first sign of economic distress , which he said sets a bad precedent . carmakers look for bailout carmakers have said that they , like ailing german banks , should get a bailout . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will tax breaks make people want to buy new cars ?
on tuesday , german economy minister michael glos announced a plan for tax incentives aimed at encouraging germans to buy new cars .
the proposed tax breaks will be part of a package aimed at strengthen the economy during the current financial crisis , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- minister said . the industry needs " our backing and very concrete help to stimulate the demand for new cars , " european union industry commissioner guenter verheugen said . if demand continues to lag , it will lead to a massive reduction in jobs in the european auto industry and beyond , verheugen told hannover 's neuen presse .
unless the situation changes quickly , " massive job reductions will be unavoidable , " he said . while germany has not yet agreed to any specific bailout measures , the united states is reportedly considering making around $ 10 billion available to general motors so that it can merge with chrysler . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but that does not mean moscow and the bloc have settled their differences over the caucasus . french foreign minister bernard kouchner announced the resumption of talks on a new partnership and cooperation agreement after a meeting with his russian counterpart sergei lavrov in st. petersburg .
those talks had been put on hold , after russia launched military action against georgia 's attempt to retake control of the breakaway provinces of south ossetia and abkhazia in late summer .
" i want to underline the eu-russian partnership talks were never suspended , they were simply delayed , " kouchner told journalists after his talks with lavrov .
kouchner added that negotiations would resume at an eu-russia summit on november 14 .
but france , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , must first get the go-ahead of all eu foreign ministers , when they meet on novermber 10 .
the new agreement is aimed at updating the partnership and cooperation agreement of 1997 , which encompassed political , commercial and cultural projects .
georgia still on their minds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian troops have withdrawn from georgia proper , but not from the breakaway regions critics of russia 's military operations against georgia had objected that moscow had not done enough to merit a resumption of the talks .
in particular , they criticized moscow for not allowing eu monitors access to the two disputed regions .
but russia 's foreign minister was not striking a conciliatory tone on the issue .
" security in south ossetia and abkhazia is assured by russian military contingents after the recognition of their independence by russia , " lavrov said at the press conference with kouchner .
he added that russia felt itself to be in line with the french-brokered ceasefire agreement in so far as it was allowing observers into areas bordering on south ossetia and abkhazia .
moscow has recognized the independence of the two regions , which have ethnic russian majorities , while the eu insisted that they are part of georgia .
kouchner said the eu would seek moscow 's cooperation with an international commission that will investigate how the conflict in the caucasus escalated .
a swiss expert has been nominated to head that commission . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

former national keeper timo hildebrand may be on his way out at valencia .
the question now : where 's he going next ? valencia thought they had landed a major coup in july 2007 , when they signed timo hildebrand , who was coming off a spirited world cup campaign as a substitute in the german national team and a league title with stuttgart as the teams number 1 .
but just 18 months later , the spanish newspaper marca has reported that valencia 's bosses are so eager to get rid of hildebrand that they would consider letting him go on a free transfer during the winter break .
the reason is mounting tension between the 29-year-old keeper and valencia coach unai emry . " the goalkeeper is no longer satisfied with his role at valencia , and the coaching staff is unhappy with the german 's attitude in training , " reported the internet edition of the spanish newspaper las provincias .
if hildebrand is history in spain , he 'll likely head back to germany .
and be asking fimself , what went wrong ?
from bundesliga to bench bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hildebrand and loew are no longer making ads together hildebrand is a victim of a bad valencia season and a coaching change .
the german gradually fought his way in valencia 's starting line-up last season , but the club spent a good portion of its time fighting relegation .
they eventually finished tenth - an unacceptable result for a team whose fans expected them to qualify for the champions league .
valaencia and hildebrand did win the king 's cup , but that was n't enough to save then-coach ronald koeman 's job .
nor was it sufficient to convince german national coach joachim loew to include hildebrand in his euro 2008 squad .
in the off-season , emry insisted the club bring in brazilian keeper renan , who became the team 's new number 1 .
valencia currently tops the spanish first division .
meanwhile , hildebrand was n't even nominated for valencia 's most recent cup match - an affront to a keeper once tipped to be in line for the top job in the german national side .
which way will he go ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could hildebrand replace former national teammate lehmann at stuttgart ?
hildebrand 's dream-turned-nightmare stint in spain has probably made him less attractive to clubs around europe , but he is positively remembered in germany .
so he could be headed home .
the big question is where .
three names keep cropping up on the rumor mill - dortmund , hoffenheim and stuttgart .
dortmund was linked with hildebrand at the start of the season amidst concerns about keeper roman weidenfeller 's fitness .
but bringing the former in now would create potentially divisive competition .
hoffenheim would no doubt have been eager to sign up hildebrand in july , just as the keeper probably would n't object to joining the surprise club of the season now .
but would hoffenheim , which was on top of the table after 9 rounds , really want to shake up its successful formula ?
finally , stuttgart would make sense since hildebrand has already had success there , and current keeper jens lehmann is rapidly approaching his 40s .
but while it might be an option for next season , it 's hard to see stuttgart replacing the high-profile lehmann in february .

former national keeper timo hildebrand may be on his way out at valencia .
the question now : where 's he going next ? valencia thought they had landed a major coup in july 2007 , when they signed timo hildebrand , who was coming off a spirited world cup campaign as a substitute in the german national team and a league title with stuttgart as the teams number 1 .
but just 18 months later , the spanish newspaper marca has reported that valencia 's bosses are so eager to get rid of hildebrand that they would consider letting him go on a free transfer during the winter break .
the reason is mounting tension between the 29-year-old keeper and valencia coach unai emry . " the goalkeeper is no longer satisfied with his role at valencia , and the coaching staff is unhappy with the german 's attitude in training , " reported the internet edition of the spanish newspaper las provincias .
if hildebrand is history in spain , he 'll likely head back to germany .
and be asking fimself , what went wrong ?
from bundesliga to bench bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hildebrand and loew are no longer making ads together hildebrand is a victim of a bad valencia season and a coaching change .
the german gradually fought his way in valencia 's starting line-up last season , but the club spent a good portion of its time fighting relegation .
they eventually finished tenth - an unacceptable result for a team whose fans expected them to qualify for the champions league .
valaencia and hildebrand did win the king 's cup , but that was n't enough to save then-coach ronald koeman 's job .
nor was it sufficient to convince german national coach joachim loew to include hildebrand in his euro 2008 squad .
in the off-season , emry insisted the club bring in brazilian keeper renan , who became the team 's new number 1 .
valencia currently tops the spanish first division .
meanwhile , hildebrand was n't even nominated for valencia 's most recent cup match - an affront to a keeper once tipped to be in line for the top job in the german national side .
which way will he go ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could hildebrand replace former national teammate lehmann at stuttgart ?
hildebrand 's dream-turned-nightmare stint in spain has probably made him less attractive to clubs around europe , but he is positively remembered in germany .
so he could be headed home .
the big question is where .
three names keep cropping up on the rumor mill - dortmund , hoffenheim and stuttgart .
dortmund was linked with hildebrand at the start of the season amidst concerns about keeper roman weidenfeller 's fitness .
but bringing the former in now would create potentially divisive competition .
hoffenheim would no doubt have been eager to sign up hildebrand in july , just as the keeper probably would n't object to joining the surprise club of the season now .
but would hoffenheim , which was on top of the table after 9 rounds , really want to shake up its successful formula ?
finally , stuttgart would make sense since hildebrand has already had success there , and current keeper jens lehmann is rapidly approaching his 40s .
but while it might be an option for next season , it 's hard to see stuttgart replacing the high-profile lehmann in february .
and hildebrand is , no doubt , anxious to get a game as soon as possible and start recovering from what 's proven a fairly disastrous foreign adventure . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

28 . " it would be completely immoral if we did n't stick to these promises .
it is our duty to prevent this continent becoming separated from the rest of the world , " pottering told a media briefing in johannesburg .
compared with the several hundred billion dollars industrialized countries were ploughing into shoring up their banking systems , the amount needed to avoid hunger in the world - which he put at 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 37.5 billion -rrb- - was small change , he said .
on monday , pottering told the reopening of the pan-african parliament in midrand , near johannesburg , that the european parliament would stand over the donor community to make sure it honoured its commitments on development aid .
he also called for the urgent implementation of zimbabwe 's power-sharing agreement , which has been held up for over six weeks by squabbling over cabinet posts .

but that does not mean moscow and the bloc have settled their differences over the caucasus . french foreign minister bernard kouchner announced the resumption of talks on a new partnership and cooperation agreement after a meeting with his russian counterpart sergei lavrov in st. petersburg .
those talks had been put on hold , after russia launched military action against georgia 's attempt to retake control of the breakaway provinces of south ossetia and abkhazia in late summer .
" i want to underline the eu-russian partnership talks were never suspended , they were simply delayed , " kouchner told journalists after his talks with lavrov .
kouchner added that negotiations would resume at an eu-russia summit on november 14 .
but france , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , must first get the go-ahead of all eu foreign ministers , when they meet on novermber 10 .
the new agreement is aimed at updating the partnership and cooperation agreement of 1997 , which encompassed political , commercial and cultural projects .
georgia still on their minds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian troops have withdrawn from georgia proper , but not from the breakaway regions critics of russia 's military operations against georgia had objected that moscow had not done enough to merit a resumption of the talks .
in particular , they criticized moscow for not allowing eu monitors access to the two disputed regions .
but russia 's foreign minister was not striking a conciliatory tone on the issue .
" security in south ossetia and abkhazia is assured by russian military contingents after the recognition of their independence by russia , " lavrov said at the press conference with kouchner .
he added that russia felt itself to be in line with the french-brokered ceasefire agreement in so far as it was allowing observers into areas bordering on south ossetia and abkhazia .
moscow has recognized the independence of the two regions , which have ethnic russian majorities , while the eu insisted that they are part of georgia .
kouchner said the eu would seek moscow 's cooperation with an international commission that will investigate how the conflict in the caucasus escalated .

haarde said he hoped the cash-strapped north atlantic nation will be able to get loans from its nordic neighbours .
the global financial crisis that has battered iceland was one of the main topics at the meeting of the nordic council organization that groups denmark , finland , iceland , norway and sweden as well as three self-ruling territories including greenland .
haarde said many of iceland 's 320,000 inhabitants will be hit by the crisis that has seen the collapse of its three largest commercial banks .
it will be " painful , " he said , stating that some will lose their jobs , others will lose their savings , and that the crisis will set iceland back some five years .
on friday , reykjavik and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- signed a deal for a 2.1-billion-dollar emergency loan from the imf to help stabilize iceland 's economy .
the deal with the imf , that needs approval by the imf board , was the first by a western country since the mid-1970s when britain signed a similar deal .
however , it is estimated that iceland needs an additional 4 billion dollars in loans although haarde did not specify the sum monday .
haarde said a possible deal with the nordics would not rule out a possible deal with russia , referring to recent talks held in moscow .
the central banks of denmark , norway and sweden in may signed a swap facility arrangement with the icelandic central bank which recently drew 400 million euros -lrb- 543 million dollars -rrb- from denmark and norway .
the financial unrest has fuelled support in iceland for joining the european union , according to a poll commissioned by the frettabladid newspaper .
the weekend poll of some 800 people suggested more than two in three supported an eu application , up from one in two in february .

as the us presidential election enters its final week , the vast majority of the world is rooting for barack obama .
but analysts say that high global expectations of the democrat will lead to disappointment , if he wins . on monday , barack obama picked up another big endorsement , this time from the daily financial times in london - a conservative-leaning newspaper usually sceptical of democrats .
the ft 's support is a measure of how much europeans would prefer obama over his republican rival john mccain in the white house .
yet the wording of the paper 's endorsement also hints that , whatever the election outcome , everything will not be hunky-dory .
" rest assured that , should he win , mr obama is bound to disappoint , " wrote the ft .
" he is expected to heal the country 's racial divisions , reverse the trend of rising inequality , improve middle-class living standards , cut almost everybody 's taxes , transform the image of the united states abroad , end the losses in iraq , deal with the mess in afghanistan and much more besides . "
pools show anywhere from 60 to 80 percent of continental europeans support obama 's bid for the oval office - compared to single-digit figures for mccain .
in many parts of the media , obama has acquired a quasi-messianic aura .
but experts say european would inevitably be let down by aspects of an obama presidency .
change in style only ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama style is different ; his policies are n't necessarily disappointments would likely result , in part , from political constraints . james goldgeier of the council of the council on foreign relations uses the example of russia to illustrate .
" no president of the united states can tell the russians : yes , you can just do whatever you want in georgia , " goldgeier told the afp .
and political expediency is n't the only potential source of disappointment .
europeans tend to see obama as the candidate of peace , the leader most likely to end the iraq war .
but they often overlook hints from the democrat that he wants to bring military pressure to bear on afghanistan and pakistan - a shift with major implications for europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans could be asked to do more , militarily , on the afghan-pakastani border " barack obama and joe biden will expect allies to commit more resources to this common mission and to remove some of the limits on what their troops in country can do , " obama 's compaign has stated on the candidate 's website .
but experts agree that despite potential conflicts of interest , obama would bring a change in diplomatic style and an improvement in us foreign relations .
" if he were to win , we would see a huge change in just the whole tone of american foreign policy , " said goldgeier , a former diplomat .
justin vaisse , a european expert at the brookings institute , concurs .
" there is a risk of unmet expectations but goodwill should generate more positive responses , " vaisse told afp .
hope for european minorities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hype was huge when obama visited europe this summer an obama presidency would represent a landmark change in race relations in the us - a fact not lost of europeans from minority ethnic backgrounds .
christiana taubira , a french member of parliament from french guyana who ran for her counrtry 's presidency in 2002 , hopes what an obama win could inspire a similar sea change in europe .
" i think very sincerely , given my own experience in 2002 , that french society is ready to enjoy the beautiful adventure that obama has offered americans , " taubira told afp .
but others say the far more institutionalized role of european political parties , in which potential candidates have to work their way up the pecking order , would restrict the chances of a relative outsider like obama .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but it could be a long time before countries like france elect a leader from an immigrant background " the french themselves are ready , but our political system would stop an obama appearing , " french human rights minister rama yade told the french news magazine le figaro .
" not because he 's black , but because he comes from a background of recent immigration , " yade added .
" here , integration is much more difficult . "

as the us presidential election enters its final week , the vast majority of the world is rooting for barack obama .
but analysts say that high global expectations of the democrat will lead to disappointment , if he wins . on monday , barack obama picked up another big endorsement , this time from the daily financial times in london - a conservative-leaning newspaper usually sceptical of democrats .
the ft 's support is a measure of how much europeans would prefer obama over his republican rival john mccain in the white house .
yet the wording of the paper 's endorsement also hints that , whatever the election outcome , everything will not be hunky-dory .
" rest assured that , should he win , mr obama is bound to disappoint , " wrote the ft .
" he is expected to heal the country 's racial divisions , reverse the trend of rising inequality , improve middle-class living standards , cut almost everybody 's taxes , transform the image of the united states abroad , end the losses in iraq , deal with the mess in afghanistan and much more besides . "
pools show anywhere from 60 to 80 percent of continental europeans support obama 's bid for the oval office - compared to single-digit figures for mccain .
in many parts of the media , obama has acquired a quasi-messianic aura .
but experts say european would inevitably be let down by aspects of an obama presidency .
change in style only ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama style is different ; his policies are n't necessarily disappointments would likely result , in part , from political constraints . james goldgeier of the council of the council on foreign relations uses the example of russia to illustrate .
" no president of the united states can tell the russians : yes , you can just do whatever you want in georgia , " goldgeier told the afp .
and political expediency is n't the only potential source of disappointment .
europeans tend to see obama as the candidate of peace , the leader most likely to end the iraq war .
but they often overlook hints from the democrat that he wants to bring military pressure to bear on afghanistan and pakistan - a shift with major implications for europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans could be asked to do more , militarily , on the afghan-pakastani border " barack obama and joe biden will expect allies to commit more resources to this common mission and to remove some of the limits on what their troops in country can do , " obama 's compaign has stated on the candidate 's website .

karadzic complained he had been unable to prepare himself due to the fact he had received the serb translation of the indictment against him only on monday .
" i did not even have time to study it , " karadzic told the court .
chaotic day in court the revised indictment , the english version of which was released on september 22 , showed that the prosecution had reduced the number of charges from 41 to 27 , in a bid to speed up the trial .
at the hearing , scottish judge bonomy said he was " extremely disappointed " about the slow speed of the trial preparations .
he said there had been little progress in the preparations since the former serb leader 's arrest in july .
emotions reached a boiling point when prosecutor alan tieger could not inform the court how many pages of the prosecution 's evidence had not yet been transferred to karadzic in the serb language .
bonomy , visibly annoyed , temporarily adjourned the hearing and left the court room .
upon his return in the trial chamber , tieger told the court a total of 60 pages of evidence had not yet been given to karadzic in serb translation .
karadzic also complained he had insufficient resources to prepare his defence .
the former serb leader is defending himself but has one legal adviser , american attorney peter robinson , appointed by the tribunal earlier this month .
karadzic faces charges of war crimes , crimes against humanity and genocide .
he was arrested in serbia in july after being on the run for more than 12 years .

the raids were backed up by turkish army artillery fire .
the statement said the only aim of the raids were pkk targets and that precautions were taken not to harm civilians in the hakurk region .
turkey has conducted numerous airstrikes on pkk positions inside northern iraq since a pkk attack earlier this month on a military border post left 17 turkish soldiers dead .
the pkk uses mountainous northern iraq as a base from which to launch attacks inside turkey .

haarde said he hoped the cash-strapped north atlantic nation will be able to get loans from its nordic neighbours .
the global financial crisis that has battered iceland was one of the main topics at the meeting of the nordic council organization that groups denmark , finland , iceland , norway and sweden as well as three self-ruling territories including greenland .
haarde said many of iceland 's 320,000 inhabitants will be hit by the crisis that has seen the collapse of its three largest commercial banks .
it will be " painful , " he said , stating that some will lose their jobs , others will lose their savings , and that the crisis will set iceland back some five years .
on friday , reykjavik and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- signed a deal for a 2.1-billion-dollar emergency loan from the imf to help stabilize iceland 's economy .
the deal with the imf , that needs approval by the imf board , was the first by a western country since the mid-1970s when britain signed a similar deal .
however , it is estimated that iceland needs an additional 4 billion dollars in loans although haarde did not specify the sum monday .
haarde said a possible deal with the nordics would not rule out a possible deal with russia , referring to recent talks held in moscow .
the central banks of denmark , norway and sweden in may signed a swap facility arrangement with the icelandic central bank which recently drew 400 million euros -lrb- 543 million dollars -rrb- from denmark and norway .

" we believe that the international community has to do what it can , what is required of it , and that is to express its readiness to stand at the side of pakistan , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said tuesday , oct .
28 , at a joint press briefing with his pakistani counterpart shah mahmood qureshi in islamabad . pakistan is facing a balance-of-payments crisis and has just a few weeks to raise billions of dollars in foreign loans needed to meet debt payments and pay for imports . steinmeier said an agreement on help for pakistan was needed within days . " i hope the decision will be made soon , " steinmeier said .
" it wo n't help to have it in six months , or six weeks .
rather , we need it in the coming six days . " steinmeier will be travelling to saudi arabia and the united arab emirates later this week . looming economic meltdown pakistan 's looming economic meltdown has roots in the political crisis that ended with former president pervez musharraf 's resignation in august , and dozens of suicide attacks by taliban militants around the country that have caused foreign investors to flee . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new pakistani president asif ali zardari faces major challenges islamabad 's seven-month-old government has been reluctant to go to the imf and has been looking for help from friendly governments .
but little assistance has materialized . steinmeier said germany would be willing to help pakistan negotiate a deal with the imf . " we will support your country in the negotiations with the imf , " he said . pakistan 's foreign reserves dropped some 75 percent over the last 12 months from $ 18 billion to around $ 4.3 billion .

27 , leading to calls for help to the country 's nordic neighbors . " we are going to get through this crisis and move on , " prime minister geir haarde told reporters before a meeting of nordic prime ministers in finland .
haarde said he hoped the cash-strapped north atlantic nation will be able to get loans from its nordic neighbours .
the global financial crisis that has battered iceland was one of the main topics at the meeting of the nordic council organization that groups denmark , finland , iceland , norway and sweden as well as three self-ruling territories including greenland .
haarde said many of iceland 's 320,000 inhabitants will be hit by the crisis that has seen the collapse of its three largest commercial banks .
it will be " painful , " he said , stating that some will lose their jobs , others will lose their savings , and that the crisis will set iceland back some five years .
on friday , reykjavik and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- signed a deal for a 2.1-billion-dollar emergency loan from the imf to help stabilize iceland 's economy .
the deal with the imf , that needs approval by the imf board , was the first by a western country since the mid-1970s when britain signed a similar deal .
however , it is estimated that iceland needs an additional 4 billion dollars in loans although haarde did not specify the sum monday .
haarde said a possible deal with the nordics would not rule out a possible deal with russia , referring to recent talks held in moscow .
the central banks of denmark , norway and sweden in may signed a swap facility arrangement with the icelandic central bank which recently drew 400 million euros -lrb- 543 million dollars -rrb- from denmark and norway .
the financial unrest has fuelled support in iceland for joining the european union , according to a poll commissioned by the frettabladid newspaper .
the weekend poll of some 800 people suggested more than two in three supported an eu application , up from one in two in february .

former national keeper timo hildebrand may be on his way out at valencia .
the question now : where 's he going next ? valencia thought they had landed a major coup in july 2007 , when they signed timo hildebrand , who was coming off a spirited world cup campaign as a substitute in the german national team and a league title with stuttgart as the teams number 1 .
but just 18 months later , the spanish newspaper marca has reported that valencia 's bosses are so eager to get rid of hildebrand that they would consider letting him go on a free transfer during the winter break .
the reason is mounting tension between the 29-year-old keeper and valencia coach unai emry . " the goalkeeper is no longer satisfied with his role at valencia , and the coaching staff is unhappy with the german 's attitude in training , " reported the internet edition of the spanish newspaper las provincias .
if hildebrand is history in spain , he 'll likely head back to germany .
and be asking fimself , what went wrong ?
from bundesliga to bench bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hildebrand and loew are no longer making ads together hildebrand is a victim of a bad valencia season and a coaching change .
the german gradually fought his way in valencia 's starting line-up last season , but the club spent a good portion of its time fighting relegation .
they eventually finished tenth - an unacceptable result for a team whose fans expected them to qualify for the champions league .
valaencia and hildebrand did win the king 's cup , but that was n't enough to save then-coach ronald koeman 's job .
nor was it sufficient to convince german national coach joachim loew to include hildebrand in his euro 2008 squad .
in the off-season , emry insisted the club bring in brazilian keeper renan , who became the team 's new number 1 .
valencia currently tops the spanish first division .
meanwhile , hildebrand was n't even nominated for valencia 's most recent cup match - an affront to a keeper once tipped to be in line for the top job in the german national side .
which way will he go ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could hildebrand replace former national teammate lehmann at stuttgart ?
hildebrand 's dream-turned-nightmare stint in spain has probably made him less attractive to clubs around europe , but he is positively remembered in germany .
so he could be headed home .
the big question is where .
three names keep cropping up on the rumor mill - dortmund , hoffenheim and stuttgart .
dortmund was linked with hildebrand at the start of the season amidst concerns about keeper roman weidenfeller 's fitness .
but bringing the former in now would create potentially divisive competition .
hoffenheim would no doubt have been eager to sign up hildebrand in july , just as the keeper probably would n't object to joining the surprise club of the season now .
but would hoffenheim , which was on top of the table after 9 rounds , really want to shake up its successful formula ?
finally , stuttgart would make sense since hildebrand has already had success there , and current keeper jens lehmann is rapidly approaching his 40s .
but while it might be an option for next season , it 's hard to see stuttgart replacing the high-profile lehmann in february .
and hildebrand is , no doubt , anxious to get a game as soon as possible and start recovering from what 's proven a fairly disastrous foreign adventure . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de players -pipe- 28.10.2008 spanish paper : hildebrand to leave valencia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hildebrand faces an uphill climb to revive his once promising career germany has a ton of great goalkeepers but they do n't always travel well .
former national keeper timo hildebrand may be on his way out at valencia .
the question now : where 's he going next ? valencia thought they had landed a major coup in july 2007 , when they signed timo hildebrand , who was coming off a spirited world cup campaign as a substitute in the german national team and a league title with stuttgart as the teams number 1 .
but just 18 months later , the spanish newspaper marca has reported that valencia 's bosses are so eager to get rid of hildebrand that they would consider letting him go on a free transfer during the winter break .
the reason is mounting tension between the 29-year-old keeper and valencia coach unai emry . " the goalkeeper is no longer satisfied with his role at valencia , and the coaching staff is unhappy with the german 's attitude in training , " reported the internet edition of the spanish newspaper las provincias .
if hildebrand is history in spain , he 'll likely head back to germany .
and be asking fimself , what went wrong ?
from bundesliga to bench bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hildebrand and loew are no longer making ads together hildebrand is a victim of a bad valencia season and a coaching change .
the german gradually fought his way in valencia 's starting line-up last season , but the club spent a good portion of its time fighting relegation .
they eventually finished tenth - an unacceptable result for a team whose fans expected them to qualify for the champions league .
valaencia and hildebrand did win the king 's cup , but that was n't enough to save then-coach ronald koeman 's job .
nor was it sufficient to convince german national coach joachim loew to include hildebrand in his euro 2008 squad .
in the off-season , emry insisted the club bring in brazilian keeper renan , who became the team 's new number 1 .
valencia currently tops the spanish first division .
meanwhile , hildebrand was n't even nominated for valencia 's most recent cup match - an affront to a keeper once tipped to be in line for the top job in the german national side .
which way will he go ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could hildebrand replace former national teammate lehmann at stuttgart ?
hildebrand 's dream-turned-nightmare stint in spain has probably made him less attractive to clubs around europe , but he is positively remembered in germany .
so he could be headed home .
the big question is where .
three names keep cropping up on the rumor mill - dortmund , hoffenheim and stuttgart .
dortmund was linked with hildebrand at the start of the season amidst concerns about keeper roman weidenfeller 's fitness .
but bringing the former in now would create potentially divisive competition .
hoffenheim would no doubt have been eager to sign up hildebrand in july , just as the keeper probably would n't object to joining the surprise club of the season now .
but would hoffenheim , which was on top of the table after 9 rounds , really want to shake up its successful formula ?
finally , stuttgart would make sense since hildebrand has already had success there , and current keeper jens lehmann is rapidly approaching his 40s .
but while it might be an option for next season , it 's hard to see stuttgart replacing the high-profile lehmann in february .
and hildebrand is , no doubt , anxious to get a game as soon as possible and start recovering from what 's proven a fairly disastrous foreign adventure . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but that does not mean moscow and the bloc have settled their differences over the caucasus . french foreign minister bernard kouchner announced the resumption of talks on a new partnership and cooperation agreement after a meeting with his russian counterpart sergei lavrov in st. petersburg .
those talks had been put on hold , after russia launched military action against georgia 's attempt to retake control of the breakaway provinces of south ossetia and abkhazia in late summer .
" i want to underline the eu-russian partnership talks were never suspended , they were simply delayed , " kouchner told journalists after his talks with lavrov .
kouchner added that negotiations would resume at an eu-russia summit on november 14 .

car parts suppliers will also be hit by the financial crisis , an expert told dw . less than a week after cutting its earnings forecast again , the giant german automaker daimler flagged plans monday , oct .
27 , to shut down work for about four weeks over christmas at key plants , including one producing its flagship luxury mercedes-benz cars . what was needed now daimler chief dieter zetsche told company employees was " the right mix of fighting spirit and perseverance . " the deepening economic gloom resulted in european car sales slumping sharply to 8.2 percent in september , the brussels-based european automobile manufacturers ' association -lrb- acea -rrb- said this month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers are n't looking of a car fresh off the assembly line " the drop in registrations confirms the aggravating market circumstances , as the fall-out of the financial crisis hits auto manufacturers hard , " acea said , adding that registrations had hit their lowest level since september 1998 . the new drop in new european car registrations was unusual , acea said , as auto sales normally pick up after the slower summer months . " the credit crunch weighs on the sector 's ability to finance daily operations , " the acea said .
" customers are increasingly hesitant to make large expenditures and find it more difficult to get their purchase financed . " declines in demand for new cars pushed daimler to shut down production could result in about 150,000 workers having an extended christmas break . this came in the wake of a slew of european carmakers such as general motors ' owned european opel unit saying they were cutting production with the financial crisis hitting the car industry just as it battles to recover from high fuel costs and environmental worries . bmw , the world 's leading premium auto group , said over the weekend it was also leaving plants idle as the looming recession meant car buyers were shying away from showrooms . industry braces for downbeat results the steady stream of grim news out of the european car business came as the industry prepares itself for a further round of downbeat company reports as the auto sector 's third-quarter reporting season gains momentum . while munich-based bmw is expected to report a fall in profits and revenue , europe 's biggest auto manufacturer , volkswagen , is predicted to post a modest rise in earnings on thursday on the back of a solid performance of its core vw brand . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw continues to do okay but its subsidiaries suffer vw said last week that world-wide deliveries increased 3.9 percent to 4.8 million vehicles in the first nine months of the year , as strong demand from leading emerging economies helped to offset declines in other international markets . vw 's stock spiked 200 percent before settling to 520 euros at the close of electronic trading on monday , up 146 percent from friday . analysts said it was not luxury car-maker porsche that was paying the high price , but short sellers who had expected the stock to fall in value and suddenly needed to settle contracts . porsche revealed sunday it had advanced its stake from 35 to 42.6 percent of volkswagen group .
additionally , it had obtained options for an additional 31.5 percent of volkswagen . however , vw 's offshoots seat -lrb- spain -rrb- and skoda -lrb- czech republic -rrb- are being forced to cut production . knock-on effect hits car parts industry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fiat 's future may not be as bright and shiny as it thinks signs have also emerged that the bleak business mood among carmakers was starting to spill over into auto parts sector , with the leading auto accessory group bosch saying it was idling a key plant and sending 400 workers home . " many suppliers of the auto industry are not going to survives , " ferdinand dudenhoeffer , director of the center of automotive research -lrb- car -rrb- in gelsenkirchen , told deutsche welle .
" many jobs are going to be cut . " indeed , in addition to the downbeat third-quarter earnings ' reports , it is the grim outlooks from the carmakers which are unnerving the industry and which have resulted in european stocks taking a big hit in recent weeks . releasing its latest third-quarter results , italy 's fiat warned that in a " worst case scenario " its 2009 profits could slump to 400 million euros -lrb- 513 million dollars -rrb- from a projected 3.4 billion euros this year . france 's two leading carmakers psa-citroen and renault sa , also slashed their earnings forecast last week after fall in sales . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but that does not mean moscow and the bloc have settled their differences over the caucasus . french foreign minister bernard kouchner announced the resumption of talks on a new partnership and cooperation agreement after a meeting with his russian counterpart sergei lavrov in st. petersburg .
those talks had been put on hold , after russia launched military action against georgia 's attempt to retake control of the breakaway provinces of south ossetia and abkhazia in late summer .
" i want to underline the eu-russian partnership talks were never suspended , they were simply delayed , " kouchner told journalists after his talks with lavrov .
kouchner added that negotiations would resume at an eu-russia summit on november 14 .
but france , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , must first get the go-ahead of all eu foreign ministers , when they meet on novermber 10 .
the new agreement is aimed at updating the partnership and cooperation agreement of 1997 , which encompassed political , commercial and cultural projects .
georgia still on their minds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian troops have withdrawn from georgia proper , but not from the breakaway regions critics of russia 's military operations against georgia had objected that moscow had not done enough to merit a resumption of the talks .
in particular , they criticized moscow for not allowing eu monitors access to the two disputed regions .
but russia 's foreign minister was not striking a conciliatory tone on the issue .
" security in south ossetia and abkhazia is assured by russian military contingents after the recognition of their independence by russia , " lavrov said at the press conference with kouchner .
he added that russia felt itself to be in line with the french-brokered ceasefire agreement in so far as it was allowing observers into areas bordering on south ossetia and abkhazia .
moscow has recognized the independence of the two regions , which have ethnic russian majorities , while the eu insisted that they are part of georgia .
kouchner said the eu would seek moscow 's cooperation with an international commission that will investigate how the conflict in the caucasus escalated .
a swiss expert has been nominated to head that commission . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 28.10.2008 experts : obama presidency likely to disappoint foreign fans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this could be obama 's autumn , but will he live up to high hopes ?
as the us presidential election enters its final week , the vast majority of the world is rooting for barack obama .
but analysts say that high global expectations of the democrat will lead to disappointment , if he wins . on monday , barack obama picked up another big endorsement , this time from the daily financial times in london - a conservative-leaning newspaper usually sceptical of democrats .
the ft 's support is a measure of how much europeans would prefer obama over his republican rival john mccain in the white house .
yet the wording of the paper 's endorsement also hints that , whatever the election outcome , everything will not be hunky-dory .
" rest assured that , should he win , mr obama is bound to disappoint , " wrote the ft .
" he is expected to heal the country 's racial divisions , reverse the trend of rising inequality , improve middle-class living standards , cut almost everybody 's taxes , transform the image of the united states abroad , end the losses in iraq , deal with the mess in afghanistan and much more besides . "
pools show anywhere from 60 to 80 percent of continental europeans support obama 's bid for the oval office - compared to single-digit figures for mccain .
in many parts of the media , obama has acquired a quasi-messianic aura .
but experts say european would inevitably be let down by aspects of an obama presidency .
change in style only ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama style is different ; his policies are n't necessarily disappointments would likely result , in part , from political constraints . james goldgeier of the council of the council on foreign relations uses the example of russia to illustrate .
" no president of the united states can tell the russians : yes , you can just do whatever you want in georgia , " goldgeier told the afp .
and political expediency is n't the only potential source of disappointment .
europeans tend to see obama as the candidate of peace , the leader most likely to end the iraq war .
but they often overlook hints from the democrat that he wants to bring military pressure to bear on afghanistan and pakistan - a shift with major implications for europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans could be asked to do more , militarily , on the afghan-pakastani border " barack obama and joe biden will expect allies to commit more resources to this common mission and to remove some of the limits on what their troops in country can do , " obama 's compaign has stated on the candidate 's website .
but experts agree that despite potential conflicts of interest , obama would bring a change in diplomatic style and an improvement in us foreign relations .
" if he were to win , we would see a huge change in just the whole tone of american foreign policy , " said goldgeier , a former diplomat .
justin vaisse , a european expert at the brookings institute , concurs .
" there is a risk of unmet expectations but goodwill should generate more positive responses , " vaisse told afp .
hope for european minorities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hype was huge when obama visited europe this summer an obama presidency would represent a landmark change in race relations in the us - a fact not lost of europeans from minority ethnic backgrounds .
christiana taubira , a french member of parliament from french guyana who ran for her counrtry 's presidency in 2002 , hopes what an obama win could inspire a similar sea change in europe .
" i think very sincerely , given my own experience in 2002 , that french society is ready to enjoy the beautiful adventure that obama has offered americans , " taubira told afp .
but others say the far more institutionalized role of european political parties , in which potential candidates have to work their way up the pecking order , would restrict the chances of a relative outsider like obama .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but it could be a long time before countries like france elect a leader from an immigrant background " the french themselves are ready , but our political system would stop an obama appearing , " french human rights minister rama yade told the french news magazine le figaro .
" not because he 's black , but because he comes from a background of recent immigration , " yade added .
" here , integration is much more difficult . "
europeans will be watching americans go to the polls on nov .
4 with an especially keen , pro-obama eye , even though there are no guarantees that he will do what they want or that they would elect a similar candidates to lead their own societies . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 28.10.2008 experts : obama presidency likely to disappoint foreign fans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this could be obama 's autumn , but will he live up to high hopes ?
as the us presidential election enters its final week , the vast majority of the world is rooting for barack obama .
but analysts say that high global expectations of the democrat will lead to disappointment , if he wins . on monday , barack obama picked up another big endorsement , this time from the daily financial times in london - a conservative-leaning newspaper usually sceptical of democrats .
the ft 's support is a measure of how much europeans would prefer obama over his republican rival john mccain in the white house .
yet the wording of the paper 's endorsement also hints that , whatever the election outcome , everything will not be hunky-dory .
" rest assured that , should he win , mr obama is bound to disappoint , " wrote the ft .
" he is expected to heal the country 's racial divisions , reverse the trend of rising inequality , improve middle-class living standards , cut almost everybody 's taxes , transform the image of the united states abroad , end the losses in iraq , deal with the mess in afghanistan and much more besides . "
pools show anywhere from 60 to 80 percent of continental europeans support obama 's bid for the oval office - compared to single-digit figures for mccain .
in many parts of the media , obama has acquired a quasi-messianic aura .
but experts say european would inevitably be let down by aspects of an obama presidency .
change in style only ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama style is different ; his policies are n't necessarily disappointments would likely result , in part , from political constraints . james goldgeier of the council of the council on foreign relations uses the example of russia to illustrate .
" no president of the united states can tell the russians : yes , you can just do whatever you want in georgia , " goldgeier told the afp .
and political expediency is n't the only potential source of disappointment .
europeans tend to see obama as the candidate of peace , the leader most likely to end the iraq war .
but they often overlook hints from the democrat that he wants to bring military pressure to bear on afghanistan and pakistan - a shift with major implications for europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans could be asked to do more , militarily , on the afghan-pakastani border " barack obama and joe biden will expect allies to commit more resources to this common mission and to remove some of the limits on what their troops in country can do , " obama 's compaign has stated on the candidate 's website .
but experts agree that despite potential conflicts of interest , obama would bring a change in diplomatic style and an improvement in us foreign relations .
" if he were to win , we would see a huge change in just the whole tone of american foreign policy , " said goldgeier , a former diplomat .
justin vaisse , a european expert at the brookings institute , concurs .
" there is a risk of unmet expectations but goodwill should generate more positive responses , " vaisse told afp .
hope for european minorities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hype was huge when obama visited europe this summer an obama presidency would represent a landmark change in race relations in the us - a fact not lost of europeans from minority ethnic backgrounds .
christiana taubira , a french member of parliament from french guyana who ran for her counrtry 's presidency in 2002 , hopes what an obama win could inspire a similar sea change in europe .
" i think very sincerely , given my own experience in 2002 , that french society is ready to enjoy the beautiful adventure that obama has offered americans , " taubira told afp .
but others say the far more institutionalized role of european political parties , in which potential candidates have to work their way up the pecking order , would restrict the chances of a relative outsider like obama .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but it could be a long time before countries like france elect a leader from an immigrant background " the french themselves are ready , but our political system would stop an obama appearing , " french human rights minister rama yade told the french news magazine le figaro .
" not because he 's black , but because he comes from a background of recent immigration , " yade added .
" here , integration is much more difficult . "
europeans will be watching americans go to the polls on nov .
4 with an especially keen , pro-obama eye , even though there are no guarantees that he will do what they want or that they would elect a similar candidates to lead their own societies . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

karadzic complained he had been unable to prepare himself due to the fact he had received the serb translation of the indictment against him only on monday .
" i did not even have time to study it , " karadzic told the court .
chaotic day in court the revised indictment , the english version of which was released on september 22 , showed that the prosecution had reduced the number of charges from 41 to 27 , in a bid to speed up the trial .
at the hearing , scottish judge bonomy said he was " extremely disappointed " about the slow speed of the trial preparations .
he said there had been little progress in the preparations since the former serb leader 's arrest in july .
emotions reached a boiling point when prosecutor alan tieger could not inform the court how many pages of the prosecution 's evidence had not yet been transferred to karadzic in the serb language .
bonomy , visibly annoyed , temporarily adjourned the hearing and left the court room .
upon his return in the trial chamber , tieger told the court a total of 60 pages of evidence had not yet been given to karadzic in serb translation .
karadzic also complained he had insufficient resources to prepare his defence .
the former serb leader is defending himself but has one legal adviser , american attorney peter robinson , appointed by the tribunal earlier this month .

he was arrested in serbia in july after being on the run for more than 12 years .

karadzic complained he had been unable to prepare himself due to the fact he had received the serb translation of the indictment against him only on monday .
" i did not even have time to study it , " karadzic told the court .
chaotic day in court the revised indictment , the english version of which was released on september 22 , showed that the prosecution had reduced the number of charges from 41 to 27 , in a bid to speed up the trial .
at the hearing , scottish judge bonomy said he was " extremely disappointed " about the slow speed of the trial preparations .
he said there had been little progress in the preparations since the former serb leader 's arrest in july .
emotions reached a boiling point when prosecutor alan tieger could not inform the court how many pages of the prosecution 's evidence had not yet been transferred to karadzic in the serb language .
bonomy , visibly annoyed , temporarily adjourned the hearing and left the court room .
upon his return in the trial chamber , tieger told the court a total of 60 pages of evidence had not yet been given to karadzic in serb translation .
karadzic also complained he had insufficient resources to prepare his defence .
the former serb leader is defending himself but has one legal adviser , american attorney peter robinson , appointed by the tribunal earlier this month .
karadzic faces charges of war crimes , crimes against humanity and genocide .
he was arrested in serbia in july after being on the run for more than 12 years .
karadzic has appeared before the court in pre-trial hearings .

as the us presidential election enters its final week , the vast majority of the world is rooting for barack obama .
but analysts say that high global expectations of the democrat will lead to disappointment , if he wins . on monday , barack obama picked up another big endorsement , this time from the daily financial times in london - a conservative-leaning newspaper usually sceptical of democrats .
the ft 's support is a measure of how much europeans would prefer obama over his republican rival john mccain in the white house .
yet the wording of the paper 's endorsement also hints that , whatever the election outcome , everything will not be hunky-dory .
" rest assured that , should he win , mr obama is bound to disappoint , " wrote the ft .
" he is expected to heal the country 's racial divisions , reverse the trend of rising inequality , improve middle-class living standards , cut almost everybody 's taxes , transform the image of the united states abroad , end the losses in iraq , deal with the mess in afghanistan and much more besides . "
pools show anywhere from 60 to 80 percent of continental europeans support obama 's bid for the oval office - compared to single-digit figures for mccain .
in many parts of the media , obama has acquired a quasi-messianic aura .
but experts say european would inevitably be let down by aspects of an obama presidency .

and political expediency is n't the only potential source of disappointment .
europeans tend to see obama as the candidate of peace , the leader most likely to end the iraq war .

as the us presidential election enters its final week , the vast majority of the world is rooting for barack obama .
but analysts say that high global expectations of the democrat will lead to disappointment , if he wins . on monday , barack obama picked up another big endorsement , this time from the daily financial times in london - a conservative-leaning newspaper usually sceptical of democrats .
the ft 's support is a measure of how much europeans would prefer obama over his republican rival john mccain in the white house .
yet the wording of the paper 's endorsement also hints that , whatever the election outcome , everything will not be hunky-dory .
" rest assured that , should he win , mr obama is bound to disappoint , " wrote the ft .
" he is expected to heal the country 's racial divisions , reverse the trend of rising inequality , improve middle-class living standards , cut almost everybody 's taxes , transform the image of the united states abroad , end the losses in iraq , deal with the mess in afghanistan and much more besides . "
pools show anywhere from 60 to 80 percent of continental europeans support obama 's bid for the oval office - compared to single-digit figures for mccain .
in many parts of the media , obama has acquired a quasi-messianic aura .
but experts say european would inevitably be let down by aspects of an obama presidency .

car parts suppliers will also be hit by the financial crisis , an expert told dw . less than a week after cutting its earnings forecast again , the giant german automaker daimler flagged plans monday , oct .
27 , to shut down work for about four weeks over christmas at key plants , including one producing its flagship luxury mercedes-benz cars . what was needed now daimler chief dieter zetsche told company employees was " the right mix of fighting spirit and perseverance . " the deepening economic gloom resulted in european car sales slumping sharply to 8.2 percent in september , the brussels-based european automobile manufacturers ' association -lrb- acea -rrb- said this month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers are n't looking of a car fresh off the assembly line " the drop in registrations confirms the aggravating market circumstances , as the fall-out of the financial crisis hits auto manufacturers hard , " acea said , adding that registrations had hit their lowest level since september 1998 . the new drop in new european car registrations was unusual , acea said , as auto sales normally pick up after the slower summer months .

but that does not mean moscow and the bloc have settled their differences over the caucasus . french foreign minister bernard kouchner announced the resumption of talks on a new partnership and cooperation agreement after a meeting with his russian counterpart sergei lavrov in st. petersburg .
those talks had been put on hold , after russia launched military action against georgia 's attempt to retake control of the breakaway provinces of south ossetia and abkhazia in late summer .
" i want to underline the eu-russian partnership talks were never suspended , they were simply delayed , " kouchner told journalists after his talks with lavrov .
kouchner added that negotiations would resume at an eu-russia summit on november 14 .
but france , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , must first get the go-ahead of all eu foreign ministers , when they meet on novermber 10 .

but russia 's foreign minister was not striking a conciliatory tone on the issue .
" security in south ossetia and abkhazia is assured by russian military contingents after the recognition of their independence by russia , " lavrov said at the press conference with kouchner .
he added that russia felt itself to be in line with the french-brokered ceasefire agreement in so far as it was allowing observers into areas bordering on south ossetia and abkhazia .
moscow has recognized the independence of the two regions , which have ethnic russian majorities , while the eu insisted that they are part of georgia .
kouchner said the eu would seek moscow 's cooperation with an international commission that will investigate how the conflict in the caucasus escalated .

but that does not mean moscow and the bloc have settled their differences over the caucasus . french foreign minister bernard kouchner announced the resumption of talks on a new partnership and cooperation agreement after a meeting with his russian counterpart sergei lavrov in st. petersburg .
those talks had been put on hold , after russia launched military action against georgia 's attempt to retake control of the breakaway provinces of south ossetia and abkhazia in late summer .
" i want to underline the eu-russian partnership talks were never suspended , they were simply delayed , " kouchner told journalists after his talks with lavrov .
kouchner added that negotiations would resume at an eu-russia summit on november 14 .
but france , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , must first get the go-ahead of all eu foreign ministers , when they meet on novermber 10 .
the new agreement is aimed at updating the partnership and cooperation agreement of 1997 , which encompassed political , commercial and cultural projects .
georgia still on their minds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian troops have withdrawn from georgia proper , but not from the breakaway regions critics of russia 's military operations against georgia had objected that moscow had not done enough to merit a resumption of the talks .
in particular , they criticized moscow for not allowing eu monitors access to the two disputed regions .
but russia 's foreign minister was not striking a conciliatory tone on the issue .
" security in south ossetia and abkhazia is assured by russian military contingents after the recognition of their independence by russia , " lavrov said at the press conference with kouchner .
he added that russia felt itself to be in line with the french-brokered ceasefire agreement in so far as it was allowing observers into areas bordering on south ossetia and abkhazia .
moscow has recognized the independence of the two regions , which have ethnic russian majorities , while the eu insisted that they are part of georgia .
kouchner said the eu would seek moscow 's cooperation with an international commission that will investigate how the conflict in the caucasus escalated .
a swiss expert has been nominated to head that commission . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but that does not mean moscow and the bloc have settled their differences over the caucasus . french foreign minister bernard kouchner announced the resumption of talks on a new partnership and cooperation agreement after a meeting with his russian counterpart sergei lavrov in st. petersburg .
those talks had been put on hold , after russia launched military action against georgia 's attempt to retake control of the breakaway provinces of south ossetia and abkhazia in late summer .
" i want to underline the eu-russian partnership talks were never suspended , they were simply delayed , " kouchner told journalists after his talks with lavrov .
kouchner added that negotiations would resume at an eu-russia summit on november 14 .
but france , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , must first get the go-ahead of all eu foreign ministers , when they meet on novermber 10 .
the new agreement is aimed at updating the partnership and cooperation agreement of 1997 , which encompassed political , commercial and cultural projects .
georgia still on their minds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian troops have withdrawn from georgia proper , but not from the breakaway regions critics of russia 's military operations against georgia had objected that moscow had not done enough to merit a resumption of the talks .
in particular , they criticized moscow for not allowing eu monitors access to the two disputed regions .
but russia 's foreign minister was not striking a conciliatory tone on the issue .
" security in south ossetia and abkhazia is assured by russian military contingents after the recognition of their independence by russia , " lavrov said at the press conference with kouchner .
he added that russia felt itself to be in line with the french-brokered ceasefire agreement in so far as it was allowing observers into areas bordering on south ossetia and abkhazia .
moscow has recognized the independence of the two regions , which have ethnic russian majorities , while the eu insisted that they are part of georgia .
kouchner said the eu would seek moscow 's cooperation with an international commission that will investigate how the conflict in the caucasus escalated .
a swiss expert has been nominated to head that commission . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

former national keeper timo hildebrand may be on his way out at valencia .
the question now : where 's he going next ? valencia thought they had landed a major coup in july 2007 , when they signed timo hildebrand , who was coming off a spirited world cup campaign as a substitute in the german national team and a league title with stuttgart as the teams number 1 .
but just 18 months later , the spanish newspaper marca has reported that valencia 's bosses are so eager to get rid of hildebrand that they would consider letting him go on a free transfer during the winter break .
the reason is mounting tension between the 29-year-old keeper and valencia coach unai emry . " the goalkeeper is no longer satisfied with his role at valencia , and the coaching staff is unhappy with the german 's attitude in training , " reported the internet edition of the spanish newspaper las provincias .
if hildebrand is history in spain , he 'll likely head back to germany .
and be asking fimself , what went wrong ?
from bundesliga to bench bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hildebrand and loew are no longer making ads together hildebrand is a victim of a bad valencia season and a coaching change .
the german gradually fought his way in valencia 's starting line-up last season , but the club spent a good portion of its time fighting relegation .
they eventually finished tenth - an unacceptable result for a team whose fans expected them to qualify for the champions league .
valaencia and hildebrand did win the king 's cup , but that was n't enough to save then-coach ronald koeman 's job .
nor was it sufficient to convince german national coach joachim loew to include hildebrand in his euro 2008 squad .
in the off-season , emry insisted the club bring in brazilian keeper renan , who became the team 's new number 1 .
valencia currently tops the spanish first division .
meanwhile , hildebrand was n't even nominated for valencia 's most recent cup match - an affront to a keeper once tipped to be in line for the top job in the german national side .
which way will he go ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could hildebrand replace former national teammate lehmann at stuttgart ?
hildebrand 's dream-turned-nightmare stint in spain has probably made him less attractive to clubs around europe , but he is positively remembered in germany .
so he could be headed home .
the big question is where .
three names keep cropping up on the rumor mill - dortmund , hoffenheim and stuttgart .
dortmund was linked with hildebrand at the start of the season amidst concerns about keeper roman weidenfeller 's fitness .
but bringing the former in now would create potentially divisive competition .
hoffenheim would no doubt have been eager to sign up hildebrand in july , just as the keeper probably would n't object to joining the surprise club of the season now .
but would hoffenheim , which was on top of the table after 9 rounds , really want to shake up its successful formula ?
finally , stuttgart would make sense since hildebrand has already had success there , and current keeper jens lehmann is rapidly approaching his 40s .
but while it might be an option for next season , it 's hard to see stuttgart replacing the high-profile lehmann in february .
and hildebrand is , no doubt , anxious to get a game as soon as possible and start recovering from what 's proven a fairly disastrous foreign adventure . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the question now : where 's he going next ? valencia thought they had landed a major coup in july 2007 , when they signed timo hildebrand , who was coming off a spirited world cup campaign as a substitute in the german national team and a league title with stuttgart as the teams number 1 .
but just 18 months later , the spanish newspaper marca has reported that valencia 's bosses are so eager to get rid of hildebrand that they would consider letting him go on a free transfer during the winter break .
the reason is mounting tension between the 29-year-old keeper and valencia coach unai emry . " the goalkeeper is no longer satisfied with his role at valencia , and the coaching staff is unhappy with the german 's attitude in training , " reported the internet edition of the spanish newspaper las provincias .
if hildebrand is history in spain , he 'll likely head back to germany .
and be asking fimself , what went wrong ?
from bundesliga to bench bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hildebrand and loew are no longer making ads together hildebrand is a victim of a bad valencia season and a coaching change .
the german gradually fought his way in valencia 's starting line-up last season , but the club spent a good portion of its time fighting relegation .
they eventually finished tenth - an unacceptable result for a team whose fans expected them to qualify for the champions league .
valaencia and hildebrand did win the king 's cup , but that was n't enough to save then-coach ronald koeman 's job .
nor was it sufficient to convince german national coach joachim loew to include hildebrand in his euro 2008 squad .
in the off-season , emry insisted the club bring in brazilian keeper renan , who became the team 's new number 1 .
valencia currently tops the spanish first division .
meanwhile , hildebrand was n't even nominated for valencia 's most recent cup match - an affront to a keeper once tipped to be in line for the top job in the german national side .
which way will he go ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could hildebrand replace former national teammate lehmann at stuttgart ?
hildebrand 's dream-turned-nightmare stint in spain has probably made him less attractive to clubs around europe , but he is positively remembered in germany .
so he could be headed home .
the big question is where .
three names keep cropping up on the rumor mill - dortmund , hoffenheim and stuttgart .
dortmund was linked with hildebrand at the start of the season amidst concerns about keeper roman weidenfeller 's fitness .
but bringing the former in now would create potentially divisive competition .
hoffenheim would no doubt have been eager to sign up hildebrand in july , just as the keeper probably would n't object to joining the surprise club of the season now .
but would hoffenheim , which was on top of the table after 9 rounds , really want to shake up its successful formula ?
finally , stuttgart would make sense since hildebrand has already had success there , and current keeper jens lehmann is rapidly approaching his 40s .
but while it might be an option for next season , it 's hard to see stuttgart replacing the high-profile lehmann in february .
and hildebrand is , no doubt , anxious to get a game as soon as possible and start recovering from what 's proven a fairly disastrous foreign adventure . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i hope the decision will be made soon , " steinmeier said .
" it wo n't help to have it in six months , or six weeks .

" we are both of this opinion that the pakistan-german relations need a comprehensive upgrade in all fields - politics , economy , military and culture , " qureshi said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soliders in afghanistan have increasingly come under attack recently earlier , in an interview with pakistan daily the news , steinmeier said in the short-term , germany " would like to help solve " issues like extremist threats and the financial situation .
in the long-term , berlin wants to contribute to strengthening the rule of law , human rights and civil society , he added . on afghanistan , where germany is planning to increase its troop numbers to 4,500 , steinmeier said afghan-pakistan cooperation was key to resolving the conflict .

" we believe that the international community has to do what it can , what is required of it , and that is to express its readiness to stand at the side of pakistan , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said tuesday , oct .
28 , at a joint press briefing with his pakistani counterpart shah mahmood qureshi in islamabad . pakistan is facing a balance-of-payments crisis and has just a few weeks to raise billions of dollars in foreign loans needed to meet debt payments and pay for imports . steinmeier said an agreement on help for pakistan was needed within days . " i hope the decision will be made soon , " steinmeier said .
" it wo n't help to have it in six months , or six weeks .
rather , we need it in the coming six days . " steinmeier will be travelling to saudi arabia and the united arab emirates later this week . looming economic meltdown pakistan 's looming economic meltdown has roots in the political crisis that ended with former president pervez musharraf 's resignation in august , and dozens of suicide attacks by taliban militants around the country that have caused foreign investors to flee . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new pakistani president asif ali zardari faces major challenges islamabad 's seven-month-old government has been reluctant to go to the imf and has been looking for help from friendly governments .
but little assistance has materialized . steinmeier said germany would be willing to help pakistan negotiate a deal with the imf . " we will support your country in the negotiations with the imf , " he said . pakistan 's foreign reserves dropped some 75 percent over the last 12 months from $ 18 billion to around $ 4.3 billion .
at the same time , the rupee has weakened by more than 27 percent against the dollar , the current-account deficit reached a record $ 14 billion in the year ending june 30 , and inflation has risen to over 30 percent . prolonged power outages and skyrocketing electricity tariffs have already triggered countrywide protests in recent weeks , raising fears that the nuclear-armed muslim nation might fall into chaos , and further complicate the ongoing fight against the islamic insurgency in afghanistan . islamabad has appealed to the friends of pakistan group , which held its first formal meeting during the recent un general assembly session in new york , for urgent assistance . the group , which includes members of the european union , the united states and china , plans to hold another meeting next month in abu dhabi to discuss how to provide financial help to pakistan to prevent further destabilization . germany in for the long haul steinmeier said germany had identified several areas of cooperation , focusing on increased german investment and support in the education sector . " we are both of this opinion that the pakistan-german relations need a comprehensive upgrade in all fields - politics , economy , military and culture , " qureshi said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soliders in afghanistan have increasingly come under attack recently earlier , in an interview with pakistan daily the news , steinmeier said in the short-term , germany " would like to help solve " issues like extremist threats and the financial situation .
in the long-term , berlin wants to contribute to strengthening the rule of law , human rights and civil society , he added . on afghanistan , where germany is planning to increase its troop numbers to 4,500 , steinmeier said afghan-pakistan cooperation was key to resolving the conflict . " you will not stop al-qaeda by drilling a well , but you might help reduce militant opposition if you provide job prospects to the young and uneducated in the border region , " he said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

27 , leading to calls for help to the country 's nordic neighbors . " we are going to get through this crisis and move on , " prime minister geir haarde told reporters before a meeting of nordic prime ministers in finland .
haarde said he hoped the cash-strapped north atlantic nation will be able to get loans from its nordic neighbours .
the global financial crisis that has battered iceland was one of the main topics at the meeting of the nordic council organization that groups denmark , finland , iceland , norway and sweden as well as three self-ruling territories including greenland .
haarde said many of iceland 's 320,000 inhabitants will be hit by the crisis that has seen the collapse of its three largest commercial banks .
it will be " painful , " he said , stating that some will lose their jobs , others will lose their savings , and that the crisis will set iceland back some five years .
on friday , reykjavik and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- signed a deal for a 2.1-billion-dollar emergency loan from the imf to help stabilize iceland 's economy .
the deal with the imf , that needs approval by the imf board , was the first by a western country since the mid-1970s when britain signed a similar deal .
however , it is estimated that iceland needs an additional 4 billion dollars in loans although haarde did not specify the sum monday .
haarde said a possible deal with the nordics would not rule out a possible deal with russia , referring to recent talks held in moscow .
the central banks of denmark , norway and sweden in may signed a swap facility arrangement with the icelandic central bank which recently drew 400 million euros -lrb- 543 million dollars -rrb- from denmark and norway .
the financial unrest has fuelled support in iceland for joining the european union , according to a poll commissioned by the frettabladid newspaper .
the weekend poll of some 800 people suggested more than two in three supported an eu application , up from one in two in february .

27 , leading to calls for help to the country 's nordic neighbors . " we are going to get through this crisis and move on , " prime minister geir haarde told reporters before a meeting of nordic prime ministers in finland .
haarde said he hoped the cash-strapped north atlantic nation will be able to get loans from its nordic neighbours .
the global financial crisis that has battered iceland was one of the main topics at the meeting of the nordic council organization that groups denmark , finland , iceland , norway and sweden as well as three self-ruling territories including greenland .
haarde said many of iceland 's 320,000 inhabitants will be hit by the crisis that has seen the collapse of its three largest commercial banks .
it will be " painful , " he said , stating that some will lose their jobs , others will lose their savings , and that the crisis will set iceland back some five years .
on friday , reykjavik and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- signed a deal for a 2.1-billion-dollar emergency loan from the imf to help stabilize iceland 's economy .
the deal with the imf , that needs approval by the imf board , was the first by a western country since the mid-1970s when britain signed a similar deal .
however , it is estimated that iceland needs an additional 4 billion dollars in loans although haarde did not specify the sum monday .
haarde said a possible deal with the nordics would not rule out a possible deal with russia , referring to recent talks held in moscow .
the central banks of denmark , norway and sweden in may signed a swap facility arrangement with the icelandic central bank which recently drew 400 million euros -lrb- 543 million dollars -rrb- from denmark and norway .
the financial unrest has fuelled support in iceland for joining the european union , according to a poll commissioned by the frettabladid newspaper .
the weekend poll of some 800 people suggested more than two in three supported an eu application , up from one in two in february .
haarde , whose independence party has opposed joining the bloc , said discussions about membership would have to await the resolution of the crisis . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

karadzic complained he had been unable to prepare himself due to the fact he had received the serb translation of the indictment against him only on monday .
" i did not even have time to study it , " karadzic told the court .
chaotic day in court the revised indictment , the english version of which was released on september 22 , showed that the prosecution had reduced the number of charges from 41 to 27 , in a bid to speed up the trial .
at the hearing , scottish judge bonomy said he was " extremely disappointed " about the slow speed of the trial preparations .
he said there had been little progress in the preparations since the former serb leader 's arrest in july .
emotions reached a boiling point when prosecutor alan tieger could not inform the court how many pages of the prosecution 's evidence had not yet been transferred to karadzic in the serb language .
bonomy , visibly annoyed , temporarily adjourned the hearing and left the court room .
upon his return in the trial chamber , tieger told the court a total of 60 pages of evidence had not yet been given to karadzic in serb translation .
karadzic also complained he had insufficient resources to prepare his defence .

karadzic complained he had been unable to prepare himself due to the fact he had received the serb translation of the indictment against him only on monday .
" i did not even have time to study it , " karadzic told the court .
chaotic day in court the revised indictment , the english version of which was released on september 22 , showed that the prosecution had reduced the number of charges from 41 to 27 , in a bid to speed up the trial .
at the hearing , scottish judge bonomy said he was " extremely disappointed " about the slow speed of the trial preparations .
he said there had been little progress in the preparations since the former serb leader 's arrest in july .
emotions reached a boiling point when prosecutor alan tieger could not inform the court how many pages of the prosecution 's evidence had not yet been transferred to karadzic in the serb language .
bonomy , visibly annoyed , temporarily adjourned the hearing and left the court room .
upon his return in the trial chamber , tieger told the court a total of 60 pages of evidence had not yet been given to karadzic in serb translation .
karadzic also complained he had insufficient resources to prepare his defence .
the former serb leader is defending himself but has one legal adviser , american attorney peter robinson , appointed by the tribunal earlier this month .
karadzic faces charges of war crimes , crimes against humanity and genocide .
he was arrested in serbia in july after being on the run for more than 12 years .
karadzic has appeared before the court in pre-trial hearings .

as the us presidential election enters its final week , the vast majority of the world is rooting for barack obama .
but analysts say that high global expectations of the democrat will lead to disappointment , if he wins . on monday , barack obama picked up another big endorsement , this time from the daily financial times in london - a conservative-leaning newspaper usually sceptical of democrats .
the ft 's support is a measure of how much europeans would prefer obama over his republican rival john mccain in the white house .
yet the wording of the paper 's endorsement also hints that , whatever the election outcome , everything will not be hunky-dory .
" rest assured that , should he win , mr obama is bound to disappoint , " wrote the ft .
" he is expected to heal the country 's racial divisions , reverse the trend of rising inequality , improve middle-class living standards , cut almost everybody 's taxes , transform the image of the united states abroad , end the losses in iraq , deal with the mess in afghanistan and much more besides . "
pools show anywhere from 60 to 80 percent of continental europeans support obama 's bid for the oval office - compared to single-digit figures for mccain .
in many parts of the media , obama has acquired a quasi-messianic aura .
but experts say european would inevitably be let down by aspects of an obama presidency .

" no president of the united states can tell the russians : yes , you can just do whatever you want in georgia , " goldgeier told the afp .
and political expediency is n't the only potential source of disappointment .
europeans tend to see obama as the candidate of peace , the leader most likely to end the iraq war .

as the us presidential election enters its final week , the vast majority of the world is rooting for barack obama .
but analysts say that high global expectations of the democrat will lead to disappointment , if he wins . on monday , barack obama picked up another big endorsement , this time from the daily financial times in london - a conservative-leaning newspaper usually sceptical of democrats .
the ft 's support is a measure of how much europeans would prefer obama over his republican rival john mccain in the white house .
yet the wording of the paper 's endorsement also hints that , whatever the election outcome , everything will not be hunky-dory .
" rest assured that , should he win , mr obama is bound to disappoint , " wrote the ft .
" he is expected to heal the country 's racial divisions , reverse the trend of rising inequality , improve middle-class living standards , cut almost everybody 's taxes , transform the image of the united states abroad , end the losses in iraq , deal with the mess in afghanistan and much more besides . "
pools show anywhere from 60 to 80 percent of continental europeans support obama 's bid for the oval office - compared to single-digit figures for mccain .
in many parts of the media , obama has acquired a quasi-messianic aura .
but experts say european would inevitably be let down by aspects of an obama presidency .
change in style only ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama style is different ; his policies are n't necessarily disappointments would likely result , in part , from political constraints . james goldgeier of the council of the council on foreign relations uses the example of russia to illustrate .
" no president of the united states can tell the russians : yes , you can just do whatever you want in georgia , " goldgeier told the afp .
and political expediency is n't the only potential source of disappointment .
europeans tend to see obama as the candidate of peace , the leader most likely to end the iraq war .
but they often overlook hints from the democrat that he wants to bring military pressure to bear on afghanistan and pakistan - a shift with major implications for europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans could be asked to do more , militarily , on the afghan-pakastani border " barack obama and joe biden will expect allies to commit more resources to this common mission and to remove some of the limits on what their troops in country can do , " obama 's compaign has stated on the candidate 's website .
but experts agree that despite potential conflicts of interest , obama would bring a change in diplomatic style and an improvement in us foreign relations .
" if he were to win , we would see a huge change in just the whole tone of american foreign policy , " said goldgeier , a former diplomat .
justin vaisse , a european expert at the brookings institute , concurs .
" there is a risk of unmet expectations but goodwill should generate more positive responses , " vaisse told afp .
hope for european minorities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hype was huge when obama visited europe this summer an obama presidency would represent a landmark change in race relations in the us - a fact not lost of europeans from minority ethnic backgrounds .
christiana taubira , a french member of parliament from french guyana who ran for her counrtry 's presidency in 2002 , hopes what an obama win could inspire a similar sea change in europe .
" i think very sincerely , given my own experience in 2002 , that french society is ready to enjoy the beautiful adventure that obama has offered americans , " taubira told afp .
but others say the far more institutionalized role of european political parties , in which potential candidates have to work their way up the pecking order , would restrict the chances of a relative outsider like obama .

27 , leading to calls for help to the country 's nordic neighbors . " we are going to get through this crisis and move on , " prime minister geir haarde told reporters before a meeting of nordic prime ministers in finland .
haarde said he hoped the cash-strapped north atlantic nation will be able to get loans from its nordic neighbours .
the global financial crisis that has battered iceland was one of the main topics at the meeting of the nordic council organization that groups denmark , finland , iceland , norway and sweden as well as three self-ruling territories including greenland .
haarde said many of iceland 's 320,000 inhabitants will be hit by the crisis that has seen the collapse of its three largest commercial banks .
it will be " painful , " he said , stating that some will lose their jobs , others will lose their savings , and that the crisis will set iceland back some five years .
on friday , reykjavik and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- signed a deal for a 2.1-billion-dollar emergency loan from the imf to help stabilize iceland 's economy .
the deal with the imf , that needs approval by the imf board , was the first by a western country since the mid-1970s when britain signed a similar deal .
however , it is estimated that iceland needs an additional 4 billion dollars in loans although haarde did not specify the sum monday .
haarde said a possible deal with the nordics would not rule out a possible deal with russia , referring to recent talks held in moscow .
the central banks of denmark , norway and sweden in may signed a swap facility arrangement with the icelandic central bank which recently drew 400 million euros -lrb- 543 million dollars -rrb- from denmark and norway .
the financial unrest has fuelled support in iceland for joining the european union , according to a poll commissioned by the frettabladid newspaper .
the weekend poll of some 800 people suggested more than two in three supported an eu application , up from one in two in february .

however , it is estimated that iceland needs an additional 4 billion dollars in loans although haarde did not specify the sum monday .
haarde said a possible deal with the nordics would not rule out a possible deal with russia , referring to recent talks held in moscow .
the central banks of denmark , norway and sweden in may signed a swap facility arrangement with the icelandic central bank which recently drew 400 million euros -lrb- 543 million dollars -rrb- from denmark and norway .
the financial unrest has fuelled support in iceland for joining the european union , according to a poll commissioned by the frettabladid newspaper .
the weekend poll of some 800 people suggested more than two in three supported an eu application , up from one in two in february .
haarde , whose independence party has opposed joining the bloc , said discussions about membership would have to await the resolution of the crisis . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

haarde said he hoped the cash-strapped north atlantic nation will be able to get loans from its nordic neighbours .
the global financial crisis that has battered iceland was one of the main topics at the meeting of the nordic council organization that groups denmark , finland , iceland , norway and sweden as well as three self-ruling territories including greenland .
haarde said many of iceland 's 320,000 inhabitants will be hit by the crisis that has seen the collapse of its three largest commercial banks .
it will be " painful , " he said , stating that some will lose their jobs , others will lose their savings , and that the crisis will set iceland back some five years .
on friday , reykjavik and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- signed a deal for a 2.1-billion-dollar emergency loan from the imf to help stabilize iceland 's economy .
the deal with the imf , that needs approval by the imf board , was the first by a western country since the mid-1970s when britain signed a similar deal .
however , it is estimated that iceland needs an additional 4 billion dollars in loans although haarde did not specify the sum monday .
haarde said a possible deal with the nordics would not rule out a possible deal with russia , referring to recent talks held in moscow .
the central banks of denmark , norway and sweden in may signed a swap facility arrangement with the icelandic central bank which recently drew 400 million euros -lrb- 543 million dollars -rrb- from denmark and norway .
the financial unrest has fuelled support in iceland for joining the european union , according to a poll commissioned by the frettabladid newspaper .

27 , leading to calls for help to the country 's nordic neighbors . " we are going to get through this crisis and move on , " prime minister geir haarde told reporters before a meeting of nordic prime ministers in finland .
haarde said he hoped the cash-strapped north atlantic nation will be able to get loans from its nordic neighbours .
the global financial crisis that has battered iceland was one of the main topics at the meeting of the nordic council organization that groups denmark , finland , iceland , norway and sweden as well as three self-ruling territories including greenland .
haarde said many of iceland 's 320,000 inhabitants will be hit by the crisis that has seen the collapse of its three largest commercial banks .
it will be " painful , " he said , stating that some will lose their jobs , others will lose their savings , and that the crisis will set iceland back some five years .
on friday , reykjavik and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- signed a deal for a 2.1-billion-dollar emergency loan from the imf to help stabilize iceland 's economy .
the deal with the imf , that needs approval by the imf board , was the first by a western country since the mid-1970s when britain signed a similar deal .
however , it is estimated that iceland needs an additional 4 billion dollars in loans although haarde did not specify the sum monday .
haarde said a possible deal with the nordics would not rule out a possible deal with russia , referring to recent talks held in moscow .
the central banks of denmark , norway and sweden in may signed a swap facility arrangement with the icelandic central bank which recently drew 400 million euros -lrb- 543 million dollars -rrb- from denmark and norway .
the financial unrest has fuelled support in iceland for joining the european union , according to a poll commissioned by the frettabladid newspaper .
the weekend poll of some 800 people suggested more than two in three supported an eu application , up from one in two in february .
haarde , whose independence party has opposed joining the bloc , said discussions about membership would have to await the resolution of the crisis . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

compared with the several hundred billion dollars industrialized countries were ploughing into shoring up their banking systems , the amount needed to avoid hunger in the world - which he put at 30 billion euros -lrb- $ 37.5 billion -rrb- - was small change , he said .
on monday , pottering told the reopening of the pan-african parliament in midrand , near johannesburg , that the european parliament would stand over the donor community to make sure it honoured its commitments on development aid .
he also called for the urgent implementation of zimbabwe 's power-sharing agreement , which has been held up for over six weeks by squabbling over cabinet posts .

former national keeper timo hildebrand may be on his way out at valencia .
the question now : where 's he going next ? valencia thought they had landed a major coup in july 2007 , when they signed timo hildebrand , who was coming off a spirited world cup campaign as a substitute in the german national team and a league title with stuttgart as the teams number 1 .
but just 18 months later , the spanish newspaper marca has reported that valencia 's bosses are so eager to get rid of hildebrand that they would consider letting him go on a free transfer during the winter break .
the reason is mounting tension between the 29-year-old keeper and valencia coach unai emry . " the goalkeeper is no longer satisfied with his role at valencia , and the coaching staff is unhappy with the german 's attitude in training , " reported the internet edition of the spanish newspaper las provincias .
if hildebrand is history in spain , he 'll likely head back to germany .
and be asking fimself , what went wrong ?
from bundesliga to bench bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hildebrand and loew are no longer making ads together hildebrand is a victim of a bad valencia season and a coaching change .
the german gradually fought his way in valencia 's starting line-up last season , but the club spent a good portion of its time fighting relegation .
they eventually finished tenth - an unacceptable result for a team whose fans expected them to qualify for the champions league .
valaencia and hildebrand did win the king 's cup , but that was n't enough to save then-coach ronald koeman 's job .
nor was it sufficient to convince german national coach joachim loew to include hildebrand in his euro 2008 squad .
in the off-season , emry insisted the club bring in brazilian keeper renan , who became the team 's new number 1 .
valencia currently tops the spanish first division .
meanwhile , hildebrand was n't even nominated for valencia 's most recent cup match - an affront to a keeper once tipped to be in line for the top job in the german national side .
which way will he go ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could hildebrand replace former national teammate lehmann at stuttgart ?
hildebrand 's dream-turned-nightmare stint in spain has probably made him less attractive to clubs around europe , but he is positively remembered in germany .
so he could be headed home .
the big question is where .
three names keep cropping up on the rumor mill - dortmund , hoffenheim and stuttgart .
dortmund was linked with hildebrand at the start of the season amidst concerns about keeper roman weidenfeller 's fitness .
but bringing the former in now would create potentially divisive competition .
hoffenheim would no doubt have been eager to sign up hildebrand in july , just as the keeper probably would n't object to joining the surprise club of the season now .
but would hoffenheim , which was on top of the table after 9 rounds , really want to shake up its successful formula ?
finally , stuttgart would make sense since hildebrand has already had success there , and current keeper jens lehmann is rapidly approaching his 40s .
but while it might be an option for next season , it 's hard to see stuttgart replacing the high-profile lehmann in february .

former national keeper timo hildebrand may be on his way out at valencia .
the question now : where 's he going next ? valencia thought they had landed a major coup in july 2007 , when they signed timo hildebrand , who was coming off a spirited world cup campaign as a substitute in the german national team and a league title with stuttgart as the teams number 1 .
but just 18 months later , the spanish newspaper marca has reported that valencia 's bosses are so eager to get rid of hildebrand that they would consider letting him go on a free transfer during the winter break .
the reason is mounting tension between the 29-year-old keeper and valencia coach unai emry . " the goalkeeper is no longer satisfied with his role at valencia , and the coaching staff is unhappy with the german 's attitude in training , " reported the internet edition of the spanish newspaper las provincias .
if hildebrand is history in spain , he 'll likely head back to germany .
and be asking fimself , what went wrong ?
from bundesliga to bench bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hildebrand and loew are no longer making ads together hildebrand is a victim of a bad valencia season and a coaching change .
the german gradually fought his way in valencia 's starting line-up last season , but the club spent a good portion of its time fighting relegation .
they eventually finished tenth - an unacceptable result for a team whose fans expected them to qualify for the champions league .
valaencia and hildebrand did win the king 's cup , but that was n't enough to save then-coach ronald koeman 's job .
nor was it sufficient to convince german national coach joachim loew to include hildebrand in his euro 2008 squad .
in the off-season , emry insisted the club bring in brazilian keeper renan , who became the team 's new number 1 .
valencia currently tops the spanish first division .
meanwhile , hildebrand was n't even nominated for valencia 's most recent cup match - an affront to a keeper once tipped to be in line for the top job in the german national side .
which way will he go ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could hildebrand replace former national teammate lehmann at stuttgart ?
hildebrand 's dream-turned-nightmare stint in spain has probably made him less attractive to clubs around europe , but he is positively remembered in germany .
so he could be headed home .
the big question is where .
three names keep cropping up on the rumor mill - dortmund , hoffenheim and stuttgart .
dortmund was linked with hildebrand at the start of the season amidst concerns about keeper roman weidenfeller 's fitness .
but bringing the former in now would create potentially divisive competition .
hoffenheim would no doubt have been eager to sign up hildebrand in july , just as the keeper probably would n't object to joining the surprise club of the season now .
but would hoffenheim , which was on top of the table after 9 rounds , really want to shake up its successful formula ?
finally , stuttgart would make sense since hildebrand has already had success there , and current keeper jens lehmann is rapidly approaching his 40s .
but while it might be an option for next season , it 's hard to see stuttgart replacing the high-profile lehmann in february .
and hildebrand is , no doubt , anxious to get a game as soon as possible and start recovering from what 's proven a fairly disastrous foreign adventure . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but that does not mean moscow and the bloc have settled their differences over the caucasus . french foreign minister bernard kouchner announced the resumption of talks on a new partnership and cooperation agreement after a meeting with his russian counterpart sergei lavrov in st. petersburg .
those talks had been put on hold , after russia launched military action against georgia 's attempt to retake control of the breakaway provinces of south ossetia and abkhazia in late summer .
" i want to underline the eu-russian partnership talks were never suspended , they were simply delayed , " kouchner told journalists after his talks with lavrov .
kouchner added that negotiations would resume at an eu-russia summit on november 14 .
but france , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , must first get the go-ahead of all eu foreign ministers , when they meet on novermber 10 .
the new agreement is aimed at updating the partnership and cooperation agreement of 1997 , which encompassed political , commercial and cultural projects .

but russia 's foreign minister was not striking a conciliatory tone on the issue .
" security in south ossetia and abkhazia is assured by russian military contingents after the recognition of their independence by russia , " lavrov said at the press conference with kouchner .
he added that russia felt itself to be in line with the french-brokered ceasefire agreement in so far as it was allowing observers into areas bordering on south ossetia and abkhazia .
moscow has recognized the independence of the two regions , which have ethnic russian majorities , while the eu insisted that they are part of georgia .

" several influential politicians are counting on germany to persuade sarkozy to back off and agree emergency regulations for the euro zone instead , " newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung said in an editorial .
the paper added that sarkozy 's euro zone " economic government " was yet another move that would bypass existing eu institutions . citing diplomatic sources , business daily financial times deutschland said leaders including italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , spain 's jose luis zapatero and european commission cheif jose manuel barroso tended to avoid confronting sarkozy themselves . " they prefer to seek out the -lrb- german -rrb- chancellor and ask her to talk sarkozy out of one or two of his ideas , " it said . german news weekly der spiegel said germany viewed france 's proposal for an " economic government " as part of a struggle over which model should dominate in europe - the social market economy or the state-controlled economy . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the global financial crisis that has battered iceland was one of the main topics at the meeting of the nordic council organization that groups denmark , finland , iceland , norway and sweden as well as three self-ruling territories including greenland .
haarde said many of iceland 's 320,000 inhabitants will be hit by the crisis that has seen the collapse of its three largest commercial banks .
it will be " painful , " he said , stating that some will lose their jobs , others will lose their savings , and that the crisis will set iceland back some five years .
on friday , reykjavik and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- signed a deal for a 2.1-billion-dollar emergency loan from the imf to help stabilize iceland 's economy .
the deal with the imf , that needs approval by the imf board , was the first by a western country since the mid-1970s when britain signed a similar deal .
however , it is estimated that iceland needs an additional 4 billion dollars in loans although haarde did not specify the sum monday .
haarde said a possible deal with the nordics would not rule out a possible deal with russia , referring to recent talks held in moscow .
the central banks of denmark , norway and sweden in may signed a swap facility arrangement with the icelandic central bank which recently drew 400 million euros -lrb- 543 million dollars -rrb- from denmark and norway .
the financial unrest has fuelled support in iceland for joining the european union , according to a poll commissioned by the frettabladid newspaper .
the weekend poll of some 800 people suggested more than two in three supported an eu application , up from one in two in february .
haarde , whose independence party has opposed joining the bloc , said discussions about membership would have to await the resolution of the crisis . dpa news agency -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

car parts suppliers will also be hit by the financial crisis , an expert told dw . less than a week after cutting its earnings forecast again , the giant german automaker daimler flagged plans monday , oct .
27 , to shut down work for about four weeks over christmas at key plants , including one producing its flagship luxury mercedes-benz cars . what was needed now daimler chief dieter zetsche told company employees was " the right mix of fighting spirit and perseverance . " the deepening economic gloom resulted in european car sales slumping sharply to 8.2 percent in september , the brussels-based european automobile manufacturers ' association -lrb- acea -rrb- said this month . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers are n't looking of a car fresh off the assembly line " the drop in registrations confirms the aggravating market circumstances , as the fall-out of the financial crisis hits auto manufacturers hard , " acea said , adding that registrations had hit their lowest level since september 1998 . the new drop in new european car registrations was unusual , acea said , as auto sales normally pick up after the slower summer months . " the credit crunch weighs on the sector 's ability to finance daily operations , " the acea said .
" customers are increasingly hesitant to make large expenditures and find it more difficult to get their purchase financed . " declines in demand for new cars pushed daimler to shut down production could result in about 150,000 workers having an extended christmas break . this came in the wake of a slew of european carmakers such as general motors ' owned european opel unit saying they were cutting production with the financial crisis hitting the car industry just as it battles to recover from high fuel costs and environmental worries . bmw , the world 's leading premium auto group , said over the weekend it was also leaving plants idle as the looming recession meant car buyers were shying away from showrooms . industry braces for downbeat results the steady stream of grim news out of the european car business came as the industry prepares itself for a further round of downbeat company reports as the auto sector 's third-quarter reporting season gains momentum . while munich-based bmw is expected to report a fall in profits and revenue , europe 's biggest auto manufacturer , volkswagen , is predicted to post a modest rise in earnings on thursday on the back of a solid performance of its core vw brand . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw continues to do okay but its subsidiaries suffer vw said last week that world-wide deliveries increased 3.9 percent to 4.8 million vehicles in the first nine months of the year , as strong demand from leading emerging economies helped to offset declines in other international markets . vw 's stock spiked 200 percent before settling to 520 euros at the close of electronic trading on monday , up 146 percent from friday . analysts said it was not luxury car-maker porsche that was paying the high price , but short sellers who had expected the stock to fall in value and suddenly needed to settle contracts . porsche revealed sunday it had advanced its stake from 35 to 42.6 percent of volkswagen group .
additionally , it had obtained options for an additional 31.5 percent of volkswagen . however , vw 's offshoots seat -lrb- spain -rrb- and skoda -lrb- czech republic -rrb- are being forced to cut production . knock-on effect hits car parts industry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fiat 's future may not be as bright and shiny as it thinks signs have also emerged that the bleak business mood among carmakers was starting to spill over into auto parts sector , with the leading auto accessory group bosch saying it was idling a key plant and sending 400 workers home .

chancellor merkel is leading efforts to stymie greater government control of money markets . as eu governments scramble to shore up their teetering banks and reassure jittery investors and citizens amid a worsening credit crisis and looming recession , fears are growing of a widening rift between europe 's largest economies , france and germany , over how to handle the financial crisis . french president nicolas sarkozy , who holds the rotating eu presidency , has called for an " economic government " for the 15-nation euro zone and urged eu countries to take stakes in strategic industries as the financial crisis bites .
the french president has also announced the creation of a sovereign wealth fund for france to protect key firms from hostile foreign takeovers . sarkozy is reportedly pushing his plans ahead of emergency talks on the global market turmoil in washington on nov .
15 between the world 's richest nations and largest emerging economies . french plans alarm germany the french plans have sparked alarm in germany .
berlin views the proposals as too interventionist and running foul of eu competition laws .
german leaders have long seen french calls for greater government control of financial markets as an attempt to undermine the independence of the european central bank . in addition , there are fears that coordinated action in the euro zone would put the 12 eu countries that do not use the common european currency at a disadvantage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos has been germany 's most vocal opponent to french plans german economy minister michael glos strongly resisted sarkozy 's latest proposals , saying they " go against the successful principles of our economic policy . " in a recent interview , glos said most economic policy , including national budgets , should be the responsibility of individual states .
the minister also ruled out a europe-wide stimulus package , pointing out that the economic situation in each european country is different . on tuesday , oct .
28 , germany 's guenther verheugen , vice-president of the eu commission , became the latest to criticize sarkozy 's plans for a partial nationalization of key industries . " the experiment ended disastrously in eastern europe , " verheugen told german daily passauer neuen presse .
he added that the french plan fundamentally contradicted the " european idea of free entrepreneurship . " all eyes on merkel germany is n't the only country uneasy of french plans to handle the crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus was critical of sarkozy 's financial plans speaking in a television debate , czech president vaclav klaus addressed speculation that france might try to extend its current eu presidency and not allow the czechs to take over in 2009 as planned . " i believe that if this government is in charge of the presidency -lrb- ... -rrb- it will have a more rational opinion on the financial crisis than most other european countries , " said klaus who had called sarkozy 's steps in the crisis " old socialism " earlier this week . in recent days , german media have also reported that germany 's neighbors are looking to chancellor angela merkel to rein sarkozy in .

workers who make the axles and transmissions that go into the luxury sedans and sporty convertibles are also worried about their jobs . just weeks after german carmakers warned that they would temporarily halt production due to falling demand , companies such as bosch and continental have begun planning similar moves . continental said it plans to have shut downs around christmas at its plant in regensburg that will mean a loss of income for about 1,500 employees .
bosch said it was idling a key plant and sending 400 workers home . germany 's venerable zf , which specializes in driveline and chassis technology , said it was doing everything possible to protect permanent staff during the slowdown , including stopping all overtime , abolishing flex time and planning temporary closures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both bmw and mercedes will temporarily halt production unless the government steps in , up to 20 percent of auto suppliers will go bankrupt in the next two years , endangering 50,000 jobs , ferdinand dudenhoeffer , director of the center of automotive research -lrb- car -rrb- in gelsenkirchen , told the bild newspaper on tuesday , oct .

" when the auto industry coughs , engineers , artisans and retailers all get pneumonia , " hickel said . he criticized the approach of the car industry to the difficult economic times , criticizing their decision to lay off workers and stop production at the first sign of economic distress , which he said sets a bad precedent . carmakers look for bailout carmakers have said that they , like ailing german banks , should get a bailout . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will tax breaks make people want to buy new cars ?

the proposed tax breaks will be part of a package aimed at strengthen the economy during the current financial crisis , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- minister said . the industry needs " our backing and very concrete help to stimulate the demand for new cars , " european union industry commissioner guenter verheugen said . if demand continues to lag , it will lead to a massive reduction in jobs in the european auto industry and beyond , verheugen told hannover 's neuen presse .
unless the situation changes quickly , " massive job reductions will be unavoidable , " he said . while germany has not yet agreed to any specific bailout measures , the united states is reportedly considering making around $ 10 billion available to general motors so that it can merge with chrysler . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but that does not mean moscow and the bloc have settled their differences over the caucasus . french foreign minister bernard kouchner announced the resumption of talks on a new partnership and cooperation agreement after a meeting with his russian counterpart sergei lavrov in st. petersburg .
those talks had been put on hold , after russia launched military action against georgia 's attempt to retake control of the breakaway provinces of south ossetia and abkhazia in late summer .
" i want to underline the eu-russian partnership talks were never suspended , they were simply delayed , " kouchner told journalists after his talks with lavrov .
kouchner added that negotiations would resume at an eu-russia summit on november 14 .
but france , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , must first get the go-ahead of all eu foreign ministers , when they meet on novermber 10 .
the new agreement is aimed at updating the partnership and cooperation agreement of 1997 , which encompassed political , commercial and cultural projects .
georgia still on their minds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian troops have withdrawn from georgia proper , but not from the breakaway regions critics of russia 's military operations against georgia had objected that moscow had not done enough to merit a resumption of the talks .
in particular , they criticized moscow for not allowing eu monitors access to the two disputed regions .
but russia 's foreign minister was not striking a conciliatory tone on the issue .
" security in south ossetia and abkhazia is assured by russian military contingents after the recognition of their independence by russia , " lavrov said at the press conference with kouchner .
he added that russia felt itself to be in line with the french-brokered ceasefire agreement in so far as it was allowing observers into areas bordering on south ossetia and abkhazia .
moscow has recognized the independence of the two regions , which have ethnic russian majorities , while the eu insisted that they are part of georgia .
kouchner said the eu would seek moscow 's cooperation with an international commission that will investigate how the conflict in the caucasus escalated .

but that does not mean moscow and the bloc have settled their differences over the caucasus . french foreign minister bernard kouchner announced the resumption of talks on a new partnership and cooperation agreement after a meeting with his russian counterpart sergei lavrov in st. petersburg .
those talks had been put on hold , after russia launched military action against georgia 's attempt to retake control of the breakaway provinces of south ossetia and abkhazia in late summer .
" i want to underline the eu-russian partnership talks were never suspended , they were simply delayed , " kouchner told journalists after his talks with lavrov .
kouchner added that negotiations would resume at an eu-russia summit on november 14 .
but france , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , must first get the go-ahead of all eu foreign ministers , when they meet on novermber 10 .
the new agreement is aimed at updating the partnership and cooperation agreement of 1997 , which encompassed political , commercial and cultural projects .
georgia still on their minds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian troops have withdrawn from georgia proper , but not from the breakaway regions critics of russia 's military operations against georgia had objected that moscow had not done enough to merit a resumption of the talks .
in particular , they criticized moscow for not allowing eu monitors access to the two disputed regions .
but russia 's foreign minister was not striking a conciliatory tone on the issue .
" security in south ossetia and abkhazia is assured by russian military contingents after the recognition of their independence by russia , " lavrov said at the press conference with kouchner .
he added that russia felt itself to be in line with the french-brokered ceasefire agreement in so far as it was allowing observers into areas bordering on south ossetia and abkhazia .
moscow has recognized the independence of the two regions , which have ethnic russian majorities , while the eu insisted that they are part of georgia .
kouchner said the eu would seek moscow 's cooperation with an international commission that will investigate how the conflict in the caucasus escalated .

share values have been skyrocketing as porsche prepares to take over the company . the increases briefly made vw the world 's biggest company by market value with 296.06 billion euros -lrb- $ 370.4 billion -rrb- based on ordinary stock .
exxon mobil has about $ 343 billion in value , at monday 's closing price .
vw shares then eased back from the peak to 652 euros in midday trading on tuesday . vw 's tuesday spike followed big gains on monday that at one point reached 200 percent .
the carmaker 's gigantic gains put the entire dax index of leading german companies in positive territory , even though most other firms had posted losses on tuesday . only a small portion of vw shares are traded freely on the stock exchanges .
the government of lower saxony holds a 20 percent stake and porsche has recently gone on a buying spree . on sunday , porsche announced it directly owns 42.6 percent of vw stock and has options on another 31.5 percent .
that leaves less than 10 percent of shares free-floating , which exacerbates volatility in the share price , traders told the afp news agency . porsche poised for takeover bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw was quite the shiny number on the german stock exchange on tuesday porsche said it aims to increase its direct equity stake to over 50 percent by the end of 2008 .
the luxury carmaker had previously said it had a 35 percent stake .
if it secures more than 75 percent , porsche would gain full financial control and access to vw 's cash flow . investors had targeted vw shares for short selling , which is essentially a bet that a share 's price will fall , then found themselves obliged to buy shares on the open market to cover those they had borrowed initially when the stock rose . german regulator bafin was investigating the vw share movement to see if any insider trading or market manipulation had taken place , according to a report from reuters news agency . " each and any short seller in the world is trying to close up their position and there is no way they can do it except for trying to buy like mad , " frankfurtfinanz analyst heino ruland told reuters .
" someone is selling it at a rather interesting and rich price - it is about 10 times as much as it should trade . " dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

former national keeper timo hildebrand may be on his way out at valencia .
the question now : where 's he going next ? valencia thought they had landed a major coup in july 2007 , when they signed timo hildebrand , who was coming off a spirited world cup campaign as a substitute in the german national team and a league title with stuttgart as the teams number 1 .
but just 18 months later , the spanish newspaper marca has reported that valencia 's bosses are so eager to get rid of hildebrand that they would consider letting him go on a free transfer during the winter break .
the reason is mounting tension between the 29-year-old keeper and valencia coach unai emry . " the goalkeeper is no longer satisfied with his role at valencia , and the coaching staff is unhappy with the german 's attitude in training , " reported the internet edition of the spanish newspaper las provincias .
if hildebrand is history in spain , he 'll likely head back to germany .
and be asking fimself , what went wrong ?
from bundesliga to bench bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hildebrand and loew are no longer making ads together hildebrand is a victim of a bad valencia season and a coaching change .
the german gradually fought his way in valencia 's starting line-up last season , but the club spent a good portion of its time fighting relegation .
they eventually finished tenth - an unacceptable result for a team whose fans expected them to qualify for the champions league .
valaencia and hildebrand did win the king 's cup , but that was n't enough to save then-coach ronald koeman 's job .
nor was it sufficient to convince german national coach joachim loew to include hildebrand in his euro 2008 squad .
in the off-season , emry insisted the club bring in brazilian keeper renan , who became the team 's new number 1 .
valencia currently tops the spanish first division .
meanwhile , hildebrand was n't even nominated for valencia 's most recent cup match - an affront to a keeper once tipped to be in line for the top job in the german national side .
which way will he go ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could hildebrand replace former national teammate lehmann at stuttgart ?
hildebrand 's dream-turned-nightmare stint in spain has probably made him less attractive to clubs around europe , but he is positively remembered in germany .
so he could be headed home .
the big question is where .
three names keep cropping up on the rumor mill - dortmund , hoffenheim and stuttgart .
dortmund was linked with hildebrand at the start of the season amidst concerns about keeper roman weidenfeller 's fitness .
but bringing the former in now would create potentially divisive competition .
hoffenheim would no doubt have been eager to sign up hildebrand in july , just as the keeper probably would n't object to joining the surprise club of the season now .
but would hoffenheim , which was on top of the table after 9 rounds , really want to shake up its successful formula ?
finally , stuttgart would make sense since hildebrand has already had success there , and current keeper jens lehmann is rapidly approaching his 40s .
but while it might be an option for next season , it 's hard to see stuttgart replacing the high-profile lehmann in february .
and hildebrand is , no doubt , anxious to get a game as soon as possible and start recovering from what 's proven a fairly disastrous foreign adventure . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could hildebrand replace former national teammate lehmann at stuttgart ?
hildebrand 's dream-turned-nightmare stint in spain has probably made him less attractive to clubs around europe , but he is positively remembered in germany .
so he could be headed home .
the big question is where .
three names keep cropping up on the rumor mill - dortmund , hoffenheim and stuttgart .
dortmund was linked with hildebrand at the start of the season amidst concerns about keeper roman weidenfeller 's fitness .
but bringing the former in now would create potentially divisive competition .
hoffenheim would no doubt have been eager to sign up hildebrand in july , just as the keeper probably would n't object to joining the surprise club of the season now .
but would hoffenheim , which was on top of the table after 9 rounds , really want to shake up its successful formula ?
finally , stuttgart would make sense since hildebrand has already had success there , and current keeper jens lehmann is rapidly approaching his 40s .
but while it might be an option for next season , it 's hard to see stuttgart replacing the high-profile lehmann in february .
and hildebrand is , no doubt , anxious to get a game as soon as possible and start recovering from what 's proven a fairly disastrous foreign adventure . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

karadzic complained he had been unable to prepare himself due to the fact he had received the serb translation of the indictment against him only on monday .
" i did not even have time to study it , " karadzic told the court .
chaotic day in court the revised indictment , the english version of which was released on september 22 , showed that the prosecution had reduced the number of charges from 41 to 27 , in a bid to speed up the trial .
at the hearing , scottish judge bonomy said he was " extremely disappointed " about the slow speed of the trial preparations .
he said there had been little progress in the preparations since the former serb leader 's arrest in july .
emotions reached a boiling point when prosecutor alan tieger could not inform the court how many pages of the prosecution 's evidence had not yet been transferred to karadzic in the serb language .
bonomy , visibly annoyed , temporarily adjourned the hearing and left the court room .
upon his return in the trial chamber , tieger told the court a total of 60 pages of evidence had not yet been given to karadzic in serb translation .
karadzic also complained he had insufficient resources to prepare his defence .
the former serb leader is defending himself but has one legal adviser , american attorney peter robinson , appointed by the tribunal earlier this month .
karadzic faces charges of war crimes , crimes against humanity and genocide .
he was arrested in serbia in july after being on the run for more than 12 years .
karadzic has appeared before the court in pre-trial hearings .
the trial proper is not expected to start for several more months . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as the us presidential election enters its final week , the vast majority of the world is rooting for barack obama .
but analysts say that high global expectations of the democrat will lead to disappointment , if he wins . on monday , barack obama picked up another big endorsement , this time from the daily financial times in london - a conservative-leaning newspaper usually sceptical of democrats .
the ft 's support is a measure of how much europeans would prefer obama over his republican rival john mccain in the white house .
yet the wording of the paper 's endorsement also hints that , whatever the election outcome , everything will not be hunky-dory .
" rest assured that , should he win , mr obama is bound to disappoint , " wrote the ft .
" he is expected to heal the country 's racial divisions , reverse the trend of rising inequality , improve middle-class living standards , cut almost everybody 's taxes , transform the image of the united states abroad , end the losses in iraq , deal with the mess in afghanistan and much more besides . "
pools show anywhere from 60 to 80 percent of continental europeans support obama 's bid for the oval office - compared to single-digit figures for mccain .
in many parts of the media , obama has acquired a quasi-messianic aura .

as the us presidential election enters its final week , the vast majority of the world is rooting for barack obama .
but analysts say that high global expectations of the democrat will lead to disappointment , if he wins . on monday , barack obama picked up another big endorsement , this time from the daily financial times in london - a conservative-leaning newspaper usually sceptical of democrats .
the ft 's support is a measure of how much europeans would prefer obama over his republican rival john mccain in the white house .
yet the wording of the paper 's endorsement also hints that , whatever the election outcome , everything will not be hunky-dory .
" rest assured that , should he win , mr obama is bound to disappoint , " wrote the ft .
" he is expected to heal the country 's racial divisions , reverse the trend of rising inequality , improve middle-class living standards , cut almost everybody 's taxes , transform the image of the united states abroad , end the losses in iraq , deal with the mess in afghanistan and much more besides . "
pools show anywhere from 60 to 80 percent of continental europeans support obama 's bid for the oval office - compared to single-digit figures for mccain .
in many parts of the media , obama has acquired a quasi-messianic aura .
but experts say european would inevitably be let down by aspects of an obama presidency .
change in style only ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama style is different ; his policies are n't necessarily disappointments would likely result , in part , from political constraints . james goldgeier of the council of the council on foreign relations uses the example of russia to illustrate .
" no president of the united states can tell the russians : yes , you can just do whatever you want in georgia , " goldgeier told the afp .
and political expediency is n't the only potential source of disappointment .
europeans tend to see obama as the candidate of peace , the leader most likely to end the iraq war .
but they often overlook hints from the democrat that he wants to bring military pressure to bear on afghanistan and pakistan - a shift with major implications for europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans could be asked to do more , militarily , on the afghan-pakastani border " barack obama and joe biden will expect allies to commit more resources to this common mission and to remove some of the limits on what their troops in country can do , " obama 's compaign has stated on the candidate 's website .

hope for european minorities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hype was huge when obama visited europe this summer an obama presidency would represent a landmark change in race relations in the us - a fact not lost of europeans from minority ethnic backgrounds .
christiana taubira , a french member of parliament from french guyana who ran for her counrtry 's presidency in 2002 , hopes what an obama win could inspire a similar sea change in europe .
" i think very sincerely , given my own experience in 2002 , that french society is ready to enjoy the beautiful adventure that obama has offered americans , " taubira told afp .
but others say the far more institutionalized role of european political parties , in which potential candidates have to work their way up the pecking order , would restrict the chances of a relative outsider like obama .

27 , leading to calls for help to the country 's nordic neighbors . " we are going to get through this crisis and move on , " prime minister geir haarde told reporters before a meeting of nordic prime ministers in finland .
haarde said he hoped the cash-strapped north atlantic nation will be able to get loans from its nordic neighbours .
the global financial crisis that has battered iceland was one of the main topics at the meeting of the nordic council organization that groups denmark , finland , iceland , norway and sweden as well as three self-ruling territories including greenland .
haarde said many of iceland 's 320,000 inhabitants will be hit by the crisis that has seen the collapse of its three largest commercial banks .
it will be " painful , " he said , stating that some will lose their jobs , others will lose their savings , and that the crisis will set iceland back some five years .
on friday , reykjavik and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- signed a deal for a 2.1-billion-dollar emergency loan from the imf to help stabilize iceland 's economy .
the deal with the imf , that needs approval by the imf board , was the first by a western country since the mid-1970s when britain signed a similar deal .
however , it is estimated that iceland needs an additional 4 billion dollars in loans although haarde did not specify the sum monday .
haarde said a possible deal with the nordics would not rule out a possible deal with russia , referring to recent talks held in moscow .
the central banks of denmark , norway and sweden in may signed a swap facility arrangement with the icelandic central bank which recently drew 400 million euros -lrb- 543 million dollars -rrb- from denmark and norway .
the financial unrest has fuelled support in iceland for joining the european union , according to a poll commissioned by the frettabladid newspaper .
the weekend poll of some 800 people suggested more than two in three supported an eu application , up from one in two in february .

users could increasingly find they are ingesting a number of other chemicals added to bulk it out , including a banned painkiller which could cause cancer .
in a quiet laboratory in central london , plastic polybags containing seized powder are handed to a scientist .
karbinder - known to his workmates as " k " - is testing to see if the substance inside the wraps is cocaine , and if so , how pure it is .
many of the one-gram wraps are folded into cut-up lottery tickets , as has become a bizarre custom among dealers .
k takes a small amount from each wrap , puts it into an individual plastic tester and loads it into a mass spectrum analyser .
this will confirm that the substance is cocaine ; further tests will establish how pure it is and what other chemicals might be in the mix .
' downmarket ' at its laboratories in lambeth , the forensic science service tests much of the cocaine seized by officers from the serious organised crime agency -lrb- soca -rrb- and the police .
drug dealers are cutting cocaine with other , often quite dangerous chemicals to make it go further rob wainwright , soca in recent years , the testing has shown up an interesting trend .
cocaine has moved downmarket .
more and more people - especially teenagers and students - are buying cocaine and they want it cheap .
prices as low as £ 25 for a wrap are not uncommon - and at this bargain basement price , what the buyer often gets is a bargain basement product .
" five years ago , most of the street cocaine we seized had a purity of around 50 % , " explains rob wainwright , international director of soca .
" but we 're now finding a lot that is of far lower quality - some barely 10 % pure .
the danger is that drug dealers are cutting cocaine with other , often quite dangerous , chemicals to make it go further . "
much of the seized cocaine is found to have been cut with phenacetin - a pharmaceutical drug banned some years ago in britain and most other nations for causing kidney failure and cancer .
other drugs used for cutting or " bashing " cocaine include lignocaine -lrb- a dental painkiller -rrb- , tetramisole -lrb- used for de-worming pets -rrb- and boric acid -lrb- used to kill cockroaches -rrb- .
' especially serious ' dr alun morinan , from the national addiction centre & hope uk , a christian drug education charity , says that young people using cocaine will not realise what they are taking .
" cocaine is bad for you anyway - it can cause heart problems among other things - but the phenacetin is a drug that was banned here many years ago because it was found to be linked to kidney failure and renal cancer .
it 's impossible for someone buying a wrap of cocaine on the street to tell what it 's been cut with dean ames forensic science service " and of course , the kidneys are the part of the body that filters out any impurities in our bodies , so for a drug user impaired kidney function is especially serious . "
back in the laboratory , the testing continues using highly expensive and sophisticated equipment .
dean ames , lead drug scientist at the forensic science service , says that it 's impossible to tell the purity of the drugs using the naked eye .
" the cocaine is a white powder and the drugs it 's being mixed with are also white powder .
" it 's impossible for someone buying a wrap of cocaine on the street to tell , just from looking at it , what it 's been cut with . "

many of the one-gram wraps are folded into cut-up lottery tickets , as has become a bizarre custom among dealers .
k takes a small amount from each wrap , puts it into an individual plastic tester and loads it into a mass spectrum analyser .
this will confirm that the substance is cocaine ; further tests will establish how pure it is and what other chemicals might be in the mix .
' downmarket ' at its laboratories in lambeth , the forensic science service tests much of the cocaine seized by officers from the serious organised crime agency -lrb- soca -rrb- and the police .
drug dealers are cutting cocaine with other , often quite dangerous chemicals to make it go further rob wainwright , soca in recent years , the testing has shown up an interesting trend .
cocaine has moved downmarket .
more and more people - especially teenagers and students - are buying cocaine and they want it cheap .
prices as low as £ 25 for a wrap are not uncommon - and at this bargain basement price , what the buyer often gets is a bargain basement product .
" five years ago , most of the street cocaine we seized had a purity of around 50 % , " explains rob wainwright , international director of soca .
" but we 're now finding a lot that is of far lower quality - some barely 10 % pure .
the danger is that drug dealers are cutting cocaine with other , often quite dangerous , chemicals to make it go further . "
much of the seized cocaine is found to have been cut with phenacetin - a pharmaceutical drug banned some years ago in britain and most other nations for causing kidney failure and cancer .
other drugs used for cutting or " bashing " cocaine include lignocaine -lrb- a dental painkiller -rrb- , tetramisole -lrb- used for de-worming pets -rrb- and boric acid -lrb- used to kill cockroaches -rrb- .
' especially serious ' dr alun morinan , from the national addiction centre & hope uk , a christian drug education charity , says that young people using cocaine will not realise what they are taking .
" cocaine is bad for you anyway - it can cause heart problems among other things - but the phenacetin is a drug that was banned here many years ago because it was found to be linked to kidney failure and renal cancer .
it 's impossible for someone buying a wrap of cocaine on the street to tell what it 's been cut with dean ames forensic science service " and of course , the kidneys are the part of the body that filters out any impurities in our bodies , so for a drug user impaired kidney function is especially serious . "
back in the laboratory , the testing continues using highly expensive and sophisticated equipment .
dean ames , lead drug scientist at the forensic science service , says that it 's impossible to tell the purity of the drugs using the naked eye .
" the cocaine is a white powder and the drugs it 's being mixed with are also white powder .
" it 's impossible for someone buying a wrap of cocaine on the street to tell , just from looking at it , what it 's been cut with . "

users could increasingly find they are ingesting a number of other chemicals added to bulk it out , including a banned painkiller which could cause cancer .
in a quiet laboratory in central london , plastic polybags containing seized powder are handed to a scientist .
karbinder - known to his workmates as " k " - is testing to see if the substance inside the wraps is cocaine , and if so , how pure it is .
many of the one-gram wraps are folded into cut-up lottery tickets , as has become a bizarre custom among dealers .
k takes a small amount from each wrap , puts it into an individual plastic tester and loads it into a mass spectrum analyser .
this will confirm that the substance is cocaine ; further tests will establish how pure it is and what other chemicals might be in the mix .
' downmarket ' at its laboratories in lambeth , the forensic science service tests much of the cocaine seized by officers from the serious organised crime agency -lrb- soca -rrb- and the police .
drug dealers are cutting cocaine with other , often quite dangerous chemicals to make it go further rob wainwright , soca in recent years , the testing has shown up an interesting trend .
cocaine has moved downmarket .
more and more people - especially teenagers and students - are buying cocaine and they want it cheap .
prices as low as £ 25 for a wrap are not uncommon - and at this bargain basement price , what the buyer often gets is a bargain basement product .
" five years ago , most of the street cocaine we seized had a purity of around 50 % , " explains rob wainwright , international director of soca .
" but we 're now finding a lot that is of far lower quality - some barely 10 % pure .
the danger is that drug dealers are cutting cocaine with other , often quite dangerous , chemicals to make it go further . "
much of the seized cocaine is found to have been cut with phenacetin - a pharmaceutical drug banned some years ago in britain and most other nations for causing kidney failure and cancer .
other drugs used for cutting or " bashing " cocaine include lignocaine -lrb- a dental painkiller -rrb- , tetramisole -lrb- used for de-worming pets -rrb- and boric acid -lrb- used to kill cockroaches -rrb- .
' especially serious ' dr alun morinan , from the national addiction centre & hope uk , a christian drug education charity , says that young people using cocaine will not realise what they are taking .
" cocaine is bad for you anyway - it can cause heart problems among other things - but the phenacetin is a drug that was banned here many years ago because it was found to be linked to kidney failure and renal cancer .
it 's impossible for someone buying a wrap of cocaine on the street to tell what it 's been cut with dean ames forensic science service " and of course , the kidneys are the part of the body that filters out any impurities in our bodies , so for a drug user impaired kidney function is especially serious . "
back in the laboratory , the testing continues using highly expensive and sophisticated equipment .
dean ames , lead drug scientist at the forensic science service , says that it 's impossible to tell the purity of the drugs using the naked eye .
" the cocaine is a white powder and the drugs it 's being mixed with are also white powder .
" it 's impossible for someone buying a wrap of cocaine on the street to tell , just from looking at it , what it 's been cut with . "

the four-year settlement would improve job security and limit outsourcing .
some 27,000 boeing workers walked off the job on 6 september in protest over pay , outsourcing and other issues .
analysts says the strike has been costing the airline manufacturer $ 100m a day , as delivery of finished planes dropped by more than 40 % .
the two parties reached the agreement late on monday , at the end of five days of talks in washington dc .
the international association of machinists and aerospace workers -lrb- iam -rrb- would not confirm full details of the agreement , but president tom buffenbarger said it " addressed all the major concerns " of union members .
the agreement is believed to address the major issues of outsourcing , including access to the shop floor for subcontractors and procedures for the union to bid for work before it is outsourced .
iam said the deal had their unanimous endorsement and would be put to a vote in three to five days .
" the members make that final decision , but i 'm hopeful , " said mr buffenbarger .
' difficult task ' boeing has had a difficult six months .
the global economic crisis , fluctuating oil prices and concerns about the financial viability of several airlines have all led to its share price plummeting 41 % over the period .
however , the company has said that it can cope , even if strike action were to last longer .
the president of boeing commercial airlines , scott e carson , said the proposed deal would reward employees for their contributions to the company 's success , while also preserving boeing 's competitive ability .
meanwhile , the brokers of the talks praised both parties for their commitment to the mediation process .
" both sides showed professionalism and a willingness to roll up their sleeves and to stick with the difficult task in front of them , " said the director of the us federal mediation and conciliation service , arthur rosenfeld .

advertisement karen partridge , from bristol , developed pre-eclampsia twice a blood test that screens pregnant woman for pre-eclampsia long before symptoms develop could be available in the next five years , doctors predict .
the condition , which leads to the deaths of 1,000 babies each year in the uk alone , could be detected as early as the first trimester , a study suggests .
a predictive test could save many lives by enabling closer monitoring of high-risk pregnancies , experts say .
routine urine and blood pressure checks can pick it up only after 20 weeks .
these researchers have made a vital finding that , if confirmed by other studies , has the potential to translate into a simple test that could potentially save many lives prof jeremy pearson british heart foundation the condition is managed for as long as possible with aspirin and extra monitoring , but delivery is the only cure .
dr victoria bills , lead researcher on the study , published in clinical science journal , said the discovery of a protein in the blood that appears to be linked with pre-eclampsia may be used to predict the condition early on in pregnancy .
" i would certainly hope that within my lifetime as an obstetrician - potentially in the next five to ten years - that possibly we may be able to develop a simple blood test which we can offer to women as early as 12 weeks in order to quantify whether they are at high-risk of developing pre-eclampsia later on in that pregnancy , " she told the bbc .
she said the substance , which goes by the full name vegf165b , might give a clue to the cause of pre-eclampsia , and possibly eventually a way to prevent it .

dr victoria bills talks about her research " if a test is available for the condition , i think people will want to know , because even though we do n't have a cure for it , research shows that if we give women low-dose aspirin , it lowers their risk , " dr bills explained .
commenting on the study of 70 patients , donald peebles , consultant in obstetrics at university college hospital , london , said it was part of a massive effort by researchers worldwide to predict poor pregnancy outcome , particularly pre-eclampsia and premature labour .
he said the research needed to be carried out on bigger numbers of patients and compared with other proteins that might also indicate early signs of pre-eclampsia .
" this is a very useful part of the development of a screening test for the prediction of pre-eclampsia , " he said .
a screening test will probably be available in the next five years , he added .
pre-eclampsia affects women in the later stages of pregnancy symptoms include high blood pressure , protein in urine , swelling and , in severe cases , liver problems and seizures can also affect the unborn baby , causing growth impairment in the womb and the need for premature delivery developing a predictive test for pre-eclampsia is regarded by some experts as a " holy grail " in medicine .
professor jeremy pearson , associate medical director at the british heart foundation , which funded the research , said : " these researchers have made a vital finding that , if confirmed by other studies , has the potential to translate into a simple test that could potentially save many lives . "
the work was carried out at st michael 's hospital , bristol , and the university of bristol .
the team measured levels of the chemical in pregnant women at 12 weeks and then at intervals throughout gestation .
they found that in normal pregnancies there was a large increase in the protein by the end of the first trimester , but in women who went on to develop pre-eclampsia it barely increased at all .

advertisement karen partridge , from bristol , developed pre-eclampsia twice a blood test that screens pregnant woman for pre-eclampsia long before symptoms develop could be available in the next five years , doctors predict .
the condition , which leads to the deaths of 1,000 babies each year in the uk alone , could be detected as early as the first trimester , a study suggests .
a predictive test could save many lives by enabling closer monitoring of high-risk pregnancies , experts say .
routine urine and blood pressure checks can pick it up only after 20 weeks .
these researchers have made a vital finding that , if confirmed by other studies , has the potential to translate into a simple test that could potentially save many lives prof jeremy pearson british heart foundation the condition is managed for as long as possible with aspirin and extra monitoring , but delivery is the only cure .
dr victoria bills , lead researcher on the study , published in clinical science journal , said the discovery of a protein in the blood that appears to be linked with pre-eclampsia may be used to predict the condition early on in pregnancy .
" i would certainly hope that within my lifetime as an obstetrician - potentially in the next five to ten years - that possibly we may be able to develop a simple blood test which we can offer to women as early as 12 weeks in order to quantify whether they are at high-risk of developing pre-eclampsia later on in that pregnancy , " she told the bbc .
she said the substance , which goes by the full name vegf165b , might give a clue to the cause of pre-eclampsia , and possibly eventually a way to prevent it .

dr victoria bills talks about her research " if a test is available for the condition , i think people will want to know , because even though we do n't have a cure for it , research shows that if we give women low-dose aspirin , it lowers their risk , " dr bills explained .
commenting on the study of 70 patients , donald peebles , consultant in obstetrics at university college hospital , london , said it was part of a massive effort by researchers worldwide to predict poor pregnancy outcome , particularly pre-eclampsia and premature labour .
he said the research needed to be carried out on bigger numbers of patients and compared with other proteins that might also indicate early signs of pre-eclampsia .
" this is a very useful part of the development of a screening test for the prediction of pre-eclampsia , " he said .
a screening test will probably be available in the next five years , he added .
pre-eclampsia affects women in the later stages of pregnancy symptoms include high blood pressure , protein in urine , swelling and , in severe cases , liver problems and seizures can also affect the unborn baby , causing growth impairment in the womb and the need for premature delivery developing a predictive test for pre-eclampsia is regarded by some experts as a " holy grail " in medicine .
professor jeremy pearson , associate medical director at the british heart foundation , which funded the research , said : " these researchers have made a vital finding that , if confirmed by other studies , has the potential to translate into a simple test that could potentially save many lives . "
the work was carried out at st michael 's hospital , bristol , and the university of bristol .
the team measured levels of the chemical in pregnant women at 12 weeks and then at intervals throughout gestation .
they found that in normal pregnancies there was a large increase in the protein by the end of the first trimester , but in women who went on to develop pre-eclampsia it barely increased at all .

the one-day event will give five of the country 's leading alternative transport companies the chance to show off their goods to industry experts .
taking place at millbrook proving ground in befordshire the invitation-only event will attract more than 800 policy-makers and industry experts .
wales will have a high profile at the event with its own pavilion on show .
the country has become a leading centre for the development of alternative fuel technologies in recent years with the support of the welsh assembly government .
the nation 's five representatives at the uk national low carbon vehicle event will include : atraverda ltd - the abertillery-based company has developed a lighter ceramic material to replace the traditional heavier lead components in lead acid batteries making them lighter and greener .
connaught engineering - the llanelli-based company has developed the world 's only retrofit braking system which can save up to 25 % on fuel and co2 emissions through regenerative breaking .
the hydrogen bus - the world 's first tribrid minibus developed by glamorgan university which has been in operation for four months ferrying students between its treforest and glyn taf campuses .
the narrow car company - the abercynon firm 's metre-wide , tandem , two-seater naro car has the dynamics of a motorbike in a bid to change urban transport .
stevens vehicles - the port talbot company 's zero carbon emission electric powered cars and vans can travel for 50 miles for less than £ 1 .
each one is hoping that the event will help launch their products on the world market with delegates set to include vehicles manufacturers , specialist suppliers , technology companies and fleet operators .
managing director of stevens vehicles , peter stevens , is looking forward to the event and he has brought one of his vans along with him to show people what it can do .
" the event will give us the opportunity to drive people around which is going to be very good , " he said .
" we 've brought our first customer 's van up so people can see that our vehicle is out there and not just a concept vehicle . "
while atraverda 's chief technical officer , andrew loyns , hopes the event will give his company a chance to change the perception of his industry .
the hydrogen bus ferries students between campuses in pontypridd " what we 're trying to do is to change the perception of lead acid chemistry which is n't easy because people have the impression that it 's really dirty and old , " he explained .
" but old lead acid batteries are almost 100 % recyclable and we 're hoping the event will give us the opportunity to show people that although lead batteries are over 100 years old - we 're taking them to the next level with our new ceramic material . "
the assembly government 's international trade and investment arm , international business wales -lrb- ibw -rrb- is an event sponsor .
it will also be promoting the recently opened hydrogen research centre at baglan energy park alongside the welsh universities which are working on collaborative projects within the auto industry .
economy and transport minister ieuan wyn jones said : " ground-breaking work is under way in wales in the drive towards a lower carbon economy .
" we are making an important contribution towards the creation of a green automotive industry and have a number of highly innovative products either on the market or under development , including low or zero carbon emission vehicles .
" the development of new and innovative technologies and products will play an increasingly important role in the current economic climate . "

the condition , which leads to the deaths of 1,000 babies each year in the uk alone , could be detected as early as the first trimester , a study suggests .
a predictive test could save many lives by enabling closer monitoring of high-risk pregnancies , experts say .
routine urine and blood pressure checks can pick it up only after 20 weeks . "
these researchers have made a vital finding that , if confirmed by other studies , has the potential to translate into a simple test that could potentially save many lives " prof jeremy pearson british heart foundation the condition is managed for as long as possible with aspirin and extra monitoring , but delivery is the only cure .
dr victoria bills , lead researcher on the study , published in clinical science journal , said the discovery of a protein in the blood that appears to be linked with pre-eclampsia may be used to predict the condition early on in pregnancy .
" i would certainly hope that within my lifetime as an obstetrician - potentially in the next five to ten years - that possibly we may be able to develop a simple blood test which we can offer to women as early as 12 weeks in order to quantify whether they are at high-risk of developing pre-eclampsia later on in that pregnancy , " she told the bbc .
she said the substance , which goes by the full name vegf165b , might give a clue to the cause of pre-eclampsia , and possibly eventually a way to prevent it .
" if a test is available for the condition , i think people will want to know , because even though we do n't have a cure for it , research shows that if we give women low-dose aspirin , it lowers their risk , " dr bills explained .
commenting on the study of 70 patients , donald peebles , consultant in obstetrics at university college hospital , london , said it was part of a massive effort by researchers worldwide to predict poor pregnancy outcome , particularly pre-eclampsia and premature labour .
he said the research needed to be carried out on bigger numbers of patients and compared with other proteins that might also indicate early signs of pre-eclampsia .
" this is a very useful part of the development of a screening test for the prediction of pre-eclampsia , " he said .
a screening test will probably be available in the next five years , he added .
pre-eclampsia affects women in the later stages of pregnancy symptoms include high blood pressure , protein in urine , swelling and , in severe cases , liver problems and seizures can also affect the unborn baby , causing growth impairment in the womb and the need for premature delivery developing a predictive test for pre-eclampsia is regarded by some experts as a " holy grail " in medicine .
professor jeremy pearson , associate medical director at the british heart foundation , which funded the research , said : " these researchers have made a vital finding that , if confirmed by other studies , has the potential to translate into a simple test that could potentially save many lives . "
the work was carried out at st michael 's hospital , bristol , and the university of bristol .
the team measured levels of the chemical in pregnant women at 12 weeks and then at intervals throughout gestation .
they found that in normal pregnancies there was a large increase in the protein by the end of the first trimester , but in women who went on to develop pre-eclampsia it barely increased at all .

net profit came in at 123bn yen -lrb- $ 1.3bn ; £ 829m -rrb- for the three months from july to september .
japan 's second-biggest carmaker has cut its profit forecast for the full year to 485bn yen , down 19 % on last year .
honda is considered one of the better-placed carmakers to deal with the global downturn , thanks to its line-up of smaller , more fuel-efficient models .
but it is vulnerable to the strong yen , estimating that a fall of one yen in the dollar exchange rate cuts about 20bn yen from its operating profit .
the desire to consume is being hurt by the credit crisis koichi kondo , honda executive vice president the dollar has fallen by about 16 % against the yen since the start of the year .
the strong yen makes honda 's vehicles more expensive in the us , where its customers are already struggling with the economic downturn .
honda has predicted that its us sales in october will be more than 20 % below the level for the same month last year .
its executive vice president koichi kondo said the fall in sales was not just across its light trucks and suvs , which have been struggling as a result of higher petrol prices .

net profit came in at 123bn yen -lrb- $ 1.3bn ; £ 829m -rrb- for the three months from july to september .
japan 's second-biggest carmaker has cut its profit forecast for the full year to 485bn yen , down 19 % on last year .
honda is considered one of the better-placed carmakers to deal with the global downturn , thanks to its line-up of smaller , more fuel-efficient models .

the desire to consume is being hurt by the credit crisis koichi kondo , honda executive vice president the dollar has fallen by about 16 % against the yen since the start of the year .
the strong yen makes honda 's vehicles more expensive in the us , where its customers are already struggling with the economic downturn .
honda has predicted that its us sales in october will be more than 20 % below the level for the same month last year .
its executive vice president koichi kondo said the fall in sales was not just across its light trucks and suvs , which have been struggling as a result of higher petrol prices .

advertisement baroness thatcher is welcomed by fellow conservatives by brian wheeler political reporter , bbc news she may no longer make speeches , on doctor 's orders , but there is no keeping lady thatcher away from her public .
from the moment she clambered shakily from the back seat of a black jaguar , on to the forecourt of the grosvenor house hotel , london , this was going to be her night .
lady thatcher arriving at the bruges speech 20th anniversary dinner at 83 , and reportedly suffering from dementia , she makes few public appearances these days .
but this was a special occasion - the 20th anniversary dinner of the bruges group , which takes its name from a speech in which she first warned against the creation of a european " super state " .
she is still recognisable from her prime ministerial heyday .
the extraordinary sweep of back-combed hair is still there - as is the famous handbag - but she is clearly very frail .
she walks with tiny , deliberate steps , all her effort seemingly concentrated on getting from a to b. but she managed to summon up a hint of the old steel , as she paused at the hotel entrance for the photographers , shooting them a determined glare of the type that once reduced cabinet ministers - and brussels bureaucrats - to jelly .
and instead of being shepherded past the crowd of admirers in the bar on her way to the top table , she was thrust straight into the middle of them .
they could hardly believe their good fortune .
" how many times in your life , do you get to meet a legend ?
she will be remembered for hundreds of years , " said nikki sinclaire , a ukip euro election candidate .
" she is the reason i got involved in politics . "
' my heroine ' these are thatcher 's people - true believers who had paid upwards of £ 125 each for the opportunity to have dinner in her presence , including several current tory mps , the novelist frederick forsyth and the ukip leader nigel farage .
and for a good half hour she walked among them , steadily working the room as her minders battled to keep the pin-striped throng at bay .
how many times in your life , do you get to meet a legend ?
she will be remembered for hundreds of years nikki sinclaire , ukip euro election candidate at times , the crowd threatened to overwhelm her , as they held up their camera phones to film her progress and pushed forward with outstretched hands , always deferential , but eager for just a few seconds with the former prime minister .
" you are my heroine , " said one woman .
" you inspired me , " said another , reaching out to grasp her fragile hand , " we need more like you " .
ms sinclaire explained that she was standing for the uk independence party in the west midlands .
" good for you .
never give up , never give up , " lady thatcher told her .
then , unexpectedly , as she pushed further into the crowd , i found myself face-to-face with her .
dementia claims " it 's an honour to meet you , " i said , shaking her hand and , for reasons which now escape me , adding : " i come from the north east . "
she seemed delighted .
" thank you for coming down .
give them my warm regards , " she said .
i did not have time to explain that , on this occasion , i had only come down from north london , but it did not seem to matter .
she seemed much sharper than i had expected .
her daughter , carol , recently wrote about her battle with dementia and that on bad days " she can hardly remember the beginning of a sentence by the time she got to the end " .
there was little sign of that here .
" i think she gets a bad press about how bad her condition is .
she comes to visit us and talks to people for hours without any trouble and of course the pensioners love her , " said susan smith , of the chelsea pensioners ' appeal , one of lady thatcher 's charities .
vocal support she appeared to be flagging a little by the time dinner was over and the speeches were under way .
she was seated at the top table , next to her old comrade in arms lord tebbitt , who gave a speech calling for a referendum on britain 's relationship with the eu - and a move towards an alliance of sovereign states , of the kind first outlined by lady thatcher in her bruges speech .
it was typically red-blooded stuff , with much scorn poured on the " euro fanatics " in his own party and their " fellow travellers " in the civil service and the bbc , which went down a storm with the die-hard euro sceptics in the audience .
but the night belonged to lady thatcher .
the sense of betrayal many of her supporters felt 18 years ago at the way she was ejected from downing street is evidently still raw among members of the bruges group .
as she reached the end of her final procession through tables of applauding admirers , pausing at the top of the stairs for a farewell wave , a chant went up from the back of the room which summed up the night perfectly and - if she heard it - will have left her with a smile on her face .
" ten more years !
ten more years !
ten more years ! "

she was seated at the top table , next to her old comrade in arms lord tebbitt , who gave a speech calling for a referendum on britain 's relationship with the eu - and a move towards an alliance of sovereign states , of the kind first outlined by lady thatcher in her bruges speech .
it was typically red-blooded stuff , with much scorn poured on the " euro fanatics " in his own party and their " fellow travellers " in the civil service and the bbc , which went down a storm with the die-hard euro sceptics in the audience .
but the night belonged to lady thatcher .
the sense of betrayal many of her supporters felt 18 years ago at the way she was ejected from downing street is evidently still raw among members of the bruges group .

advertisement baroness thatcher is welcomed by fellow conservatives by brian wheeler political reporter , bbc news she may no longer make speeches , on doctor 's orders , but there is no keeping lady thatcher away from her public .
from the moment she clambered shakily from the back seat of a black jaguar , on to the forecourt of the grosvenor house hotel , london , this was going to be her night .
lady thatcher arriving at the bruges speech 20th anniversary dinner at 83 , and reportedly suffering from dementia , she makes few public appearances these days .
but this was a special occasion - the 20th anniversary dinner of the bruges group , which takes its name from a speech in which she first warned against the creation of a european " super state " .
she is still recognisable from her prime ministerial heyday .
the extraordinary sweep of back-combed hair is still there - as is the famous handbag - but she is clearly very frail .
she walks with tiny , deliberate steps , all her effort seemingly concentrated on getting from a to b. but she managed to summon up a hint of the old steel , as she paused at the hotel entrance for the photographers , shooting them a determined glare of the type that once reduced cabinet ministers - and brussels bureaucrats - to jelly .
and instead of being shepherded past the crowd of admirers in the bar on her way to the top table , she was thrust straight into the middle of them .
they could hardly believe their good fortune .
" how many times in your life , do you get to meet a legend ?
she will be remembered for hundreds of years , " said nikki sinclaire , a ukip euro election candidate .

she seemed delighted .
" thank you for coming down .
give them my warm regards , " she said .
i did not have time to explain that , on this occasion , i had only come down from north london , but it did not seem to matter .
she seemed much sharper than i had expected .

advertisement baroness thatcher is welcomed by fellow conservatives by brian wheeler political reporter , bbc news she may no longer make speeches , on doctor 's orders , but there is no keeping lady thatcher away from her public .
from the moment she clambered shakily from the back seat of a black jaguar , on to the forecourt of the grosvenor house hotel , london , this was going to be her night .
lady thatcher arriving at the bruges speech 20th anniversary dinner at 83 , and reportedly suffering from dementia , she makes few public appearances these days .
but this was a special occasion - the 20th anniversary dinner of the bruges group , which takes its name from a speech in which she first warned against the creation of a european " super state " .
she is still recognisable from her prime ministerial heyday .
the extraordinary sweep of back-combed hair is still there - as is the famous handbag - but she is clearly very frail .
she walks with tiny , deliberate steps , all her effort seemingly concentrated on getting from a to b. but she managed to summon up a hint of the old steel , as she paused at the hotel entrance for the photographers , shooting them a determined glare of the type that once reduced cabinet ministers - and brussels bureaucrats - to jelly .
and instead of being shepherded past the crowd of admirers in the bar on her way to the top table , she was thrust straight into the middle of them .
they could hardly believe their good fortune .
" how many times in your life , do you get to meet a legend ?
she will be remembered for hundreds of years , " said nikki sinclaire , a ukip euro election candidate .
" she is the reason i got involved in politics . "
' my heroine ' these are thatcher 's people - true believers who had paid upwards of £ 125 each for the opportunity to have dinner in her presence , including several current tory mps , the novelist frederick forsyth and the ukip leader nigel farage .
and for a good half hour she walked among them , steadily working the room as her minders battled to keep the pin-striped throng at bay .
how many times in your life , do you get to meet a legend ?
she will be remembered for hundreds of years nikki sinclaire , ukip euro election candidate at times , the crowd threatened to overwhelm her , as they held up their camera phones to film her progress and pushed forward with outstretched hands , always deferential , but eager for just a few seconds with the former prime minister .
" you are my heroine , " said one woman .
" you inspired me , " said another , reaching out to grasp her fragile hand , " we need more like you " .
ms sinclaire explained that she was standing for the uk independence party in the west midlands .
" good for you .
never give up , never give up , " lady thatcher told her .
then , unexpectedly , as she pushed further into the crowd , i found myself face-to-face with her .
dementia claims " it 's an honour to meet you , " i said , shaking her hand and , for reasons which now escape me , adding : " i come from the north east . "
she seemed delighted .
" thank you for coming down .
give them my warm regards , " she said .
i did not have time to explain that , on this occasion , i had only come down from north london , but it did not seem to matter .
she seemed much sharper than i had expected .
her daughter , carol , recently wrote about her battle with dementia and that on bad days " she can hardly remember the beginning of a sentence by the time she got to the end " .
there was little sign of that here .
" i think she gets a bad press about how bad her condition is .
she comes to visit us and talks to people for hours without any trouble and of course the pensioners love her , " said susan smith , of the chelsea pensioners ' appeal , one of lady thatcher 's charities .
vocal support she appeared to be flagging a little by the time dinner was over and the speeches were under way .
she was seated at the top table , next to her old comrade in arms lord tebbitt , who gave a speech calling for a referendum on britain 's relationship with the eu - and a move towards an alliance of sovereign states , of the kind first outlined by lady thatcher in her bruges speech .
it was typically red-blooded stuff , with much scorn poured on the " euro fanatics " in his own party and their " fellow travellers " in the civil service and the bbc , which went down a storm with the die-hard euro sceptics in the audience .
but the night belonged to lady thatcher .
the sense of betrayal many of her supporters felt 18 years ago at the way she was ejected from downing street is evidently still raw among members of the bruges group .
as she reached the end of her final procession through tables of applauding admirers , pausing at the top of the stairs for a farewell wave , a chant went up from the back of the room which summed up the night perfectly and - if she heard it - will have left her with a smile on her face .

advertisement daniel craig on james bond and the quantum of solace by tim masters entertainment reporter , bbc news daniel craig may be a man of many talents , but he also has the power of prophecy .
" i 'm going to get hurt , " he said at the press launch for quantum of solace in january - just after filming on his second outing as 007 had commenced .
and here 's craig nine months later with his right arm in a sling after a shoulder operation , having also severed his fingertip and had eight stitches in his face after being accidentally kicked by one of his co-stars .
the actor proffers his left arm for a solid - if slightly awkward - handshake and , despite all those injuries , is in an ebullient mood about the new film .
" i 'm very happy with the result and director marc forster 's done an amazing job , so i could n't be happier at the moment , " craig says , his eyes every as bit as blue in real life as they are on the big screen .
creative input critics have given quantum of solace a largely positive reception the first reviews have been largely positive and critics and fans are starting to openly declare craig to be the best bond of them all .
not least because he has helped reinvent bond as a cruel and emotionally battered character who is far closer to the superspy of ian fleming 's novels .
" the character 's rounded and 90 % of his views i ca n't go along with , " says craig .
" but he falls in love and falls out of love , he struggles with his work , and to get some of those in the movie is just the job .
i do n't know another way of doing it - i look to the flemings for help . "
quantum of solace is the shortest bond movie to date , but packs in more locations than ever before .
filming began in january at pinewood studios in the uk before moving on to panama , chile 's atacama desert , various locations in italy including siena and lake garda , plus bregenz in austria and san felipe , mexico .
the workload , says craig , was tougher than it was on casino royale .
" there was a potential actors ' strike in june or july and because we 'd started we had to finish on a certain date , so the pressure was on - we could n't stop .
if i 'd got an injury and we 'd had to stop for a couple of weeks it would have really screwed things around . "
quantum of solace is the shortest bond film to date so how much creative input does craig have in the production process ?
" i do n't shut up ! " he laughs .
" i ca n't give you a percentage .
i try and involve myself with everything - but i do n't interfere .
marc 's the director and it 's important that his vision of the movie comes across very strongly .
" we sat in meetings months before we started shooting and talked about what we wanted .
so i 'm as involved as much as i can be . "
return of q ?
both of craig 's bond movies have ditched the gadgets , the glib one-liners , miss moneypenny and q .
bond does n't even sleep with his feisty sidekick camille -lrb- olga kurylenko -rrb- .
but craig is adamant that the likes of moneypenny and q have not been consigned to bond history .
olga kurylenko plays bond 's sidekick camille " no , not at all , " he says .
" we certainly have to introduce them and earn the right to have them .
you ca n't just drop them in .
there 's a generation of people who do n't know bond movies and i want them to watch the movies and understand who those characters are . "
so how does daniel craig - the actor - detach himself from the world of james bond and keep his feet on the ground ?
" by getting away from it as much as possible , " says craig decisively .
" and where do you go ? "
" well i 'm not going to tell you , am i ? " says craig with an icy blue warning flash of those piercing eyes .
then he breaks into laughter .
" no , i spend time with my friends and my family the people that matter to me . "
and then it 's time for a final left-handed shake , before craig heads off on another assignment with a member of the press .
but james bond will return in 2010 - and it looks like some old bond favourites might be joining him too .

advertisement daniel craig on james bond and the quantum of solace by tim masters entertainment reporter , bbc news daniel craig may be a man of many talents , but he also has the power of prophecy .
" i 'm going to get hurt , " he said at the press launch for quantum of solace in january - just after filming on his second outing as 007 had commenced .
and here 's craig nine months later with his right arm in a sling after a shoulder operation , having also severed his fingertip and had eight stitches in his face after being accidentally kicked by one of his co-stars .
the actor proffers his left arm for a solid - if slightly awkward - handshake and , despite all those injuries , is in an ebullient mood about the new film .
" i 'm very happy with the result and director marc forster 's done an amazing job , so i could n't be happier at the moment , " craig says , his eyes every as bit as blue in real life as they are on the big screen .
creative input critics have given quantum of solace a largely positive reception the first reviews have been largely positive and critics and fans are starting to openly declare craig to be the best bond of them all .
not least because he has helped reinvent bond as a cruel and emotionally battered character who is far closer to the superspy of ian fleming 's novels .
" the character 's rounded and 90 % of his views i ca n't go along with , " says craig .
" but he falls in love and falls out of love , he struggles with his work , and to get some of those in the movie is just the job .
i do n't know another way of doing it - i look to the flemings for help . "
quantum of solace is the shortest bond movie to date , but packs in more locations than ever before .
filming began in january at pinewood studios in the uk before moving on to panama , chile 's atacama desert , various locations in italy including siena and lake garda , plus bregenz in austria and san felipe , mexico .
the workload , says craig , was tougher than it was on casino royale .
" there was a potential actors ' strike in june or july and because we 'd started we had to finish on a certain date , so the pressure was on - we could n't stop .
if i 'd got an injury and we 'd had to stop for a couple of weeks it would have really screwed things around . "
quantum of solace is the shortest bond film to date so how much creative input does craig have in the production process ?
" i do n't shut up ! " he laughs .
" i ca n't give you a percentage .
i try and involve myself with everything - but i do n't interfere .
marc 's the director and it 's important that his vision of the movie comes across very strongly .
" we sat in meetings months before we started shooting and talked about what we wanted .
so i 'm as involved as much as i can be . "
return of q ?
both of craig 's bond movies have ditched the gadgets , the glib one-liners , miss moneypenny and q .
bond does n't even sleep with his feisty sidekick camille -lrb- olga kurylenko -rrb- .
but craig is adamant that the likes of moneypenny and q have not been consigned to bond history .
olga kurylenko plays bond 's sidekick camille " no , not at all , " he says .
" we certainly have to introduce them and earn the right to have them .
you ca n't just drop them in .
there 's a generation of people who do n't know bond movies and i want them to watch the movies and understand who those characters are . "
so how does daniel craig - the actor - detach himself from the world of james bond and keep his feet on the ground ?
" by getting away from it as much as possible , " says craig decisively .
" and where do you go ? "
" well i 'm not going to tell you , am i ? " says craig with an icy blue warning flash of those piercing eyes .
then he breaks into laughter .
" no , i spend time with my friends and my family the people that matter to me . "
