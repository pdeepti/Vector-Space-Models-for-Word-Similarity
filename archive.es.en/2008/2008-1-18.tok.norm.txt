seehofer said that he was against the ground rules for eu subsidies being altered every year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer vowed to fight brussels every step of the way germany , as the primary funder of the cap , is concerned that huge farms formed during the communist period in the east of the country would be hit if a maximum limit is applied to direct grants to farm enterprises .
the european commission is considering capping payments to the largest farms , increasing the minimum amount of land a farmer has to own to qualify for payments , and imposing tighter environmental rules on farmers as part of its so-called " health check " on the cap .
" of course we have to be willing to compromise , " seehofer said .
" but we are going to fight very , very hard for our corner . "
eu farm ministers are to negotiate on monday in brussels on the changes .
subsidies still destined for farming community , says eu eu commissioner mariann fischer boel stuck to her guns saying that even with changes , the subsidies would still end up in the farming community , but would be spent on rural development instead .
there were no plans to put at risk the economic survival of farm enterprises .
the european union launched its latest review of its agriculture policy - the most expensive issue in its portfolio , and one of the most explosive - in november .
" it 's quite normal for perfectly healthy people to visit their doctor to see whether they need to do anything different ...
in the same way , we need to look at whether we need to adjust the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- for an eu of 27 and a rapidly changing world , " fischer boel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer boel 's cap health check has left germany sick under the " health check " , the commission is set to consult with eu member states , farmers and ngos over ways to make the cap more effective without making it more expensive .
the commission is expected to propose legally-binding changes to the current cap in spring 2008 .
the cap is already the eu 's costliest policy , accounting for some 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 73.3 billion -rrb- per year - over 40 per cent of the total eu budget - in a complex system of payments based on farm size , type of crop and volume produced , among other factors .
agriculture policy a consistent sore point the cap has often been the source of bitter contention between member states - most recently in 2003 , when a major reform fell foul of an all-out row between france and britain .
france is the largest recipient of cap funds , while britain receives a multi-billion-euro rebate from the eu every year because it gets so little from the cap .
each side regularly accuses the other of taking unfair advantage of the system .
the potential row over subsidies is therefore nothing new and rather than putting green week under a cloud , it will be just one of many debates going on around the berlin conference center where the international agriculture event is staged . the dispute is sure to feature during the international conference of the ministers of agriculture which takes place there this weekend .

seehofer said that he was against the ground rules for eu subsidies being altered every year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer vowed to fight brussels every step of the way germany , as the primary funder of the cap , is concerned that huge farms formed during the communist period in the east of the country would be hit if a maximum limit is applied to direct grants to farm enterprises .
the european commission is considering capping payments to the largest farms , increasing the minimum amount of land a farmer has to own to qualify for payments , and imposing tighter environmental rules on farmers as part of its so-called " health check " on the cap .
" of course we have to be willing to compromise , " seehofer said .
" but we are going to fight very , very hard for our corner . "
eu farm ministers are to negotiate on monday in brussels on the changes .
subsidies still destined for farming community , says eu eu commissioner mariann fischer boel stuck to her guns saying that even with changes , the subsidies would still end up in the farming community , but would be spent on rural development instead .
there were no plans to put at risk the economic survival of farm enterprises .
the european union launched its latest review of its agriculture policy - the most expensive issue in its portfolio , and one of the most explosive - in november .
" it 's quite normal for perfectly healthy people to visit their doctor to see whether they need to do anything different ...
in the same way , we need to look at whether we need to adjust the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- for an eu of 27 and a rapidly changing world , " fischer boel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer boel 's cap health check has left germany sick under the " health check " , the commission is set to consult with eu member states , farmers and ngos over ways to make the cap more effective without making it more expensive .
the commission is expected to propose legally-binding changes to the current cap in spring 2008 .
the cap is already the eu 's costliest policy , accounting for some 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 73.3 billion -rrb- per year - over 40 per cent of the total eu budget - in a complex system of payments based on farm size , type of crop and volume produced , among other factors .
agriculture policy a consistent sore point the cap has often been the source of bitter contention between member states - most recently in 2003 , when a major reform fell foul of an all-out row between france and britain .
france is the largest recipient of cap funds , while britain receives a multi-billion-euro rebate from the eu every year because it gets so little from the cap .
each side regularly accuses the other of taking unfair advantage of the system .
the potential row over subsidies is therefore nothing new and rather than putting green week under a cloud , it will be just one of many debates going on around the berlin conference center where the international agriculture event is staged . the dispute is sure to feature during the international conference of the ministers of agriculture which takes place there this weekend .
the international green week berlin 2008 runs from january 18 to 27 , with displays representing all areas of the food industry , agriculture and horticulture . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in his role as foreign minister for the " grand coalition , " steinmeier should have considered the political implications of the invitation , leading cdu leaders said this week .
steinmeier is a member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , the junior partner in the federal coalition led by the conservatives . other western countries such as the united states and france have sought to isolate syria for worsening the political instability in lebanon and for its support for radical groups involved in violence against israel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syria said it 's ready to play constructive role earlier this week , merkel accused syria of not doing enough to resolve the political crisis in lebanon , which has been without a head of state since november due to an impasse between the western-backed majority and the hezbollah-led opposition supported by syria .
steinmeier feels syria is a key player both in resolving the lebanon crisis and bringing peace to the middle east .
" syria is a country that can be a spoiler .
therefore , my advice is to keep trying to convince it that a destructive role is n't necessarily in its own interest , " steinmeier said in a speech to the bertelsmann foundation think-tank after his thursday meeting with foreign minister al-moualem .
coalition partners unhappy steinmeier is responsible for ensuring that the government projects a stable foreign policy .
he should not be seen as " going at it alone " in his foreign policy decisions , said karl-theodor zu guttenberg chairman of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- 's comittee on foreign affairs .
the csu is the sister bavarian party of the cdu .
guttenberg made it clear that the csu was not happy with steinmeier 's decision .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 18.01.2008 germany challenges eu subsidies as agriculture show opens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the row over farm subsidies is n't as fresh as the produce at the show as europe 's biggest farm produce trade fair opens in berlin , germany set an altogether different stall out when its agriculture minister squared up to the european union over plans to scrap outdated farm subsidies . speaking before the international green week opened in the german capital friday , horst seehofer announced he was spoiling for a fight over the eu commissioner for agriculture 's planned changes to the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- .
seehofer said that he was against the ground rules for eu subsidies being altered every year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer vowed to fight brussels every step of the way germany , as the primary funder of the cap , is concerned that huge farms formed during the communist period in the east of the country would be hit if a maximum limit is applied to direct grants to farm enterprises .
the european commission is considering capping payments to the largest farms , increasing the minimum amount of land a farmer has to own to qualify for payments , and imposing tighter environmental rules on farmers as part of its so-called " health check " on the cap .
" of course we have to be willing to compromise , " seehofer said .
" but we are going to fight very , very hard for our corner . "
eu farm ministers are to negotiate on monday in brussels on the changes .
subsidies still destined for farming community , says eu eu commissioner mariann fischer boel stuck to her guns saying that even with changes , the subsidies would still end up in the farming community , but would be spent on rural development instead .
there were no plans to put at risk the economic survival of farm enterprises .
the european union launched its latest review of its agriculture policy - the most expensive issue in its portfolio , and one of the most explosive - in november .
" it 's quite normal for perfectly healthy people to visit their doctor to see whether they need to do anything different ...
in the same way , we need to look at whether we need to adjust the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- for an eu of 27 and a rapidly changing world , " fischer boel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer boel 's cap health check has left germany sick under the " health check " , the commission is set to consult with eu member states , farmers and ngos over ways to make the cap more effective without making it more expensive .
the commission is expected to propose legally-binding changes to the current cap in spring 2008 .
the cap is already the eu 's costliest policy , accounting for some 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 73.3 billion -rrb- per year - over 40 per cent of the total eu budget - in a complex system of payments based on farm size , type of crop and volume produced , among other factors .
agriculture policy a consistent sore point the cap has often been the source of bitter contention between member states - most recently in 2003 , when a major reform fell foul of an all-out row between france and britain .
france is the largest recipient of cap funds , while britain receives a multi-billion-euro rebate from the eu every year because it gets so little from the cap .
each side regularly accuses the other of taking unfair advantage of the system .
the potential row over subsidies is therefore nothing new and rather than putting green week under a cloud , it will be just one of many debates going on around the berlin conference center where the international agriculture event is staged . the dispute is sure to feature during the international conference of the ministers of agriculture which takes place there this weekend .
the international green week berlin 2008 runs from january 18 to 27 , with displays representing all areas of the food industry , agriculture and horticulture . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

seehofer said that he was against the ground rules for eu subsidies being altered every year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer vowed to fight brussels every step of the way germany , as the primary funder of the cap , is concerned that huge farms formed during the communist period in the east of the country would be hit if a maximum limit is applied to direct grants to farm enterprises .
the european commission is considering capping payments to the largest farms , increasing the minimum amount of land a farmer has to own to qualify for payments , and imposing tighter environmental rules on farmers as part of its so-called " health check " on the cap .
" of course we have to be willing to compromise , " seehofer said .
" but we are going to fight very , very hard for our corner . "
eu farm ministers are to negotiate on monday in brussels on the changes .
subsidies still destined for farming community , says eu eu commissioner mariann fischer boel stuck to her guns saying that even with changes , the subsidies would still end up in the farming community , but would be spent on rural development instead .
there were no plans to put at risk the economic survival of farm enterprises .
the european union launched its latest review of its agriculture policy - the most expensive issue in its portfolio , and one of the most explosive - in november .
" it 's quite normal for perfectly healthy people to visit their doctor to see whether they need to do anything different ...
in the same way , we need to look at whether we need to adjust the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- for an eu of 27 and a rapidly changing world , " fischer boel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer boel 's cap health check has left germany sick under the " health check " , the commission is set to consult with eu member states , farmers and ngos over ways to make the cap more effective without making it more expensive .
the commission is expected to propose legally-binding changes to the current cap in spring 2008 .
the cap is already the eu 's costliest policy , accounting for some 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 73.3 billion -rrb- per year - over 40 per cent of the total eu budget - in a complex system of payments based on farm size , type of crop and volume produced , among other factors .
agriculture policy a consistent sore point the cap has often been the source of bitter contention between member states - most recently in 2003 , when a major reform fell foul of an all-out row between france and britain .
france is the largest recipient of cap funds , while britain receives a multi-billion-euro rebate from the eu every year because it gets so little from the cap .
each side regularly accuses the other of taking unfair advantage of the system .
the potential row over subsidies is therefore nothing new and rather than putting green week under a cloud , it will be just one of many debates going on around the berlin conference center where the international agriculture event is staged . the dispute is sure to feature during the international conference of the ministers of agriculture which takes place there this weekend .

seehofer said that he was against the ground rules for eu subsidies being altered every year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer vowed to fight brussels every step of the way germany , as the primary funder of the cap , is concerned that huge farms formed during the communist period in the east of the country would be hit if a maximum limit is applied to direct grants to farm enterprises .
the european commission is considering capping payments to the largest farms , increasing the minimum amount of land a farmer has to own to qualify for payments , and imposing tighter environmental rules on farmers as part of its so-called " health check " on the cap .
" of course we have to be willing to compromise , " seehofer said .
" but we are going to fight very , very hard for our corner . "
eu farm ministers are to negotiate on monday in brussels on the changes .
subsidies still destined for farming community , says eu eu commissioner mariann fischer boel stuck to her guns saying that even with changes , the subsidies would still end up in the farming community , but would be spent on rural development instead .
there were no plans to put at risk the economic survival of farm enterprises .
the european union launched its latest review of its agriculture policy - the most expensive issue in its portfolio , and one of the most explosive - in november .
" it 's quite normal for perfectly healthy people to visit their doctor to see whether they need to do anything different ...
in the same way , we need to look at whether we need to adjust the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- for an eu of 27 and a rapidly changing world , " fischer boel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer boel 's cap health check has left germany sick under the " health check " , the commission is set to consult with eu member states , farmers and ngos over ways to make the cap more effective without making it more expensive .
the commission is expected to propose legally-binding changes to the current cap in spring 2008 .
the cap is already the eu 's costliest policy , accounting for some 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 73.3 billion -rrb- per year - over 40 per cent of the total eu budget - in a complex system of payments based on farm size , type of crop and volume produced , among other factors .
agriculture policy a consistent sore point the cap has often been the source of bitter contention between member states - most recently in 2003 , when a major reform fell foul of an all-out row between france and britain .
france is the largest recipient of cap funds , while britain receives a multi-billion-euro rebate from the eu every year because it gets so little from the cap .
each side regularly accuses the other of taking unfair advantage of the system .
the potential row over subsidies is therefore nothing new and rather than putting green week under a cloud , it will be just one of many debates going on around the berlin conference center where the international agriculture event is staged . the dispute is sure to feature during the international conference of the ministers of agriculture which takes place there this weekend .
the international green week berlin 2008 runs from january 18 to 27 , with displays representing all areas of the food industry , agriculture and horticulture . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in his role as foreign minister for the " grand coalition , " steinmeier should have considered the political implications of the invitation , leading cdu leaders said this week .
steinmeier is a member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , the junior partner in the federal coalition led by the conservatives . other western countries such as the united states and france have sought to isolate syria for worsening the political instability in lebanon and for its support for radical groups involved in violence against israel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syria said it 's ready to play constructive role earlier this week , merkel accused syria of not doing enough to resolve the political crisis in lebanon , which has been without a head of state since november due to an impasse between the western-backed majority and the hezbollah-led opposition supported by syria .
steinmeier feels syria is a key player both in resolving the lebanon crisis and bringing peace to the middle east .
" syria is a country that can be a spoiler .
therefore , my advice is to keep trying to convince it that a destructive role is n't necessarily in its own interest , " steinmeier said in a speech to the bertelsmann foundation think-tank after his thursday meeting with foreign minister al-moualem .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 18.01.2008 germany challenges eu subsidies as agriculture show opens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the row over farm subsidies is n't as fresh as the produce at the show as europe 's biggest farm produce trade fair opens in berlin , germany set an altogether different stall out when its agriculture minister squared up to the european union over plans to scrap outdated farm subsidies . speaking before the international green week opened in the german capital friday , horst seehofer announced he was spoiling for a fight over the eu commissioner for agriculture 's planned changes to the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- .
seehofer said that he was against the ground rules for eu subsidies being altered every year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer vowed to fight brussels every step of the way germany , as the primary funder of the cap , is concerned that huge farms formed during the communist period in the east of the country would be hit if a maximum limit is applied to direct grants to farm enterprises .
the european commission is considering capping payments to the largest farms , increasing the minimum amount of land a farmer has to own to qualify for payments , and imposing tighter environmental rules on farmers as part of its so-called " health check " on the cap .
" of course we have to be willing to compromise , " seehofer said .
" but we are going to fight very , very hard for our corner . "
eu farm ministers are to negotiate on monday in brussels on the changes .
subsidies still destined for farming community , says eu eu commissioner mariann fischer boel stuck to her guns saying that even with changes , the subsidies would still end up in the farming community , but would be spent on rural development instead .
there were no plans to put at risk the economic survival of farm enterprises .
the european union launched its latest review of its agriculture policy - the most expensive issue in its portfolio , and one of the most explosive - in november .
" it 's quite normal for perfectly healthy people to visit their doctor to see whether they need to do anything different ...
in the same way , we need to look at whether we need to adjust the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- for an eu of 27 and a rapidly changing world , " fischer boel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer boel 's cap health check has left germany sick under the " health check " , the commission is set to consult with eu member states , farmers and ngos over ways to make the cap more effective without making it more expensive .
the commission is expected to propose legally-binding changes to the current cap in spring 2008 .
the cap is already the eu 's costliest policy , accounting for some 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 73.3 billion -rrb- per year - over 40 per cent of the total eu budget - in a complex system of payments based on farm size , type of crop and volume produced , among other factors .
agriculture policy a consistent sore point the cap has often been the source of bitter contention between member states - most recently in 2003 , when a major reform fell foul of an all-out row between france and britain .
france is the largest recipient of cap funds , while britain receives a multi-billion-euro rebate from the eu every year because it gets so little from the cap .
each side regularly accuses the other of taking unfair advantage of the system .
the potential row over subsidies is therefore nothing new and rather than putting green week under a cloud , it will be just one of many debates going on around the berlin conference center where the international agriculture event is staged . the dispute is sure to feature during the international conference of the ministers of agriculture which takes place there this weekend .
the international green week berlin 2008 runs from january 18 to 27 , with displays representing all areas of the food industry , agriculture and horticulture . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

seehofer said that he was against the ground rules for eu subsidies being altered every year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer vowed to fight brussels every step of the way germany , as the primary funder of the cap , is concerned that huge farms formed during the communist period in the east of the country would be hit if a maximum limit is applied to direct grants to farm enterprises .
the european commission is considering capping payments to the largest farms , increasing the minimum amount of land a farmer has to own to qualify for payments , and imposing tighter environmental rules on farmers as part of its so-called " health check " on the cap .
" of course we have to be willing to compromise , " seehofer said .
" but we are going to fight very , very hard for our corner . "
eu farm ministers are to negotiate on monday in brussels on the changes .
subsidies still destined for farming community , says eu eu commissioner mariann fischer boel stuck to her guns saying that even with changes , the subsidies would still end up in the farming community , but would be spent on rural development instead .
there were no plans to put at risk the economic survival of farm enterprises .
the european union launched its latest review of its agriculture policy - the most expensive issue in its portfolio , and one of the most explosive - in november .
" it 's quite normal for perfectly healthy people to visit their doctor to see whether they need to do anything different ...
in the same way , we need to look at whether we need to adjust the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- for an eu of 27 and a rapidly changing world , " fischer boel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer boel 's cap health check has left germany sick under the " health check " , the commission is set to consult with eu member states , farmers and ngos over ways to make the cap more effective without making it more expensive .
the commission is expected to propose legally-binding changes to the current cap in spring 2008 .
the cap is already the eu 's costliest policy , accounting for some 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 73.3 billion -rrb- per year - over 40 per cent of the total eu budget - in a complex system of payments based on farm size , type of crop and volume produced , among other factors .
agriculture policy a consistent sore point the cap has often been the source of bitter contention between member states - most recently in 2003 , when a major reform fell foul of an all-out row between france and britain .
france is the largest recipient of cap funds , while britain receives a multi-billion-euro rebate from the eu every year because it gets so little from the cap .
each side regularly accuses the other of taking unfair advantage of the system .
the potential row over subsidies is therefore nothing new and rather than putting green week under a cloud , it will be just one of many debates going on around the berlin conference center where the international agriculture event is staged . the dispute is sure to feature during the international conference of the ministers of agriculture which takes place there this weekend .

in his role as foreign minister for the " grand coalition , " steinmeier should have considered the political implications of the invitation , leading cdu leaders said this week .
steinmeier is a member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , the junior partner in the federal coalition led by the conservatives . other western countries such as the united states and france have sought to isolate syria for worsening the political instability in lebanon and for its support for radical groups involved in violence against israel .

steinmeier feels syria is a key player both in resolving the lebanon crisis and bringing peace to the middle east .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 18.01.2008 german foreign minister criticized for courting syria großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier has taken political heat for talking to syria foreign policy disagreements between germany 's left-right coalition heated up this week as foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier found himself on the defensive for meeting with his syrian counterpart . chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- lashed out at steinmeier for inviting syrian foreign minister walid al-moallem to berlin this week .
in his role as foreign minister for the " grand coalition , " steinmeier should have considered the political implications of the invitation , leading cdu leaders said this week .
steinmeier is a member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , the junior partner in the federal coalition led by the conservatives . other western countries such as the united states and france have sought to isolate syria for worsening the political instability in lebanon and for its support for radical groups involved in violence against israel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syria said it 's ready to play constructive role earlier this week , merkel accused syria of not doing enough to resolve the political crisis in lebanon , which has been without a head of state since november due to an impasse between the western-backed majority and the hezbollah-led opposition supported by syria .
steinmeier feels syria is a key player both in resolving the lebanon crisis and bringing peace to the middle east .
" syria is a country that can be a spoiler .
therefore , my advice is to keep trying to convince it that a destructive role is n't necessarily in its own interest , " steinmeier said in a speech to the bertelsmann foundation think-tank after his thursday meeting with foreign minister al-moualem .
coalition partners unhappy steinmeier is responsible for ensuring that the government projects a stable foreign policy .
he should not be seen as " going at it alone " in his foreign policy decisions , said karl-theodor zu guttenberg chairman of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- 's comittee on foreign affairs .
the csu is the sister bavarian party of the cdu .
guttenberg made it clear that the csu was not happy with steinmeier 's decision .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tense situation in lebanon remains a matter of concern merkel did n't attend the thursday , jan .
18 meeting between steinmeier and his syrian counterpart walid al-moualem .
she also did n't send any of her foreign policy advisers to greet him .
it 's not good to " always roll out the red carpet " for syria , eckard von klaeden , the foreign affairs spokesman for the cdu , told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
the invitation brought with it the danger that damaskus would incorrectly interpret the gesture , von klaeden said .
syria has not been meeting western expectations in helping resolve the political crisis in lebanon , merkel said this week .
many fear the situation could launch the country into another civicl war .
" we expect syria to play a constructive role in lebanon 's presidential election , " merkel said .
" i do n't see this sufficiently at the moment . "
isolation seen as counterproductive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel criticized syria 's lack of cooperation in lebanon steinmeier admitted that syria is currently not playing a constructive role in the israel-palestinian peace efforts , but he strongly defended his decision to engage damascus .
isolating syria is a bad idea , steinmeier said at the bertelsmann foundation speech .
" containment and isolation wo n't succeed , i am convinced , and i 'm not sure that some arab states would permit it , " steinmeier said .
syria has indicated it is ready to look for peaceful ways to resolve the conflict in the middle east .
" it is in the interest of syria to play a positive role to ensure security and stability in this turbulent region , " al-moallem told reporters thursday .
" with peace , security for all will be ensured .
with peace , we will have economic prosperity for all as well as the answer to extremism in the region . " dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

seehofer said that he was against the ground rules for eu subsidies being altered every year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer vowed to fight brussels every step of the way germany , as the primary funder of the cap , is concerned that huge farms formed during the communist period in the east of the country would be hit if a maximum limit is applied to direct grants to farm enterprises .
the european commission is considering capping payments to the largest farms , increasing the minimum amount of land a farmer has to own to qualify for payments , and imposing tighter environmental rules on farmers as part of its so-called " health check " on the cap .
" of course we have to be willing to compromise , " seehofer said .
" but we are going to fight very , very hard for our corner . "
eu farm ministers are to negotiate on monday in brussels on the changes .
subsidies still destined for farming community , says eu eu commissioner mariann fischer boel stuck to her guns saying that even with changes , the subsidies would still end up in the farming community , but would be spent on rural development instead .
there were no plans to put at risk the economic survival of farm enterprises .
the european union launched its latest review of its agriculture policy - the most expensive issue in its portfolio , and one of the most explosive - in november .
" it 's quite normal for perfectly healthy people to visit their doctor to see whether they need to do anything different ...
in the same way , we need to look at whether we need to adjust the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- for an eu of 27 and a rapidly changing world , " fischer boel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer boel 's cap health check has left germany sick under the " health check " , the commission is set to consult with eu member states , farmers and ngos over ways to make the cap more effective without making it more expensive .
the commission is expected to propose legally-binding changes to the current cap in spring 2008 .
the cap is already the eu 's costliest policy , accounting for some 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 73.3 billion -rrb- per year - over 40 per cent of the total eu budget - in a complex system of payments based on farm size , type of crop and volume produced , among other factors .
agriculture policy a consistent sore point the cap has often been the source of bitter contention between member states - most recently in 2003 , when a major reform fell foul of an all-out row between france and britain .
france is the largest recipient of cap funds , while britain receives a multi-billion-euro rebate from the eu every year because it gets so little from the cap .
each side regularly accuses the other of taking unfair advantage of the system .
the potential row over subsidies is therefore nothing new and rather than putting green week under a cloud , it will be just one of many debates going on around the berlin conference center where the international agriculture event is staged . the dispute is sure to feature during the international conference of the ministers of agriculture which takes place there this weekend .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer vowed to fight brussels every step of the way germany , as the primary funder of the cap , is concerned that huge farms formed during the communist period in the east of the country would be hit if a maximum limit is applied to direct grants to farm enterprises .
the european commission is considering capping payments to the largest farms , increasing the minimum amount of land a farmer has to own to qualify for payments , and imposing tighter environmental rules on farmers as part of its so-called " health check " on the cap .
" of course we have to be willing to compromise , " seehofer said .
" but we are going to fight very , very hard for our corner . "
eu farm ministers are to negotiate on monday in brussels on the changes .
subsidies still destined for farming community , says eu eu commissioner mariann fischer boel stuck to her guns saying that even with changes , the subsidies would still end up in the farming community , but would be spent on rural development instead .
there were no plans to put at risk the economic survival of farm enterprises .
the european union launched its latest review of its agriculture policy - the most expensive issue in its portfolio , and one of the most explosive - in november .
" it 's quite normal for perfectly healthy people to visit their doctor to see whether they need to do anything different ...
in the same way , we need to look at whether we need to adjust the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- for an eu of 27 and a rapidly changing world , " fischer boel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer boel 's cap health check has left germany sick under the " health check " , the commission is set to consult with eu member states , farmers and ngos over ways to make the cap more effective without making it more expensive .
the commission is expected to propose legally-binding changes to the current cap in spring 2008 .
the cap is already the eu 's costliest policy , accounting for some 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 73.3 billion -rrb- per year - over 40 per cent of the total eu budget - in a complex system of payments based on farm size , type of crop and volume produced , among other factors .
agriculture policy a consistent sore point the cap has often been the source of bitter contention between member states - most recently in 2003 , when a major reform fell foul of an all-out row between france and britain .
france is the largest recipient of cap funds , while britain receives a multi-billion-euro rebate from the eu every year because it gets so little from the cap .
each side regularly accuses the other of taking unfair advantage of the system .
the potential row over subsidies is therefore nothing new and rather than putting green week under a cloud , it will be just one of many debates going on around the berlin conference center where the international agriculture event is staged . the dispute is sure to feature during the international conference of the ministers of agriculture which takes place there this weekend .

the european commission is considering capping payments to the largest farms , increasing the minimum amount of land a farmer has to own to qualify for payments , and imposing tighter environmental rules on farmers as part of its so-called " health check " on the cap .
" of course we have to be willing to compromise , " seehofer said .
" but we are going to fight very , very hard for our corner . "
eu farm ministers are to negotiate on monday in brussels on the changes .
subsidies still destined for farming community , says eu eu commissioner mariann fischer boel stuck to her guns saying that even with changes , the subsidies would still end up in the farming community , but would be spent on rural development instead .
there were no plans to put at risk the economic survival of farm enterprises .
the european union launched its latest review of its agriculture policy - the most expensive issue in its portfolio , and one of the most explosive - in november .
" it 's quite normal for perfectly healthy people to visit their doctor to see whether they need to do anything different ...
in the same way , we need to look at whether we need to adjust the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- for an eu of 27 and a rapidly changing world , " fischer boel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer boel 's cap health check has left germany sick under the " health check " , the commission is set to consult with eu member states , farmers and ngos over ways to make the cap more effective without making it more expensive .
the commission is expected to propose legally-binding changes to the current cap in spring 2008 .
the cap is already the eu 's costliest policy , accounting for some 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 73.3 billion -rrb- per year - over 40 per cent of the total eu budget - in a complex system of payments based on farm size , type of crop and volume produced , among other factors .
agriculture policy a consistent sore point the cap has often been the source of bitter contention between member states - most recently in 2003 , when a major reform fell foul of an all-out row between france and britain .
france is the largest recipient of cap funds , while britain receives a multi-billion-euro rebate from the eu every year because it gets so little from the cap .
each side regularly accuses the other of taking unfair advantage of the system .
the potential row over subsidies is therefore nothing new and rather than putting green week under a cloud , it will be just one of many debates going on around the berlin conference center where the international agriculture event is staged . the dispute is sure to feature during the international conference of the ministers of agriculture which takes place there this weekend .

seehofer said that he was against the ground rules for eu subsidies being altered every year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer vowed to fight brussels every step of the way germany , as the primary funder of the cap , is concerned that huge farms formed during the communist period in the east of the country would be hit if a maximum limit is applied to direct grants to farm enterprises .
the european commission is considering capping payments to the largest farms , increasing the minimum amount of land a farmer has to own to qualify for payments , and imposing tighter environmental rules on farmers as part of its so-called " health check " on the cap .
" of course we have to be willing to compromise , " seehofer said .
" but we are going to fight very , very hard for our corner . "
eu farm ministers are to negotiate on monday in brussels on the changes .
subsidies still destined for farming community , says eu eu commissioner mariann fischer boel stuck to her guns saying that even with changes , the subsidies would still end up in the farming community , but would be spent on rural development instead .
there were no plans to put at risk the economic survival of farm enterprises .
the european union launched its latest review of its agriculture policy - the most expensive issue in its portfolio , and one of the most explosive - in november .
" it 's quite normal for perfectly healthy people to visit their doctor to see whether they need to do anything different ...
in the same way , we need to look at whether we need to adjust the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- for an eu of 27 and a rapidly changing world , " fischer boel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer boel 's cap health check has left germany sick under the " health check " , the commission is set to consult with eu member states , farmers and ngos over ways to make the cap more effective without making it more expensive .
the commission is expected to propose legally-binding changes to the current cap in spring 2008 .
the cap is already the eu 's costliest policy , accounting for some 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 73.3 billion -rrb- per year - over 40 per cent of the total eu budget - in a complex system of payments based on farm size , type of crop and volume produced , among other factors .
agriculture policy a consistent sore point the cap has often been the source of bitter contention between member states - most recently in 2003 , when a major reform fell foul of an all-out row between france and britain .
france is the largest recipient of cap funds , while britain receives a multi-billion-euro rebate from the eu every year because it gets so little from the cap .
each side regularly accuses the other of taking unfair advantage of the system .
the potential row over subsidies is therefore nothing new and rather than putting green week under a cloud , it will be just one of many debates going on around the berlin conference center where the international agriculture event is staged . the dispute is sure to feature during the international conference of the ministers of agriculture which takes place there this weekend .
the international green week berlin 2008 runs from january 18 to 27 , with displays representing all areas of the food industry , agriculture and horticulture . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in his role as foreign minister for the " grand coalition , " steinmeier should have considered the political implications of the invitation , leading cdu leaders said this week .
steinmeier is a member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , the junior partner in the federal coalition led by the conservatives . other western countries such as the united states and france have sought to isolate syria for worsening the political instability in lebanon and for its support for radical groups involved in violence against israel .

steinmeier feels syria is a key player both in resolving the lebanon crisis and bringing peace to the middle east .
" syria is a country that can be a spoiler .
therefore , my advice is to keep trying to convince it that a destructive role is n't necessarily in its own interest , " steinmeier said in a speech to the bertelsmann foundation think-tank after his thursday meeting with foreign minister al-moualem .

in his role as foreign minister for the " grand coalition , " steinmeier should have considered the political implications of the invitation , leading cdu leaders said this week .
steinmeier is a member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , the junior partner in the federal coalition led by the conservatives . other western countries such as the united states and france have sought to isolate syria for worsening the political instability in lebanon and for its support for radical groups involved in violence against israel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syria said it 's ready to play constructive role earlier this week , merkel accused syria of not doing enough to resolve the political crisis in lebanon , which has been without a head of state since november due to an impasse between the western-backed majority and the hezbollah-led opposition supported by syria .
steinmeier feels syria is a key player both in resolving the lebanon crisis and bringing peace to the middle east .
" syria is a country that can be a spoiler .
therefore , my advice is to keep trying to convince it that a destructive role is n't necessarily in its own interest , " steinmeier said in a speech to the bertelsmann foundation think-tank after his thursday meeting with foreign minister al-moualem .
coalition partners unhappy steinmeier is responsible for ensuring that the government projects a stable foreign policy .
he should not be seen as " going at it alone " in his foreign policy decisions , said karl-theodor zu guttenberg chairman of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- 's comittee on foreign affairs .
the csu is the sister bavarian party of the cdu .
guttenberg made it clear that the csu was not happy with steinmeier 's decision .

in his role as foreign minister for the " grand coalition , " steinmeier should have considered the political implications of the invitation , leading cdu leaders said this week .
steinmeier is a member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , the junior partner in the federal coalition led by the conservatives . other western countries such as the united states and france have sought to isolate syria for worsening the political instability in lebanon and for its support for radical groups involved in violence against israel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syria said it 's ready to play constructive role earlier this week , merkel accused syria of not doing enough to resolve the political crisis in lebanon , which has been without a head of state since november due to an impasse between the western-backed majority and the hezbollah-led opposition supported by syria .
steinmeier feels syria is a key player both in resolving the lebanon crisis and bringing peace to the middle east .
" syria is a country that can be a spoiler .
therefore , my advice is to keep trying to convince it that a destructive role is n't necessarily in its own interest , " steinmeier said in a speech to the bertelsmann foundation think-tank after his thursday meeting with foreign minister al-moualem .
coalition partners unhappy steinmeier is responsible for ensuring that the government projects a stable foreign policy .
he should not be seen as " going at it alone " in his foreign policy decisions , said karl-theodor zu guttenberg chairman of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- 's comittee on foreign affairs .
the csu is the sister bavarian party of the cdu .

syria has not been meeting western expectations in helping resolve the political crisis in lebanon , merkel said this week .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 18.01.2008 germany challenges eu subsidies as agriculture show opens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the row over farm subsidies is n't as fresh as the produce at the show as europe 's biggest farm produce trade fair opens in berlin , germany set an altogether different stall out when its agriculture minister squared up to the european union over plans to scrap outdated farm subsidies . speaking before the international green week opened in the german capital friday , horst seehofer announced he was spoiling for a fight over the eu commissioner for agriculture 's planned changes to the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- .
seehofer said that he was against the ground rules for eu subsidies being altered every year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer vowed to fight brussels every step of the way germany , as the primary funder of the cap , is concerned that huge farms formed during the communist period in the east of the country would be hit if a maximum limit is applied to direct grants to farm enterprises .
the european commission is considering capping payments to the largest farms , increasing the minimum amount of land a farmer has to own to qualify for payments , and imposing tighter environmental rules on farmers as part of its so-called " health check " on the cap .
" of course we have to be willing to compromise , " seehofer said .
" but we are going to fight very , very hard for our corner . "
eu farm ministers are to negotiate on monday in brussels on the changes .
subsidies still destined for farming community , says eu eu commissioner mariann fischer boel stuck to her guns saying that even with changes , the subsidies would still end up in the farming community , but would be spent on rural development instead .
there were no plans to put at risk the economic survival of farm enterprises .
the european union launched its latest review of its agriculture policy - the most expensive issue in its portfolio , and one of the most explosive - in november .
" it 's quite normal for perfectly healthy people to visit their doctor to see whether they need to do anything different ...
in the same way , we need to look at whether we need to adjust the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- for an eu of 27 and a rapidly changing world , " fischer boel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer boel 's cap health check has left germany sick under the " health check " , the commission is set to consult with eu member states , farmers and ngos over ways to make the cap more effective without making it more expensive .
the commission is expected to propose legally-binding changes to the current cap in spring 2008 .

seehofer said that he was against the ground rules for eu subsidies being altered every year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer vowed to fight brussels every step of the way germany , as the primary funder of the cap , is concerned that huge farms formed during the communist period in the east of the country would be hit if a maximum limit is applied to direct grants to farm enterprises .
the european commission is considering capping payments to the largest farms , increasing the minimum amount of land a farmer has to own to qualify for payments , and imposing tighter environmental rules on farmers as part of its so-called " health check " on the cap .
" of course we have to be willing to compromise , " seehofer said .
" but we are going to fight very , very hard for our corner . "
eu farm ministers are to negotiate on monday in brussels on the changes .
subsidies still destined for farming community , says eu eu commissioner mariann fischer boel stuck to her guns saying that even with changes , the subsidies would still end up in the farming community , but would be spent on rural development instead .
there were no plans to put at risk the economic survival of farm enterprises .
the european union launched its latest review of its agriculture policy - the most expensive issue in its portfolio , and one of the most explosive - in november .
" it 's quite normal for perfectly healthy people to visit their doctor to see whether they need to do anything different ...
in the same way , we need to look at whether we need to adjust the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- for an eu of 27 and a rapidly changing world , " fischer boel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer boel 's cap health check has left germany sick under the " health check " , the commission is set to consult with eu member states , farmers and ngos over ways to make the cap more effective without making it more expensive .
the commission is expected to propose legally-binding changes to the current cap in spring 2008 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 18.01.2008 germany challenges eu subsidies as agriculture show opens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the row over farm subsidies is n't as fresh as the produce at the show as europe 's biggest farm produce trade fair opens in berlin , germany set an altogether different stall out when its agriculture minister squared up to the european union over plans to scrap outdated farm subsidies . speaking before the international green week opened in the german capital friday , horst seehofer announced he was spoiling for a fight over the eu commissioner for agriculture 's planned changes to the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- .
seehofer said that he was against the ground rules for eu subsidies being altered every year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer vowed to fight brussels every step of the way germany , as the primary funder of the cap , is concerned that huge farms formed during the communist period in the east of the country would be hit if a maximum limit is applied to direct grants to farm enterprises .
the european commission is considering capping payments to the largest farms , increasing the minimum amount of land a farmer has to own to qualify for payments , and imposing tighter environmental rules on farmers as part of its so-called " health check " on the cap .
" of course we have to be willing to compromise , " seehofer said .
" but we are going to fight very , very hard for our corner . "
eu farm ministers are to negotiate on monday in brussels on the changes .
subsidies still destined for farming community , says eu eu commissioner mariann fischer boel stuck to her guns saying that even with changes , the subsidies would still end up in the farming community , but would be spent on rural development instead .
there were no plans to put at risk the economic survival of farm enterprises .
the european union launched its latest review of its agriculture policy - the most expensive issue in its portfolio , and one of the most explosive - in november .
" it 's quite normal for perfectly healthy people to visit their doctor to see whether they need to do anything different ...
in the same way , we need to look at whether we need to adjust the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- for an eu of 27 and a rapidly changing world , " fischer boel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer boel 's cap health check has left germany sick under the " health check " , the commission is set to consult with eu member states , farmers and ngos over ways to make the cap more effective without making it more expensive .
the commission is expected to propose legally-binding changes to the current cap in spring 2008 .
the cap is already the eu 's costliest policy , accounting for some 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 73.3 billion -rrb- per year - over 40 per cent of the total eu budget - in a complex system of payments based on farm size , type of crop and volume produced , among other factors .
agriculture policy a consistent sore point the cap has often been the source of bitter contention between member states - most recently in 2003 , when a major reform fell foul of an all-out row between france and britain .
france is the largest recipient of cap funds , while britain receives a multi-billion-euro rebate from the eu every year because it gets so little from the cap .
each side regularly accuses the other of taking unfair advantage of the system .
the potential row over subsidies is therefore nothing new and rather than putting green week under a cloud , it will be just one of many debates going on around the berlin conference center where the international agriculture event is staged . the dispute is sure to feature during the international conference of the ministers of agriculture which takes place there this weekend .
the international green week berlin 2008 runs from january 18 to 27 , with displays representing all areas of the food industry , agriculture and horticulture . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

seehofer said that he was against the ground rules for eu subsidies being altered every year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer vowed to fight brussels every step of the way germany , as the primary funder of the cap , is concerned that huge farms formed during the communist period in the east of the country would be hit if a maximum limit is applied to direct grants to farm enterprises .
the european commission is considering capping payments to the largest farms , increasing the minimum amount of land a farmer has to own to qualify for payments , and imposing tighter environmental rules on farmers as part of its so-called " health check " on the cap .
" of course we have to be willing to compromise , " seehofer said .
" but we are going to fight very , very hard for our corner . "
eu farm ministers are to negotiate on monday in brussels on the changes .
subsidies still destined for farming community , says eu eu commissioner mariann fischer boel stuck to her guns saying that even with changes , the subsidies would still end up in the farming community , but would be spent on rural development instead .
there were no plans to put at risk the economic survival of farm enterprises .
the european union launched its latest review of its agriculture policy - the most expensive issue in its portfolio , and one of the most explosive - in november .
" it 's quite normal for perfectly healthy people to visit their doctor to see whether they need to do anything different ...
in the same way , we need to look at whether we need to adjust the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- for an eu of 27 and a rapidly changing world , " fischer boel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer boel 's cap health check has left germany sick under the " health check " , the commission is set to consult with eu member states , farmers and ngos over ways to make the cap more effective without making it more expensive .
the commission is expected to propose legally-binding changes to the current cap in spring 2008 .
the cap is already the eu 's costliest policy , accounting for some 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 73.3 billion -rrb- per year - over 40 per cent of the total eu budget - in a complex system of payments based on farm size , type of crop and volume produced , among other factors .
agriculture policy a consistent sore point the cap has often been the source of bitter contention between member states - most recently in 2003 , when a major reform fell foul of an all-out row between france and britain .
france is the largest recipient of cap funds , while britain receives a multi-billion-euro rebate from the eu every year because it gets so little from the cap .
each side regularly accuses the other of taking unfair advantage of the system .
the potential row over subsidies is therefore nothing new and rather than putting green week under a cloud , it will be just one of many debates going on around the berlin conference center where the international agriculture event is staged . the dispute is sure to feature during the international conference of the ministers of agriculture which takes place there this weekend .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 18.01.2008 german foreign minister criticized for courting syria großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier has taken political heat for talking to syria foreign policy disagreements between germany 's left-right coalition heated up this week as foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier found himself on the defensive for meeting with his syrian counterpart . chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- lashed out at steinmeier for inviting syrian foreign minister walid al-moallem to berlin this week .
in his role as foreign minister for the " grand coalition , " steinmeier should have considered the political implications of the invitation , leading cdu leaders said this week .
steinmeier is a member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , the junior partner in the federal coalition led by the conservatives . other western countries such as the united states and france have sought to isolate syria for worsening the political instability in lebanon and for its support for radical groups involved in violence against israel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syria said it 's ready to play constructive role earlier this week , merkel accused syria of not doing enough to resolve the political crisis in lebanon , which has been without a head of state since november due to an impasse between the western-backed majority and the hezbollah-led opposition supported by syria .
steinmeier feels syria is a key player both in resolving the lebanon crisis and bringing peace to the middle east .
" syria is a country that can be a spoiler .
therefore , my advice is to keep trying to convince it that a destructive role is n't necessarily in its own interest , " steinmeier said in a speech to the bertelsmann foundation think-tank after his thursday meeting with foreign minister al-moualem .
coalition partners unhappy steinmeier is responsible for ensuring that the government projects a stable foreign policy .
he should not be seen as " going at it alone " in his foreign policy decisions , said karl-theodor zu guttenberg chairman of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- 's comittee on foreign affairs .
the csu is the sister bavarian party of the cdu .
guttenberg made it clear that the csu was not happy with steinmeier 's decision .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tense situation in lebanon remains a matter of concern merkel did n't attend the thursday , jan .
18 meeting between steinmeier and his syrian counterpart walid al-moualem .
she also did n't send any of her foreign policy advisers to greet him .
it 's not good to " always roll out the red carpet " for syria , eckard von klaeden , the foreign affairs spokesman for the cdu , told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
the invitation brought with it the danger that damaskus would incorrectly interpret the gesture , von klaeden said .
syria has not been meeting western expectations in helping resolve the political crisis in lebanon , merkel said this week .
many fear the situation could launch the country into another civicl war .
" we expect syria to play a constructive role in lebanon 's presidential election , " merkel said .
" i do n't see this sufficiently at the moment . "
isolation seen as counterproductive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel criticized syria 's lack of cooperation in lebanon steinmeier admitted that syria is currently not playing a constructive role in the israel-palestinian peace efforts , but he strongly defended his decision to engage damascus .
isolating syria is a bad idea , steinmeier said at the bertelsmann foundation speech .
" containment and isolation wo n't succeed , i am convinced , and i 'm not sure that some arab states would permit it , " steinmeier said .
syria has indicated it is ready to look for peaceful ways to resolve the conflict in the middle east .
" it is in the interest of syria to play a positive role to ensure security and stability in this turbulent region , " al-moallem told reporters thursday .
" with peace , security for all will be ensured .
with peace , we will have economic prosperity for all as well as the answer to extremism in the region . " dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in his role as foreign minister for the " grand coalition , " steinmeier should have considered the political implications of the invitation , leading cdu leaders said this week .
steinmeier is a member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , the junior partner in the federal coalition led by the conservatives . other western countries such as the united states and france have sought to isolate syria for worsening the political instability in lebanon and for its support for radical groups involved in violence against israel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syria said it 's ready to play constructive role earlier this week , merkel accused syria of not doing enough to resolve the political crisis in lebanon , which has been without a head of state since november due to an impasse between the western-backed majority and the hezbollah-led opposition supported by syria .
steinmeier feels syria is a key player both in resolving the lebanon crisis and bringing peace to the middle east .
" syria is a country that can be a spoiler .
therefore , my advice is to keep trying to convince it that a destructive role is n't necessarily in its own interest , " steinmeier said in a speech to the bertelsmann foundation think-tank after his thursday meeting with foreign minister al-moualem .
coalition partners unhappy steinmeier is responsible for ensuring that the government projects a stable foreign policy .
he should not be seen as " going at it alone " in his foreign policy decisions , said karl-theodor zu guttenberg chairman of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- 's comittee on foreign affairs .
the csu is the sister bavarian party of the cdu .
guttenberg made it clear that the csu was not happy with steinmeier 's decision .

18 meeting between steinmeier and his syrian counterpart walid al-moualem .
she also did n't send any of her foreign policy advisers to greet him .
it 's not good to " always roll out the red carpet " for syria , eckard von klaeden , the foreign affairs spokesman for the cdu , told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
the invitation brought with it the danger that damaskus would incorrectly interpret the gesture , von klaeden said .
syria has not been meeting western expectations in helping resolve the political crisis in lebanon , merkel said this week .
many fear the situation could launch the country into another civicl war .
" we expect syria to play a constructive role in lebanon 's presidential election , " merkel said .
" i do n't see this sufficiently at the moment . "
isolation seen as counterproductive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel criticized syria 's lack of cooperation in lebanon steinmeier admitted that syria is currently not playing a constructive role in the israel-palestinian peace efforts , but he strongly defended his decision to engage damascus .
isolating syria is a bad idea , steinmeier said at the bertelsmann foundation speech .
" containment and isolation wo n't succeed , i am convinced , and i 'm not sure that some arab states would permit it , " steinmeier said .
syria has indicated it is ready to look for peaceful ways to resolve the conflict in the middle east .
" it is in the interest of syria to play a positive role to ensure security and stability in this turbulent region , " al-moallem told reporters thursday .

in his role as foreign minister for the " grand coalition , " steinmeier should have considered the political implications of the invitation , leading cdu leaders said this week .
steinmeier is a member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , the junior partner in the federal coalition led by the conservatives . other western countries such as the united states and france have sought to isolate syria for worsening the political instability in lebanon and for its support for radical groups involved in violence against israel .

steinmeier feels syria is a key player both in resolving the lebanon crisis and bringing peace to the middle east .
" syria is a country that can be a spoiler .
therefore , my advice is to keep trying to convince it that a destructive role is n't necessarily in its own interest , " steinmeier said in a speech to the bertelsmann foundation think-tank after his thursday meeting with foreign minister al-moualem .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 18.01.2008 germany challenges eu subsidies as agriculture show opens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the row over farm subsidies is n't as fresh as the produce at the show as europe 's biggest farm produce trade fair opens in berlin , germany set an altogether different stall out when its agriculture minister squared up to the european union over plans to scrap outdated farm subsidies . speaking before the international green week opened in the german capital friday , horst seehofer announced he was spoiling for a fight over the eu commissioner for agriculture 's planned changes to the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- .
seehofer said that he was against the ground rules for eu subsidies being altered every year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer vowed to fight brussels every step of the way germany , as the primary funder of the cap , is concerned that huge farms formed during the communist period in the east of the country would be hit if a maximum limit is applied to direct grants to farm enterprises .
the european commission is considering capping payments to the largest farms , increasing the minimum amount of land a farmer has to own to qualify for payments , and imposing tighter environmental rules on farmers as part of its so-called " health check " on the cap .
" of course we have to be willing to compromise , " seehofer said .
" but we are going to fight very , very hard for our corner . "
eu farm ministers are to negotiate on monday in brussels on the changes .
subsidies still destined for farming community , says eu eu commissioner mariann fischer boel stuck to her guns saying that even with changes , the subsidies would still end up in the farming community , but would be spent on rural development instead .
there were no plans to put at risk the economic survival of farm enterprises .
the european union launched its latest review of its agriculture policy - the most expensive issue in its portfolio , and one of the most explosive - in november .
" it 's quite normal for perfectly healthy people to visit their doctor to see whether they need to do anything different ...
in the same way , we need to look at whether we need to adjust the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- for an eu of 27 and a rapidly changing world , " fischer boel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer boel 's cap health check has left germany sick under the " health check " , the commission is set to consult with eu member states , farmers and ngos over ways to make the cap more effective without making it more expensive .
the commission is expected to propose legally-binding changes to the current cap in spring 2008 .
the cap is already the eu 's costliest policy , accounting for some 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 73.3 billion -rrb- per year - over 40 per cent of the total eu budget - in a complex system of payments based on farm size , type of crop and volume produced , among other factors .
agriculture policy a consistent sore point the cap has often been the source of bitter contention between member states - most recently in 2003 , when a major reform fell foul of an all-out row between france and britain .
france is the largest recipient of cap funds , while britain receives a multi-billion-euro rebate from the eu every year because it gets so little from the cap .
each side regularly accuses the other of taking unfair advantage of the system .
the potential row over subsidies is therefore nothing new and rather than putting green week under a cloud , it will be just one of many debates going on around the berlin conference center where the international agriculture event is staged . the dispute is sure to feature during the international conference of the ministers of agriculture which takes place there this weekend .

seehofer said that he was against the ground rules for eu subsidies being altered every year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer vowed to fight brussels every step of the way germany , as the primary funder of the cap , is concerned that huge farms formed during the communist period in the east of the country would be hit if a maximum limit is applied to direct grants to farm enterprises .
the european commission is considering capping payments to the largest farms , increasing the minimum amount of land a farmer has to own to qualify for payments , and imposing tighter environmental rules on farmers as part of its so-called " health check " on the cap .
" of course we have to be willing to compromise , " seehofer said .
" but we are going to fight very , very hard for our corner . "
eu farm ministers are to negotiate on monday in brussels on the changes .
subsidies still destined for farming community , says eu eu commissioner mariann fischer boel stuck to her guns saying that even with changes , the subsidies would still end up in the farming community , but would be spent on rural development instead .
there were no plans to put at risk the economic survival of farm enterprises .
the european union launched its latest review of its agriculture policy - the most expensive issue in its portfolio , and one of the most explosive - in november .
" it 's quite normal for perfectly healthy people to visit their doctor to see whether they need to do anything different ...
in the same way , we need to look at whether we need to adjust the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- for an eu of 27 and a rapidly changing world , " fischer boel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer boel 's cap health check has left germany sick under the " health check " , the commission is set to consult with eu member states , farmers and ngos over ways to make the cap more effective without making it more expensive .
the commission is expected to propose legally-binding changes to the current cap in spring 2008 .
the cap is already the eu 's costliest policy , accounting for some 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 73.3 billion -rrb- per year - over 40 per cent of the total eu budget - in a complex system of payments based on farm size , type of crop and volume produced , among other factors .
agriculture policy a consistent sore point the cap has often been the source of bitter contention between member states - most recently in 2003 , when a major reform fell foul of an all-out row between france and britain .
france is the largest recipient of cap funds , while britain receives a multi-billion-euro rebate from the eu every year because it gets so little from the cap .
each side regularly accuses the other of taking unfair advantage of the system .
the potential row over subsidies is therefore nothing new and rather than putting green week under a cloud , it will be just one of many debates going on around the berlin conference center where the international agriculture event is staged . the dispute is sure to feature during the international conference of the ministers of agriculture which takes place there this weekend .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 18.01.2008 german foreign minister criticized for courting syria großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier has taken political heat for talking to syria foreign policy disagreements between germany 's left-right coalition heated up this week as foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier found himself on the defensive for meeting with his syrian counterpart . chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- lashed out at steinmeier for inviting syrian foreign minister walid al-moallem to berlin this week .
in his role as foreign minister for the " grand coalition , " steinmeier should have considered the political implications of the invitation , leading cdu leaders said this week .
steinmeier is a member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , the junior partner in the federal coalition led by the conservatives . other western countries such as the united states and france have sought to isolate syria for worsening the political instability in lebanon and for its support for radical groups involved in violence against israel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syria said it 's ready to play constructive role earlier this week , merkel accused syria of not doing enough to resolve the political crisis in lebanon , which has been without a head of state since november due to an impasse between the western-backed majority and the hezbollah-led opposition supported by syria .
steinmeier feels syria is a key player both in resolving the lebanon crisis and bringing peace to the middle east .
" syria is a country that can be a spoiler .
therefore , my advice is to keep trying to convince it that a destructive role is n't necessarily in its own interest , " steinmeier said in a speech to the bertelsmann foundation think-tank after his thursday meeting with foreign minister al-moualem .
coalition partners unhappy steinmeier is responsible for ensuring that the government projects a stable foreign policy .
he should not be seen as " going at it alone " in his foreign policy decisions , said karl-theodor zu guttenberg chairman of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- 's comittee on foreign affairs .
the csu is the sister bavarian party of the cdu .
guttenberg made it clear that the csu was not happy with steinmeier 's decision .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tense situation in lebanon remains a matter of concern merkel did n't attend the thursday , jan .
18 meeting between steinmeier and his syrian counterpart walid al-moualem .
she also did n't send any of her foreign policy advisers to greet him .
it 's not good to " always roll out the red carpet " for syria , eckard von klaeden , the foreign affairs spokesman for the cdu , told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
the invitation brought with it the danger that damaskus would incorrectly interpret the gesture , von klaeden said .
syria has not been meeting western expectations in helping resolve the political crisis in lebanon , merkel said this week .
many fear the situation could launch the country into another civicl war .
" we expect syria to play a constructive role in lebanon 's presidential election , " merkel said .
" i do n't see this sufficiently at the moment . "
isolation seen as counterproductive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel criticized syria 's lack of cooperation in lebanon steinmeier admitted that syria is currently not playing a constructive role in the israel-palestinian peace efforts , but he strongly defended his decision to engage damascus .
isolating syria is a bad idea , steinmeier said at the bertelsmann foundation speech .
" containment and isolation wo n't succeed , i am convinced , and i 'm not sure that some arab states would permit it , " steinmeier said .
syria has indicated it is ready to look for peaceful ways to resolve the conflict in the middle east .
" it is in the interest of syria to play a positive role to ensure security and stability in this turbulent region , " al-moallem told reporters thursday .
" with peace , security for all will be ensured .
with peace , we will have economic prosperity for all as well as the answer to extremism in the region . " dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 18.01.2008 german foreign minister criticized for courting syria großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier has taken political heat for talking to syria foreign policy disagreements between germany 's left-right coalition heated up this week as foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier found himself on the defensive for meeting with his syrian counterpart . chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- lashed out at steinmeier for inviting syrian foreign minister walid al-moallem to berlin this week .
in his role as foreign minister for the " grand coalition , " steinmeier should have considered the political implications of the invitation , leading cdu leaders said this week .
steinmeier is a member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , the junior partner in the federal coalition led by the conservatives . other western countries such as the united states and france have sought to isolate syria for worsening the political instability in lebanon and for its support for radical groups involved in violence against israel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syria said it 's ready to play constructive role earlier this week , merkel accused syria of not doing enough to resolve the political crisis in lebanon , which has been without a head of state since november due to an impasse between the western-backed majority and the hezbollah-led opposition supported by syria .
steinmeier feels syria is a key player both in resolving the lebanon crisis and bringing peace to the middle east .
" syria is a country that can be a spoiler .
therefore , my advice is to keep trying to convince it that a destructive role is n't necessarily in its own interest , " steinmeier said in a speech to the bertelsmann foundation think-tank after his thursday meeting with foreign minister al-moualem .
coalition partners unhappy steinmeier is responsible for ensuring that the government projects a stable foreign policy .
he should not be seen as " going at it alone " in his foreign policy decisions , said karl-theodor zu guttenberg chairman of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- 's comittee on foreign affairs .
the csu is the sister bavarian party of the cdu .
guttenberg made it clear that the csu was not happy with steinmeier 's decision .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tense situation in lebanon remains a matter of concern merkel did n't attend the thursday , jan .
18 meeting between steinmeier and his syrian counterpart walid al-moualem .
she also did n't send any of her foreign policy advisers to greet him .
it 's not good to " always roll out the red carpet " for syria , eckard von klaeden , the foreign affairs spokesman for the cdu , told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
the invitation brought with it the danger that damaskus would incorrectly interpret the gesture , von klaeden said .
syria has not been meeting western expectations in helping resolve the political crisis in lebanon , merkel said this week .
many fear the situation could launch the country into another civicl war .
" we expect syria to play a constructive role in lebanon 's presidential election , " merkel said .
" i do n't see this sufficiently at the moment . "
isolation seen as counterproductive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel criticized syria 's lack of cooperation in lebanon steinmeier admitted that syria is currently not playing a constructive role in the israel-palestinian peace efforts , but he strongly defended his decision to engage damascus .
isolating syria is a bad idea , steinmeier said at the bertelsmann foundation speech .
" containment and isolation wo n't succeed , i am convinced , and i 'm not sure that some arab states would permit it , " steinmeier said .
syria has indicated it is ready to look for peaceful ways to resolve the conflict in the middle east .
" it is in the interest of syria to play a positive role to ensure security and stability in this turbulent region , " al-moallem told reporters thursday .
" with peace , security for all will be ensured .
with peace , we will have economic prosperity for all as well as the answer to extremism in the region . " dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 18.01.2008 germany challenges eu subsidies as agriculture show opens großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the row over farm subsidies is n't as fresh as the produce at the show as europe 's biggest farm produce trade fair opens in berlin , germany set an altogether different stall out when its agriculture minister squared up to the european union over plans to scrap outdated farm subsidies . speaking before the international green week opened in the german capital friday , horst seehofer announced he was spoiling for a fight over the eu commissioner for agriculture 's planned changes to the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- .
seehofer said that he was against the ground rules for eu subsidies being altered every year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer vowed to fight brussels every step of the way germany , as the primary funder of the cap , is concerned that huge farms formed during the communist period in the east of the country would be hit if a maximum limit is applied to direct grants to farm enterprises .
the european commission is considering capping payments to the largest farms , increasing the minimum amount of land a farmer has to own to qualify for payments , and imposing tighter environmental rules on farmers as part of its so-called " health check " on the cap .
" of course we have to be willing to compromise , " seehofer said .
" but we are going to fight very , very hard for our corner . "
eu farm ministers are to negotiate on monday in brussels on the changes .
subsidies still destined for farming community , says eu eu commissioner mariann fischer boel stuck to her guns saying that even with changes , the subsidies would still end up in the farming community , but would be spent on rural development instead .
there were no plans to put at risk the economic survival of farm enterprises .
the european union launched its latest review of its agriculture policy - the most expensive issue in its portfolio , and one of the most explosive - in november .
" it 's quite normal for perfectly healthy people to visit their doctor to see whether they need to do anything different ...
in the same way , we need to look at whether we need to adjust the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- for an eu of 27 and a rapidly changing world , " fischer boel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer boel 's cap health check has left germany sick under the " health check " , the commission is set to consult with eu member states , farmers and ngos over ways to make the cap more effective without making it more expensive .
the commission is expected to propose legally-binding changes to the current cap in spring 2008 .
the cap is already the eu 's costliest policy , accounting for some 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 73.3 billion -rrb- per year - over 40 per cent of the total eu budget - in a complex system of payments based on farm size , type of crop and volume produced , among other factors .
agriculture policy a consistent sore point the cap has often been the source of bitter contention between member states - most recently in 2003 , when a major reform fell foul of an all-out row between france and britain .
france is the largest recipient of cap funds , while britain receives a multi-billion-euro rebate from the eu every year because it gets so little from the cap .
each side regularly accuses the other of taking unfair advantage of the system .
the potential row over subsidies is therefore nothing new and rather than putting green week under a cloud , it will be just one of many debates going on around the berlin conference center where the international agriculture event is staged . the dispute is sure to feature during the international conference of the ministers of agriculture which takes place there this weekend .
the international green week berlin 2008 runs from january 18 to 27 , with displays representing all areas of the food industry , agriculture and horticulture . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in his role as foreign minister for the " grand coalition , " steinmeier should have considered the political implications of the invitation , leading cdu leaders said this week .
steinmeier is a member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , the junior partner in the federal coalition led by the conservatives . other western countries such as the united states and france have sought to isolate syria for worsening the political instability in lebanon and for its support for radical groups involved in violence against israel .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : syria said it 's ready to play constructive role earlier this week , merkel accused syria of not doing enough to resolve the political crisis in lebanon , which has been without a head of state since november due to an impasse between the western-backed majority and the hezbollah-led opposition supported by syria .
steinmeier feels syria is a key player both in resolving the lebanon crisis and bringing peace to the middle east .
" syria is a country that can be a spoiler .
therefore , my advice is to keep trying to convince it that a destructive role is n't necessarily in its own interest , " steinmeier said in a speech to the bertelsmann foundation think-tank after his thursday meeting with foreign minister al-moualem .
coalition partners unhappy steinmeier is responsible for ensuring that the government projects a stable foreign policy .
he should not be seen as " going at it alone " in his foreign policy decisions , said karl-theodor zu guttenberg chairman of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- 's comittee on foreign affairs .
the csu is the sister bavarian party of the cdu .
guttenberg made it clear that the csu was not happy with steinmeier 's decision .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tense situation in lebanon remains a matter of concern merkel did n't attend the thursday , jan .
18 meeting between steinmeier and his syrian counterpart walid al-moualem .
she also did n't send any of her foreign policy advisers to greet him .
it 's not good to " always roll out the red carpet " for syria , eckard von klaeden , the foreign affairs spokesman for the cdu , told the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper .
the invitation brought with it the danger that damaskus would incorrectly interpret the gesture , von klaeden said .
syria has not been meeting western expectations in helping resolve the political crisis in lebanon , merkel said this week .
many fear the situation could launch the country into another civicl war .
" we expect syria to play a constructive role in lebanon 's presidential election , " merkel said .
" i do n't see this sufficiently at the moment . "
isolation seen as counterproductive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel criticized syria 's lack of cooperation in lebanon steinmeier admitted that syria is currently not playing a constructive role in the israel-palestinian peace efforts , but he strongly defended his decision to engage damascus .
isolating syria is a bad idea , steinmeier said at the bertelsmann foundation speech .
" containment and isolation wo n't succeed , i am convinced , and i 'm not sure that some arab states would permit it , " steinmeier said .
syria has indicated it is ready to look for peaceful ways to resolve the conflict in the middle east .
" it is in the interest of syria to play a positive role to ensure security and stability in this turbulent region , " al-moallem told reporters thursday .
" with peace , security for all will be ensured .
with peace , we will have economic prosperity for all as well as the answer to extremism in the region . " dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

seehofer said that he was against the ground rules for eu subsidies being altered every year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seehofer vowed to fight brussels every step of the way germany , as the primary funder of the cap , is concerned that huge farms formed during the communist period in the east of the country would be hit if a maximum limit is applied to direct grants to farm enterprises .
the european commission is considering capping payments to the largest farms , increasing the minimum amount of land a farmer has to own to qualify for payments , and imposing tighter environmental rules on farmers as part of its so-called " health check " on the cap .
" of course we have to be willing to compromise , " seehofer said .
" but we are going to fight very , very hard for our corner . "
eu farm ministers are to negotiate on monday in brussels on the changes .
subsidies still destined for farming community , says eu eu commissioner mariann fischer boel stuck to her guns saying that even with changes , the subsidies would still end up in the farming community , but would be spent on rural development instead .
there were no plans to put at risk the economic survival of farm enterprises .
the european union launched its latest review of its agriculture policy - the most expensive issue in its portfolio , and one of the most explosive - in november .
" it 's quite normal for perfectly healthy people to visit their doctor to see whether they need to do anything different ...
in the same way , we need to look at whether we need to adjust the common agricultural policy -lrb- cap -rrb- for an eu of 27 and a rapidly changing world , " fischer boel said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer boel 's cap health check has left germany sick under the " health check " , the commission is set to consult with eu member states , farmers and ngos over ways to make the cap more effective without making it more expensive .
the commission is expected to propose legally-binding changes to the current cap in spring 2008 .
the cap is already the eu 's costliest policy , accounting for some 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 73.3 billion -rrb- per year - over 40 per cent of the total eu budget - in a complex system of payments based on farm size , type of crop and volume produced , among other factors .
agriculture policy a consistent sore point the cap has often been the source of bitter contention between member states - most recently in 2003 , when a major reform fell foul of an all-out row between france and britain .
france is the largest recipient of cap funds , while britain receives a multi-billion-euro rebate from the eu every year because it gets so little from the cap .
each side regularly accuses the other of taking unfair advantage of the system .
the potential row over subsidies is therefore nothing new and rather than putting green week under a cloud , it will be just one of many debates going on around the berlin conference center where the international agriculture event is staged . the dispute is sure to feature during the international conference of the ministers of agriculture which takes place there this weekend .

the men had been killed by a shot to the head , a federal agent told a news briefing in the border city of tijuana .
the stand-off began as agents prepared to raid a house that police say was a hideout for the tijuana drugs cartel , also known as arellano felix .
it is the latest in a series of drug-related killings in mexico .
tijuana is the biggest city in baja california , which was mexico 's most violent state in 2007 with more than 400 murders .
president felipe calderon sent more than 3,000 soldiers to tijuana earlier this month , as part of a nationwide crackdown on drug trafficking and gang violence .
arrests during the incident nearby schools were closed down , and local television showed images of police officers carrying out children while gunfire was heard in the background .
a spokesman for the federal public safety department , edgar millan , said one of the gunmen had been killed and four police officers wounded .
another four gunmen were arrested - one of whom was a state police investigator and another a tijuana police officer , said mr millan .
the four men will be flown to mexico city for questioning .
investigators are trying to determine the identities of the six men found shot dead in the house .

they include images that show parts of the surface missed by the mariner 10 spacecraft when it flew by the planet in the 1970s .
like the previously mapped portions of mercury , the new sections appear heavily cratered .
messenger needs to perform another two fly-bys and a number of engine firings to get itself into orbit in 2011 .
monday 's manoeuvre took the probe to within just 200km -lrb- 125 miles -rrb- of the planet at closest approach .
messenger was programmed to collect more than 1,300 images and make other observations during the encounter .
the data began transmission to earth on tuesday .
this image was taken just 21 minutes after closest approach .
messenger 's narrow angle camera spies a variety of surface features , including craters as small as about 300m across .
nasa says such detailed close-ups will be used by planetary geologists to study the processes that have shaped mercury 's surface over the past four billion years .
the picture shows part of a giant impact crater to the bottom-right .
this narrow angle camera image was obtained about 37 minutes after closest approach to the planet .
it shows a previously unseen crater with distinctive bright rays of ejected material extending radially outward from the crater 's centre .
resolution in the picture is about 360m per pixel , and the width of the image is about 370km .
monday 's flyby has produced a sequence of pictures that will allow scientists to build a high-resolution mosaic of the northeast quarter of the region not seen by mariner 10 .
it is to be expected that after 30 years of technological development , the images returned by messenger are of a superior quality to those sent back by mariner 10 .
the large , shadow-filled , double ringed crater in this picture was glimpsed by the 1970s probe and named vivaldi , after the italian composer .
its outer ring has a diameter of about 200km .
messenger sees much more detail , including the broad ancient depression overlapped by the lower-left part of the vivaldi crater .
messenger captured this image as it closed in on the planet .
it was taken when the probe was about 18,000km from the surface of mercury , and about 55 minutes before closest approach .
the image shows smooth plains , many impact craters -lrb- some with central peaks -rrb- , and rough material that appears to have been ejected from the large crater to the lower right .
this 200km-wide crater was also seen in less detail by mariner 10 .

archbishop milingo was excommunicated for marrying and for attempting to ordain four married catholic priests as bishops in the united states .
this is the first time that he has returned to rome since his formal excommunication by the vatican .
about 100 journalists and tv cameramen turned up for the book launch , in a bookshop near the trevi fountain .
seated next to his south korean wife , maria sung , the african prelate vigorously defended his decision to defy the roman catholic church 's celibacy rule .
' priests forever ' " we are claiming our rights .
we are priests forever and we are members of the catholic church , " he said .
archbishop milingo attempted to ordain married priests archbishop milingo claims that worldwide about 150,000 catholic priests have left the church to marry , 26,000 of them in the united states alone .
his book , confessions of an excommunicated catholic , tells his life story from childhood poverty in africa to his appointment as one of the youngest ever archbishops of the catholic church .
after a period of enforced residence in rome when the vatican became uneasy over his faith-healing activities in zambia , archbishop milingo left italy for the united states where he became close to the unification church of the reverend sun myung moon .
he denied however that he had become a member of the moonies .
his mission today , he says , is to be the apostle of married priests .
naturally archbishop milingo will not be seeing pope benedict while he is here .
although he said he personally had been treated with compassion and kindness by the late pope john paul ii , he strongly criticised the way that priests who leave the church to marry are abandoned by the vatican and forbidden from returning to their pastoral work .

they cover the period oct 06 - sept 07 .
" patients " include all people in the pct area - not just those using statins .
the nhs calculates the potential annual saving on each pct 's statins bill .
it looks at what proportion of prescriptions in each area is for " low cost " statins .
if that figure is less than 77 % , the nhs believes there is a potential saving to be made .
the figure of 77 % is chosen because this is what is achieved by the best performing 25 % of pcts .
these estimated figures are based on data collected in the 2nd quarter of 2007/8 .

fiona walker looks at what scotland can learn from a fostering village in russia .
it 's like walking into an illustration in a children 's book with hansel and gretel homes and children helping to stack the logs .
kitezh fostering village looks at long-term solutions for children kitezh is a fostering village in rural russia , looking after children in care .
it relies on the expertise of a consultant based in scotland , but it 's now more successful than the statistics suggest we are here .
russia may seem like an unlikely place to discover such a success story .
the country 's statistics on their children in care are pretty bleak , but not at kitezh .
in scotland children who have been in care are more likely than other young people to end up homeless , jobless or in prison .
about half of those who leave care have no standard grades .
in kitezh , nearly all the of the 69 young people who have been to kitezh over 15 years have gone on to further education .
none has ever been homeless , addicted to drugs or in prison .
kitezh 's consultant in scotland , david dean , believes we can learn from the russian experience .
so what are their secrets ?
children only come to kitezh if they are suited to the environment .
this means they are less likely to fail .
they are still young when they arrive so there 's time to work on their psychological issues .
however , challenging their behaviour , the community at kitezh copes with it .
in scotland a child can be moved from one children 's home or foster family to another .
this may be because the carers ca n't cope with their behaviour or because temporary solutions are found because of a lack of longer-term spaces .
each time a child needs to be moved , they can feel rejected , potentially creating adverse behaviour .
you ca n't put their needs on hold for three or four or five years judy furnivall scottish institute for residential child care taking a child away from their family home is , perhaps naturally , considered a last resort in scotland .
but this can mean a child is in crisis before it 's given the chance of stability or proper education .
judy furnivall , from the scottish institute for residential child care at strathclyde university , said we should be looking at removing a child from potential risk earlier , if necessary .
she said : " time does n't stop for children .
" you ca n't put their needs on hold for three or four or five years while we decide whether their parents are able to look after them .
" if they really are not able to then we need to make that decision more quickly and decisively than we do currently because actually parental rights are about the right to provide properly for your child , they 're not about ownership . "
in kitezh , the children are loved and claimed by the whole community .
the foster carers and teachers live together in a community to provide constant support to each other .
because of historic cases of child abuse in children 's homes , judy furnivall says there are now regulations controlling how we interact with children in care .
she says it 's pretty bleak that a child can grow up in a residential schools and never be told they are loved .
in kitezh , psychologists are on hand 24 hours a day so any issues are dealt with immediately .
during our investigation we discovered children in scotland waiting for up to nine months to see a mental health team .
david dean said this was crucial to kitezh 's success .
it means psychological issues are n't left to become more ingrained and more difficult to deal with .
he said : " it 's the immediacy of the support and assistance at kitezh that makes it successful .
" you 're not waiting for an appointment - we 're talking about people who grow , live , work together .
" that makes the strength of the support that is around the foster parent and by extension around the children far stronger . "
kitezh is unusual with some unconventional methods but david dean believes we can learn from aspects of their success .
what now for scotland ?
there are plans in scotland for an early years strategy , focusing on early intervention .
minister for children and early years adam ingram has said he wants to put measures in place " almost from pregnancy " to make sure families can cope .
he has also made it clear that the resources for earlier intervention must come from existing funding .
care at what cost ? will be broadcast on bbc radio scotland at 0900 gmt on friday .

they cover the period oct 06 - sept 07 .
" patients " include all people in the pct area - not just those using statins .
the nhs calculates the potential annual saving on each pct 's statins bill .
it looks at what proportion of prescriptions in each area is for " low cost " statins .
if that figure is less than 77 % , the nhs believes there is a potential saving to be made .
the figure of 77 % is chosen because this is what is achieved by the best performing 25 % of pcts .
these estimated figures are based on data collected in the 2nd quarter of 2007/8 .
