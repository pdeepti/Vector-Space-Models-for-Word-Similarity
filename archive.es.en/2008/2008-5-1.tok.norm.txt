georgian officials said the move is the start of military aggression against tbilisi . the soldiers " are completing their deployment at their positions in the tkvarcheli district of abkhazia , " russia 's three main news agencies quoted the russian defense ministry press office as saying . troops were setting up camp , defenses and communications , the itar-tass , ria novosti and interfax agencies all reported . russian officials have still not released information on exactly how many additional troops are being sent to the separatist georgian region to bolster the more than 2,000 soldiers already there .
the russians are deployed under accords ending the separatist war between georgia and the abkhaz minority in the early 1990s . the defense ministry stressed that the " total number of russian peacekeepers does not exceed the numerical limits agreed under international agreements , " the agencies reported . concern in european union russia 's move , to counter what it said was the massing of georgian troops near abkhazia and south ossetia , raised concern in the united states while the european union has said that any military build-up would not be wise . " the steps that have been taken -lsb- by russia -rsb- and the rhetoric that has been used concerning the threat of force have increased tensions and have undermined georgia 's territorial integrity , " nato spokesman james appathurai said on wednesday . " the allies are unanimous in supporting , endorsing georgia 's territorial integrity and will not recognize or support steps that undermine that sovereignty , " he said . nato announced at a summit early this month that georgia would one day become a member of the 26-nation military alliance , in the face of fierce russian opposition . russia objects to nato moving closer to its borders and is deeply concerned that the breakaway regions could be destabilized by tbilisi 's rapprochement with moscow 's old cold war-era foe . georgia claims that russia has , over the last three months , strengthened its control over abkhazia and established direct ties with the local authorities . the russian peacekeeping announcement only fuelled problems , said president mikheil saakashvili 's new " special representative " and top georgian diplomat , david bakradze . georgians reject russia 's peacekeeping claim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the build-up in the rebel regions is causing tensions " it 's hard to believe that this is being done for the purposes of peacekeeping , it 's rather the beginning of full-scale military aggression , " he told reporters .
" the georgian side , as the host country , should be notified in advance and there should be consent from georgia on any troop deployment , including peacekeepers .
we have not been notified . " " peacekeeping is not strengthened by unilateral steps . " russia has peacekeepers in abkhazia and south ossetia under an agreement with georgia from the 1990s following wars in which separatists broke away and established close ties with moscow . the russian defense ministry did not say how many extra soldiers were being sent , but said that 15 new observation posts would be set up on the frontline in abkhazia .
around 2,000 russians serve there and a further 1,000 in south ossetia . " any attempt by the georgian side to resolve the conflicts with force against russian peacekeepers and also against russian citizens ... will be met with an adequate and tough answer , " news agencies quoted the ministry as saying . no plans revealed for georgia action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia has not revealed any plans to retaliate as the rhetoric escalated , appathurai said that neither russia nor georgia had informed the military alliance of any plans to actually move their forces , although he said moscow could " technically " do so without notifying nato . but he said : " have no doubt ; everyone is watching very carefully what is happening on the ground . " bakradze said that a un mission monitoring georgia and abhkazia , unomig , " verifies everything " in terms of his country 's military deployments .
" if there is something on our side , it will immediately be known , " he said , adding : " we 're not going to move troops . " in a statement on april 21 , unomig said that its monitors " did not observe anything to substantiate reports of a build-up of forces on either side . " nato and georgian officials have confirmed that alliance ambassadors , in the so-called north atlantic council , will travel to georgia in " coming months " in a show of support for the would-be candidate . georgia attempts to defuse situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president saakashvili called for an end to the conflict georgia appeared to be attempting to prevent the dispute with russia from further escalating with president mikhail saakashvili saying that the country sought an end to the conflict . in a televised address to the people of abkhazia and south ossetia , saakashvili said : " georgia wants peace . " earlier wednesday , georgia attacked russia 's plans to boost peacekeeping troops in the two breakaway georgian regions as the start of " full scale military aggression . " the georgian foreign ministry called the plan an " act of irresponsible provocation , " russian news agency interfax reported . the remarks came after russia 's defense ministry announced tuesday an increase in peacekeeping forces to abkhazia and south ossetia in response to what it called aggressive moves by pro-western georgia . " if georgia puts in place the threats it has made on a number of occasions about the use of force , we would be forced to take retaliatory measures to protect the lives of our citizens , " russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said . eu criticize russian deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana is suspicious of the motives for the deployment the eu leaders called for calm , with eu foreign policy chief javier solana saying that the bloc would like to " de-escalate the tension . " abkhazia and south ossetia are both russian-dominated regions of georgia which fought brief separatist wars in the early 1990s and which still reject tbilisi 's rule . the georgian authorities insist that the two regions are its sovereign territory and accuse moscow of supporting the rebels .
most inhabitants of the two regions hold russian passports . in the light of rising tensions between georgia and its two regions over the past week , russia decided on tuesday to send more peacekeeping troops into the breakaway provinces . that decision was " not wise , " even if it was in line with peace agreements , solana said . osce leaders express concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the members of the osce have expressed concern finland , current chair of the 56-nation organization for security and cooperation in europe -lsb- ocse -rsb- expressed concern wednesday over " increased tension " in georgia . finnish foreign minister alexander stubb issued a statement repeating previous concern over moscow 's decision to establish ties with two breakaway regions in georgia . stubb said the april 20 downing of georgian drone over abkhazia " and the recent military build-up have considerably increased tension in the region . " he said he had telephoned president saakashvili and foreign minister lavrov as part of attempts to avert further escalation . the osce was prepared to aid the peace process and supported the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia within its internationally recognized borders , the statement said . dw staff / dpa / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

georgian officials said the move is the start of military aggression against tbilisi . the soldiers " are completing their deployment at their positions in the tkvarcheli district of abkhazia , " russia 's three main news agencies quoted the russian defense ministry press office as saying . troops were setting up camp , defenses and communications , the itar-tass , ria novosti and interfax agencies all reported . russian officials have still not released information on exactly how many additional troops are being sent to the separatist georgian region to bolster the more than 2,000 soldiers already there .
the russians are deployed under accords ending the separatist war between georgia and the abkhaz minority in the early 1990s . the defense ministry stressed that the " total number of russian peacekeepers does not exceed the numerical limits agreed under international agreements , " the agencies reported . concern in european union russia 's move , to counter what it said was the massing of georgian troops near abkhazia and south ossetia , raised concern in the united states while the european union has said that any military build-up would not be wise .

" earlier wednesday , georgia attacked russia 's plans to boost peacekeeping troops in the two breakaway georgian regions as the start of " full scale military aggression . " the georgian foreign ministry called the plan an " act of irresponsible provocation , " russian news agency interfax reported . the remarks came after russia 's defense ministry announced tuesday an increase in peacekeeping forces to abkhazia and south ossetia in response to what it called aggressive moves by pro-western georgia .

most inhabitants of the two regions hold russian passports . in the light of rising tensions between georgia and its two regions over the past week , russia decided on tuesday to send more peacekeeping troops into the breakaway provinces . that decision was " not wise , " even if it was in line with peace agreements , solana said . osce leaders express concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the members of the osce have expressed concern finland , current chair of the 56-nation organization for security and cooperation in europe -lsb- ocse -rsb- expressed concern wednesday over " increased tension " in georgia . finnish foreign minister alexander stubb issued a statement repeating previous concern over moscow 's decision to establish ties with two breakaway regions in georgia . stubb said the april 20 downing of georgian drone over abkhazia " and the recent military build-up have considerably increased tension in the region . " he said he had telephoned president saakashvili and foreign minister lavrov as part of attempts to avert further escalation . the osce was prepared to aid the peace process and supported the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia within its internationally recognized borders , the statement said . dw staff / dpa / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the club 's brazilian defender ze roberto tells dw-world.de what motivates the bavarian giants . dw-world.de : ze roberto , let 's talk about the coming game with zenit st. petersburg .
can bayern munich make it to the uefa cup final ?
how high are the chances ?
ze roberto : we have a big chance to reach the final in spite of the result from the first leg of the semi-final at home .
we can win and want to win in st. petersburg .
we are on a good run and have had some luck on our side .
this luck may have helped in the bundesliga and maybe even in the uefa cup , if you consider the crazy game against getafe , but can you count on it ?
the games in europe are very different from the ones played in the bundesliga or the german cup .
in the uefa cup you have a lot of teams which are not seen as being the biggest in europe but are nevertheless very strong and have a lot of quality .
they want to win this title .
the problem has been for us the games at home , such as against getafe and last week against zenit .
can you explain why the results have been so close and the ties so complicated when bayern has the potential to get a result quickly and more clearly ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ze roberto is at a loss to explain why bayern fade we have recently had two types of halves in these games .
in the first half we are normally dominant , aggressive and determined .
in the second half , though , we have been unable to maintain that level .
i ca n't explain why .
maybe after so many games we are tired .
but the fact is , unfortunately , it is in the second half that we often give things away .
but to get to the final of the uefa cup , the team must be able to maintain that first half level of dominance for the whole 90 minutes .
that 's right .
we plan to perform for the whole game in st. petersburg at the level we showed in the first half of the game against zenit in munich .
is it a mental problem that the team can not maintain such a high level for the whole game ?
it is a primarily a psychological problem and also a physical problem with tiredness .
nevertheless , we always come out of the dressing room with the vision of victory in our heads , regardless of who our opponent is .
lucio was the unlucky figure last week in the first game against zenit - his own goal gave st. petersburg the draw and set up the nervous match in russia .
does the team stand behind him ?
has he regained his confidence ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio 's own goal complicates the tie with zenit the sort of own goal lucio scored seldom happens under normal circumstances .
we are a real team , and we stand behind lucio .
if we did not support him then we would not be a team because the idea of unity would be absent .
lucio is extremely motivated , just like we all are and our combined purpose is the welfare of the team - not the honoring or castigating of individuals .
you have never played as continuously throughout a season as you have during this campaign .
how are you feeling ?
everything is going well .
i 'm surprised myself to have played so often , but i have remained free of injuries and from health problems .
it is a very positive thing to feel so physically and emotionally fit at the end of the season .
has it been a difficult season ?
one does not experience a season of challenges like this every year , maybe once every three or five years .
it is nice to be in this position where we are playing for three trophies which we want to win .
we have the german cup , the league championship is very close - we only need one more point - and we have a great chance in the uefa cup .
we have talked a lot about this and our coach ottmar hitzfeld has gone over with us many times how special this is .
this is something great we are creating , something that is very special and that motivates us .
in spite of the tiredness ?
yes .
this motivation , these big challenges help us to overcome the tiredness .
we are concentrating very much and the bones and muscles will stay strong because we stand on the brink of a historical event .
at the age of 33 , do you feel the demands of the three different competitions greater than others ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ze roberto 's body tells him when he 's in need of a break yes , i feel the demands even more intensely today than i did when i was 25 years old or 20 .
as i said , i feel good , but my body lets me know when i need a break .
on the other hand , my experience as a player helps .
i know better what i need to do to recover .
i hear my body , i count on my experience and i think more like a professional than i did when i was younger .
only thinking like this has allowed me to play longer at this high level .
is this bayern munich team the best you have ever played for ?
no , the best team was the national team of brazil .
now if the question refers to club level , i must answer with a very strong " yes . "
this team , bayern munich , is fantastic .
we are very strong as a group and we have in the players who can make a difference in every game .
to be allowed to play with ribery , luca toni or klose is very motivating .

the club 's brazilian defender ze roberto tells dw-world.de what motivates the bavarian giants . dw-world.de : ze roberto , let 's talk about the coming game with zenit st. petersburg .
can bayern munich make it to the uefa cup final ?
how high are the chances ?
ze roberto : we have a big chance to reach the final in spite of the result from the first leg of the semi-final at home .
we can win and want to win in st. petersburg .
we are on a good run and have had some luck on our side .
this luck may have helped in the bundesliga and maybe even in the uefa cup , if you consider the crazy game against getafe , but can you count on it ?
the games in europe are very different from the ones played in the bundesliga or the german cup .
in the uefa cup you have a lot of teams which are not seen as being the biggest in europe but are nevertheless very strong and have a lot of quality .
they want to win this title .
the problem has been for us the games at home , such as against getafe and last week against zenit .
can you explain why the results have been so close and the ties so complicated when bayern has the potential to get a result quickly and more clearly ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ze roberto is at a loss to explain why bayern fade we have recently had two types of halves in these games .
in the first half we are normally dominant , aggressive and determined .
in the second half , though , we have been unable to maintain that level .
i ca n't explain why .
maybe after so many games we are tired .
but the fact is , unfortunately , it is in the second half that we often give things away .
but to get to the final of the uefa cup , the team must be able to maintain that first half level of dominance for the whole 90 minutes .
that 's right .
we plan to perform for the whole game in st. petersburg at the level we showed in the first half of the game against zenit in munich .
is it a mental problem that the team can not maintain such a high level for the whole game ?
it is a primarily a psychological problem and also a physical problem with tiredness .
nevertheless , we always come out of the dressing room with the vision of victory in our heads , regardless of who our opponent is .
lucio was the unlucky figure last week in the first game against zenit - his own goal gave st. petersburg the draw and set up the nervous match in russia .
does the team stand behind him ?
has he regained his confidence ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio 's own goal complicates the tie with zenit the sort of own goal lucio scored seldom happens under normal circumstances .
we are a real team , and we stand behind lucio .
if we did not support him then we would not be a team because the idea of unity would be absent .
lucio is extremely motivated , just like we all are and our combined purpose is the welfare of the team - not the honoring or castigating of individuals .
you have never played as continuously throughout a season as you have during this campaign .
how are you feeling ?
everything is going well .
i 'm surprised myself to have played so often , but i have remained free of injuries and from health problems .
it is a very positive thing to feel so physically and emotionally fit at the end of the season .
has it been a difficult season ?
one does not experience a season of challenges like this every year , maybe once every three or five years .
it is nice to be in this position where we are playing for three trophies which we want to win .
we have the german cup , the league championship is very close - we only need one more point - and we have a great chance in the uefa cup .
we have talked a lot about this and our coach ottmar hitzfeld has gone over with us many times how special this is .
this is something great we are creating , something that is very special and that motivates us .
in spite of the tiredness ?
yes .
this motivation , these big challenges help us to overcome the tiredness .
we are concentrating very much and the bones and muscles will stay strong because we stand on the brink of a historical event .
at the age of 33 , do you feel the demands of the three different competitions greater than others ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ze roberto 's body tells him when he 's in need of a break yes , i feel the demands even more intensely today than i did when i was 25 years old or 20 .
as i said , i feel good , but my body lets me know when i need a break .
on the other hand , my experience as a player helps .
i know better what i need to do to recover .
i hear my body , i count on my experience and i think more like a professional than i did when i was younger .
only thinking like this has allowed me to play longer at this high level .
is this bayern munich team the best you have ever played for ?
no , the best team was the national team of brazil .
now if the question refers to club level , i must answer with a very strong " yes . "
this team , bayern munich , is fantastic .
we are very strong as a group and we have in the players who can make a difference in every game .
to be allowed to play with ribery , luca toni or klose is very motivating .

maybe after so many games we are tired .
but the fact is , unfortunately , it is in the second half that we often give things away .
but to get to the final of the uefa cup , the team must be able to maintain that first half level of dominance for the whole 90 minutes .
that 's right .
we plan to perform for the whole game in st. petersburg at the level we showed in the first half of the game against zenit in munich .
is it a mental problem that the team can not maintain such a high level for the whole game ?
it is a primarily a psychological problem and also a physical problem with tiredness .
nevertheless , we always come out of the dressing room with the vision of victory in our heads , regardless of who our opponent is .
lucio was the unlucky figure last week in the first game against zenit - his own goal gave st. petersburg the draw and set up the nervous match in russia .
does the team stand behind him ?
has he regained his confidence ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio 's own goal complicates the tie with zenit the sort of own goal lucio scored seldom happens under normal circumstances .
we are a real team , and we stand behind lucio .
if we did not support him then we would not be a team because the idea of unity would be absent .
lucio is extremely motivated , just like we all are and our combined purpose is the welfare of the team - not the honoring or castigating of individuals .
you have never played as continuously throughout a season as you have during this campaign .
how are you feeling ?
everything is going well .
i 'm surprised myself to have played so often , but i have remained free of injuries and from health problems .
it is a very positive thing to feel so physically and emotionally fit at the end of the season .
has it been a difficult season ?
one does not experience a season of challenges like this every year , maybe once every three or five years .
it is nice to be in this position where we are playing for three trophies which we want to win .
we have the german cup , the league championship is very close - we only need one more point - and we have a great chance in the uefa cup .
we have talked a lot about this and our coach ottmar hitzfeld has gone over with us many times how special this is .
this is something great we are creating , something that is very special and that motivates us .
in spite of the tiredness ?
yes .
this motivation , these big challenges help us to overcome the tiredness .
we are concentrating very much and the bones and muscles will stay strong because we stand on the brink of a historical event .
at the age of 33 , do you feel the demands of the three different competitions greater than others ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ze roberto 's body tells him when he 's in need of a break yes , i feel the demands even more intensely today than i did when i was 25 years old or 20 .
as i said , i feel good , but my body lets me know when i need a break .
on the other hand , my experience as a player helps .
i know better what i need to do to recover .
i hear my body , i count on my experience and i think more like a professional than i did when i was younger .
only thinking like this has allowed me to play longer at this high level .
is this bayern munich team the best you have ever played for ?
no , the best team was the national team of brazil .
now if the question refers to club level , i must answer with a very strong " yes . "
this team , bayern munich , is fantastic .
we are very strong as a group and we have in the players who can make a difference in every game .
to be allowed to play with ribery , luca toni or klose is very motivating .
there is always the desire to win everything .

the club 's brazilian defender ze roberto tells dw-world.de what motivates the bavarian giants . dw-world.de : ze roberto , let 's talk about the coming game with zenit st. petersburg .
can bayern munich make it to the uefa cup final ?
how high are the chances ?
ze roberto : we have a big chance to reach the final in spite of the result from the first leg of the semi-final at home .
we can win and want to win in st. petersburg .
we are on a good run and have had some luck on our side .
this luck may have helped in the bundesliga and maybe even in the uefa cup , if you consider the crazy game against getafe , but can you count on it ?
the games in europe are very different from the ones played in the bundesliga or the german cup .
in the uefa cup you have a lot of teams which are not seen as being the biggest in europe but are nevertheless very strong and have a lot of quality .
they want to win this title .
the problem has been for us the games at home , such as against getafe and last week against zenit .
can you explain why the results have been so close and the ties so complicated when bayern has the potential to get a result quickly and more clearly ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ze roberto is at a loss to explain why bayern fade we have recently had two types of halves in these games .
in the first half we are normally dominant , aggressive and determined .
in the second half , though , we have been unable to maintain that level .
i ca n't explain why .
maybe after so many games we are tired .
but the fact is , unfortunately , it is in the second half that we often give things away .

we can no longer be sure that recourse to history books will address israel 's particular situation and the special relationship between israel and germany comprehensibly enough for young people .
that 's why i think it 's important for younger generations in particular to look at israel 's multifaceted literature . it 's literature that is not characterized by pessimism or depression .

db owns rail companies outside germany and is also a major road transport operator within germany .
the heads of the two parties in merkel 's coalition agreed monday on selling off a stake in the passenger and freight services , while retaining the railtracks , stations , power generation and signaling in state hands .
estimates on the value of the 24.9-per-cent stake in passenger and freight services run to around 6 billion euros -lsb- $ 9.5 billion -rsb- .
the issue provoked months of debate within the broad coalition government , comprising merkel 's conservative christian cdu / csu bloc and its traditional rival , the social democrats -lsb- spd -rsb- .
the spd conceded ground in the debate , backing away from a proposal to sell the db stake as " people 's shares . "
instead , the offering is expected to go to big institutions , with some shares being sold to rail employees .

db , which has 237,000 employees , has reached a pre-privatization accord with unions ruling out layoffs for the next 15 years .

after 63 years , the shock of the holocaust remains chilling , ehud olmert said . as the sirens began at 10 a.m. local time -lrb- 0800 gmt -rrb- , traffic came to a total standstill as drivers stood next to their cars and pedestrians stopped walking , many of them standing to attention or with their heads bowed . holocaust memorial day began wednesday night with a ceremony at jerusalem 's yad vashem holocaust memorial institute , attended by state leaders , foreign diplomats , and holocaust survivors and their relatives . six survivors lit six beacons honoring the 6 million jews killed by the nazis and their collaborators . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ceremonies were held at jerusalem 's yad vashem holocaust memorial institute " sixty-three years have passed since the satanic factories of death of the nazis and their collaborators ceased to operate , yet with the passing of time , the dimensions of the holocaust still remain beyond comprehension , unfathomably shocking , unacceptably chilling , " prime minister ehud olmert said at the ceremony . " who would have believed that 63 years later , hatred of jews and israelis would rear its ugly head in so many different places around the globe , provocatively and venomously , inciting hatred ? " he asked .
" the voices of those who deny the holocaust are also being heard .
to them , the haters , the deniers , and all the conspirators of evil and to all of those who allow them to function within their realms , we say today : this shall never happen again . " in a second thinly veiled comparison of nazi germany to contemporary iran , israeli president shimon peres told the hundreds of holocaust survivors and other israelis at a yad vashem ceremony on wednesday that the world could have faced destruction if nazi dictator adolf hitler had succeeded in acquiring nuclear weapons . commemorations continue thursday with ceremonies at yad vashem and television and radio channels broadcasting special programs focusing on the nazi attempt to murder the jews of europe . the names of the victims will be read out at the knesset and at yad vashem 's hall of remembrance . the united nations has designated jan .
27 , the day the auschwitz death camp was liberated in 1945 , as international holocaust remembrance day , but israel has traditionally marked it on the 27th day of the jewish month of nissan , one week before independence day , to symbolize the birth of the jewish state from the ashes of the holocaust . according to counts held before and after the war , two-thirds of europe 's 9 million jews perished at the hands of the nazis and their collaborators . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he said she had taught him patience . european leaders gathered in the german city of aachen on thursday , may 1 , to pay tribute to merkel 's contributions to european unity . for her part , merkel reminded europeans of the progress the continent has made . " after centuries of violent confrontations , we have created what once could hardly have been imagined - peaceful and friendly cooperation in europe , " she said in her speech , adding that europe could serve as a model for other regions . addressing her as " dear angela " in a speech of eulogy , sarkozy said , " she has taught me that hope requires time -lsb- to work -rsb- . " mutual compliments continued when merkel replied in french , thanking sarkozy " from her heart " and praising his " adeptness and honesty " in winning office as president a year ago and " leading france back into the heart of the european union . " " too beautiful and too fair " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we are the future of europe " supporters proclaimed while merkel received her award sarkozy added that paris and berlin would have to work together to push the european union forward , adding that europe is " too beautiful and too fair of an idea to be an idea only for the elite . " the annual award , in the historic town hall of the western german city , honored merkel for mediating a solution to the political crisis in the eu last year that led to the eu reform treaty called the treaty of lisbon . at a church service that began the day 's festivities , the catholic bishop of aachen , heinrich mussinghoff , criticized the reform treaty 's silence about religion . he said the fundamental document should have expressly mentioned both the judeo-christian heritage of europe and the role of islam . among those on the guest list thursday were dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende , belgian prime minister yves leterme , luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker and king juan carlos of spain . the european leadership prize , awarded since 1950 in aachen , a near the belgian and french border , is named after the emperor charlemagne -lrb- 768-814 -rrb- who united a vast region of europe from france to northern germany . the prize comprises a cash award of 5,000 euros -lrb- $ 7,700 -rrb- and a medal .

the club 's brazilian defender ze roberto tells dw-world.de what motivates the bavarian giants . dw-world.de : ze roberto , let 's talk about the coming game with zenit st. petersburg .
can bayern munich make it to the uefa cup final ?
how high are the chances ?
ze roberto : we have a big chance to reach the final in spite of the result from the first leg of the semi-final at home .
we can win and want to win in st. petersburg .
we are on a good run and have had some luck on our side .
this luck may have helped in the bundesliga and maybe even in the uefa cup , if you consider the crazy game against getafe , but can you count on it ?
the games in europe are very different from the ones played in the bundesliga or the german cup .
in the uefa cup you have a lot of teams which are not seen as being the biggest in europe but are nevertheless very strong and have a lot of quality .
they want to win this title .
the problem has been for us the games at home , such as against getafe and last week against zenit .
can you explain why the results have been so close and the ties so complicated when bayern has the potential to get a result quickly and more clearly ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ze roberto is at a loss to explain why bayern fade we have recently had two types of halves in these games .
in the first half we are normally dominant , aggressive and determined .
in the second half , though , we have been unable to maintain that level .
i ca n't explain why .
maybe after so many games we are tired .
but the fact is , unfortunately , it is in the second half that we often give things away .
but to get to the final of the uefa cup , the team must be able to maintain that first half level of dominance for the whole 90 minutes .
that 's right .
we plan to perform for the whole game in st. petersburg at the level we showed in the first half of the game against zenit in munich .
is it a mental problem that the team can not maintain such a high level for the whole game ?
it is a primarily a psychological problem and also a physical problem with tiredness .
nevertheless , we always come out of the dressing room with the vision of victory in our heads , regardless of who our opponent is .
lucio was the unlucky figure last week in the first game against zenit - his own goal gave st. petersburg the draw and set up the nervous match in russia .
does the team stand behind him ?
has he regained his confidence ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio 's own goal complicates the tie with zenit the sort of own goal lucio scored seldom happens under normal circumstances .
we are a real team , and we stand behind lucio .
if we did not support him then we would not be a team because the idea of unity would be absent .
lucio is extremely motivated , just like we all are and our combined purpose is the welfare of the team - not the honoring or castigating of individuals .
you have never played as continuously throughout a season as you have during this campaign .
how are you feeling ?
everything is going well .
i 'm surprised myself to have played so often , but i have remained free of injuries and from health problems .
it is a very positive thing to feel so physically and emotionally fit at the end of the season .
has it been a difficult season ?
one does not experience a season of challenges like this every year , maybe once every three or five years .
it is nice to be in this position where we are playing for three trophies which we want to win .
we have the german cup , the league championship is very close - we only need one more point - and we have a great chance in the uefa cup .
we have talked a lot about this and our coach ottmar hitzfeld has gone over with us many times how special this is .
this is something great we are creating , something that is very special and that motivates us .
in spite of the tiredness ?
yes .
this motivation , these big challenges help us to overcome the tiredness .
we are concentrating very much and the bones and muscles will stay strong because we stand on the brink of a historical event .
at the age of 33 , do you feel the demands of the three different competitions greater than others ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ze roberto 's body tells him when he 's in need of a break yes , i feel the demands even more intensely today than i did when i was 25 years old or 20 .
as i said , i feel good , but my body lets me know when i need a break .
on the other hand , my experience as a player helps .
i know better what i need to do to recover .
i hear my body , i count on my experience and i think more like a professional than i did when i was younger .
only thinking like this has allowed me to play longer at this high level .
is this bayern munich team the best you have ever played for ?
no , the best team was the national team of brazil .
now if the question refers to club level , i must answer with a very strong " yes . "
this team , bayern munich , is fantastic .
we are very strong as a group and we have in the players who can make a difference in every game .
to be allowed to play with ribery , luca toni or klose is very motivating .

the club 's brazilian defender ze roberto tells dw-world.de what motivates the bavarian giants . dw-world.de : ze roberto , let 's talk about the coming game with zenit st. petersburg .
can bayern munich make it to the uefa cup final ?
how high are the chances ?
ze roberto : we have a big chance to reach the final in spite of the result from the first leg of the semi-final at home .
we can win and want to win in st. petersburg .
we are on a good run and have had some luck on our side .
this luck may have helped in the bundesliga and maybe even in the uefa cup , if you consider the crazy game against getafe , but can you count on it ?
the games in europe are very different from the ones played in the bundesliga or the german cup .
in the uefa cup you have a lot of teams which are not seen as being the biggest in europe but are nevertheless very strong and have a lot of quality .
they want to win this title .
the problem has been for us the games at home , such as against getafe and last week against zenit .
can you explain why the results have been so close and the ties so complicated when bayern has the potential to get a result quickly and more clearly ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ze roberto is at a loss to explain why bayern fade we have recently had two types of halves in these games .
in the first half we are normally dominant , aggressive and determined .
in the second half , though , we have been unable to maintain that level .
i ca n't explain why .
maybe after so many games we are tired .
but the fact is , unfortunately , it is in the second half that we often give things away .
but to get to the final of the uefa cup , the team must be able to maintain that first half level of dominance for the whole 90 minutes .
that 's right .
we plan to perform for the whole game in st. petersburg at the level we showed in the first half of the game against zenit in munich .
is it a mental problem that the team can not maintain such a high level for the whole game ?
it is a primarily a psychological problem and also a physical problem with tiredness .
nevertheless , we always come out of the dressing room with the vision of victory in our heads , regardless of who our opponent is .
lucio was the unlucky figure last week in the first game against zenit - his own goal gave st. petersburg the draw and set up the nervous match in russia .
does the team stand behind him ?
has he regained his confidence ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio 's own goal complicates the tie with zenit the sort of own goal lucio scored seldom happens under normal circumstances .
we are a real team , and we stand behind lucio .
if we did not support him then we would not be a team because the idea of unity would be absent .
lucio is extremely motivated , just like we all are and our combined purpose is the welfare of the team - not the honoring or castigating of individuals .
you have never played as continuously throughout a season as you have during this campaign .
how are you feeling ?
everything is going well .
i 'm surprised myself to have played so often , but i have remained free of injuries and from health problems .
it is a very positive thing to feel so physically and emotionally fit at the end of the season .
has it been a difficult season ?
one does not experience a season of challenges like this every year , maybe once every three or five years .
it is nice to be in this position where we are playing for three trophies which we want to win .
we have the german cup , the league championship is very close - we only need one more point - and we have a great chance in the uefa cup .
we have talked a lot about this and our coach ottmar hitzfeld has gone over with us many times how special this is .
this is something great we are creating , something that is very special and that motivates us .
in spite of the tiredness ?
yes .
this motivation , these big challenges help us to overcome the tiredness .
we are concentrating very much and the bones and muscles will stay strong because we stand on the brink of a historical event .
at the age of 33 , do you feel the demands of the three different competitions greater than others ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ze roberto 's body tells him when he 's in need of a break yes , i feel the demands even more intensely today than i did when i was 25 years old or 20 .
as i said , i feel good , but my body lets me know when i need a break .
on the other hand , my experience as a player helps .
i know better what i need to do to recover .
i hear my body , i count on my experience and i think more like a professional than i did when i was younger .
only thinking like this has allowed me to play longer at this high level .
is this bayern munich team the best you have ever played for ?
no , the best team was the national team of brazil .
now if the question refers to club level , i must answer with a very strong " yes . "
this team , bayern munich , is fantastic .
we are very strong as a group and we have in the players who can make a difference in every game .

georgian officials said the move is the start of military aggression against tbilisi . the soldiers " are completing their deployment at their positions in the tkvarcheli district of abkhazia , " russia 's three main news agencies quoted the russian defense ministry press office as saying . troops were setting up camp , defenses and communications , the itar-tass , ria novosti and interfax agencies all reported . russian officials have still not released information on exactly how many additional troops are being sent to the separatist georgian region to bolster the more than 2,000 soldiers already there .
the russians are deployed under accords ending the separatist war between georgia and the abkhaz minority in the early 1990s . the defense ministry stressed that the " total number of russian peacekeepers does not exceed the numerical limits agreed under international agreements , " the agencies reported . concern in european union russia 's move , to counter what it said was the massing of georgian troops near abkhazia and south ossetia , raised concern in the united states while the european union has said that any military build-up would not be wise . " the steps that have been taken -lsb- by russia -rsb- and the rhetoric that has been used concerning the threat of force have increased tensions and have undermined georgia 's territorial integrity , " nato spokesman james appathurai said on wednesday . " the allies are unanimous in supporting , endorsing georgia 's territorial integrity and will not recognize or support steps that undermine that sovereignty , " he said . nato announced at a summit early this month that georgia would one day become a member of the 26-nation military alliance , in the face of fierce russian opposition . russia objects to nato moving closer to its borders and is deeply concerned that the breakaway regions could be destabilized by tbilisi 's rapprochement with moscow 's old cold war-era foe . georgia claims that russia has , over the last three months , strengthened its control over abkhazia and established direct ties with the local authorities . the russian peacekeeping announcement only fuelled problems , said president mikheil saakashvili 's new " special representative " and top georgian diplomat , david bakradze . georgians reject russia 's peacekeeping claim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the build-up in the rebel regions is causing tensions " it 's hard to believe that this is being done for the purposes of peacekeeping , it 's rather the beginning of full-scale military aggression , " he told reporters .
" the georgian side , as the host country , should be notified in advance and there should be consent from georgia on any troop deployment , including peacekeepers .
we have not been notified . " " peacekeeping is not strengthened by unilateral steps . " russia has peacekeepers in abkhazia and south ossetia under an agreement with georgia from the 1990s following wars in which separatists broke away and established close ties with moscow . the russian defense ministry did not say how many extra soldiers were being sent , but said that 15 new observation posts would be set up on the frontline in abkhazia .
around 2,000 russians serve there and a further 1,000 in south ossetia . " any attempt by the georgian side to resolve the conflicts with force against russian peacekeepers and also against russian citizens ... will be met with an adequate and tough answer , " news agencies quoted the ministry as saying . no plans revealed for georgia action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia has not revealed any plans to retaliate as the rhetoric escalated , appathurai said that neither russia nor georgia had informed the military alliance of any plans to actually move their forces , although he said moscow could " technically " do so without notifying nato . but he said : " have no doubt ; everyone is watching very carefully what is happening on the ground . " bakradze said that a un mission monitoring georgia and abhkazia , unomig , " verifies everything " in terms of his country 's military deployments .
" if there is something on our side , it will immediately be known , " he said , adding : " we 're not going to move troops . " in a statement on april 21 , unomig said that its monitors " did not observe anything to substantiate reports of a build-up of forces on either side . " nato and georgian officials have confirmed that alliance ambassadors , in the so-called north atlantic council , will travel to georgia in " coming months " in a show of support for the would-be candidate . georgia attempts to defuse situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president saakashvili called for an end to the conflict georgia appeared to be attempting to prevent the dispute with russia from further escalating with president mikhail saakashvili saying that the country sought an end to the conflict . in a televised address to the people of abkhazia and south ossetia , saakashvili said : " georgia wants peace . " earlier wednesday , georgia attacked russia 's plans to boost peacekeeping troops in the two breakaway georgian regions as the start of " full scale military aggression . " the georgian foreign ministry called the plan an " act of irresponsible provocation , " russian news agency interfax reported . the remarks came after russia 's defense ministry announced tuesday an increase in peacekeeping forces to abkhazia and south ossetia in response to what it called aggressive moves by pro-western georgia . " if georgia puts in place the threats it has made on a number of occasions about the use of force , we would be forced to take retaliatory measures to protect the lives of our citizens , " russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said . eu criticize russian deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana is suspicious of the motives for the deployment the eu leaders called for calm , with eu foreign policy chief javier solana saying that the bloc would like to " de-escalate the tension . " abkhazia and south ossetia are both russian-dominated regions of georgia which fought brief separatist wars in the early 1990s and which still reject tbilisi 's rule . the georgian authorities insist that the two regions are its sovereign territory and accuse moscow of supporting the rebels .
most inhabitants of the two regions hold russian passports . in the light of rising tensions between georgia and its two regions over the past week , russia decided on tuesday to send more peacekeeping troops into the breakaway provinces . that decision was " not wise , " even if it was in line with peace agreements , solana said . osce leaders express concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the members of the osce have expressed concern finland , current chair of the 56-nation organization for security and cooperation in europe -lsb- ocse -rsb- expressed concern wednesday over " increased tension " in georgia . finnish foreign minister alexander stubb issued a statement repeating previous concern over moscow 's decision to establish ties with two breakaway regions in georgia . stubb said the april 20 downing of georgian drone over abkhazia " and the recent military build-up have considerably increased tension in the region . " he said he had telephoned president saakashvili and foreign minister lavrov as part of attempts to avert further escalation . the osce was prepared to aid the peace process and supported the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia within its internationally recognized borders , the statement said . dw staff / dpa / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

georgian officials said the move is the start of military aggression against tbilisi . the soldiers " are completing their deployment at their positions in the tkvarcheli district of abkhazia , " russia 's three main news agencies quoted the russian defense ministry press office as saying . troops were setting up camp , defenses and communications , the itar-tass , ria novosti and interfax agencies all reported . russian officials have still not released information on exactly how many additional troops are being sent to the separatist georgian region to bolster the more than 2,000 soldiers already there .
the russians are deployed under accords ending the separatist war between georgia and the abkhaz minority in the early 1990s . the defense ministry stressed that the " total number of russian peacekeepers does not exceed the numerical limits agreed under international agreements , " the agencies reported . concern in european union russia 's move , to counter what it said was the massing of georgian troops near abkhazia and south ossetia , raised concern in the united states while the european union has said that any military build-up would not be wise . " the steps that have been taken -lsb- by russia -rsb- and the rhetoric that has been used concerning the threat of force have increased tensions and have undermined georgia 's territorial integrity , " nato spokesman james appathurai said on wednesday . " the allies are unanimous in supporting , endorsing georgia 's territorial integrity and will not recognize or support steps that undermine that sovereignty , " he said . nato announced at a summit early this month that georgia would one day become a member of the 26-nation military alliance , in the face of fierce russian opposition . russia objects to nato moving closer to its borders and is deeply concerned that the breakaway regions could be destabilized by tbilisi 's rapprochement with moscow 's old cold war-era foe . georgia claims that russia has , over the last three months , strengthened its control over abkhazia and established direct ties with the local authorities . the russian peacekeeping announcement only fuelled problems , said president mikheil saakashvili 's new " special representative " and top georgian diplomat , david bakradze . georgians reject russia 's peacekeeping claim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the build-up in the rebel regions is causing tensions " it 's hard to believe that this is being done for the purposes of peacekeeping , it 's rather the beginning of full-scale military aggression , " he told reporters .
" the georgian side , as the host country , should be notified in advance and there should be consent from georgia on any troop deployment , including peacekeepers .
we have not been notified . " " peacekeeping is not strengthened by unilateral steps . " russia has peacekeepers in abkhazia and south ossetia under an agreement with georgia from the 1990s following wars in which separatists broke away and established close ties with moscow . the russian defense ministry did not say how many extra soldiers were being sent , but said that 15 new observation posts would be set up on the frontline in abkhazia .
around 2,000 russians serve there and a further 1,000 in south ossetia . " any attempt by the georgian side to resolve the conflicts with force against russian peacekeepers and also against russian citizens ... will be met with an adequate and tough answer , " news agencies quoted the ministry as saying . no plans revealed for georgia action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia has not revealed any plans to retaliate as the rhetoric escalated , appathurai said that neither russia nor georgia had informed the military alliance of any plans to actually move their forces , although he said moscow could " technically " do so without notifying nato . but he said : " have no doubt ; everyone is watching very carefully what is happening on the ground . " bakradze said that a un mission monitoring georgia and abhkazia , unomig , " verifies everything " in terms of his country 's military deployments .
" if there is something on our side , it will immediately be known , " he said , adding : " we 're not going to move troops . " in a statement on april 21 , unomig said that its monitors " did not observe anything to substantiate reports of a build-up of forces on either side . " nato and georgian officials have confirmed that alliance ambassadors , in the so-called north atlantic council , will travel to georgia in " coming months " in a show of support for the would-be candidate . georgia attempts to defuse situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president saakashvili called for an end to the conflict georgia appeared to be attempting to prevent the dispute with russia from further escalating with president mikhail saakashvili saying that the country sought an end to the conflict . in a televised address to the people of abkhazia and south ossetia , saakashvili said : " georgia wants peace . " earlier wednesday , georgia attacked russia 's plans to boost peacekeeping troops in the two breakaway georgian regions as the start of " full scale military aggression . " the georgian foreign ministry called the plan an " act of irresponsible provocation , " russian news agency interfax reported . the remarks came after russia 's defense ministry announced tuesday an increase in peacekeeping forces to abkhazia and south ossetia in response to what it called aggressive moves by pro-western georgia . " if georgia puts in place the threats it has made on a number of occasions about the use of force , we would be forced to take retaliatory measures to protect the lives of our citizens , " russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said . eu criticize russian deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana is suspicious of the motives for the deployment the eu leaders called for calm , with eu foreign policy chief javier solana saying that the bloc would like to " de-escalate the tension . " abkhazia and south ossetia are both russian-dominated regions of georgia which fought brief separatist wars in the early 1990s and which still reject tbilisi 's rule . the georgian authorities insist that the two regions are its sovereign territory and accuse moscow of supporting the rebels .
most inhabitants of the two regions hold russian passports . in the light of rising tensions between georgia and its two regions over the past week , russia decided on tuesday to send more peacekeeping troops into the breakaway provinces . that decision was " not wise , " even if it was in line with peace agreements , solana said . osce leaders express concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the members of the osce have expressed concern finland , current chair of the 56-nation organization for security and cooperation in europe -lsb- ocse -rsb- expressed concern wednesday over " increased tension " in georgia . finnish foreign minister alexander stubb issued a statement repeating previous concern over moscow 's decision to establish ties with two breakaway regions in georgia . stubb said the april 20 downing of georgian drone over abkhazia " and the recent military build-up have considerably increased tension in the region . " he said he had telephoned president saakashvili and foreign minister lavrov as part of attempts to avert further escalation . the osce was prepared to aid the peace process and supported the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia within its internationally recognized borders , the statement said . dw staff / dpa / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the russians are deployed under accords ending the separatist war between georgia and the abkhaz minority in the early 1990s . the defense ministry stressed that the " total number of russian peacekeepers does not exceed the numerical limits agreed under international agreements , " the agencies reported . concern in european union russia 's move , to counter what it said was the massing of georgian troops near abkhazia and south ossetia , raised concern in the united states while the european union has said that any military build-up would not be wise . " the steps that have been taken -lsb- by russia -rsb- and the rhetoric that has been used concerning the threat of force have increased tensions and have undermined georgia 's territorial integrity , " nato spokesman james appathurai said on wednesday . " the allies are unanimous in supporting , endorsing georgia 's territorial integrity and will not recognize or support steps that undermine that sovereignty , " he said . nato announced at a summit early this month that georgia would one day become a member of the 26-nation military alliance , in the face of fierce russian opposition . russia objects to nato moving closer to its borders and is deeply concerned that the breakaway regions could be destabilized by tbilisi 's rapprochement with moscow 's old cold war-era foe . georgia claims that russia has , over the last three months , strengthened its control over abkhazia and established direct ties with the local authorities . the russian peacekeeping announcement only fuelled problems , said president mikheil saakashvili 's new " special representative " and top georgian diplomat , david bakradze . georgians reject russia 's peacekeeping claim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the build-up in the rebel regions is causing tensions " it 's hard to believe that this is being done for the purposes of peacekeeping , it 's rather the beginning of full-scale military aggression , " he told reporters .
" the georgian side , as the host country , should be notified in advance and there should be consent from georgia on any troop deployment , including peacekeepers .
we have not been notified . " " peacekeeping is not strengthened by unilateral steps . " russia has peacekeepers in abkhazia and south ossetia under an agreement with georgia from the 1990s following wars in which separatists broke away and established close ties with moscow . the russian defense ministry did not say how many extra soldiers were being sent , but said that 15 new observation posts would be set up on the frontline in abkhazia .
around 2,000 russians serve there and a further 1,000 in south ossetia . " any attempt by the georgian side to resolve the conflicts with force against russian peacekeepers and also against russian citizens ... will be met with an adequate and tough answer , " news agencies quoted the ministry as saying . no plans revealed for georgia action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia has not revealed any plans to retaliate as the rhetoric escalated , appathurai said that neither russia nor georgia had informed the military alliance of any plans to actually move their forces , although he said moscow could " technically " do so without notifying nato . but he said : " have no doubt ; everyone is watching very carefully what is happening on the ground . " bakradze said that a un mission monitoring georgia and abhkazia , unomig , " verifies everything " in terms of his country 's military deployments .
" if there is something on our side , it will immediately be known , " he said , adding : " we 're not going to move troops . " in a statement on april 21 , unomig said that its monitors " did not observe anything to substantiate reports of a build-up of forces on either side . " nato and georgian officials have confirmed that alliance ambassadors , in the so-called north atlantic council , will travel to georgia in " coming months " in a show of support for the would-be candidate . georgia attempts to defuse situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president saakashvili called for an end to the conflict georgia appeared to be attempting to prevent the dispute with russia from further escalating with president mikhail saakashvili saying that the country sought an end to the conflict . in a televised address to the people of abkhazia and south ossetia , saakashvili said : " georgia wants peace . " earlier wednesday , georgia attacked russia 's plans to boost peacekeeping troops in the two breakaway georgian regions as the start of " full scale military aggression . " the georgian foreign ministry called the plan an " act of irresponsible provocation , " russian news agency interfax reported . the remarks came after russia 's defense ministry announced tuesday an increase in peacekeeping forces to abkhazia and south ossetia in response to what it called aggressive moves by pro-western georgia . " if georgia puts in place the threats it has made on a number of occasions about the use of force , we would be forced to take retaliatory measures to protect the lives of our citizens , " russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said . eu criticize russian deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana is suspicious of the motives for the deployment the eu leaders called for calm , with eu foreign policy chief javier solana saying that the bloc would like to " de-escalate the tension . " abkhazia and south ossetia are both russian-dominated regions of georgia which fought brief separatist wars in the early 1990s and which still reject tbilisi 's rule . the georgian authorities insist that the two regions are its sovereign territory and accuse moscow of supporting the rebels .
most inhabitants of the two regions hold russian passports . in the light of rising tensions between georgia and its two regions over the past week , russia decided on tuesday to send more peacekeeping troops into the breakaway provinces . that decision was " not wise , " even if it was in line with peace agreements , solana said . osce leaders express concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the members of the osce have expressed concern finland , current chair of the 56-nation organization for security and cooperation in europe -lsb- ocse -rsb- expressed concern wednesday over " increased tension " in georgia . finnish foreign minister alexander stubb issued a statement repeating previous concern over moscow 's decision to establish ties with two breakaway regions in georgia . stubb said the april 20 downing of georgian drone over abkhazia " and the recent military build-up have considerably increased tension in the region . " he said he had telephoned president saakashvili and foreign minister lavrov as part of attempts to avert further escalation . the osce was prepared to aid the peace process and supported the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia within its internationally recognized borders , the statement said . dw staff / dpa / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

db owns rail companies outside germany and is also a major road transport operator within germany .
the heads of the two parties in merkel 's coalition agreed monday on selling off a stake in the passenger and freight services , while retaining the railtracks , stations , power generation and signaling in state hands .
estimates on the value of the 24.9-per-cent stake in passenger and freight services run to around 6 billion euros -lsb- $ 9.5 billion -rsb- .
the issue provoked months of debate within the broad coalition government , comprising merkel 's conservative christian cdu / csu bloc and its traditional rival , the social democrats -lsb- spd -rsb- .
the spd conceded ground in the debate , backing away from a proposal to sell the db stake as " people 's shares . "
instead , the offering is expected to go to big institutions , with some shares being sold to rail employees .
conservatives aim to double the stake bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel with deutsche bahn ceo hartmut mehdorn the cdu / csu hopes to later double the stake sold off to 49.9 percent , but still intends to retain the 34,000-kilometre track network in state hands .
db , which has 237,000 employees , has reached a pre-privatization accord with unions ruling out layoffs for the next 15 years .
berlin says two thirds of the money raised in the flotation will be channeled back into modernizing the tracks , shabby stations and building sound-barriers to cut acoustic pollution next to tracks .
details are to be set out in a future contract with db .
part of the remaining one third will end up in the general federal budget or be used to increase db 's general funds . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

db owns rail companies outside germany and is also a major road transport operator within germany .
the heads of the two parties in merkel 's coalition agreed monday on selling off a stake in the passenger and freight services , while retaining the railtracks , stations , power generation and signaling in state hands .
estimates on the value of the 24.9-per-cent stake in passenger and freight services run to around 6 billion euros -lsb- $ 9.5 billion -rsb- .
the issue provoked months of debate within the broad coalition government , comprising merkel 's conservative christian cdu / csu bloc and its traditional rival , the social democrats -lsb- spd -rsb- .
the spd conceded ground in the debate , backing away from a proposal to sell the db stake as " people 's shares . "
instead , the offering is expected to go to big institutions , with some shares being sold to rail employees .
conservatives aim to double the stake bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel with deutsche bahn ceo hartmut mehdorn the cdu / csu hopes to later double the stake sold off to 49.9 percent , but still intends to retain the 34,000-kilometre track network in state hands .
db , which has 237,000 employees , has reached a pre-privatization accord with unions ruling out layoffs for the next 15 years .
berlin says two thirds of the money raised in the flotation will be channeled back into modernizing the tracks , shabby stations and building sound-barriers to cut acoustic pollution next to tracks .
details are to be set out in a future contract with db .
part of the remaining one third will end up in the general federal budget or be used to increase db 's general funds . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" he asked .
" the voices of those who deny the holocaust are also being heard .
to them , the haters , the deniers , and all the conspirators of evil and to all of those who allow them to function within their realms , we say today : this shall never happen again . " in a second thinly veiled comparison of nazi germany to contemporary iran , israeli president shimon peres told the hundreds of holocaust survivors and other israelis at a yad vashem ceremony on wednesday that the world could have faced destruction if nazi dictator adolf hitler had succeeded in acquiring nuclear weapons . commemorations continue thursday with ceremonies at yad vashem and television and radio channels broadcasting special programs focusing on the nazi attempt to murder the jews of europe . the names of the victims will be read out at the knesset and at yad vashem 's hall of remembrance . the united nations has designated jan .

georgian officials said the move is the start of military aggression against tbilisi . the soldiers " are completing their deployment at their positions in the tkvarcheli district of abkhazia , " russia 's three main news agencies quoted the russian defense ministry press office as saying . troops were setting up camp , defenses and communications , the itar-tass , ria novosti and interfax agencies all reported . russian officials have still not released information on exactly how many additional troops are being sent to the separatist georgian region to bolster the more than 2,000 soldiers already there .
the russians are deployed under accords ending the separatist war between georgia and the abkhaz minority in the early 1990s . the defense ministry stressed that the " total number of russian peacekeepers does not exceed the numerical limits agreed under international agreements , " the agencies reported . concern in european union russia 's move , to counter what it said was the massing of georgian troops near abkhazia and south ossetia , raised concern in the united states while the european union has said that any military build-up would not be wise . " the steps that have been taken -lsb- by russia -rsb- and the rhetoric that has been used concerning the threat of force have increased tensions and have undermined georgia 's territorial integrity , " nato spokesman james appathurai said on wednesday . " the allies are unanimous in supporting , endorsing georgia 's territorial integrity and will not recognize or support steps that undermine that sovereignty , " he said . nato announced at a summit early this month that georgia would one day become a member of the 26-nation military alliance , in the face of fierce russian opposition . russia objects to nato moving closer to its borders and is deeply concerned that the breakaway regions could be destabilized by tbilisi 's rapprochement with moscow 's old cold war-era foe . georgia claims that russia has , over the last three months , strengthened its control over abkhazia and established direct ties with the local authorities . the russian peacekeeping announcement only fuelled problems , said president mikheil saakashvili 's new " special representative " and top georgian diplomat , david bakradze . georgians reject russia 's peacekeeping claim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the build-up in the rebel regions is causing tensions " it 's hard to believe that this is being done for the purposes of peacekeeping , it 's rather the beginning of full-scale military aggression , " he told reporters .
" the georgian side , as the host country , should be notified in advance and there should be consent from georgia on any troop deployment , including peacekeepers .
we have not been notified . " " peacekeeping is not strengthened by unilateral steps . " russia has peacekeepers in abkhazia and south ossetia under an agreement with georgia from the 1990s following wars in which separatists broke away and established close ties with moscow . the russian defense ministry did not say how many extra soldiers were being sent , but said that 15 new observation posts would be set up on the frontline in abkhazia .
around 2,000 russians serve there and a further 1,000 in south ossetia . " any attempt by the georgian side to resolve the conflicts with force against russian peacekeepers and also against russian citizens ... will be met with an adequate and tough answer , " news agencies quoted the ministry as saying . no plans revealed for georgia action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia has not revealed any plans to retaliate as the rhetoric escalated , appathurai said that neither russia nor georgia had informed the military alliance of any plans to actually move their forces , although he said moscow could " technically " do so without notifying nato . but he said : " have no doubt ; everyone is watching very carefully what is happening on the ground . " bakradze said that a un mission monitoring georgia and abhkazia , unomig , " verifies everything " in terms of his country 's military deployments .
" if there is something on our side , it will immediately be known , " he said , adding : " we 're not going to move troops . " in a statement on april 21 , unomig said that its monitors " did not observe anything to substantiate reports of a build-up of forces on either side . " nato and georgian officials have confirmed that alliance ambassadors , in the so-called north atlantic council , will travel to georgia in " coming months " in a show of support for the would-be candidate . georgia attempts to defuse situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president saakashvili called for an end to the conflict georgia appeared to be attempting to prevent the dispute with russia from further escalating with president mikhail saakashvili saying that the country sought an end to the conflict . in a televised address to the people of abkhazia and south ossetia , saakashvili said : " georgia wants peace . " earlier wednesday , georgia attacked russia 's plans to boost peacekeeping troops in the two breakaway georgian regions as the start of " full scale military aggression . " the georgian foreign ministry called the plan an " act of irresponsible provocation , " russian news agency interfax reported . the remarks came after russia 's defense ministry announced tuesday an increase in peacekeeping forces to abkhazia and south ossetia in response to what it called aggressive moves by pro-western georgia . " if georgia puts in place the threats it has made on a number of occasions about the use of force , we would be forced to take retaliatory measures to protect the lives of our citizens , " russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said . eu criticize russian deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana is suspicious of the motives for the deployment the eu leaders called for calm , with eu foreign policy chief javier solana saying that the bloc would like to " de-escalate the tension . " abkhazia and south ossetia are both russian-dominated regions of georgia which fought brief separatist wars in the early 1990s and which still reject tbilisi 's rule . the georgian authorities insist that the two regions are its sovereign territory and accuse moscow of supporting the rebels .
most inhabitants of the two regions hold russian passports . in the light of rising tensions between georgia and its two regions over the past week , russia decided on tuesday to send more peacekeeping troops into the breakaway provinces . that decision was " not wise , " even if it was in line with peace agreements , solana said . osce leaders express concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the members of the osce have expressed concern finland , current chair of the 56-nation organization for security and cooperation in europe -lsb- ocse -rsb- expressed concern wednesday over " increased tension " in georgia . finnish foreign minister alexander stubb issued a statement repeating previous concern over moscow 's decision to establish ties with two breakaway regions in georgia . stubb said the april 20 downing of georgian drone over abkhazia " and the recent military build-up have considerably increased tension in the region . " he said he had telephoned president saakashvili and foreign minister lavrov as part of attempts to avert further escalation . the osce was prepared to aid the peace process and supported the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia within its internationally recognized borders , the statement said . dw staff / dpa / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the club 's brazilian defender ze roberto tells dw-world.de what motivates the bavarian giants . dw-world.de : ze roberto , let 's talk about the coming game with zenit st. petersburg .
can bayern munich make it to the uefa cup final ?
how high are the chances ?
ze roberto : we have a big chance to reach the final in spite of the result from the first leg of the semi-final at home .
we can win and want to win in st. petersburg .
we are on a good run and have had some luck on our side .
this luck may have helped in the bundesliga and maybe even in the uefa cup , if you consider the crazy game against getafe , but can you count on it ?
the games in europe are very different from the ones played in the bundesliga or the german cup .
in the uefa cup you have a lot of teams which are not seen as being the biggest in europe but are nevertheless very strong and have a lot of quality .
they want to win this title .
the problem has been for us the games at home , such as against getafe and last week against zenit .
can you explain why the results have been so close and the ties so complicated when bayern has the potential to get a result quickly and more clearly ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ze roberto is at a loss to explain why bayern fade we have recently had two types of halves in these games .
in the first half we are normally dominant , aggressive and determined .
in the second half , though , we have been unable to maintain that level .
i ca n't explain why .
maybe after so many games we are tired .
but the fact is , unfortunately , it is in the second half that we often give things away .
but to get to the final of the uefa cup , the team must be able to maintain that first half level of dominance for the whole 90 minutes .
that 's right .
we plan to perform for the whole game in st. petersburg at the level we showed in the first half of the game against zenit in munich .
is it a mental problem that the team can not maintain such a high level for the whole game ?
it is a primarily a psychological problem and also a physical problem with tiredness .
nevertheless , we always come out of the dressing room with the vision of victory in our heads , regardless of who our opponent is .
lucio was the unlucky figure last week in the first game against zenit - his own goal gave st. petersburg the draw and set up the nervous match in russia .
does the team stand behind him ?
has he regained his confidence ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio 's own goal complicates the tie with zenit the sort of own goal lucio scored seldom happens under normal circumstances .
we are a real team , and we stand behind lucio .
if we did not support him then we would not be a team because the idea of unity would be absent .
lucio is extremely motivated , just like we all are and our combined purpose is the welfare of the team - not the honoring or castigating of individuals .
you have never played as continuously throughout a season as you have during this campaign .
how are you feeling ?
everything is going well .
i 'm surprised myself to have played so often , but i have remained free of injuries and from health problems .
it is a very positive thing to feel so physically and emotionally fit at the end of the season .
has it been a difficult season ?
one does not experience a season of challenges like this every year , maybe once every three or five years .
it is nice to be in this position where we are playing for three trophies which we want to win .
we have the german cup , the league championship is very close - we only need one more point - and we have a great chance in the uefa cup .
we have talked a lot about this and our coach ottmar hitzfeld has gone over with us many times how special this is .
this is something great we are creating , something that is very special and that motivates us .
in spite of the tiredness ?
yes .
this motivation , these big challenges help us to overcome the tiredness .
we are concentrating very much and the bones and muscles will stay strong because we stand on the brink of a historical event .
at the age of 33 , do you feel the demands of the three different competitions greater than others ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ze roberto 's body tells him when he 's in need of a break yes , i feel the demands even more intensely today than i did when i was 25 years old or 20 .
as i said , i feel good , but my body lets me know when i need a break .
on the other hand , my experience as a player helps .
i know better what i need to do to recover .
i hear my body , i count on my experience and i think more like a professional than i did when i was younger .
only thinking like this has allowed me to play longer at this high level .
is this bayern munich team the best you have ever played for ?
no , the best team was the national team of brazil .
now if the question refers to club level , i must answer with a very strong " yes . "
this team , bayern munich , is fantastic .
we are very strong as a group and we have in the players who can make a difference in every game .
to be allowed to play with ribery , luca toni or klose is very motivating .
there is always the desire to win everything .
this team emits such strength that we come to the stadium not only to play soccer , but also to defeat the opponent . daniel martinez interviewed ze roberto -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

georgian officials said the move is the start of military aggression against tbilisi . the soldiers " are completing their deployment at their positions in the tkvarcheli district of abkhazia , " russia 's three main news agencies quoted the russian defense ministry press office as saying . troops were setting up camp , defenses and communications , the itar-tass , ria novosti and interfax agencies all reported . russian officials have still not released information on exactly how many additional troops are being sent to the separatist georgian region to bolster the more than 2,000 soldiers already there .
the russians are deployed under accords ending the separatist war between georgia and the abkhaz minority in the early 1990s . the defense ministry stressed that the " total number of russian peacekeepers does not exceed the numerical limits agreed under international agreements , " the agencies reported . concern in european union russia 's move , to counter what it said was the massing of georgian troops near abkhazia and south ossetia , raised concern in the united states while the european union has said that any military build-up would not be wise . " the steps that have been taken -lsb- by russia -rsb- and the rhetoric that has been used concerning the threat of force have increased tensions and have undermined georgia 's territorial integrity , " nato spokesman james appathurai said on wednesday . " the allies are unanimous in supporting , endorsing georgia 's territorial integrity and will not recognize or support steps that undermine that sovereignty , " he said . nato announced at a summit early this month that georgia would one day become a member of the 26-nation military alliance , in the face of fierce russian opposition . russia objects to nato moving closer to its borders and is deeply concerned that the breakaway regions could be destabilized by tbilisi 's rapprochement with moscow 's old cold war-era foe . georgia claims that russia has , over the last three months , strengthened its control over abkhazia and established direct ties with the local authorities . the russian peacekeeping announcement only fuelled problems , said president mikheil saakashvili 's new " special representative " and top georgian diplomat , david bakradze . georgians reject russia 's peacekeeping claim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the build-up in the rebel regions is causing tensions " it 's hard to believe that this is being done for the purposes of peacekeeping , it 's rather the beginning of full-scale military aggression , " he told reporters .
" the georgian side , as the host country , should be notified in advance and there should be consent from georgia on any troop deployment , including peacekeepers .
we have not been notified . " " peacekeeping is not strengthened by unilateral steps . " russia has peacekeepers in abkhazia and south ossetia under an agreement with georgia from the 1990s following wars in which separatists broke away and established close ties with moscow . the russian defense ministry did not say how many extra soldiers were being sent , but said that 15 new observation posts would be set up on the frontline in abkhazia .
around 2,000 russians serve there and a further 1,000 in south ossetia . " any attempt by the georgian side to resolve the conflicts with force against russian peacekeepers and also against russian citizens ... will be met with an adequate and tough answer , " news agencies quoted the ministry as saying . no plans revealed for georgia action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia has not revealed any plans to retaliate as the rhetoric escalated , appathurai said that neither russia nor georgia had informed the military alliance of any plans to actually move their forces , although he said moscow could " technically " do so without notifying nato . but he said : " have no doubt ; everyone is watching very carefully what is happening on the ground . " bakradze said that a un mission monitoring georgia and abhkazia , unomig , " verifies everything " in terms of his country 's military deployments .
" if there is something on our side , it will immediately be known , " he said , adding : " we 're not going to move troops . " in a statement on april 21 , unomig said that its monitors " did not observe anything to substantiate reports of a build-up of forces on either side . " nato and georgian officials have confirmed that alliance ambassadors , in the so-called north atlantic council , will travel to georgia in " coming months " in a show of support for the would-be candidate . georgia attempts to defuse situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president saakashvili called for an end to the conflict georgia appeared to be attempting to prevent the dispute with russia from further escalating with president mikhail saakashvili saying that the country sought an end to the conflict . in a televised address to the people of abkhazia and south ossetia , saakashvili said : " georgia wants peace . " earlier wednesday , georgia attacked russia 's plans to boost peacekeeping troops in the two breakaway georgian regions as the start of " full scale military aggression . " the georgian foreign ministry called the plan an " act of irresponsible provocation , " russian news agency interfax reported . the remarks came after russia 's defense ministry announced tuesday an increase in peacekeeping forces to abkhazia and south ossetia in response to what it called aggressive moves by pro-western georgia . " if georgia puts in place the threats it has made on a number of occasions about the use of force , we would be forced to take retaliatory measures to protect the lives of our citizens , " russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said . eu criticize russian deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana is suspicious of the motives for the deployment the eu leaders called for calm , with eu foreign policy chief javier solana saying that the bloc would like to " de-escalate the tension . " abkhazia and south ossetia are both russian-dominated regions of georgia which fought brief separatist wars in the early 1990s and which still reject tbilisi 's rule . the georgian authorities insist that the two regions are its sovereign territory and accuse moscow of supporting the rebels .
most inhabitants of the two regions hold russian passports . in the light of rising tensions between georgia and its two regions over the past week , russia decided on tuesday to send more peacekeeping troops into the breakaway provinces . that decision was " not wise , " even if it was in line with peace agreements , solana said . osce leaders express concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the members of the osce have expressed concern finland , current chair of the 56-nation organization for security and cooperation in europe -lsb- ocse -rsb- expressed concern wednesday over " increased tension " in georgia . finnish foreign minister alexander stubb issued a statement repeating previous concern over moscow 's decision to establish ties with two breakaway regions in georgia . stubb said the april 20 downing of georgian drone over abkhazia " and the recent military build-up have considerably increased tension in the region .

the club 's brazilian defender ze roberto tells dw-world.de what motivates the bavarian giants . dw-world.de : ze roberto , let 's talk about the coming game with zenit st. petersburg .
can bayern munich make it to the uefa cup final ?
how high are the chances ?
ze roberto : we have a big chance to reach the final in spite of the result from the first leg of the semi-final at home .
we can win and want to win in st. petersburg .
we are on a good run and have had some luck on our side .
this luck may have helped in the bundesliga and maybe even in the uefa cup , if you consider the crazy game against getafe , but can you count on it ?
the games in europe are very different from the ones played in the bundesliga or the german cup .
in the uefa cup you have a lot of teams which are not seen as being the biggest in europe but are nevertheless very strong and have a lot of quality .
they want to win this title .
the problem has been for us the games at home , such as against getafe and last week against zenit .
can you explain why the results have been so close and the ties so complicated when bayern has the potential to get a result quickly and more clearly ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ze roberto is at a loss to explain why bayern fade we have recently had two types of halves in these games .
in the first half we are normally dominant , aggressive and determined .
in the second half , though , we have been unable to maintain that level .
i ca n't explain why .
maybe after so many games we are tired .
but the fact is , unfortunately , it is in the second half that we often give things away .
but to get to the final of the uefa cup , the team must be able to maintain that first half level of dominance for the whole 90 minutes .
that 's right .
we plan to perform for the whole game in st. petersburg at the level we showed in the first half of the game against zenit in munich .
is it a mental problem that the team can not maintain such a high level for the whole game ?
it is a primarily a psychological problem and also a physical problem with tiredness .
nevertheless , we always come out of the dressing room with the vision of victory in our heads , regardless of who our opponent is .
lucio was the unlucky figure last week in the first game against zenit - his own goal gave st. petersburg the draw and set up the nervous match in russia .
does the team stand behind him ?
has he regained his confidence ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio 's own goal complicates the tie with zenit the sort of own goal lucio scored seldom happens under normal circumstances .
we are a real team , and we stand behind lucio .
if we did not support him then we would not be a team because the idea of unity would be absent .
lucio is extremely motivated , just like we all are and our combined purpose is the welfare of the team - not the honoring or castigating of individuals .
you have never played as continuously throughout a season as you have during this campaign .
how are you feeling ?
everything is going well .
i 'm surprised myself to have played so often , but i have remained free of injuries and from health problems .
it is a very positive thing to feel so physically and emotionally fit at the end of the season .
has it been a difficult season ?
one does not experience a season of challenges like this every year , maybe once every three or five years .
it is nice to be in this position where we are playing for three trophies which we want to win .
we have the german cup , the league championship is very close - we only need one more point - and we have a great chance in the uefa cup .
we have talked a lot about this and our coach ottmar hitzfeld has gone over with us many times how special this is .
this is something great we are creating , something that is very special and that motivates us .
in spite of the tiredness ?
yes .
this motivation , these big challenges help us to overcome the tiredness .
we are concentrating very much and the bones and muscles will stay strong because we stand on the brink of a historical event .
at the age of 33 , do you feel the demands of the three different competitions greater than others ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ze roberto 's body tells him when he 's in need of a break yes , i feel the demands even more intensely today than i did when i was 25 years old or 20 .
as i said , i feel good , but my body lets me know when i need a break .
on the other hand , my experience as a player helps .
i know better what i need to do to recover .
i hear my body , i count on my experience and i think more like a professional than i did when i was younger .
only thinking like this has allowed me to play longer at this high level .
is this bayern munich team the best you have ever played for ?
no , the best team was the national team of brazil .
now if the question refers to club level , i must answer with a very strong " yes . "
this team , bayern munich , is fantastic .
we are very strong as a group and we have in the players who can make a difference in every game .
to be allowed to play with ribery , luca toni or klose is very motivating .
there is always the desire to win everything .
this team emits such strength that we come to the stadium not only to play soccer , but also to defeat the opponent . daniel martinez interviewed ze roberto -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

georgian officials said the move is the start of military aggression against tbilisi . the soldiers " are completing their deployment at their positions in the tkvarcheli district of abkhazia , " russia 's three main news agencies quoted the russian defense ministry press office as saying . troops were setting up camp , defenses and communications , the itar-tass , ria novosti and interfax agencies all reported . russian officials have still not released information on exactly how many additional troops are being sent to the separatist georgian region to bolster the more than 2,000 soldiers already there .
the russians are deployed under accords ending the separatist war between georgia and the abkhaz minority in the early 1990s . the defense ministry stressed that the " total number of russian peacekeepers does not exceed the numerical limits agreed under international agreements , " the agencies reported . concern in european union russia 's move , to counter what it said was the massing of georgian troops near abkhazia and south ossetia , raised concern in the united states while the european union has said that any military build-up would not be wise . " the steps that have been taken -lsb- by russia -rsb- and the rhetoric that has been used concerning the threat of force have increased tensions and have undermined georgia 's territorial integrity , " nato spokesman james appathurai said on wednesday . " the allies are unanimous in supporting , endorsing georgia 's territorial integrity and will not recognize or support steps that undermine that sovereignty , " he said . nato announced at a summit early this month that georgia would one day become a member of the 26-nation military alliance , in the face of fierce russian opposition . russia objects to nato moving closer to its borders and is deeply concerned that the breakaway regions could be destabilized by tbilisi 's rapprochement with moscow 's old cold war-era foe . georgia claims that russia has , over the last three months , strengthened its control over abkhazia and established direct ties with the local authorities . the russian peacekeeping announcement only fuelled problems , said president mikheil saakashvili 's new " special representative " and top georgian diplomat , david bakradze . georgians reject russia 's peacekeeping claim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the build-up in the rebel regions is causing tensions " it 's hard to believe that this is being done for the purposes of peacekeeping , it 's rather the beginning of full-scale military aggression , " he told reporters .
" the georgian side , as the host country , should be notified in advance and there should be consent from georgia on any troop deployment , including peacekeepers .
we have not been notified . " " peacekeeping is not strengthened by unilateral steps . " russia has peacekeepers in abkhazia and south ossetia under an agreement with georgia from the 1990s following wars in which separatists broke away and established close ties with moscow . the russian defense ministry did not say how many extra soldiers were being sent , but said that 15 new observation posts would be set up on the frontline in abkhazia .
around 2,000 russians serve there and a further 1,000 in south ossetia . " any attempt by the georgian side to resolve the conflicts with force against russian peacekeepers and also against russian citizens ... will be met with an adequate and tough answer , " news agencies quoted the ministry as saying . no plans revealed for georgia action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia has not revealed any plans to retaliate as the rhetoric escalated , appathurai said that neither russia nor georgia had informed the military alliance of any plans to actually move their forces , although he said moscow could " technically " do so without notifying nato . but he said : " have no doubt ; everyone is watching very carefully what is happening on the ground . " bakradze said that a un mission monitoring georgia and abhkazia , unomig , " verifies everything " in terms of his country 's military deployments .
" if there is something on our side , it will immediately be known , " he said , adding : " we 're not going to move troops . " in a statement on april 21 , unomig said that its monitors " did not observe anything to substantiate reports of a build-up of forces on either side . " nato and georgian officials have confirmed that alliance ambassadors , in the so-called north atlantic council , will travel to georgia in " coming months " in a show of support for the would-be candidate . georgia attempts to defuse situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president saakashvili called for an end to the conflict georgia appeared to be attempting to prevent the dispute with russia from further escalating with president mikhail saakashvili saying that the country sought an end to the conflict . in a televised address to the people of abkhazia and south ossetia , saakashvili said : " georgia wants peace . " earlier wednesday , georgia attacked russia 's plans to boost peacekeeping troops in the two breakaway georgian regions as the start of " full scale military aggression . " the georgian foreign ministry called the plan an " act of irresponsible provocation , " russian news agency interfax reported . the remarks came after russia 's defense ministry announced tuesday an increase in peacekeeping forces to abkhazia and south ossetia in response to what it called aggressive moves by pro-western georgia . " if georgia puts in place the threats it has made on a number of occasions about the use of force , we would be forced to take retaliatory measures to protect the lives of our citizens , " russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said . eu criticize russian deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana is suspicious of the motives for the deployment the eu leaders called for calm , with eu foreign policy chief javier solana saying that the bloc would like to " de-escalate the tension . " abkhazia and south ossetia are both russian-dominated regions of georgia which fought brief separatist wars in the early 1990s and which still reject tbilisi 's rule . the georgian authorities insist that the two regions are its sovereign territory and accuse moscow of supporting the rebels .
most inhabitants of the two regions hold russian passports . in the light of rising tensions between georgia and its two regions over the past week , russia decided on tuesday to send more peacekeeping troops into the breakaway provinces . that decision was " not wise , " even if it was in line with peace agreements , solana said . osce leaders express concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the members of the osce have expressed concern finland , current chair of the 56-nation organization for security and cooperation in europe -lsb- ocse -rsb- expressed concern wednesday over " increased tension " in georgia . finnish foreign minister alexander stubb issued a statement repeating previous concern over moscow 's decision to establish ties with two breakaway regions in georgia . stubb said the april 20 downing of georgian drone over abkhazia " and the recent military build-up have considerably increased tension in the region .

the club 's brazilian defender ze roberto tells dw-world.de what motivates the bavarian giants . dw-world.de : ze roberto , let 's talk about the coming game with zenit st. petersburg .
can bayern munich make it to the uefa cup final ?
how high are the chances ?
ze roberto : we have a big chance to reach the final in spite of the result from the first leg of the semi-final at home .
we can win and want to win in st. petersburg .
we are on a good run and have had some luck on our side .
this luck may have helped in the bundesliga and maybe even in the uefa cup , if you consider the crazy game against getafe , but can you count on it ?
the games in europe are very different from the ones played in the bundesliga or the german cup .
in the uefa cup you have a lot of teams which are not seen as being the biggest in europe but are nevertheless very strong and have a lot of quality .
they want to win this title .
the problem has been for us the games at home , such as against getafe and last week against zenit .
can you explain why the results have been so close and the ties so complicated when bayern has the potential to get a result quickly and more clearly ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ze roberto is at a loss to explain why bayern fade we have recently had two types of halves in these games .
in the first half we are normally dominant , aggressive and determined .
in the second half , though , we have been unable to maintain that level .
i ca n't explain why .
maybe after so many games we are tired .
but the fact is , unfortunately , it is in the second half that we often give things away .
but to get to the final of the uefa cup , the team must be able to maintain that first half level of dominance for the whole 90 minutes .
that 's right .
we plan to perform for the whole game in st. petersburg at the level we showed in the first half of the game against zenit in munich .
is it a mental problem that the team can not maintain such a high level for the whole game ?
it is a primarily a psychological problem and also a physical problem with tiredness .
nevertheless , we always come out of the dressing room with the vision of victory in our heads , regardless of who our opponent is .
lucio was the unlucky figure last week in the first game against zenit - his own goal gave st. petersburg the draw and set up the nervous match in russia .
does the team stand behind him ?
has he regained his confidence ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio 's own goal complicates the tie with zenit the sort of own goal lucio scored seldom happens under normal circumstances .
we are a real team , and we stand behind lucio .
if we did not support him then we would not be a team because the idea of unity would be absent .
lucio is extremely motivated , just like we all are and our combined purpose is the welfare of the team - not the honoring or castigating of individuals .
you have never played as continuously throughout a season as you have during this campaign .
how are you feeling ?
everything is going well .
i 'm surprised myself to have played so often , but i have remained free of injuries and from health problems .
it is a very positive thing to feel so physically and emotionally fit at the end of the season .
has it been a difficult season ?
one does not experience a season of challenges like this every year , maybe once every three or five years .
it is nice to be in this position where we are playing for three trophies which we want to win .
we have the german cup , the league championship is very close - we only need one more point - and we have a great chance in the uefa cup .
we have talked a lot about this and our coach ottmar hitzfeld has gone over with us many times how special this is .
this is something great we are creating , something that is very special and that motivates us .
in spite of the tiredness ?
yes .
this motivation , these big challenges help us to overcome the tiredness .
we are concentrating very much and the bones and muscles will stay strong because we stand on the brink of a historical event .
at the age of 33 , do you feel the demands of the three different competitions greater than others ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ze roberto 's body tells him when he 's in need of a break yes , i feel the demands even more intensely today than i did when i was 25 years old or 20 .
as i said , i feel good , but my body lets me know when i need a break .
on the other hand , my experience as a player helps .
i know better what i need to do to recover .
i hear my body , i count on my experience and i think more like a professional than i did when i was younger .
only thinking like this has allowed me to play longer at this high level .
is this bayern munich team the best you have ever played for ?
no , the best team was the national team of brazil .
now if the question refers to club level , i must answer with a very strong " yes . "
this team , bayern munich , is fantastic .
we are very strong as a group and we have in the players who can make a difference in every game .
to be allowed to play with ribery , luca toni or klose is very motivating .
there is always the desire to win everything .

the club 's brazilian defender ze roberto tells dw-world.de what motivates the bavarian giants . dw-world.de : ze roberto , let 's talk about the coming game with zenit st. petersburg .
can bayern munich make it to the uefa cup final ?
how high are the chances ?
ze roberto : we have a big chance to reach the final in spite of the result from the first leg of the semi-final at home .
we can win and want to win in st. petersburg .
we are on a good run and have had some luck on our side .
this luck may have helped in the bundesliga and maybe even in the uefa cup , if you consider the crazy game against getafe , but can you count on it ?
the games in europe are very different from the ones played in the bundesliga or the german cup .
in the uefa cup you have a lot of teams which are not seen as being the biggest in europe but are nevertheless very strong and have a lot of quality .
they want to win this title .
the problem has been for us the games at home , such as against getafe and last week against zenit .
can you explain why the results have been so close and the ties so complicated when bayern has the potential to get a result quickly and more clearly ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ze roberto is at a loss to explain why bayern fade we have recently had two types of halves in these games .
in the first half we are normally dominant , aggressive and determined .
in the second half , though , we have been unable to maintain that level .
i ca n't explain why .
maybe after so many games we are tired .
but the fact is , unfortunately , it is in the second half that we often give things away .
but to get to the final of the uefa cup , the team must be able to maintain that first half level of dominance for the whole 90 minutes .
that 's right .
we plan to perform for the whole game in st. petersburg at the level we showed in the first half of the game against zenit in munich .
is it a mental problem that the team can not maintain such a high level for the whole game ?
it is a primarily a psychological problem and also a physical problem with tiredness .
nevertheless , we always come out of the dressing room with the vision of victory in our heads , regardless of who our opponent is .
lucio was the unlucky figure last week in the first game against zenit - his own goal gave st. petersburg the draw and set up the nervous match in russia .
does the team stand behind him ?
has he regained his confidence ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio 's own goal complicates the tie with zenit the sort of own goal lucio scored seldom happens under normal circumstances .
we are a real team , and we stand behind lucio .
if we did not support him then we would not be a team because the idea of unity would be absent .
lucio is extremely motivated , just like we all are and our combined purpose is the welfare of the team - not the honoring or castigating of individuals .
you have never played as continuously throughout a season as you have during this campaign .
how are you feeling ?
everything is going well .
i 'm surprised myself to have played so often , but i have remained free of injuries and from health problems .
it is a very positive thing to feel so physically and emotionally fit at the end of the season .
has it been a difficult season ?
one does not experience a season of challenges like this every year , maybe once every three or five years .
it is nice to be in this position where we are playing for three trophies which we want to win .
we have the german cup , the league championship is very close - we only need one more point - and we have a great chance in the uefa cup .
we have talked a lot about this and our coach ottmar hitzfeld has gone over with us many times how special this is .
this is something great we are creating , something that is very special and that motivates us .
in spite of the tiredness ?
yes .
this motivation , these big challenges help us to overcome the tiredness .
we are concentrating very much and the bones and muscles will stay strong because we stand on the brink of a historical event .
at the age of 33 , do you feel the demands of the three different competitions greater than others ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ze roberto 's body tells him when he 's in need of a break yes , i feel the demands even more intensely today than i did when i was 25 years old or 20 .
as i said , i feel good , but my body lets me know when i need a break .
on the other hand , my experience as a player helps .
i know better what i need to do to recover .
i hear my body , i count on my experience and i think more like a professional than i did when i was younger .
only thinking like this has allowed me to play longer at this high level .
is this bayern munich team the best you have ever played for ?
no , the best team was the national team of brazil .
now if the question refers to club level , i must answer with a very strong " yes . "
this team , bayern munich , is fantastic .
we are very strong as a group and we have in the players who can make a difference in every game .
to be allowed to play with ribery , luca toni or klose is very motivating .
there is always the desire to win everything .
this team emits such strength that we come to the stadium not only to play soccer , but also to defeat the opponent . daniel martinez interviewed ze roberto -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

you have never played as continuously throughout a season as you have during this campaign .
how are you feeling ?
everything is going well .
i 'm surprised myself to have played so often , but i have remained free of injuries and from health problems .
it is a very positive thing to feel so physically and emotionally fit at the end of the season .
has it been a difficult season ?
one does not experience a season of challenges like this every year , maybe once every three or five years .
it is nice to be in this position where we are playing for three trophies which we want to win .
we have the german cup , the league championship is very close - we only need one more point - and we have a great chance in the uefa cup .
we have talked a lot about this and our coach ottmar hitzfeld has gone over with us many times how special this is .
this is something great we are creating , something that is very special and that motivates us .
in spite of the tiredness ?
yes .
this motivation , these big challenges help us to overcome the tiredness .
we are concentrating very much and the bones and muscles will stay strong because we stand on the brink of a historical event .
at the age of 33 , do you feel the demands of the three different competitions greater than others ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ze roberto 's body tells him when he 's in need of a break yes , i feel the demands even more intensely today than i did when i was 25 years old or 20 .
as i said , i feel good , but my body lets me know when i need a break .
on the other hand , my experience as a player helps .
i know better what i need to do to recover .
i hear my body , i count on my experience and i think more like a professional than i did when i was younger .
only thinking like this has allowed me to play longer at this high level .
is this bayern munich team the best you have ever played for ?
no , the best team was the national team of brazil .
now if the question refers to club level , i must answer with a very strong " yes . "
this team , bayern munich , is fantastic .
we are very strong as a group and we have in the players who can make a difference in every game .
to be allowed to play with ribery , luca toni or klose is very motivating .
there is always the desire to win everything .
this team emits such strength that we come to the stadium not only to play soccer , but also to defeat the opponent . daniel martinez interviewed ze roberto -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

foreign minister steinmeier told dw what culture can do for politics . deutsche welle : mr. steinmeier , israeli literature is being presented in the german foreign ministry , but do you ever get a chance to pick up a novel ? foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier : i have never stopped doing it .

it changes all the time for me .
sometimes i engage myself with particular regions .
this year that 's foreseeable since it 's the year the state of israel - with which we have multifaceted , and naturally political meetings - celebrates its 60th birthday . at the moment i 'm also trying to support forms of memory and knowledge among younger generations here in germany .
we can no longer be sure that recourse to history books will address israel 's particular situation and the special relationship between israel and germany comprehensibly enough for young people .
that 's why i think it 's important for younger generations in particular to look at israel 's multifaceted literature . it 's literature that is not characterized by pessimism or depression .
many authors are using very witty language that sometimes covers over the suffering and tension seen in their own country .
once you have an entry point , you can develop a sense for the diversity of life in israel .
that 's why i think that this literature appeals to readers in germany - possibly even more now because , i think , a new generation of israeli literature is emerging .
it 's dealing less with the holocaust and instead looking at the history of growth and development of the state of israel and immigration , which has not been free of tension in israel .
it 's immigration that is accompanied by people bringing the history of their country of origin with them .
this history is not regarded as a simply as a weight but as an enrichment , and that could really be an example to others .
all of this can be found in modern israeli literature . can culture influence political culture ? no , i would never see it as that instrumental .
culture is not a servant to political policy , and culture is n't able to fill the gaps where politics or political instruments have failed .
but i think that in order to understand each other , there needs to be - in addition to the political establishment 's relations - a real interest and curiosity from both sides about other people .
this curiosity can be better served by culture , and especially literature , than it can be by political statements . after the series of israeli literature in the foreign ministry ends , will there be a continuation with other focuses ? that 's something i could imagine .

reading is a part of life for me .
that 's why i 'm pleased that it 's still possible for me to read - on long flights or weekends - and , yes , i also read israeli literature . do you have any favorite books or authors ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : literature can help give people a look at other 's lives , steinmeier said i do n't have a favorite book .
it changes all the time for me .
sometimes i engage myself with particular regions .
this year that 's foreseeable since it 's the year the state of israel - with which we have multifaceted , and naturally political meetings - celebrates its 60th birthday . at the moment i 'm also trying to support forms of memory and knowledge among younger generations here in germany .
we can no longer be sure that recourse to history books will address israel 's particular situation and the special relationship between israel and germany comprehensibly enough for young people .
that 's why i think it 's important for younger generations in particular to look at israel 's multifaceted literature . it 's literature that is not characterized by pessimism or depression .
many authors are using very witty language that sometimes covers over the suffering and tension seen in their own country .
once you have an entry point , you can develop a sense for the diversity of life in israel .
that 's why i think that this literature appeals to readers in germany - possibly even more now because , i think , a new generation of israeli literature is emerging .
it 's dealing less with the holocaust and instead looking at the history of growth and development of the state of israel and immigration , which has not been free of tension in israel .
it 's immigration that is accompanied by people bringing the history of their country of origin with them .
this history is not regarded as a simply as a weight but as an enrichment , and that could really be an example to others .
all of this can be found in modern israeli literature . can culture influence political culture ? no , i would never see it as that instrumental .
culture is not a servant to political policy , and culture is n't able to fill the gaps where politics or political instruments have failed .
but i think that in order to understand each other , there needs to be - in addition to the political establishment 's relations - a real interest and curiosity from both sides about other people .
this curiosity can be better served by culture , and especially literature , than it can be by political statements . after the series of israeli literature in the foreign ministry ends , will there be a continuation with other focuses ? that 's something i could imagine .
but this is an experiment for this year , and i 'm pleased that many people have come to see the exhibit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 01.05.2008 russia begins sending troops to georgian republic großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has sent more troops , allegedly peacekeepers , to georgia 's rebel regions russia deployed troops thursday , may 1 , to the georgian separatist zone of abkhazia , despite georgia 's objections and concern in nato .
georgian officials said the move is the start of military aggression against tbilisi . the soldiers " are completing their deployment at their positions in the tkvarcheli district of abkhazia , " russia 's three main news agencies quoted the russian defense ministry press office as saying . troops were setting up camp , defenses and communications , the itar-tass , ria novosti and interfax agencies all reported . russian officials have still not released information on exactly how many additional troops are being sent to the separatist georgian region to bolster the more than 2,000 soldiers already there .
the russians are deployed under accords ending the separatist war between georgia and the abkhaz minority in the early 1990s . the defense ministry stressed that the " total number of russian peacekeepers does not exceed the numerical limits agreed under international agreements , " the agencies reported . concern in european union russia 's move , to counter what it said was the massing of georgian troops near abkhazia and south ossetia , raised concern in the united states while the european union has said that any military build-up would not be wise . " the steps that have been taken -lsb- by russia -rsb- and the rhetoric that has been used concerning the threat of force have increased tensions and have undermined georgia 's territorial integrity , " nato spokesman james appathurai said on wednesday . " the allies are unanimous in supporting , endorsing georgia 's territorial integrity and will not recognize or support steps that undermine that sovereignty , " he said . nato announced at a summit early this month that georgia would one day become a member of the 26-nation military alliance , in the face of fierce russian opposition . russia objects to nato moving closer to its borders and is deeply concerned that the breakaway regions could be destabilized by tbilisi 's rapprochement with moscow 's old cold war-era foe . georgia claims that russia has , over the last three months , strengthened its control over abkhazia and established direct ties with the local authorities . the russian peacekeeping announcement only fuelled problems , said president mikheil saakashvili 's new " special representative " and top georgian diplomat , david bakradze . georgians reject russia 's peacekeeping claim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the build-up in the rebel regions is causing tensions " it 's hard to believe that this is being done for the purposes of peacekeeping , it 's rather the beginning of full-scale military aggression , " he told reporters .
" the georgian side , as the host country , should be notified in advance and there should be consent from georgia on any troop deployment , including peacekeepers .
we have not been notified . " " peacekeeping is not strengthened by unilateral steps . " russia has peacekeepers in abkhazia and south ossetia under an agreement with georgia from the 1990s following wars in which separatists broke away and established close ties with moscow . the russian defense ministry did not say how many extra soldiers were being sent , but said that 15 new observation posts would be set up on the frontline in abkhazia .
around 2,000 russians serve there and a further 1,000 in south ossetia . " any attempt by the georgian side to resolve the conflicts with force against russian peacekeepers and also against russian citizens ... will be met with an adequate and tough answer , " news agencies quoted the ministry as saying . no plans revealed for georgia action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia has not revealed any plans to retaliate as the rhetoric escalated , appathurai said that neither russia nor georgia had informed the military alliance of any plans to actually move their forces , although he said moscow could " technically " do so without notifying nato . but he said : " have no doubt ; everyone is watching very carefully what is happening on the ground . " bakradze said that a un mission monitoring georgia and abhkazia , unomig , " verifies everything " in terms of his country 's military deployments .
" if there is something on our side , it will immediately be known , " he said , adding : " we 're not going to move troops . " in a statement on april 21 , unomig said that its monitors " did not observe anything to substantiate reports of a build-up of forces on either side . " nato and georgian officials have confirmed that alliance ambassadors , in the so-called north atlantic council , will travel to georgia in " coming months " in a show of support for the would-be candidate . georgia attempts to defuse situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president saakashvili called for an end to the conflict georgia appeared to be attempting to prevent the dispute with russia from further escalating with president mikhail saakashvili saying that the country sought an end to the conflict . in a televised address to the people of abkhazia and south ossetia , saakashvili said : " georgia wants peace . " earlier wednesday , georgia attacked russia 's plans to boost peacekeeping troops in the two breakaway georgian regions as the start of " full scale military aggression . " the georgian foreign ministry called the plan an " act of irresponsible provocation , " russian news agency interfax reported . the remarks came after russia 's defense ministry announced tuesday an increase in peacekeeping forces to abkhazia and south ossetia in response to what it called aggressive moves by pro-western georgia . " if georgia puts in place the threats it has made on a number of occasions about the use of force , we would be forced to take retaliatory measures to protect the lives of our citizens , " russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said . eu criticize russian deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana is suspicious of the motives for the deployment the eu leaders called for calm , with eu foreign policy chief javier solana saying that the bloc would like to " de-escalate the tension . " abkhazia and south ossetia are both russian-dominated regions of georgia which fought brief separatist wars in the early 1990s and which still reject tbilisi 's rule . the georgian authorities insist that the two regions are its sovereign territory and accuse moscow of supporting the rebels .
most inhabitants of the two regions hold russian passports . in the light of rising tensions between georgia and its two regions over the past week , russia decided on tuesday to send more peacekeeping troops into the breakaway provinces . that decision was " not wise , " even if it was in line with peace agreements , solana said . osce leaders express concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the members of the osce have expressed concern finland , current chair of the 56-nation organization for security and cooperation in europe -lsb- ocse -rsb- expressed concern wednesday over " increased tension " in georgia . finnish foreign minister alexander stubb issued a statement repeating previous concern over moscow 's decision to establish ties with two breakaway regions in georgia . stubb said the april 20 downing of georgian drone over abkhazia " and the recent military build-up have considerably increased tension in the region . " he said he had telephoned president saakashvili and foreign minister lavrov as part of attempts to avert further escalation . the osce was prepared to aid the peace process and supported the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia within its internationally recognized borders , the statement said . dw staff / dpa / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the russians are deployed under accords ending the separatist war between georgia and the abkhaz minority in the early 1990s . the defense ministry stressed that the " total number of russian peacekeepers does not exceed the numerical limits agreed under international agreements , " the agencies reported . concern in european union russia 's move , to counter what it said was the massing of georgian troops near abkhazia and south ossetia , raised concern in the united states while the european union has said that any military build-up would not be wise . " the steps that have been taken -lsb- by russia -rsb- and the rhetoric that has been used concerning the threat of force have increased tensions and have undermined georgia 's territorial integrity , " nato spokesman james appathurai said on wednesday . " the allies are unanimous in supporting , endorsing georgia 's territorial integrity and will not recognize or support steps that undermine that sovereignty , " he said . nato announced at a summit early this month that georgia would one day become a member of the 26-nation military alliance , in the face of fierce russian opposition . russia objects to nato moving closer to its borders and is deeply concerned that the breakaway regions could be destabilized by tbilisi 's rapprochement with moscow 's old cold war-era foe . georgia claims that russia has , over the last three months , strengthened its control over abkhazia and established direct ties with the local authorities . the russian peacekeeping announcement only fuelled problems , said president mikheil saakashvili 's new " special representative " and top georgian diplomat , david bakradze . georgians reject russia 's peacekeeping claim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the build-up in the rebel regions is causing tensions " it 's hard to believe that this is being done for the purposes of peacekeeping , it 's rather the beginning of full-scale military aggression , " he told reporters .
" the georgian side , as the host country , should be notified in advance and there should be consent from georgia on any troop deployment , including peacekeepers .
we have not been notified . " " peacekeeping is not strengthened by unilateral steps . " russia has peacekeepers in abkhazia and south ossetia under an agreement with georgia from the 1990s following wars in which separatists broke away and established close ties with moscow . the russian defense ministry did not say how many extra soldiers were being sent , but said that 15 new observation posts would be set up on the frontline in abkhazia .
around 2,000 russians serve there and a further 1,000 in south ossetia . " any attempt by the georgian side to resolve the conflicts with force against russian peacekeepers and also against russian citizens ... will be met with an adequate and tough answer , " news agencies quoted the ministry as saying . no plans revealed for georgia action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia has not revealed any plans to retaliate as the rhetoric escalated , appathurai said that neither russia nor georgia had informed the military alliance of any plans to actually move their forces , although he said moscow could " technically " do so without notifying nato . but he said : " have no doubt ; everyone is watching very carefully what is happening on the ground . " bakradze said that a un mission monitoring georgia and abhkazia , unomig , " verifies everything " in terms of his country 's military deployments .
" if there is something on our side , it will immediately be known , " he said , adding : " we 're not going to move troops . " in a statement on april 21 , unomig said that its monitors " did not observe anything to substantiate reports of a build-up of forces on either side . " nato and georgian officials have confirmed that alliance ambassadors , in the so-called north atlantic council , will travel to georgia in " coming months " in a show of support for the would-be candidate . georgia attempts to defuse situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president saakashvili called for an end to the conflict georgia appeared to be attempting to prevent the dispute with russia from further escalating with president mikhail saakashvili saying that the country sought an end to the conflict . in a televised address to the people of abkhazia and south ossetia , saakashvili said : " georgia wants peace . " earlier wednesday , georgia attacked russia 's plans to boost peacekeeping troops in the two breakaway georgian regions as the start of " full scale military aggression . " the georgian foreign ministry called the plan an " act of irresponsible provocation , " russian news agency interfax reported . the remarks came after russia 's defense ministry announced tuesday an increase in peacekeeping forces to abkhazia and south ossetia in response to what it called aggressive moves by pro-western georgia . " if georgia puts in place the threats it has made on a number of occasions about the use of force , we would be forced to take retaliatory measures to protect the lives of our citizens , " russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said . eu criticize russian deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana is suspicious of the motives for the deployment the eu leaders called for calm , with eu foreign policy chief javier solana saying that the bloc would like to " de-escalate the tension . " abkhazia and south ossetia are both russian-dominated regions of georgia which fought brief separatist wars in the early 1990s and which still reject tbilisi 's rule . the georgian authorities insist that the two regions are its sovereign territory and accuse moscow of supporting the rebels .
most inhabitants of the two regions hold russian passports . in the light of rising tensions between georgia and its two regions over the past week , russia decided on tuesday to send more peacekeeping troops into the breakaway provinces . that decision was " not wise , " even if it was in line with peace agreements , solana said . osce leaders express concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the members of the osce have expressed concern finland , current chair of the 56-nation organization for security and cooperation in europe -lsb- ocse -rsb- expressed concern wednesday over " increased tension " in georgia . finnish foreign minister alexander stubb issued a statement repeating previous concern over moscow 's decision to establish ties with two breakaway regions in georgia . stubb said the april 20 downing of georgian drone over abkhazia " and the recent military build-up have considerably increased tension in the region . " he said he had telephoned president saakashvili and foreign minister lavrov as part of attempts to avert further escalation . the osce was prepared to aid the peace process and supported the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia within its internationally recognized borders , the statement said . dw staff / dpa / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the allies are unanimous in supporting , endorsing georgia 's territorial integrity and will not recognize or support steps that undermine that sovereignty , " he said . nato announced at a summit early this month that georgia would one day become a member of the 26-nation military alliance , in the face of fierce russian opposition . russia objects to nato moving closer to its borders and is deeply concerned that the breakaway regions could be destabilized by tbilisi 's rapprochement with moscow 's old cold war-era foe . georgia claims that russia has , over the last three months , strengthened its control over abkhazia and established direct ties with the local authorities . the russian peacekeeping announcement only fuelled problems , said president mikheil saakashvili 's new " special representative " and top georgian diplomat , david bakradze . georgians reject russia 's peacekeeping claim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the build-up in the rebel regions is causing tensions " it 's hard to believe that this is being done for the purposes of peacekeeping , it 's rather the beginning of full-scale military aggression , " he told reporters .
" the georgian side , as the host country , should be notified in advance and there should be consent from georgia on any troop deployment , including peacekeepers .
we have not been notified . " " peacekeeping is not strengthened by unilateral steps . " russia has peacekeepers in abkhazia and south ossetia under an agreement with georgia from the 1990s following wars in which separatists broke away and established close ties with moscow . the russian defense ministry did not say how many extra soldiers were being sent , but said that 15 new observation posts would be set up on the frontline in abkhazia .
around 2,000 russians serve there and a further 1,000 in south ossetia . " any attempt by the georgian side to resolve the conflicts with force against russian peacekeepers and also against russian citizens ... will be met with an adequate and tough answer , " news agencies quoted the ministry as saying . no plans revealed for georgia action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia has not revealed any plans to retaliate as the rhetoric escalated , appathurai said that neither russia nor georgia had informed the military alliance of any plans to actually move their forces , although he said moscow could " technically " do so without notifying nato . but he said : " have no doubt ; everyone is watching very carefully what is happening on the ground . " bakradze said that a un mission monitoring georgia and abhkazia , unomig , " verifies everything " in terms of his country 's military deployments .
" if there is something on our side , it will immediately be known , " he said , adding : " we 're not going to move troops .

" earlier wednesday , georgia attacked russia 's plans to boost peacekeeping troops in the two breakaway georgian regions as the start of " full scale military aggression .

" if georgia puts in place the threats it has made on a number of occasions about the use of force , we would be forced to take retaliatory measures to protect the lives of our citizens , " russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said . eu criticize russian deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana is suspicious of the motives for the deployment the eu leaders called for calm , with eu foreign policy chief javier solana saying that the bloc would like to " de-escalate the tension .

most inhabitants of the two regions hold russian passports . in the light of rising tensions between georgia and its two regions over the past week , russia decided on tuesday to send more peacekeeping troops into the breakaway provinces . that decision was " not wise , " even if it was in line with peace agreements , solana said . osce leaders express concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the members of the osce have expressed concern finland , current chair of the 56-nation organization for security and cooperation in europe -lsb- ocse -rsb- expressed concern wednesday over " increased tension " in georgia . finnish foreign minister alexander stubb issued a statement repeating previous concern over moscow 's decision to establish ties with two breakaway regions in georgia . stubb said the april 20 downing of georgian drone over abkhazia " and the recent military build-up have considerably increased tension in the region .

after 63 years , the shock of the holocaust remains chilling , ehud olmert said . as the sirens began at 10 a.m. local time -lrb- 0800 gmt -rrb- , traffic came to a total standstill as drivers stood next to their cars and pedestrians stopped walking , many of them standing to attention or with their heads bowed . holocaust memorial day began wednesday night with a ceremony at jerusalem 's yad vashem holocaust memorial institute , attended by state leaders , foreign diplomats , and holocaust survivors and their relatives . six survivors lit six beacons honoring the 6 million jews killed by the nazis and their collaborators . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ceremonies were held at jerusalem 's yad vashem holocaust memorial institute " sixty-three years have passed since the satanic factories of death of the nazis and their collaborators ceased to operate , yet with the passing of time , the dimensions of the holocaust still remain beyond comprehension , unfathomably shocking , unacceptably chilling , " prime minister ehud olmert said at the ceremony .

" he asked .

the club 's brazilian defender ze roberto tells dw-world.de what motivates the bavarian giants . dw-world.de : ze roberto , let 's talk about the coming game with zenit st. petersburg .
can bayern munich make it to the uefa cup final ?
how high are the chances ?
ze roberto : we have a big chance to reach the final in spite of the result from the first leg of the semi-final at home .
we can win and want to win in st. petersburg .
we are on a good run and have had some luck on our side .
this luck may have helped in the bundesliga and maybe even in the uefa cup , if you consider the crazy game against getafe , but can you count on it ?
the games in europe are very different from the ones played in the bundesliga or the german cup .
in the uefa cup you have a lot of teams which are not seen as being the biggest in europe but are nevertheless very strong and have a lot of quality .
they want to win this title .
the problem has been for us the games at home , such as against getafe and last week against zenit .
can you explain why the results have been so close and the ties so complicated when bayern has the potential to get a result quickly and more clearly ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ze roberto is at a loss to explain why bayern fade we have recently had two types of halves in these games .
in the first half we are normally dominant , aggressive and determined .
in the second half , though , we have been unable to maintain that level .
i ca n't explain why .
maybe after so many games we are tired .
but the fact is , unfortunately , it is in the second half that we often give things away .
but to get to the final of the uefa cup , the team must be able to maintain that first half level of dominance for the whole 90 minutes .
that 's right .
we plan to perform for the whole game in st. petersburg at the level we showed in the first half of the game against zenit in munich .
is it a mental problem that the team can not maintain such a high level for the whole game ?
it is a primarily a psychological problem and also a physical problem with tiredness .
nevertheless , we always come out of the dressing room with the vision of victory in our heads , regardless of who our opponent is .
lucio was the unlucky figure last week in the first game against zenit - his own goal gave st. petersburg the draw and set up the nervous match in russia .
does the team stand behind him ?
has he regained his confidence ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio 's own goal complicates the tie with zenit the sort of own goal lucio scored seldom happens under normal circumstances .
we are a real team , and we stand behind lucio .
if we did not support him then we would not be a team because the idea of unity would be absent .
lucio is extremely motivated , just like we all are and our combined purpose is the welfare of the team - not the honoring or castigating of individuals .
you have never played as continuously throughout a season as you have during this campaign .
how are you feeling ?
everything is going well .
i 'm surprised myself to have played so often , but i have remained free of injuries and from health problems .
it is a very positive thing to feel so physically and emotionally fit at the end of the season .
has it been a difficult season ?
one does not experience a season of challenges like this every year , maybe once every three or five years .
it is nice to be in this position where we are playing for three trophies which we want to win .
we have the german cup , the league championship is very close - we only need one more point - and we have a great chance in the uefa cup .
we have talked a lot about this and our coach ottmar hitzfeld has gone over with us many times how special this is .
this is something great we are creating , something that is very special and that motivates us .
in spite of the tiredness ?
yes .
this motivation , these big challenges help us to overcome the tiredness .
we are concentrating very much and the bones and muscles will stay strong because we stand on the brink of a historical event .
at the age of 33 , do you feel the demands of the three different competitions greater than others ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ze roberto 's body tells him when he 's in need of a break yes , i feel the demands even more intensely today than i did when i was 25 years old or 20 .
as i said , i feel good , but my body lets me know when i need a break .
on the other hand , my experience as a player helps .
i know better what i need to do to recover .
i hear my body , i count on my experience and i think more like a professional than i did when i was younger .
only thinking like this has allowed me to play longer at this high level .
is this bayern munich team the best you have ever played for ?
no , the best team was the national team of brazil .
now if the question refers to club level , i must answer with a very strong " yes . "
this team , bayern munich , is fantastic .
we are very strong as a group and we have in the players who can make a difference in every game .
to be allowed to play with ribery , luca toni or klose is very motivating .

can bayern munich make it to the uefa cup final ?
how high are the chances ?
ze roberto : we have a big chance to reach the final in spite of the result from the first leg of the semi-final at home .
we can win and want to win in st. petersburg .
we are on a good run and have had some luck on our side .
this luck may have helped in the bundesliga and maybe even in the uefa cup , if you consider the crazy game against getafe , but can you count on it ?
the games in europe are very different from the ones played in the bundesliga or the german cup .
in the uefa cup you have a lot of teams which are not seen as being the biggest in europe but are nevertheless very strong and have a lot of quality .
they want to win this title .
the problem has been for us the games at home , such as against getafe and last week against zenit .
can you explain why the results have been so close and the ties so complicated when bayern has the potential to get a result quickly and more clearly ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ze roberto is at a loss to explain why bayern fade we have recently had two types of halves in these games .
in the first half we are normally dominant , aggressive and determined .
in the second half , though , we have been unable to maintain that level .
i ca n't explain why .
maybe after so many games we are tired .
but the fact is , unfortunately , it is in the second half that we often give things away .
but to get to the final of the uefa cup , the team must be able to maintain that first half level of dominance for the whole 90 minutes .
that 's right .
we plan to perform for the whole game in st. petersburg at the level we showed in the first half of the game against zenit in munich .
is it a mental problem that the team can not maintain such a high level for the whole game ?
it is a primarily a psychological problem and also a physical problem with tiredness .
nevertheless , we always come out of the dressing room with the vision of victory in our heads , regardless of who our opponent is .
lucio was the unlucky figure last week in the first game against zenit - his own goal gave st. petersburg the draw and set up the nervous match in russia .
does the team stand behind him ?
has he regained his confidence ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio 's own goal complicates the tie with zenit the sort of own goal lucio scored seldom happens under normal circumstances .
we are a real team , and we stand behind lucio .
if we did not support him then we would not be a team because the idea of unity would be absent .
lucio is extremely motivated , just like we all are and our combined purpose is the welfare of the team - not the honoring or castigating of individuals .
you have never played as continuously throughout a season as you have during this campaign .
how are you feeling ?
everything is going well .
i 'm surprised myself to have played so often , but i have remained free of injuries and from health problems .
it is a very positive thing to feel so physically and emotionally fit at the end of the season .
has it been a difficult season ?
one does not experience a season of challenges like this every year , maybe once every three or five years .
it is nice to be in this position where we are playing for three trophies which we want to win .
we have the german cup , the league championship is very close - we only need one more point - and we have a great chance in the uefa cup .
we have talked a lot about this and our coach ottmar hitzfeld has gone over with us many times how special this is .
this is something great we are creating , something that is very special and that motivates us .
in spite of the tiredness ?
yes .
this motivation , these big challenges help us to overcome the tiredness .
we are concentrating very much and the bones and muscles will stay strong because we stand on the brink of a historical event .
at the age of 33 , do you feel the demands of the three different competitions greater than others ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ze roberto 's body tells him when he 's in need of a break yes , i feel the demands even more intensely today than i did when i was 25 years old or 20 .
as i said , i feel good , but my body lets me know when i need a break .
on the other hand , my experience as a player helps .
i know better what i need to do to recover .
i hear my body , i count on my experience and i think more like a professional than i did when i was younger .
only thinking like this has allowed me to play longer at this high level .
is this bayern munich team the best you have ever played for ?
no , the best team was the national team of brazil .
now if the question refers to club level , i must answer with a very strong " yes . "
this team , bayern munich , is fantastic .
we are very strong as a group and we have in the players who can make a difference in every game .

we have talked a lot about this and our coach ottmar hitzfeld has gone over with us many times how special this is .
this is something great we are creating , something that is very special and that motivates us .
in spite of the tiredness ?
yes .
this motivation , these big challenges help us to overcome the tiredness .
we are concentrating very much and the bones and muscles will stay strong because we stand on the brink of a historical event .
at the age of 33 , do you feel the demands of the three different competitions greater than others ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ze roberto 's body tells him when he 's in need of a break yes , i feel the demands even more intensely today than i did when i was 25 years old or 20 .
as i said , i feel good , but my body lets me know when i need a break .
on the other hand , my experience as a player helps .
i know better what i need to do to recover .
i hear my body , i count on my experience and i think more like a professional than i did when i was younger .
only thinking like this has allowed me to play longer at this high level .
is this bayern munich team the best you have ever played for ?
no , the best team was the national team of brazil .
now if the question refers to club level , i must answer with a very strong " yes . "
this team , bayern munich , is fantastic .
we are very strong as a group and we have in the players who can make a difference in every game .
to be allowed to play with ribery , luca toni or klose is very motivating .
there is always the desire to win everything .
this team emits such strength that we come to the stadium not only to play soccer , but also to defeat the opponent . daniel martinez interviewed ze roberto -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

foreign minister steinmeier told dw what culture can do for politics . deutsche welle : mr. steinmeier , israeli literature is being presented in the german foreign ministry , but do you ever get a chance to pick up a novel ? foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier : i have never stopped doing it .
not during my time as foreign minister and not in the years before as head of the chancellery - where things also never got boring .
reading is a part of life for me .
that 's why i 'm pleased that it 's still possible for me to read - on long flights or weekends - and , yes , i also read israeli literature . do you have any favorite books or authors ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : literature can help give people a look at other 's lives , steinmeier said i do n't have a favorite book .
it changes all the time for me .
sometimes i engage myself with particular regions .
this year that 's foreseeable since it 's the year the state of israel - with which we have multifaceted , and naturally political meetings - celebrates its 60th birthday . at the moment i 'm also trying to support forms of memory and knowledge among younger generations here in germany .
we can no longer be sure that recourse to history books will address israel 's particular situation and the special relationship between israel and germany comprehensibly enough for young people .
that 's why i think it 's important for younger generations in particular to look at israel 's multifaceted literature . it 's literature that is not characterized by pessimism or depression .
many authors are using very witty language that sometimes covers over the suffering and tension seen in their own country .
once you have an entry point , you can develop a sense for the diversity of life in israel .
that 's why i think that this literature appeals to readers in germany - possibly even more now because , i think , a new generation of israeli literature is emerging .
it 's dealing less with the holocaust and instead looking at the history of growth and development of the state of israel and immigration , which has not been free of tension in israel .
it 's immigration that is accompanied by people bringing the history of their country of origin with them .
this history is not regarded as a simply as a weight but as an enrichment , and that could really be an example to others .
all of this can be found in modern israeli literature . can culture influence political culture ? no , i would never see it as that instrumental .
culture is not a servant to political policy , and culture is n't able to fill the gaps where politics or political instruments have failed .
but i think that in order to understand each other , there needs to be - in addition to the political establishment 's relations - a real interest and curiosity from both sides about other people .
this curiosity can be better served by culture , and especially literature , than it can be by political statements . after the series of israeli literature in the foreign ministry ends , will there be a continuation with other focuses ? that 's something i could imagine .
but this is an experiment for this year , and i 'm pleased that many people have come to see the exhibit .
if the level of interest keeps up , i could imagine that we continue it next year with a different focus . interview : cornelia rabitz -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

foreign minister steinmeier told dw what culture can do for politics . deutsche welle : mr. steinmeier , israeli literature is being presented in the german foreign ministry , but do you ever get a chance to pick up a novel ? foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier : i have never stopped doing it .

it changes all the time for me .
sometimes i engage myself with particular regions .
this year that 's foreseeable since it 's the year the state of israel - with which we have multifaceted , and naturally political meetings - celebrates its 60th birthday . at the moment i 'm also trying to support forms of memory and knowledge among younger generations here in germany .
we can no longer be sure that recourse to history books will address israel 's particular situation and the special relationship between israel and germany comprehensibly enough for young people .
that 's why i think it 's important for younger generations in particular to look at israel 's multifaceted literature . it 's literature that is not characterized by pessimism or depression .
many authors are using very witty language that sometimes covers over the suffering and tension seen in their own country .
once you have an entry point , you can develop a sense for the diversity of life in israel .
that 's why i think that this literature appeals to readers in germany - possibly even more now because , i think , a new generation of israeli literature is emerging .
it 's dealing less with the holocaust and instead looking at the history of growth and development of the state of israel and immigration , which has not been free of tension in israel .
it 's immigration that is accompanied by people bringing the history of their country of origin with them .
this history is not regarded as a simply as a weight but as an enrichment , and that could really be an example to others .
all of this can be found in modern israeli literature . can culture influence political culture ? no , i would never see it as that instrumental .
culture is not a servant to political policy , and culture is n't able to fill the gaps where politics or political instruments have failed .
but i think that in order to understand each other , there needs to be - in addition to the political establishment 's relations - a real interest and curiosity from both sides about other people .
this curiosity can be better served by culture , and especially literature , than it can be by political statements . after the series of israeli literature in the foreign ministry ends , will there be a continuation with other focuses ? that 's something i could imagine .

he said she had taught him patience . european leaders gathered in the german city of aachen on thursday , may 1 , to pay tribute to merkel 's contributions to european unity . for her part , merkel reminded europeans of the progress the continent has made . " after centuries of violent confrontations , we have created what once could hardly have been imagined - peaceful and friendly cooperation in europe , " she said in her speech , adding that europe could serve as a model for other regions . addressing her as " dear angela " in a speech of eulogy , sarkozy said , " she has taught me that hope requires time -lsb- to work -rsb- .

brunner , an aide to adolf eichmann and responsible for deporting over 100,000 jews to nazi death camps from austria , greece , france and slovakia , is defined by the center as " the most important nazi war criminal who may still be alive . "

" ivan the terrible " still wanted despite being freed ivan demjanjuk , who participated in the mass murder of jews in sobibor death camp and also served in majdanek death camp , is number two on the list .
demjanjuk stood trial in jerusalem in the late 1980 's , on suspicion he was the death camp guard known as " ivan the terrible " , but was freed through " reasonable doubt " .

karoly zentai , who participated in manhunts , persecution and murder of jews in budapest in 1944 , is seventh .

he was convicted in lithuania , which has so far refused to implement his sentence of imprisonment .
the list is rounded off with harry mannil , who arrested jews and communists executed by the nazis and their estonian collaborators .

the club 's brazilian defender ze roberto tells dw-world.de what motivates the bavarian giants . dw-world.de : ze roberto , let 's talk about the coming game with zenit st. petersburg .
can bayern munich make it to the uefa cup final ?
how high are the chances ?
ze roberto : we have a big chance to reach the final in spite of the result from the first leg of the semi-final at home .
we can win and want to win in st. petersburg .
we are on a good run and have had some luck on our side .
this luck may have helped in the bundesliga and maybe even in the uefa cup , if you consider the crazy game against getafe , but can you count on it ?
the games in europe are very different from the ones played in the bundesliga or the german cup .
in the uefa cup you have a lot of teams which are not seen as being the biggest in europe but are nevertheless very strong and have a lot of quality .
they want to win this title .
the problem has been for us the games at home , such as against getafe and last week against zenit .
can you explain why the results have been so close and the ties so complicated when bayern has the potential to get a result quickly and more clearly ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ze roberto is at a loss to explain why bayern fade we have recently had two types of halves in these games .
in the first half we are normally dominant , aggressive and determined .
in the second half , though , we have been unable to maintain that level .
i ca n't explain why .
maybe after so many games we are tired .
but the fact is , unfortunately , it is in the second half that we often give things away .
but to get to the final of the uefa cup , the team must be able to maintain that first half level of dominance for the whole 90 minutes .
that 's right .
we plan to perform for the whole game in st. petersburg at the level we showed in the first half of the game against zenit in munich .
is it a mental problem that the team can not maintain such a high level for the whole game ?
it is a primarily a psychological problem and also a physical problem with tiredness .
nevertheless , we always come out of the dressing room with the vision of victory in our heads , regardless of who our opponent is .
lucio was the unlucky figure last week in the first game against zenit - his own goal gave st. petersburg the draw and set up the nervous match in russia .
does the team stand behind him ?
has he regained his confidence ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio 's own goal complicates the tie with zenit the sort of own goal lucio scored seldom happens under normal circumstances .
we are a real team , and we stand behind lucio .
if we did not support him then we would not be a team because the idea of unity would be absent .
lucio is extremely motivated , just like we all are and our combined purpose is the welfare of the team - not the honoring or castigating of individuals .
you have never played as continuously throughout a season as you have during this campaign .
how are you feeling ?
everything is going well .
i 'm surprised myself to have played so often , but i have remained free of injuries and from health problems .
it is a very positive thing to feel so physically and emotionally fit at the end of the season .
has it been a difficult season ?
one does not experience a season of challenges like this every year , maybe once every three or five years .
it is nice to be in this position where we are playing for three trophies which we want to win .
we have the german cup , the league championship is very close - we only need one more point - and we have a great chance in the uefa cup .
we have talked a lot about this and our coach ottmar hitzfeld has gone over with us many times how special this is .
this is something great we are creating , something that is very special and that motivates us .
in spite of the tiredness ?
yes .
this motivation , these big challenges help us to overcome the tiredness .
we are concentrating very much and the bones and muscles will stay strong because we stand on the brink of a historical event .
at the age of 33 , do you feel the demands of the three different competitions greater than others ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ze roberto 's body tells him when he 's in need of a break yes , i feel the demands even more intensely today than i did when i was 25 years old or 20 .
as i said , i feel good , but my body lets me know when i need a break .
on the other hand , my experience as a player helps .
i know better what i need to do to recover .
i hear my body , i count on my experience and i think more like a professional than i did when i was younger .
only thinking like this has allowed me to play longer at this high level .
is this bayern munich team the best you have ever played for ?
no , the best team was the national team of brazil .
now if the question refers to club level , i must answer with a very strong " yes . "
this team , bayern munich , is fantastic .
we are very strong as a group and we have in the players who can make a difference in every game .
to be allowed to play with ribery , luca toni or klose is very motivating .
there is always the desire to win everything .

the club 's brazilian defender ze roberto tells dw-world.de what motivates the bavarian giants . dw-world.de : ze roberto , let 's talk about the coming game with zenit st. petersburg .
can bayern munich make it to the uefa cup final ?
how high are the chances ?
ze roberto : we have a big chance to reach the final in spite of the result from the first leg of the semi-final at home .
we can win and want to win in st. petersburg .
we are on a good run and have had some luck on our side .
this luck may have helped in the bundesliga and maybe even in the uefa cup , if you consider the crazy game against getafe , but can you count on it ?
the games in europe are very different from the ones played in the bundesliga or the german cup .
in the uefa cup you have a lot of teams which are not seen as being the biggest in europe but are nevertheless very strong and have a lot of quality .
they want to win this title .
the problem has been for us the games at home , such as against getafe and last week against zenit .
can you explain why the results have been so close and the ties so complicated when bayern has the potential to get a result quickly and more clearly ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ze roberto is at a loss to explain why bayern fade we have recently had two types of halves in these games .
in the first half we are normally dominant , aggressive and determined .
in the second half , though , we have been unable to maintain that level .
i ca n't explain why .
maybe after so many games we are tired .
but the fact is , unfortunately , it is in the second half that we often give things away .
but to get to the final of the uefa cup , the team must be able to maintain that first half level of dominance for the whole 90 minutes .
that 's right .
we plan to perform for the whole game in st. petersburg at the level we showed in the first half of the game against zenit in munich .
is it a mental problem that the team can not maintain such a high level for the whole game ?
it is a primarily a psychological problem and also a physical problem with tiredness .
nevertheless , we always come out of the dressing room with the vision of victory in our heads , regardless of who our opponent is .
lucio was the unlucky figure last week in the first game against zenit - his own goal gave st. petersburg the draw and set up the nervous match in russia .
does the team stand behind him ?
has he regained his confidence ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio 's own goal complicates the tie with zenit the sort of own goal lucio scored seldom happens under normal circumstances .
we are a real team , and we stand behind lucio .
if we did not support him then we would not be a team because the idea of unity would be absent .
lucio is extremely motivated , just like we all are and our combined purpose is the welfare of the team - not the honoring or castigating of individuals .
you have never played as continuously throughout a season as you have during this campaign .
how are you feeling ?
everything is going well .
i 'm surprised myself to have played so often , but i have remained free of injuries and from health problems .
it is a very positive thing to feel so physically and emotionally fit at the end of the season .
has it been a difficult season ?
one does not experience a season of challenges like this every year , maybe once every three or five years .
it is nice to be in this position where we are playing for three trophies which we want to win .
we have the german cup , the league championship is very close - we only need one more point - and we have a great chance in the uefa cup .
we have talked a lot about this and our coach ottmar hitzfeld has gone over with us many times how special this is .
this is something great we are creating , something that is very special and that motivates us .
in spite of the tiredness ?
yes .
this motivation , these big challenges help us to overcome the tiredness .
we are concentrating very much and the bones and muscles will stay strong because we stand on the brink of a historical event .

he said she had taught him patience . european leaders gathered in the german city of aachen on thursday , may 1 , to pay tribute to merkel 's contributions to european unity . for her part , merkel reminded europeans of the progress the continent has made . " after centuries of violent confrontations , we have created what once could hardly have been imagined - peaceful and friendly cooperation in europe , " she said in her speech , adding that europe could serve as a model for other regions . addressing her as " dear angela " in a speech of eulogy , sarkozy said , " she has taught me that hope requires time -lsb- to work -rsb- . " mutual compliments continued when merkel replied in french , thanking sarkozy " from her heart " and praising his " adeptness and honesty " in winning office as president a year ago and " leading france back into the heart of the european union .

georgian officials said the move is the start of military aggression against tbilisi . the soldiers " are completing their deployment at their positions in the tkvarcheli district of abkhazia , " russia 's three main news agencies quoted the russian defense ministry press office as saying . troops were setting up camp , defenses and communications , the itar-tass , ria novosti and interfax agencies all reported . russian officials have still not released information on exactly how many additional troops are being sent to the separatist georgian region to bolster the more than 2,000 soldiers already there .
the russians are deployed under accords ending the separatist war between georgia and the abkhaz minority in the early 1990s . the defense ministry stressed that the " total number of russian peacekeepers does not exceed the numerical limits agreed under international agreements , " the agencies reported . concern in european union russia 's move , to counter what it said was the massing of georgian troops near abkhazia and south ossetia , raised concern in the united states while the european union has said that any military build-up would not be wise . " the steps that have been taken -lsb- by russia -rsb- and the rhetoric that has been used concerning the threat of force have increased tensions and have undermined georgia 's territorial integrity , " nato spokesman james appathurai said on wednesday . " the allies are unanimous in supporting , endorsing georgia 's territorial integrity and will not recognize or support steps that undermine that sovereignty , " he said . nato announced at a summit early this month that georgia would one day become a member of the 26-nation military alliance , in the face of fierce russian opposition . russia objects to nato moving closer to its borders and is deeply concerned that the breakaway regions could be destabilized by tbilisi 's rapprochement with moscow 's old cold war-era foe . georgia claims that russia has , over the last three months , strengthened its control over abkhazia and established direct ties with the local authorities . the russian peacekeeping announcement only fuelled problems , said president mikheil saakashvili 's new " special representative " and top georgian diplomat , david bakradze . georgians reject russia 's peacekeeping claim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the build-up in the rebel regions is causing tensions " it 's hard to believe that this is being done for the purposes of peacekeeping , it 's rather the beginning of full-scale military aggression , " he told reporters .
" the georgian side , as the host country , should be notified in advance and there should be consent from georgia on any troop deployment , including peacekeepers .
we have not been notified . " " peacekeeping is not strengthened by unilateral steps . " russia has peacekeepers in abkhazia and south ossetia under an agreement with georgia from the 1990s following wars in which separatists broke away and established close ties with moscow . the russian defense ministry did not say how many extra soldiers were being sent , but said that 15 new observation posts would be set up on the frontline in abkhazia .
around 2,000 russians serve there and a further 1,000 in south ossetia . " any attempt by the georgian side to resolve the conflicts with force against russian peacekeepers and also against russian citizens ... will be met with an adequate and tough answer , " news agencies quoted the ministry as saying . no plans revealed for georgia action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia has not revealed any plans to retaliate as the rhetoric escalated , appathurai said that neither russia nor georgia had informed the military alliance of any plans to actually move their forces , although he said moscow could " technically " do so without notifying nato . but he said : " have no doubt ; everyone is watching very carefully what is happening on the ground . " bakradze said that a un mission monitoring georgia and abhkazia , unomig , " verifies everything " in terms of his country 's military deployments .
" if there is something on our side , it will immediately be known , " he said , adding : " we 're not going to move troops . " in a statement on april 21 , unomig said that its monitors " did not observe anything to substantiate reports of a build-up of forces on either side . " nato and georgian officials have confirmed that alliance ambassadors , in the so-called north atlantic council , will travel to georgia in " coming months " in a show of support for the would-be candidate . georgia attempts to defuse situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president saakashvili called for an end to the conflict georgia appeared to be attempting to prevent the dispute with russia from further escalating with president mikhail saakashvili saying that the country sought an end to the conflict . in a televised address to the people of abkhazia and south ossetia , saakashvili said : " georgia wants peace . " earlier wednesday , georgia attacked russia 's plans to boost peacekeeping troops in the two breakaway georgian regions as the start of " full scale military aggression . " the georgian foreign ministry called the plan an " act of irresponsible provocation , " russian news agency interfax reported . the remarks came after russia 's defense ministry announced tuesday an increase in peacekeeping forces to abkhazia and south ossetia in response to what it called aggressive moves by pro-western georgia . " if georgia puts in place the threats it has made on a number of occasions about the use of force , we would be forced to take retaliatory measures to protect the lives of our citizens , " russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said . eu criticize russian deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana is suspicious of the motives for the deployment the eu leaders called for calm , with eu foreign policy chief javier solana saying that the bloc would like to " de-escalate the tension . " abkhazia and south ossetia are both russian-dominated regions of georgia which fought brief separatist wars in the early 1990s and which still reject tbilisi 's rule . the georgian authorities insist that the two regions are its sovereign territory and accuse moscow of supporting the rebels .
most inhabitants of the two regions hold russian passports . in the light of rising tensions between georgia and its two regions over the past week , russia decided on tuesday to send more peacekeeping troops into the breakaway provinces . that decision was " not wise , " even if it was in line with peace agreements , solana said . osce leaders express concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the members of the osce have expressed concern finland , current chair of the 56-nation organization for security and cooperation in europe -lsb- ocse -rsb- expressed concern wednesday over " increased tension " in georgia . finnish foreign minister alexander stubb issued a statement repeating previous concern over moscow 's decision to establish ties with two breakaway regions in georgia . stubb said the april 20 downing of georgian drone over abkhazia " and the recent military build-up have considerably increased tension in the region . " he said he had telephoned president saakashvili and foreign minister lavrov as part of attempts to avert further escalation . the osce was prepared to aid the peace process and supported the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia within its internationally recognized borders , the statement said . dw staff / dpa / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

georgian officials said the move is the start of military aggression against tbilisi . the soldiers " are completing their deployment at their positions in the tkvarcheli district of abkhazia , " russia 's three main news agencies quoted the russian defense ministry press office as saying . troops were setting up camp , defenses and communications , the itar-tass , ria novosti and interfax agencies all reported . russian officials have still not released information on exactly how many additional troops are being sent to the separatist georgian region to bolster the more than 2,000 soldiers already there .
the russians are deployed under accords ending the separatist war between georgia and the abkhaz minority in the early 1990s . the defense ministry stressed that the " total number of russian peacekeepers does not exceed the numerical limits agreed under international agreements , " the agencies reported . concern in european union russia 's move , to counter what it said was the massing of georgian troops near abkhazia and south ossetia , raised concern in the united states while the european union has said that any military build-up would not be wise . " the steps that have been taken -lsb- by russia -rsb- and the rhetoric that has been used concerning the threat of force have increased tensions and have undermined georgia 's territorial integrity , " nato spokesman james appathurai said on wednesday . " the allies are unanimous in supporting , endorsing georgia 's territorial integrity and will not recognize or support steps that undermine that sovereignty , " he said . nato announced at a summit early this month that georgia would one day become a member of the 26-nation military alliance , in the face of fierce russian opposition . russia objects to nato moving closer to its borders and is deeply concerned that the breakaway regions could be destabilized by tbilisi 's rapprochement with moscow 's old cold war-era foe . georgia claims that russia has , over the last three months , strengthened its control over abkhazia and established direct ties with the local authorities . the russian peacekeeping announcement only fuelled problems , said president mikheil saakashvili 's new " special representative " and top georgian diplomat , david bakradze . georgians reject russia 's peacekeeping claim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the build-up in the rebel regions is causing tensions " it 's hard to believe that this is being done for the purposes of peacekeeping , it 's rather the beginning of full-scale military aggression , " he told reporters .
" the georgian side , as the host country , should be notified in advance and there should be consent from georgia on any troop deployment , including peacekeepers .
we have not been notified . " " peacekeeping is not strengthened by unilateral steps . " russia has peacekeepers in abkhazia and south ossetia under an agreement with georgia from the 1990s following wars in which separatists broke away and established close ties with moscow . the russian defense ministry did not say how many extra soldiers were being sent , but said that 15 new observation posts would be set up on the frontline in abkhazia .
around 2,000 russians serve there and a further 1,000 in south ossetia . " any attempt by the georgian side to resolve the conflicts with force against russian peacekeepers and also against russian citizens ... will be met with an adequate and tough answer , " news agencies quoted the ministry as saying . no plans revealed for georgia action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia has not revealed any plans to retaliate as the rhetoric escalated , appathurai said that neither russia nor georgia had informed the military alliance of any plans to actually move their forces , although he said moscow could " technically " do so without notifying nato . but he said : " have no doubt ; everyone is watching very carefully what is happening on the ground . " bakradze said that a un mission monitoring georgia and abhkazia , unomig , " verifies everything " in terms of his country 's military deployments .
" if there is something on our side , it will immediately be known , " he said , adding : " we 're not going to move troops . " in a statement on april 21 , unomig said that its monitors " did not observe anything to substantiate reports of a build-up of forces on either side . " nato and georgian officials have confirmed that alliance ambassadors , in the so-called north atlantic council , will travel to georgia in " coming months " in a show of support for the would-be candidate . georgia attempts to defuse situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president saakashvili called for an end to the conflict georgia appeared to be attempting to prevent the dispute with russia from further escalating with president mikhail saakashvili saying that the country sought an end to the conflict . in a televised address to the people of abkhazia and south ossetia , saakashvili said : " georgia wants peace . " earlier wednesday , georgia attacked russia 's plans to boost peacekeeping troops in the two breakaway georgian regions as the start of " full scale military aggression . " the georgian foreign ministry called the plan an " act of irresponsible provocation , " russian news agency interfax reported . the remarks came after russia 's defense ministry announced tuesday an increase in peacekeeping forces to abkhazia and south ossetia in response to what it called aggressive moves by pro-western georgia . " if georgia puts in place the threats it has made on a number of occasions about the use of force , we would be forced to take retaliatory measures to protect the lives of our citizens , " russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said . eu criticize russian deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana is suspicious of the motives for the deployment the eu leaders called for calm , with eu foreign policy chief javier solana saying that the bloc would like to " de-escalate the tension . " abkhazia and south ossetia are both russian-dominated regions of georgia which fought brief separatist wars in the early 1990s and which still reject tbilisi 's rule . the georgian authorities insist that the two regions are its sovereign territory and accuse moscow of supporting the rebels .
most inhabitants of the two regions hold russian passports . in the light of rising tensions between georgia and its two regions over the past week , russia decided on tuesday to send more peacekeeping troops into the breakaway provinces . that decision was " not wise , " even if it was in line with peace agreements , solana said . osce leaders express concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the members of the osce have expressed concern finland , current chair of the 56-nation organization for security and cooperation in europe -lsb- ocse -rsb- expressed concern wednesday over " increased tension " in georgia . finnish foreign minister alexander stubb issued a statement repeating previous concern over moscow 's decision to establish ties with two breakaway regions in georgia . stubb said the april 20 downing of georgian drone over abkhazia " and the recent military build-up have considerably increased tension in the region . " he said he had telephoned president saakashvili and foreign minister lavrov as part of attempts to avert further escalation . the osce was prepared to aid the peace process and supported the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia within its internationally recognized borders , the statement said . dw staff / dpa / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

georgian officials said the move is the start of military aggression against tbilisi . the soldiers " are completing their deployment at their positions in the tkvarcheli district of abkhazia , " russia 's three main news agencies quoted the russian defense ministry press office as saying . troops were setting up camp , defenses and communications , the itar-tass , ria novosti and interfax agencies all reported . russian officials have still not released information on exactly how many additional troops are being sent to the separatist georgian region to bolster the more than 2,000 soldiers already there .
the russians are deployed under accords ending the separatist war between georgia and the abkhaz minority in the early 1990s . the defense ministry stressed that the " total number of russian peacekeepers does not exceed the numerical limits agreed under international agreements , " the agencies reported . concern in european union russia 's move , to counter what it said was the massing of georgian troops near abkhazia and south ossetia , raised concern in the united states while the european union has said that any military build-up would not be wise . " the steps that have been taken -lsb- by russia -rsb- and the rhetoric that has been used concerning the threat of force have increased tensions and have undermined georgia 's territorial integrity , " nato spokesman james appathurai said on wednesday . " the allies are unanimous in supporting , endorsing georgia 's territorial integrity and will not recognize or support steps that undermine that sovereignty , " he said . nato announced at a summit early this month that georgia would one day become a member of the 26-nation military alliance , in the face of fierce russian opposition . russia objects to nato moving closer to its borders and is deeply concerned that the breakaway regions could be destabilized by tbilisi 's rapprochement with moscow 's old cold war-era foe . georgia claims that russia has , over the last three months , strengthened its control over abkhazia and established direct ties with the local authorities . the russian peacekeeping announcement only fuelled problems , said president mikheil saakashvili 's new " special representative " and top georgian diplomat , david bakradze . georgians reject russia 's peacekeeping claim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the build-up in the rebel regions is causing tensions " it 's hard to believe that this is being done for the purposes of peacekeeping , it 's rather the beginning of full-scale military aggression , " he told reporters .
" the georgian side , as the host country , should be notified in advance and there should be consent from georgia on any troop deployment , including peacekeepers .
we have not been notified . " " peacekeeping is not strengthened by unilateral steps . " russia has peacekeepers in abkhazia and south ossetia under an agreement with georgia from the 1990s following wars in which separatists broke away and established close ties with moscow . the russian defense ministry did not say how many extra soldiers were being sent , but said that 15 new observation posts would be set up on the frontline in abkhazia .
around 2,000 russians serve there and a further 1,000 in south ossetia . " any attempt by the georgian side to resolve the conflicts with force against russian peacekeepers and also against russian citizens ... will be met with an adequate and tough answer , " news agencies quoted the ministry as saying . no plans revealed for georgia action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia has not revealed any plans to retaliate as the rhetoric escalated , appathurai said that neither russia nor georgia had informed the military alliance of any plans to actually move their forces , although he said moscow could " technically " do so without notifying nato . but he said : " have no doubt ; everyone is watching very carefully what is happening on the ground . " bakradze said that a un mission monitoring georgia and abhkazia , unomig , " verifies everything " in terms of his country 's military deployments .
" if there is something on our side , it will immediately be known , " he said , adding : " we 're not going to move troops . " in a statement on april 21 , unomig said that its monitors " did not observe anything to substantiate reports of a build-up of forces on either side . " nato and georgian officials have confirmed that alliance ambassadors , in the so-called north atlantic council , will travel to georgia in " coming months " in a show of support for the would-be candidate . georgia attempts to defuse situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president saakashvili called for an end to the conflict georgia appeared to be attempting to prevent the dispute with russia from further escalating with president mikhail saakashvili saying that the country sought an end to the conflict . in a televised address to the people of abkhazia and south ossetia , saakashvili said : " georgia wants peace . " earlier wednesday , georgia attacked russia 's plans to boost peacekeeping troops in the two breakaway georgian regions as the start of " full scale military aggression . " the georgian foreign ministry called the plan an " act of irresponsible provocation , " russian news agency interfax reported . the remarks came after russia 's defense ministry announced tuesday an increase in peacekeeping forces to abkhazia and south ossetia in response to what it called aggressive moves by pro-western georgia . " if georgia puts in place the threats it has made on a number of occasions about the use of force , we would be forced to take retaliatory measures to protect the lives of our citizens , " russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said . eu criticize russian deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana is suspicious of the motives for the deployment the eu leaders called for calm , with eu foreign policy chief javier solana saying that the bloc would like to " de-escalate the tension . " abkhazia and south ossetia are both russian-dominated regions of georgia which fought brief separatist wars in the early 1990s and which still reject tbilisi 's rule . the georgian authorities insist that the two regions are its sovereign territory and accuse moscow of supporting the rebels .
most inhabitants of the two regions hold russian passports . in the light of rising tensions between georgia and its two regions over the past week , russia decided on tuesday to send more peacekeeping troops into the breakaway provinces . that decision was " not wise , " even if it was in line with peace agreements , solana said . osce leaders express concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the members of the osce have expressed concern finland , current chair of the 56-nation organization for security and cooperation in europe -lsb- ocse -rsb- expressed concern wednesday over " increased tension " in georgia . finnish foreign minister alexander stubb issued a statement repeating previous concern over moscow 's decision to establish ties with two breakaway regions in georgia . stubb said the april 20 downing of georgian drone over abkhazia " and the recent military build-up have considerably increased tension in the region . " he said he had telephoned president saakashvili and foreign minister lavrov as part of attempts to avert further escalation . the osce was prepared to aid the peace process and supported the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia within its internationally recognized borders , the statement said . dw staff / dpa / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

foreign minister steinmeier told dw what culture can do for politics . deutsche welle : mr. steinmeier , israeli literature is being presented in the german foreign ministry , but do you ever get a chance to pick up a novel ? foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier : i have never stopped doing it .
not during my time as foreign minister and not in the years before as head of the chancellery - where things also never got boring .
reading is a part of life for me .
that 's why i 'm pleased that it 's still possible for me to read - on long flights or weekends - and , yes , i also read israeli literature . do you have any favorite books or authors ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : literature can help give people a look at other 's lives , steinmeier said i do n't have a favorite book .
it changes all the time for me .
sometimes i engage myself with particular regions .
this year that 's foreseeable since it 's the year the state of israel - with which we have multifaceted , and naturally political meetings - celebrates its 60th birthday . at the moment i 'm also trying to support forms of memory and knowledge among younger generations here in germany .
we can no longer be sure that recourse to history books will address israel 's particular situation and the special relationship between israel and germany comprehensibly enough for young people .
that 's why i think it 's important for younger generations in particular to look at israel 's multifaceted literature . it 's literature that is not characterized by pessimism or depression .
many authors are using very witty language that sometimes covers over the suffering and tension seen in their own country .
once you have an entry point , you can develop a sense for the diversity of life in israel .
that 's why i think that this literature appeals to readers in germany - possibly even more now because , i think , a new generation of israeli literature is emerging .
it 's dealing less with the holocaust and instead looking at the history of growth and development of the state of israel and immigration , which has not been free of tension in israel .
it 's immigration that is accompanied by people bringing the history of their country of origin with them .
this history is not regarded as a simply as a weight but as an enrichment , and that could really be an example to others .
all of this can be found in modern israeli literature . can culture influence political culture ? no , i would never see it as that instrumental .
culture is not a servant to political policy , and culture is n't able to fill the gaps where politics or political instruments have failed .
but i think that in order to understand each other , there needs to be - in addition to the political establishment 's relations - a real interest and curiosity from both sides about other people .
this curiosity can be better served by culture , and especially literature , than it can be by political statements . after the series of israeli literature in the foreign ministry ends , will there be a continuation with other focuses ? that 's something i could imagine .
but this is an experiment for this year , and i 'm pleased that many people have come to see the exhibit .
if the level of interest keeps up , i could imagine that we continue it next year with a different focus . interview : cornelia rabitz -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the club 's brazilian defender ze roberto tells dw-world.de what motivates the bavarian giants . dw-world.de : ze roberto , let 's talk about the coming game with zenit st. petersburg .
can bayern munich make it to the uefa cup final ?
how high are the chances ?
ze roberto : we have a big chance to reach the final in spite of the result from the first leg of the semi-final at home .
we can win and want to win in st. petersburg .
we are on a good run and have had some luck on our side .
this luck may have helped in the bundesliga and maybe even in the uefa cup , if you consider the crazy game against getafe , but can you count on it ?
the games in europe are very different from the ones played in the bundesliga or the german cup .
in the uefa cup you have a lot of teams which are not seen as being the biggest in europe but are nevertheless very strong and have a lot of quality .
they want to win this title .
the problem has been for us the games at home , such as against getafe and last week against zenit .
can you explain why the results have been so close and the ties so complicated when bayern has the potential to get a result quickly and more clearly ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ze roberto is at a loss to explain why bayern fade we have recently had two types of halves in these games .
in the first half we are normally dominant , aggressive and determined .
in the second half , though , we have been unable to maintain that level .
i ca n't explain why .
maybe after so many games we are tired .
but the fact is , unfortunately , it is in the second half that we often give things away .
but to get to the final of the uefa cup , the team must be able to maintain that first half level of dominance for the whole 90 minutes .
that 's right .
we plan to perform for the whole game in st. petersburg at the level we showed in the first half of the game against zenit in munich .
is it a mental problem that the team can not maintain such a high level for the whole game ?
it is a primarily a psychological problem and also a physical problem with tiredness .
nevertheless , we always come out of the dressing room with the vision of victory in our heads , regardless of who our opponent is .
lucio was the unlucky figure last week in the first game against zenit - his own goal gave st. petersburg the draw and set up the nervous match in russia .
does the team stand behind him ?
has he regained his confidence ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio 's own goal complicates the tie with zenit the sort of own goal lucio scored seldom happens under normal circumstances .
we are a real team , and we stand behind lucio .
if we did not support him then we would not be a team because the idea of unity would be absent .
lucio is extremely motivated , just like we all are and our combined purpose is the welfare of the team - not the honoring or castigating of individuals .
you have never played as continuously throughout a season as you have during this campaign .
how are you feeling ?
everything is going well .
i 'm surprised myself to have played so often , but i have remained free of injuries and from health problems .
it is a very positive thing to feel so physically and emotionally fit at the end of the season .
has it been a difficult season ?
one does not experience a season of challenges like this every year , maybe once every three or five years .
it is nice to be in this position where we are playing for three trophies which we want to win .
we have the german cup , the league championship is very close - we only need one more point - and we have a great chance in the uefa cup .
we have talked a lot about this and our coach ottmar hitzfeld has gone over with us many times how special this is .
this is something great we are creating , something that is very special and that motivates us .
in spite of the tiredness ?
yes .
this motivation , these big challenges help us to overcome the tiredness .
we are concentrating very much and the bones and muscles will stay strong because we stand on the brink of a historical event .
at the age of 33 , do you feel the demands of the three different competitions greater than others ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ze roberto 's body tells him when he 's in need of a break yes , i feel the demands even more intensely today than i did when i was 25 years old or 20 .
as i said , i feel good , but my body lets me know when i need a break .
on the other hand , my experience as a player helps .
i know better what i need to do to recover .
i hear my body , i count on my experience and i think more like a professional than i did when i was younger .
only thinking like this has allowed me to play longer at this high level .
is this bayern munich team the best you have ever played for ?
no , the best team was the national team of brazil .
now if the question refers to club level , i must answer with a very strong " yes . "
this team , bayern munich , is fantastic .
we are very strong as a group and we have in the players who can make a difference in every game .
to be allowed to play with ribery , luca toni or klose is very motivating .
there is always the desire to win everything .

georgian officials said the move is the start of military aggression against tbilisi . the soldiers " are completing their deployment at their positions in the tkvarcheli district of abkhazia , " russia 's three main news agencies quoted the russian defense ministry press office as saying . troops were setting up camp , defenses and communications , the itar-tass , ria novosti and interfax agencies all reported . russian officials have still not released information on exactly how many additional troops are being sent to the separatist georgian region to bolster the more than 2,000 soldiers already there .
the russians are deployed under accords ending the separatist war between georgia and the abkhaz minority in the early 1990s . the defense ministry stressed that the " total number of russian peacekeepers does not exceed the numerical limits agreed under international agreements , " the agencies reported . concern in european union russia 's move , to counter what it said was the massing of georgian troops near abkhazia and south ossetia , raised concern in the united states while the european union has said that any military build-up would not be wise . " the steps that have been taken -lsb- by russia -rsb- and the rhetoric that has been used concerning the threat of force have increased tensions and have undermined georgia 's territorial integrity , " nato spokesman james appathurai said on wednesday . " the allies are unanimous in supporting , endorsing georgia 's territorial integrity and will not recognize or support steps that undermine that sovereignty , " he said . nato announced at a summit early this month that georgia would one day become a member of the 26-nation military alliance , in the face of fierce russian opposition . russia objects to nato moving closer to its borders and is deeply concerned that the breakaway regions could be destabilized by tbilisi 's rapprochement with moscow 's old cold war-era foe . georgia claims that russia has , over the last three months , strengthened its control over abkhazia and established direct ties with the local authorities . the russian peacekeeping announcement only fuelled problems , said president mikheil saakashvili 's new " special representative " and top georgian diplomat , david bakradze . georgians reject russia 's peacekeeping claim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the build-up in the rebel regions is causing tensions " it 's hard to believe that this is being done for the purposes of peacekeeping , it 's rather the beginning of full-scale military aggression , " he told reporters .
" the georgian side , as the host country , should be notified in advance and there should be consent from georgia on any troop deployment , including peacekeepers .
we have not been notified . " " peacekeeping is not strengthened by unilateral steps . " russia has peacekeepers in abkhazia and south ossetia under an agreement with georgia from the 1990s following wars in which separatists broke away and established close ties with moscow . the russian defense ministry did not say how many extra soldiers were being sent , but said that 15 new observation posts would be set up on the frontline in abkhazia .
around 2,000 russians serve there and a further 1,000 in south ossetia . " any attempt by the georgian side to resolve the conflicts with force against russian peacekeepers and also against russian citizens ... will be met with an adequate and tough answer , " news agencies quoted the ministry as saying . no plans revealed for georgia action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia has not revealed any plans to retaliate as the rhetoric escalated , appathurai said that neither russia nor georgia had informed the military alliance of any plans to actually move their forces , although he said moscow could " technically " do so without notifying nato . but he said : " have no doubt ; everyone is watching very carefully what is happening on the ground . " bakradze said that a un mission monitoring georgia and abhkazia , unomig , " verifies everything " in terms of his country 's military deployments .
" if there is something on our side , it will immediately be known , " he said , adding : " we 're not going to move troops . " in a statement on april 21 , unomig said that its monitors " did not observe anything to substantiate reports of a build-up of forces on either side . " nato and georgian officials have confirmed that alliance ambassadors , in the so-called north atlantic council , will travel to georgia in " coming months " in a show of support for the would-be candidate . georgia attempts to defuse situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president saakashvili called for an end to the conflict georgia appeared to be attempting to prevent the dispute with russia from further escalating with president mikhail saakashvili saying that the country sought an end to the conflict . in a televised address to the people of abkhazia and south ossetia , saakashvili said : " georgia wants peace . " earlier wednesday , georgia attacked russia 's plans to boost peacekeeping troops in the two breakaway georgian regions as the start of " full scale military aggression . " the georgian foreign ministry called the plan an " act of irresponsible provocation , " russian news agency interfax reported . the remarks came after russia 's defense ministry announced tuesday an increase in peacekeeping forces to abkhazia and south ossetia in response to what it called aggressive moves by pro-western georgia . " if georgia puts in place the threats it has made on a number of occasions about the use of force , we would be forced to take retaliatory measures to protect the lives of our citizens , " russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said . eu criticize russian deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana is suspicious of the motives for the deployment the eu leaders called for calm , with eu foreign policy chief javier solana saying that the bloc would like to " de-escalate the tension . " abkhazia and south ossetia are both russian-dominated regions of georgia which fought brief separatist wars in the early 1990s and which still reject tbilisi 's rule . the georgian authorities insist that the two regions are its sovereign territory and accuse moscow of supporting the rebels .
most inhabitants of the two regions hold russian passports . in the light of rising tensions between georgia and its two regions over the past week , russia decided on tuesday to send more peacekeeping troops into the breakaway provinces . that decision was " not wise , " even if it was in line with peace agreements , solana said . osce leaders express concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the members of the osce have expressed concern finland , current chair of the 56-nation organization for security and cooperation in europe -lsb- ocse -rsb- expressed concern wednesday over " increased tension " in georgia . finnish foreign minister alexander stubb issued a statement repeating previous concern over moscow 's decision to establish ties with two breakaway regions in georgia . stubb said the april 20 downing of georgian drone over abkhazia " and the recent military build-up have considerably increased tension in the region . " he said he had telephoned president saakashvili and foreign minister lavrov as part of attempts to avert further escalation . the osce was prepared to aid the peace process and supported the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia within its internationally recognized borders , the statement said . dw staff / dpa / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

georgian officials said the move is the start of military aggression against tbilisi . the soldiers " are completing their deployment at their positions in the tkvarcheli district of abkhazia , " russia 's three main news agencies quoted the russian defense ministry press office as saying . troops were setting up camp , defenses and communications , the itar-tass , ria novosti and interfax agencies all reported . russian officials have still not released information on exactly how many additional troops are being sent to the separatist georgian region to bolster the more than 2,000 soldiers already there .
the russians are deployed under accords ending the separatist war between georgia and the abkhaz minority in the early 1990s . the defense ministry stressed that the " total number of russian peacekeepers does not exceed the numerical limits agreed under international agreements , " the agencies reported . concern in european union russia 's move , to counter what it said was the massing of georgian troops near abkhazia and south ossetia , raised concern in the united states while the european union has said that any military build-up would not be wise . " the steps that have been taken -lsb- by russia -rsb- and the rhetoric that has been used concerning the threat of force have increased tensions and have undermined georgia 's territorial integrity , " nato spokesman james appathurai said on wednesday . " the allies are unanimous in supporting , endorsing georgia 's territorial integrity and will not recognize or support steps that undermine that sovereignty , " he said . nato announced at a summit early this month that georgia would one day become a member of the 26-nation military alliance , in the face of fierce russian opposition . russia objects to nato moving closer to its borders and is deeply concerned that the breakaway regions could be destabilized by tbilisi 's rapprochement with moscow 's old cold war-era foe . georgia claims that russia has , over the last three months , strengthened its control over abkhazia and established direct ties with the local authorities . the russian peacekeeping announcement only fuelled problems , said president mikheil saakashvili 's new " special representative " and top georgian diplomat , david bakradze . georgians reject russia 's peacekeeping claim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the build-up in the rebel regions is causing tensions " it 's hard to believe that this is being done for the purposes of peacekeeping , it 's rather the beginning of full-scale military aggression , " he told reporters .
" the georgian side , as the host country , should be notified in advance and there should be consent from georgia on any troop deployment , including peacekeepers .
we have not been notified . " " peacekeeping is not strengthened by unilateral steps . " russia has peacekeepers in abkhazia and south ossetia under an agreement with georgia from the 1990s following wars in which separatists broke away and established close ties with moscow . the russian defense ministry did not say how many extra soldiers were being sent , but said that 15 new observation posts would be set up on the frontline in abkhazia .
around 2,000 russians serve there and a further 1,000 in south ossetia . " any attempt by the georgian side to resolve the conflicts with force against russian peacekeepers and also against russian citizens ... will be met with an adequate and tough answer , " news agencies quoted the ministry as saying . no plans revealed for georgia action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia has not revealed any plans to retaliate as the rhetoric escalated , appathurai said that neither russia nor georgia had informed the military alliance of any plans to actually move their forces , although he said moscow could " technically " do so without notifying nato . but he said : " have no doubt ; everyone is watching very carefully what is happening on the ground . " bakradze said that a un mission monitoring georgia and abhkazia , unomig , " verifies everything " in terms of his country 's military deployments .
" if there is something on our side , it will immediately be known , " he said , adding : " we 're not going to move troops . " in a statement on april 21 , unomig said that its monitors " did not observe anything to substantiate reports of a build-up of forces on either side .

" earlier wednesday , georgia attacked russia 's plans to boost peacekeeping troops in the two breakaway georgian regions as the start of " full scale military aggression . " the georgian foreign ministry called the plan an " act of irresponsible provocation , " russian news agency interfax reported . the remarks came after russia 's defense ministry announced tuesday an increase in peacekeeping forces to abkhazia and south ossetia in response to what it called aggressive moves by pro-western georgia . " if georgia puts in place the threats it has made on a number of occasions about the use of force , we would be forced to take retaliatory measures to protect the lives of our citizens , " russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said . eu criticize russian deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana is suspicious of the motives for the deployment the eu leaders called for calm , with eu foreign policy chief javier solana saying that the bloc would like to " de-escalate the tension . " abkhazia and south ossetia are both russian-dominated regions of georgia which fought brief separatist wars in the early 1990s and which still reject tbilisi 's rule . the georgian authorities insist that the two regions are its sovereign territory and accuse moscow of supporting the rebels .
most inhabitants of the two regions hold russian passports . in the light of rising tensions between georgia and its two regions over the past week , russia decided on tuesday to send more peacekeeping troops into the breakaway provinces . that decision was " not wise , " even if it was in line with peace agreements , solana said . osce leaders express concern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the members of the osce have expressed concern finland , current chair of the 56-nation organization for security and cooperation in europe -lsb- ocse -rsb- expressed concern wednesday over " increased tension " in georgia . finnish foreign minister alexander stubb issued a statement repeating previous concern over moscow 's decision to establish ties with two breakaway regions in georgia . stubb said the april 20 downing of georgian drone over abkhazia " and the recent military build-up have considerably increased tension in the region .

db owns rail companies outside germany and is also a major road transport operator within germany .
the heads of the two parties in merkel 's coalition agreed monday on selling off a stake in the passenger and freight services , while retaining the railtracks , stations , power generation and signaling in state hands .
estimates on the value of the 24.9-per-cent stake in passenger and freight services run to around 6 billion euros -lsb- $ 9.5 billion -rsb- .
the issue provoked months of debate within the broad coalition government , comprising merkel 's conservative christian cdu / csu bloc and its traditional rival , the social democrats -lsb- spd -rsb- .
the spd conceded ground in the debate , backing away from a proposal to sell the db stake as " people 's shares . "
instead , the offering is expected to go to big institutions , with some shares being sold to rail employees .
conservatives aim to double the stake bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel with deutsche bahn ceo hartmut mehdorn the cdu / csu hopes to later double the stake sold off to 49.9 percent , but still intends to retain the 34,000-kilometre track network in state hands .
db , which has 237,000 employees , has reached a pre-privatization accord with unions ruling out layoffs for the next 15 years .
berlin says two thirds of the money raised in the flotation will be channeled back into modernizing the tracks , shabby stations and building sound-barriers to cut acoustic pollution next to tracks .
details are to be set out in a future contract with db .
part of the remaining one third will end up in the general federal budget or be used to increase db 's general funds . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" ivan the terrible " still wanted despite being freed ivan demjanjuk , who participated in the mass murder of jews in sobibor death camp and also served in majdanek death camp , is number two on the list .
demjanjuk stood trial in jerusalem in the late 1980 's , on suspicion he was the death camp guard known as " ivan the terrible " , but was freed through " reasonable doubt " .

the club 's brazilian defender ze roberto tells dw-world.de what motivates the bavarian giants . dw-world.de : ze roberto , let 's talk about the coming game with zenit st. petersburg .
can bayern munich make it to the uefa cup final ?
how high are the chances ?
ze roberto : we have a big chance to reach the final in spite of the result from the first leg of the semi-final at home .
we can win and want to win in st. petersburg .
we are on a good run and have had some luck on our side .
this luck may have helped in the bundesliga and maybe even in the uefa cup , if you consider the crazy game against getafe , but can you count on it ?
the games in europe are very different from the ones played in the bundesliga or the german cup .
in the uefa cup you have a lot of teams which are not seen as being the biggest in europe but are nevertheless very strong and have a lot of quality .
they want to win this title .
the problem has been for us the games at home , such as against getafe and last week against zenit .
can you explain why the results have been so close and the ties so complicated when bayern has the potential to get a result quickly and more clearly ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ze roberto is at a loss to explain why bayern fade we have recently had two types of halves in these games .
in the first half we are normally dominant , aggressive and determined .
in the second half , though , we have been unable to maintain that level .
i ca n't explain why .
maybe after so many games we are tired .
but the fact is , unfortunately , it is in the second half that we often give things away .
but to get to the final of the uefa cup , the team must be able to maintain that first half level of dominance for the whole 90 minutes .
that 's right .
we plan to perform for the whole game in st. petersburg at the level we showed in the first half of the game against zenit in munich .
is it a mental problem that the team can not maintain such a high level for the whole game ?
it is a primarily a psychological problem and also a physical problem with tiredness .
nevertheless , we always come out of the dressing room with the vision of victory in our heads , regardless of who our opponent is .
lucio was the unlucky figure last week in the first game against zenit - his own goal gave st. petersburg the draw and set up the nervous match in russia .
does the team stand behind him ?
has he regained his confidence ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lucio 's own goal complicates the tie with zenit the sort of own goal lucio scored seldom happens under normal circumstances .
we are a real team , and we stand behind lucio .
if we did not support him then we would not be a team because the idea of unity would be absent .
lucio is extremely motivated , just like we all are and our combined purpose is the welfare of the team - not the honoring or castigating of individuals .
you have never played as continuously throughout a season as you have during this campaign .
how are you feeling ?
everything is going well .
i 'm surprised myself to have played so often , but i have remained free of injuries and from health problems .
it is a very positive thing to feel so physically and emotionally fit at the end of the season .
has it been a difficult season ?
one does not experience a season of challenges like this every year , maybe once every three or five years .
it is nice to be in this position where we are playing for three trophies which we want to win .
we have the german cup , the league championship is very close - we only need one more point - and we have a great chance in the uefa cup .
we have talked a lot about this and our coach ottmar hitzfeld has gone over with us many times how special this is .
this is something great we are creating , something that is very special and that motivates us .
in spite of the tiredness ?
yes .
this motivation , these big challenges help us to overcome the tiredness .
we are concentrating very much and the bones and muscles will stay strong because we stand on the brink of a historical event .
at the age of 33 , do you feel the demands of the three different competitions greater than others ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ze roberto 's body tells him when he 's in need of a break yes , i feel the demands even more intensely today than i did when i was 25 years old or 20 .
as i said , i feel good , but my body lets me know when i need a break .
on the other hand , my experience as a player helps .
i know better what i need to do to recover .
i hear my body , i count on my experience and i think more like a professional than i did when i was younger .
only thinking like this has allowed me to play longer at this high level .
is this bayern munich team the best you have ever played for ?
no , the best team was the national team of brazil .
now if the question refers to club level , i must answer with a very strong " yes . "
this team , bayern munich , is fantastic .
we are very strong as a group and we have in the players who can make a difference in every game .
to be allowed to play with ribery , luca toni or klose is very motivating .
there is always the desire to win everything .
this team emits such strength that we come to the stadium not only to play soccer , but also to defeat the opponent . daniel martinez interviewed ze roberto -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

brunner , an aide to adolf eichmann and responsible for deporting over 100,000 jews to nazi death camps from austria , greece , france and slovakia , is defined by the center as " the most important nazi war criminal who may still be alive . "
however the center said the chances that brunner , who was born in 1912 , and found refuge in syria , is still alive , " are relatively slim . "
" ivan the terrible " still wanted despite being freed ivan demjanjuk , who participated in the mass murder of jews in sobibor death camp and also served in majdanek death camp , is number two on the list .
demjanjuk stood trial in jerusalem in the late 1980 's , on suspicion he was the death camp guard known as " ivan the terrible " , but was freed through " reasonable doubt " .

heinrich boere , who as a member of a waffen-ss squad murdered three dutch civilians , is sixth ; in april 2008 he was indicted in germany for his crimes .
karoly zentai , who participated in manhunts , persecution and murder of jews in budapest in 1944 , is seventh .
he is currently appealing the extradition from austria which hungary has asked for .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf eichmann was one of those who did not get away mikhail gorshkow , who participated in the murder of jews in belarus , and is under investigation in estonia is eighth on the list .
algimantas dailide , who arrested jews later murdered by nazis and lithuanian collaborators , is ninth .
he was convicted in lithuania , which has so far refused to implement his sentence of imprisonment .
the list is rounded off with harry mannil , who arrested jews and communists executed by the nazis and their estonian collaborators .
he was cleared by investigation in estonia .

gerry mccann said they had always hoped they " would not get to this stage " .
his wife said the key message was that madeleine was still missing , she had been the victim of a " horrific crime " and the perpetrator was " out there " .
they told the bbc they kept hope alive because madeleine was " so important " to them that they would never give up .
" we need that key bit of information ... then this could all be over , " said kate mccann .
madeleine , of rothley , leicestershire , disappeared shortly before her fourth birthday in praia da luz , portugal , on 3 may last year .
her parents were eating with friends in a nearby tapas restaurant .
the mccanns still have arguido - or suspect - status in portugal but deny any wrongdoing . "
we are not characters in a soap opera or a fiction - this is about a real child and real family who have been traumatised " gerry mccann in an interview with the bbc 's huw edwards the couple said they had researched abduction cases in the us , and found hope in stories of missing children being found .
reeling off names of children recovered after long periods of abduction , gerry mccann said the evidence suggested that the younger a child was when they were taken the lower the chance they had suffered serious harm .
as long as there was no evidence of harm being done to madeleine , they would not give up , he said .
" and what a disservice it would be to madeleine to assume otherwise , without any evidence , " said mrs mccann .
" she 's still out there and we 're asking for help to find her , " added gerry mccann .
information ' missed ? '
the couple , whose campaign was the subject of a two-hour itv documentary on wednesday night , said they were convinced someone had details that could " unlock " the mystery of madeleine 's disappearance .
they have launched a new hotline number for information - 0845 8384699 - which can be called from within the uk or outside the country .
" we will guarantee anonymity for anyone who wants it , " said mr mccann .
campaign hotline from uk : 0845 8384699 from outside uk : 00 44 845 8384699 mrs mccann said even if people had come forward previously with information , they should make another approach .
she said there had been such a volume of information at the beginning that things could have been missed or not " slotted into place " at the time .
the couple said they had had no direct contact with police in portugal , and were not aware of what was being done to find their daughter .
they said they wanted more information but added that the situation was not unusual in the portuguese system .
the mccanns said that they realised there would be less intensive media coverage of the campaign after the first year had passed , and would only be appearing in the press if they felt they had something new to say .
the itv documentary revealed the extent of hate mail the family had received , showing one message calling the pair " scum " .
but the couple told the bbc they did not want to expend too much energy and focus on talking about those who had sent them hate mail , because they were a minority among well-wishers .
mr mccann said they hoped the documentary would - among other things - help remind people they were real people .
" we are not characters in a soap opera or a fiction .
this is about a real child and real family who have been traumatised by this . "
they said their twin children sean and amelie were " very happy " and enjoying as normal a life as possible .
they had taken professional advice about how to deal with the children 's questions , which they were answering truthfully but on a basic level , they said .
" they are still only three , " said mrs mccann .
" they talk about madeleine a lot , which is lovely .
they just say ' madeleine is missing ' and we say ' yes , we 're all looking for her ' . "
declaration meanwhile , the family is campaigning for an eu-wide quick response system to be introduced to help find abducted children .
campaigners say france and greece are the only eu countries to have alert systems as comprehensive as the american amber scheme , which involves immediate broadcasts on radio and television about missing children and information about possible suspects .
british police forces do operate an alert system , and belgium and germany have their own schemes , but the mccanns want a far more co-ordinated response plan across europe .
a european parliament declaration demanding the alert system opened for signatures last week , but needs the names of at least half the 785 meps before it has formal status as a resolution .
to date the declaration has attracted 127 names , but needs at least 393 by the end of june .

campaign hotline from uk : 0845 8384699 from outside uk : 00 44 845 8384699 mrs mccann said even if people had come forward previously with information , they should make another approach .
she said there had been such a volume of information at the beginning that things could have been missed or not " slotted into place " at the time .
the couple said they had had no direct contact with police in portugal , and were not aware of what was being done to find their daughter .
they said they wanted more information but added that the situation was not unusual in the portuguese system .
the mccanns said that they realised there would be less intensive media coverage of the campaign after the first year had passed , and would only be appearing in the press if they felt they had something new to say .
the mccanns said they saw hope in stories of other children being found the itv documentary revealed the extent of hate mail the family had received , showing one message calling the pair " scum " .
but the couple told the bbc they did not want to expend too much energy and focus on talking about those who had sent them hate mail , because they were a minority among well-wishers .
mr mccann said they hoped the documentary would - among other things - help remind people they were real people .
" we are not characters in a soap opera or a fiction .
this is about a real child and real family who have been traumatised by this . "
they said their twin children sean and amelie were " very happy " and enjoying as normal a life as possible .
they had taken professional advice about how to deal with the children 's questions , which they were answering truthfully but on a basic level , they said .
" they are still only three , " said mrs mccann .
" they talk about madeleine a lot , which is lovely .
they just say ' madeleine is missing ' and we say ' yes , we 're all looking for her ' . "
declaration meanwhile , the family is campaigning for an eu-wide quick response system to be introduced to help find abducted children .
campaigners say france and greece are the only eu countries to have alert systems as comprehensive as the american amber scheme , which involves immediate broadcasts on radio and television about missing children and information about possible suspects .
british police forces do operate an alert system , and belgium and germany have their own schemes , but the mccanns want a far more co-ordinated response plan across europe .
a european parliament declaration demanding the alert system opened for signatures last week , but needs the names of at least half the 785 meps before it has formal status as a resolution .
to date the declaration has attracted 127 names , but needs at least 393 by the end of june .

campaign hotline from uk : 0845 8384699 from outside uk : 00 44 845 8384699 mrs mccann said even if people had come forward previously with information , they should make another approach .
she said there had been such a volume of information at the beginning that things could have been missed or not " slotted into place " at the time .
the couple said they had had no direct contact with police in portugal , and were not aware of what was being done to find their daughter .
they said they wanted more information but added that the situation was not unusual in the portuguese system .
the mccanns said that they realised there would be less intensive media coverage of the campaign after the first year had passed , and would only be appearing in the press if they felt they had something new to say .
the mccanns said they saw hope in stories of other children being found the itv documentary revealed the extent of hate mail the family had received , showing one message calling the pair " scum " .
but the couple told the bbc they did not want to expend too much energy and focus on talking about those who had sent them hate mail , because they were a minority among well-wishers .
mr mccann said they hoped the documentary would - among other things - help remind people they were real people .
" we are not characters in a soap opera or a fiction .
this is about a real child and real family who have been traumatised by this . "
they said their twin children sean and amelie were " very happy " and enjoying as normal a life as possible .
they had taken professional advice about how to deal with the children 's questions , which they were answering truthfully but on a basic level , they said .
" they are still only three , " said mrs mccann .
" they talk about madeleine a lot , which is lovely .
they just say ' madeleine is missing ' and we say ' yes , we 're all looking for her ' . "
declaration meanwhile , the family is campaigning for an eu-wide quick response system to be introduced to help find abducted children .
campaigners say france and greece are the only eu countries to have alert systems as comprehensive as the american amber scheme , which involves immediate broadcasts on radio and television about missing children and information about possible suspects .
british police forces do operate an alert system , and belgium and germany have their own schemes , but the mccanns want a far more co-ordinated response plan across europe .
a european parliament declaration demanding the alert system opened for signatures last week , but needs the names of at least half the 785 meps before it has formal status as a resolution .
to date the declaration has attracted 127 names , but needs at least 393 by the end of june .

campaign hotline from uk : 0845 8384699 from outside uk : 00 44 845 8384699 mrs mccann said even if people had come forward previously with information , they should make another approach .
she said there had been such a volume of information at the beginning that things could have been missed or not " slotted into place " at the time .
the couple said they had had no direct contact with police in portugal , and were not aware of what was being done to find their daughter .
they said they wanted more information but added that the situation was not unusual in the portuguese system .
the mccanns said that they realised there would be less intensive media coverage of the campaign after the first year had passed , and would only be appearing in the press if they felt they had something new to say .
the mccanns said they saw hope in stories of other children being found the itv documentary revealed the extent of hate mail the family had received , showing one message calling the pair " scum " .
but the couple told the bbc they did not want to expend too much energy and focus on talking about those who had sent them hate mail , because they were a minority among well-wishers .
mr mccann said they hoped the documentary would - among other things - help remind people they were real people .
" we are not characters in a soap opera or a fiction .
this is about a real child and real family who have been traumatised by this . "
they said their twin children sean and amelie were " very happy " and enjoying as normal a life as possible .
they had taken professional advice about how to deal with the children 's questions , which they were answering truthfully but on a basic level , they said .
" they are still only three , " said mrs mccann .
" they talk about madeleine a lot , which is lovely .
they just say ' madeleine is missing ' and we say ' yes , we 're all looking for her ' . "
declaration meanwhile , the family is campaigning for an eu-wide quick response system to be introduced to help find abducted children .
campaigners say france and greece are the only eu countries to have alert systems as comprehensive as the american amber scheme , which involves immediate broadcasts on radio and television about missing children and information about possible suspects .
british police forces do operate an alert system , and belgium and germany have their own schemes , but the mccanns want a far more co-ordinated response plan across europe .
a european parliament declaration demanding the alert system opened for signatures last week , but needs the names of at least half the 785 meps before it has formal status as a resolution .
to date the declaration has attracted 127 names , but needs at least 393 by the end of june .

lamar fike and marty lacker , two of presley 's inner circle nicknamed the " memphis mafia " , insist he never travelled to england .
veteran rock star tommy steele recently acknowledged a story that he took presley on a secret tour of london .
" my apologies to tommy , but it did not happen , " said mr fike , who was in the us army with presley in germany .
" i was with him the whole time , " he told the bbc news website .
" i got there two days after he got there .
he was confined to base . "
presley did visit paris and munich during his 18 months in germany , mr fike said , but added : " had he gone to england , i 'd have been there . "
theatre producer bill kenwright recently told a bbc radio show that presley flew into london for a day " when he was in the forces " and steele showed him landmarks such as the houses of parliament .
' shared thrill ' in a note to the daily mail newspaper , steele said he " swore never to divulge publicly " what took place and " regrets " that news leaked out .
" i can only hope he -lsb- presley -rsb- can forgive me , " he said .
" it was an event shared by two young men sharing the same love of their music and the same thrill of achieving something unimaginable . "
presley joined the us army in march 1958 , and was stationed in friedberg , germany , from october 1958 .
his only confirmed visit to the uk was to prestwick airport , near glasgow , where his aeroplane stopped to refuel on his way back to the us in 1960 .
mr fike was introduced to presley by record pioneer sam phillips in 1954 .
movie plan " we just became very fast friends , " he said .
" i travelled with him and went to hollywood with him in ' 57 and we did jailhouse rock .
" then when he went into the service , i tried to join because i wanted to be with him .
we were just close , close friends . "
mr fike is about to publish a book about his time with the " king of rock " , called an uncommon journey .
he has also written a screenplay based on his memoir which he said was currently being considered by five movie studios .
" it will be a heck of a picture , " he said .
" it wo n't be any low budget picture , it 's going to be an expensive picture . "

he looks back on a brilliant season for roberto martinez 's men and explains why it will dwell long in the memory .
we 've done it !
after 24 years the swans are finally flying high again in the second tier of english football - and boy does it feel good .
i will admit when roberto martinez took over at the helm last season i had my doubts .
after all we were getting rid of a manager who had got us promoted to division one , won a trophy and been just a penalty shoot-out away from the championship .
and what were we getting in return ?
a former player , albeit a great one , with no managerial experience .
well it 's brilliant to be proved wrong and since the day he took over roberto has proven to be a fantastic manager .
one of his great strengths is that he certainly has an eye for a player and the summer signings of bodde , scotland , rangle and bauza have proven to be the foundation of this season 's success .
his loan signings have also been shrewd and i do n't think there is a fan out there who is n't praying we can secure the services of the exciting paul anderson from liverpool again next season .
manager roberto martinez is now a swansea all-time great couple that with roberto 's philosophy of stylish free-flowing football , largely played on the deck , and this season has been the finest i can remember since attending my first game at the vetch way back in 1990 .
roberto says he has a special affiliation with the club and the fans are in complete agreement .
he was hero-worshiped as a player but his achievements this season have lifted him into the realms of the swansea all-time greats .
and yet way back in august things had hardly started with a flourish with an opening day defeat at oldham and further defeats to doncaster and leeds in september leaving the swans mid-table .
i think the turning point came in early october when we travelled to the then leaders orient and won 5-0 .
that was a sign that this team was starting to gel and confidence was on the up .
november heralded the start of that wonderful 17 game unbeaten league run that lasted four months and saw us playing the best football i 've ever seen by a swansea team .
ok we wobbled a bit near the end - but i think that anyone who has seen swansea regularly this season will admit that we deserve our place as champions .
it is a bit annoying that swansea were n't presented with the trophy at the last home game because of the possibility leeds might get their 15 points back .
i just hope we win our remaining game so even if they get the points back we are still champions .
i remember vividly going to the crunch game against hull at the vetch in 2003 when if we had lost the swans would have been relegated to the conference .
it 's amazing that in only five seasons we are now in the championship , we 've got a fantastic all-seater stadium and we are in good financial shape .
it 's been a real rollercoaster supporting swansea over the last 18 years and great credit needs to go to everyone involved with the club to get us where we are today .
being promoted will boost the city and revive rivalry with cardiff and so to the future .
i really think we have the nucleus of a team that can not only survive but flourish in the championship .
none of the realistic fans in swansea expect immediate success in the championship and we realise that a few seasons of rebuilding and consolidation are upon us .
championship football is great news for swansea as a city too and everyone is looking forward to the derby games with cardiff next season .
personally , rivalries aside , i want to see all the welsh clubs doing well but it does feel that we have been in the shadow of cardiff for a long time now .
to stand toe to toe with them in the championship is going to be exciting and i hope we can prove that swansea is just as big a club in terms of support and attracting the right players .
i 'm just happy to be there !

mr chavez has set his sights on turning siderurgica del orinco -lrb- sidor -rrb- , which was 60 % controlled by luxembourg-based ternium , into a " socialist company " .
talks to buy ternium 's stake collapsed when the sides could not agree a price .
mr chavez has taken control of foreign owned cement , telecommunications , electricity , oil and gas companies .
the president believes companies should concentrate on the domestic market before overseas sales , and has branded his reforms as " 21st century socialism " .
mr chavez , whose government already owned 20 % of sidor , threatened to take control of the company last year unless it sold more of its steel in venezuela .
he has sided with workers , who wanted better pay and benefits .
separately , the president has increased the country 's minimum wage by about 30 % to offset the impact of inflation caused by the soaring oil price .

for entrepreneurs above all , the environment seems harsher .
fearless inventors are not put off by adversity harsher , because of the credit crunch -lrb- yes , even those words have now become commonplace in pub conversations -rrb- .
it makes banks less willing to lend money and certainly less willing to take risks .
harsher , because house prices are falling and so the option of financing a business by mortgaging a home is far less available .
and harsher too , because consumers are facing a bit if a crunch of their own .
it will probably become harder to sell to them as people start to retrench on their spending , having saved rather too little for the last few years , borrowed too much and having relied too much on housing as a source of wealth .
key question given all this , one might well expect that fewer new businesses will be created in the next three years than in the last three .
for evidence , go back to the last boom-bust cycle in the late 80s and early 90s .
a crude indicator of the amount of new business activity occurring is the number of new vat registrations that are made within a period .
and that fell sharply from the peak of the last boom .
from 259,000 registrations in 1989 , the number had fallen by more than a quarter to 187,000 by 1992 .
are we about to see a similar decline in entrepreneurial activity ?
this is an important question for dragons ' den .
fresh challenges the venture capital tv programme has been a huge success since its first series in 2005 .
but the years since 2005 have been rather favourable for new businesses .
what changes is that the external environment is less forgiving of any mistakes investors make for series 6 of dragons den , now entering production , the question is whether britain 's entrepreneurs have the resilience to weather difficult economic times ?
i suspect the answer to the question is " yes " .
if there are two things that generally characterise successful entrepreneurs , one is the ability to think positively , and the other is the ability to see an opportunity where others see a problem .
this is clearly a time for those attributes to shin .
for example , i heard somebody on the radio the other day say that the good thing about current conditions is that the banks and other lenders will be more discriminating .
the good news is that you can be sure that any companies that are formed , succeed or grow are ones that have real strengths .
cautious investors what does that mean for the investors and entrepreneurs in dragons den and in the traditional world of business start-ups ?
in principle , those investments are not usually about short term profit opportunities that will only survive benign conditions .
investors usually want to spot businesses with long term prospects , ideally those that can be scaled up into something large and valuable for a sale down the line .
so the tougher environment does not change the job of the dragons or other professional venture capital investors ; it should not change the kinds of decisions they make .
what changes is that the external environment is less forgiving of any mistakes investors make .
the dragons will find out more quickly in a harsh market , what they should not have backed .
that might make investors a little more cautious .
robust ideas if it does , it will have a consequence for entrepreneurs .
they will have to go further than before to impress , to iron out any wrinkles in their business plans and to ensure they have preparations for all contingencies .
some entrepreneurs will be deterred by the challenge ; some will try and fail , but quite a few will still succeed in jumping over the bar even it has been raised a little .
whatever housing market storms erupt , however crisis-ridden the banks , whatever the gloominess of consumers , i suspect there will be new ideas and innovations ; there will be plenty of ambitious entrepreneurs and there will be some good new businesses .
what the next few years will remind us is that while flimsy ideas can fly in the upswing of a boom , they will pretty quickly flop when the economic going gets tough .
robust ideas though , are those that can fly come what may .
have you got what it takes to convince the dragons that your idea is simply the best ?

for entrepreneurs above all , the environment seems harsher .
fearless inventors are not put off by adversity harsher , because of the credit crunch -lrb- yes , even those words have now become commonplace in pub conversations -rrb- .
it makes banks less willing to lend money and certainly less willing to take risks .
harsher , because house prices are falling and so the option of financing a business by mortgaging a home is far less available .
and harsher too , because consumers are facing a bit if a crunch of their own .
it will probably become harder to sell to them as people start to retrench on their spending , having saved rather too little for the last few years , borrowed too much and having relied too much on housing as a source of wealth .
key question given all this , one might well expect that fewer new businesses will be created in the next three years than in the last three .
for evidence , go back to the last boom-bust cycle in the late 80s and early 90s .
a crude indicator of the amount of new business activity occurring is the number of new vat registrations that are made within a period .
and that fell sharply from the peak of the last boom .
from 259,000 registrations in 1989 , the number had fallen by more than a quarter to 187,000 by 1992 .
are we about to see a similar decline in entrepreneurial activity ?
this is an important question for dragons ' den .
fresh challenges the venture capital tv programme has been a huge success since its first series in 2005 .
but the years since 2005 have been rather favourable for new businesses .
what changes is that the external environment is less forgiving of any mistakes investors make for series 6 of dragons den , now entering production , the question is whether britain 's entrepreneurs have the resilience to weather difficult economic times ?
i suspect the answer to the question is " yes " .
if there are two things that generally characterise successful entrepreneurs , one is the ability to think positively , and the other is the ability to see an opportunity where others see a problem .
this is clearly a time for those attributes to shin .
for example , i heard somebody on the radio the other day say that the good thing about current conditions is that the banks and other lenders will be more discriminating .
the good news is that you can be sure that any companies that are formed , succeed or grow are ones that have real strengths .
cautious investors what does that mean for the investors and entrepreneurs in dragons den and in the traditional world of business start-ups ?
in principle , those investments are not usually about short term profit opportunities that will only survive benign conditions .
investors usually want to spot businesses with long term prospects , ideally those that can be scaled up into something large and valuable for a sale down the line .
so the tougher environment does not change the job of the dragons or other professional venture capital investors ; it should not change the kinds of decisions they make .
what changes is that the external environment is less forgiving of any mistakes investors make .
the dragons will find out more quickly in a harsh market , what they should not have backed .
that might make investors a little more cautious .
robust ideas if it does , it will have a consequence for entrepreneurs .
they will have to go further than before to impress , to iron out any wrinkles in their business plans and to ensure they have preparations for all contingencies .
some entrepreneurs will be deterred by the challenge ; some will try and fail , but quite a few will still succeed in jumping over the bar even it has been raised a little .
whatever housing market storms erupt , however crisis-ridden the banks , whatever the gloominess of consumers , i suspect there will be new ideas and innovations ; there will be plenty of ambitious entrepreneurs and there will be some good new businesses .
what the next few years will remind us is that while flimsy ideas can fly in the upswing of a boom , they will pretty quickly flop when the economic going gets tough .
robust ideas though , are those that can fly come what may .
have you got what it takes to convince the dragons that your idea is simply the best ?

" do we really require so many gardening programmes , makeover programmes or celebrity chefs ? " he asked .
sir david said it was " a scandal " that there was " no place for continuing series of programmes about science or serious music or in-depth interviews " .
the presenter was giving a speech about public service broadcasting in london .
he singled out the bbc 's long-running science show tomorrow 's world as a " very inventive programme " , and said the demise of such strands was " sad " .
however , the life on earth and blue planet presenter paid tribute to the " pioneering " work of the bbc 's natural history unit , based in bristol .
" it is a prime example of what public service broadcasting can achieve , " he said .
' pariahs ' sir david 's most recent wildlife series was life in cold blood sir david was controller of bbc two for four years until 1969 , before spending three years as director of programmes across both bbc one and bbc two .

at its best , he acknowledged the bbc achieved these aims .
" but i have to say that there are moments when i wonder , " he added .
" there are times when both bbc one and bbc two , intoxicated by the sudden popularity of a programme genre , have allowed that genre to proliferate and run rampant through the schedules , with the result that other kinds of programmes are not placed - simply because of lack of space . "
he argues that niche channels have n't done too well for audiences bbc parliament controller peter knowles read peter 's thoughts in full sir david also addressed ofcom 's recent suggestion that the bbc 's licence fee could be shared with commercial broadcasters to help pay for public service programmes such as news and children 's programmes .
he said the idea had merit , but that regulation would be needed to ensure that such programmes would not be pushed out of peak-time .
" they become the schedule 's pariahs , retained under sufferance , tucked away , unloved , where they do least harm to the network 's income , " he added .
the wildlife presenter 's lecture was part of a series organised by the bbc to debate ofcom 's review of public service broadcasting .
comedian stephen fry and former observer editor will hutton will also deliver their personal views on the issue in coming weeks .

families have fought a determined campaign to keep six primary schools and a nursery open .
some cried following the vote at full council , which saw 23 councillors for the proposals and 14 against .
aberdeen city council said falling rolls meant the cost of maintaining buildings could no longer be justified .
it said it preferred to spend the money on educating pupils rather than on crumbling buildings .
the vote came after a four-hour debate on wednesday night .
causwayend , victoria road and hilton nursery were earmarked for closure earlier this year , along with the merger of four others - byron park and westerton , and st machar and donbank .
one parent said campaigners were now considering legal action .
" we 'll have to get lawyers involved now .
we want resignations from the council .
we 're not going to stand by and let this happen , " she said .
another described the outcome as " very disappointing " and added that the council had refused to answer many questions put to them .
however , deputy leader of the snp / lib dem-led council kevin stewart said the decision was taken with the best interests of pupils in mind .
' best education ' he told bbc scotland : " quite frankly we have 30,000 school places and only 22,000 pupils - we can not afford to pay for buildings when we should be paying for education .
" we have to ensure that there is a level playing field for all children and that we can provide the best education possible for them . "
labour leader councillor len ironside accused the council of making a grave error .
he said : " it 's an absolute slap in the teeth to the people of aberdeen - minds were made up before this consultation was ever started . "
and he argued that the surplus capacity in some schools could have been put to a wider community use .
" you could bring in the nhs or post offices that people are so worried about disappearing .
but the council did n't want to hear anything other than what they 'd made their minds up about two months ago - it 's disgraceful . "
aberdeen central labour msp lewis macdonald called on scottish ministers to step in .
