on tuesday , karadzic filed a motion to the court claiming that judge alphons orie was not suitable to preside over his case . the president of the international criminal tribunal for former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , judge fausto pocar , said the prosecution had originally intended to combine karadzic 's case with the proceedings against momcilo perisic , one of the most senior generals under late serbian leader slobodan milosevic .
but after prosecutors recently informed the court they had changed their plans , the icty decided to assign the karadzic trial to a different judge .
karadzic labels judge inappropriate the former wartime bosnian serb leader had argued that orie would not be neutral , as he had already sentenced one of his close assistants in the balkan war , momcilo krajisnik .
the bosnian-serb war crimes suspect was captured in the serbian capital belgrade in july after nearly 13 years on the run .
he has been indicted for crimes against humanity and genocide over the massacre of up to 8,000 bosnian muslims in srebrenica in 1995 and the siege of sarajevo in which thousands of people were also killed .

" i do n't think this is a new cold war , " rice told reporters shortly after she signed a deal in warsaw on deploying part of a us missile shield on polish territory in the face of deep russian anger .
" it is a difficult time but i think we should n't overstate the depth of the difficulties , " rice said on wednesday , aug .
20 .
she noted that during the cold war , which lasted from the end of world war ii until the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 , there were vast ideological differences between east and west .
" the cold war is over , " she said .
washington plans to deploy 10 interceptor missiles in poland plus a radar facility in the neighbouring czech republic between 2011 and 2013 as part of a system to ward off what it says is the risk of attack by " rogue states " such as iran and north korea .
russia has rejected the us arguments for the shield - which was endorsed by all 26 nato member states earlier this year - dubbing it a security threat designed to undermine russia 's nuclear deterrent .
some russian politicians and generals have said poland must be prepared for a preventive attack on the site in the future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski says us missile shield will strengthen poland " poland made this decision as a sovereign state , " polish president lech kaczynski said in a speech to the nation broadcast late tuesday , as reported by bloomberg news .
" nobody has the right to tell poland what to do - those times have passed . "
us-russia relations at low-point the signing of the missile deal comes with relations between moscow and the us - as well as with america 's nato allies - at their lowest ebb in years over russia 's conflict with pro-western georgia .
as the conflict in georgia continues to simmer , rice warned russia that it is playing " a very dangerous game " by resuming cold war-era strategic bomber patrols close to the alaskan coast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian tu-95 's have flown patrols near alaska " russia is a state that is , unfortunately , using the one tool that it has always used whenever it wishes to deliver a message , and that 's its military power , " rice said en route to an emergency meeting of nato foreign ministers wednesday .
" that 's not the way to deal in the 21st century . ”
she said russia 's renewed aviation activity was " a very dangerous game and perhaps one that i suggest the russians want to reconsider .
this is not one that is cost-free . "
russia trying to undermine saakashvili : rice rice added that the alaska patrols and the invasion of georgia contradicted russia 's stated desire for political and economic integration into the international community .
she charged that russia 's offensive deep into georgia was aimed at " undermining " the pro-us government of president mikhail saakashvili and crippling the impoverished nation by damaging and destroying vital economic infrastructure .
" that is an objective that will be denied because georgian democracy stands and it will stand with the help of its allies around the world , " rice said .
" georgian infrastructure will be rebuilt .
georgia 's economy will be reinforced . "
rice said that nato foreign ministers would consider measures to reinforce us and european support for georgia 's territorial integrity .
but she said the united states would not push to accelerate approval by the 26 foreign ministers of plans for the admission to nato of georgia and the former soviet republic of ukraine . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on tuesday , karadzic filed a motion to the court claiming that judge alphons orie was not suitable to preside over his case . the president of the international criminal tribunal for former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , judge fausto pocar , said the prosecution had originally intended to combine karadzic 's case with the proceedings against momcilo perisic , one of the most senior generals under late serbian leader slobodan milosevic .
but after prosecutors recently informed the court they had changed their plans , the icty decided to assign the karadzic trial to a different judge .
karadzic labels judge inappropriate the former wartime bosnian serb leader had argued that orie would not be neutral , as he had already sentenced one of his close assistants in the balkan war , momcilo krajisnik .
the bosnian-serb war crimes suspect was captured in the serbian capital belgrade in july after nearly 13 years on the run .
he has been indicted for crimes against humanity and genocide over the massacre of up to 8,000 bosnian muslims in srebrenica in 1995 and the siege of sarajevo in which thousands of people were also killed .

she said nato took note of the decision .
however , the spokeswoman told reporters that alliance foreign ministers had already agreed earlier in the week that they could not continue business as usual with russia until moscow fulfiled the terms of its peace deal with georgia .
the tit-for-tat refusals to cooperate mark the lowest point in nato-russia relations since the foundation of the nato-russia council , a body which was meant to improve dialogue between the cold war foes , in 2002 .
however , both sides have also stressed that they are keen to resume cooperation as soon as the other proves more tractable , in an apparent attempt to limit the diplomatic fallout of the conflict .
nato wo n't cooperate with russia : us spokesperson bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the white house says military cooperation with russia is currently a no-go simultaneously , the white house warned thursday that there can be no russia-nato military cooperation until the crisis in georgia has been remedied .

" it all depends on nato priorities : if they prefer to support the bankrupt saakashvili regime to partnership with russia , that will not be our fault , ” he said .
estonia , latvia , norway informed by letter in tallinn , a spokesman for estonia 's defence ministry said it had been informed by letter that russia had decided on the temporary suspension of military cooperation with nato states .
the spokesman said the note , consisting of one sentence , had no extra details or an indication of a timescale .

both latvia and estonia said their countries had no military cooperation with russia that would be affected by such a suspension .

" i do n't think this is a new cold war , " rice told reporters shortly after she signed a deal in warsaw on deploying part of a us missile shield on polish territory in the face of deep russian anger .
" it is a difficult time but i think we should n't overstate the depth of the difficulties , " rice said on wednesday , aug .
20 .
she noted that during the cold war , which lasted from the end of world war ii until the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 , there were vast ideological differences between east and west .
" the cold war is over , " she said .
washington plans to deploy 10 interceptor missiles in poland plus a radar facility in the neighbouring czech republic between 2011 and 2013 as part of a system to ward off what it says is the risk of attack by " rogue states " such as iran and north korea .
russia has rejected the us arguments for the shield - which was endorsed by all 26 nato member states earlier this year - dubbing it a security threat designed to undermine russia 's nuclear deterrent .
some russian politicians and generals have said poland must be prepared for a preventive attack on the site in the future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski says us missile shield will strengthen poland " poland made this decision as a sovereign state , " polish president lech kaczynski said in a speech to the nation broadcast late tuesday , as reported by bloomberg news .
" nobody has the right to tell poland what to do - those times have passed . "
us-russia relations at low-point the signing of the missile deal comes with relations between moscow and the us - as well as with america 's nato allies - at their lowest ebb in years over russia 's conflict with pro-western georgia .
as the conflict in georgia continues to simmer , rice warned russia that it is playing " a very dangerous game " by resuming cold war-era strategic bomber patrols close to the alaskan coast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian tu-95 's have flown patrols near alaska " russia is a state that is , unfortunately , using the one tool that it has always used whenever it wishes to deliver a message , and that 's its military power , " rice said en route to an emergency meeting of nato foreign ministers wednesday .
" that 's not the way to deal in the 21st century . ”
she said russia 's renewed aviation activity was " a very dangerous game and perhaps one that i suggest the russians want to reconsider .
this is not one that is cost-free . "
russia trying to undermine saakashvili : rice rice added that the alaska patrols and the invasion of georgia contradicted russia 's stated desire for political and economic integration into the international community .
she charged that russia 's offensive deep into georgia was aimed at " undermining " the pro-us government of president mikhail saakashvili and crippling the impoverished nation by damaging and destroying vital economic infrastructure .
" that is an objective that will be denied because georgian democracy stands and it will stand with the help of its allies around the world , " rice said .
" georgian infrastructure will be rebuilt .
georgia 's economy will be reinforced . "
rice said that nato foreign ministers would consider measures to reinforce us and european support for georgia 's territorial integrity .
but she said the united states would not push to accelerate approval by the 26 foreign ministers of plans for the admission to nato of georgia and the former soviet republic of ukraine . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

washington plans to deploy 10 interceptor missiles in poland plus a radar facility in the neighbouring czech republic between 2011 and 2013 as part of a system to ward off what it says is the risk of attack by " rogue states " such as iran and north korea .
russia has rejected the us arguments for the shield - which was endorsed by all 26 nato member states earlier this year - dubbing it a security threat designed to undermine russia 's nuclear deterrent .
some russian politicians and generals have said poland must be prepared for a preventive attack on the site in the future .

us-russia relations at low-point the signing of the missile deal comes with relations between moscow and the us - as well as with america 's nato allies - at their lowest ebb in years over russia 's conflict with pro-western georgia .

i mostly wanted to see the team try to make combinations , to move the ball quickly , to finish the game quickly .
the players interpreted that well and managed it very well . " loew praised young defender serdar tasci 's national team debut in front of the 34,117 spectators in nuremberg , adding that the 21-year-old " delivered everything we expected from him . " german striker lukas podolski missed a good opportunity when he was fouled hard by belgian goalkeeper stijn stijnen . a hard time for belgium despite displaying a mostly solid defense against germany , belgium could not deliver in the offensive third . " we had our chances against a good german side but technically we made some mistakes which was disappointing , " belgian coach rene vandereycken told reporters . it was germany 's first match of the new international soccer season and they are warming up ahead of their first world cup 2010 qualifier match against liechtenstein on sept .

dw spoke with two of them . in the early morning of aug .
21 , 1968 , when east german radio announced that " personalities of the party and the state of the czechoslovak socialist republic -lrb- cssr -rrb- " had called on the soviet union and other allied states to grant them " help , including help from armed forces , " hartmut zwahr was n't the only one choking on his breakfast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands still demonstrated peacefully in prague 's main square on aug .
20 , 1968 " my wife came into the kitchen and said : ' they 've invaded , " ' zwahr said .
" one had always feared that this was going to happen . " at the time , zwahr was a 32-year-old historian with high hopes at leipzig 's karl marx university .
he was fascinated by the attempts to renew socialism in the neighboring country .
he 's a member of germany 's sorb minority , speaks czech and regularly traveled to the cssr , where he read local papers , which at the time were often sold out in leipzig . sobering experience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander dubcek gave hope to east germans as well during the summer of 1968 , east germans were clearly on the side of the cssr 's reformist leader , alexander dubcek .
the invasion is a rude awakening after dreaming of socialism with a human face . " it was sobering , it was a knockdown , " zwahr said , adding that dubcek 's democratization efforts had already led to the release of political prisoners . " i began fearing the secret police , " he said .
" i stopped making friends in my field . " zwahr said he led a double life during the months of the prague spring .
at university , he functioned as it was expected of him as a good comrade . but at night , he filled his diary with entries about party meetings , where die-hard communists led the way and dubcek supporters kept quiet out of fear .
he wrote about his internal conflicts , his heretic thoughts , political jokes and the frustrations of everyday life .
only decades later , he published his diary under the tile " the swallow 's frozen wings . " typewritten protest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : becker 's protest brought her to prison hildegart becker , a 17-year-old student in the east german town of frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- near the polish border , also felt compelled to write during those days in august 1968 . together with a friend and her sister , she used the typewriter of her father , a protestant pastor , to compose a protest flyer against the invasion .
she sent them to residents in her city after getting their addresses from the phone book .
when she got to the letter k , agents from the stasi , the former east german secret police , were already at her door . " we 'd sent out about 150 letters , but very few actually reached their recipients , " becker said , adding that she found out later in her stasi files that many people turned the letters in to the authorities . in a strictly controlled republic , actions like becker 's represented a wave a protest . between aug .
21 and the end of november 1968 , 1,290 people in east germany were investigated for painting graffiti , distributing pamphlets or even just publicly criticizing the invasion , according to stasi files . those arrested included young workers , students , pupils , some of them the children of famous party and state functionaries . life-long memories becker ended up in prison for her actions .
from her cell , she was able to hear the bells of her father 's church .
while she was n't a member of east germany 's communist youth organizations , she still did n't see herself as an enemy of socialism . " it had a certain attraction , " she said .
" that 's why i thought : it ca n't be that they move in with tanks in socialism . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east germans followed their czech neighbors in 1989 after three months in jail , becker was released just in time to celebrate christmas with her family .
she was allowed to finish school and study civil engineering and theology .
she became active in east germany 's democratization movement of 1989 . hartmut zwahr , on the other hand , became a respected social historian , who taught in leipzig until 2001 .
his diary is n't the only thing that reminds him of the prague spring : his son 's name is alexander , just like 1968 socialist alexander dubcek . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw spoke with two of them . in the early morning of aug .
21 , 1968 , when east german radio announced that " personalities of the party and the state of the czechoslovak socialist republic -lrb- cssr -rrb- " had called on the soviet union and other allied states to grant them " help , including help from armed forces , " hartmut zwahr was n't the only one choking on his breakfast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands still demonstrated peacefully in prague 's main square on aug .
20 , 1968 " my wife came into the kitchen and said : ' they 've invaded , " ' zwahr said .
" one had always feared that this was going to happen . " at the time , zwahr was a 32-year-old historian with high hopes at leipzig 's karl marx university .
he was fascinated by the attempts to renew socialism in the neighboring country .
he 's a member of germany 's sorb minority , speaks czech and regularly traveled to the cssr , where he read local papers , which at the time were often sold out in leipzig . sobering experience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander dubcek gave hope to east germans as well during the summer of 1968 , east germans were clearly on the side of the cssr 's reformist leader , alexander dubcek .
the invasion is a rude awakening after dreaming of socialism with a human face . " it was sobering , it was a knockdown , " zwahr said , adding that dubcek 's democratization efforts had already led to the release of political prisoners . " i began fearing the secret police , " he said .
" i stopped making friends in my field . " zwahr said he led a double life during the months of the prague spring .
at university , he functioned as it was expected of him as a good comrade . but at night , he filled his diary with entries about party meetings , where die-hard communists led the way and dubcek supporters kept quiet out of fear .
he wrote about his internal conflicts , his heretic thoughts , political jokes and the frustrations of everyday life .
only decades later , he published his diary under the tile " the swallow 's frozen wings . " typewritten protest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : becker 's protest brought her to prison hildegart becker , a 17-year-old student in the east german town of frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- near the polish border , also felt compelled to write during those days in august 1968 . together with a friend and her sister , she used the typewriter of her father , a protestant pastor , to compose a protest flyer against the invasion .
she sent them to residents in her city after getting their addresses from the phone book .
when she got to the letter k , agents from the stasi , the former east german secret police , were already at her door . " we 'd sent out about 150 letters , but very few actually reached their recipients , " becker said , adding that she found out later in her stasi files that many people turned the letters in to the authorities . in a strictly controlled republic , actions like becker 's represented a wave a protest . between aug .
21 and the end of november 1968 , 1,290 people in east germany were investigated for painting graffiti , distributing pamphlets or even just publicly criticizing the invasion , according to stasi files . those arrested included young workers , students , pupils , some of them the children of famous party and state functionaries . life-long memories becker ended up in prison for her actions .
from her cell , she was able to hear the bells of her father 's church .
while she was n't a member of east germany 's communist youth organizations , she still did n't see herself as an enemy of socialism . " it had a certain attraction , " she said .
" that 's why i thought : it ca n't be that they move in with tanks in socialism . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east germans followed their czech neighbors in 1989 after three months in jail , becker was released just in time to celebrate christmas with her family .
she was allowed to finish school and study civil engineering and theology .
she became active in east germany 's democratization movement of 1989 . hartmut zwahr , on the other hand , became a respected social historian , who taught in leipzig until 2001 .
his diary is n't the only thing that reminds him of the prague spring : his son 's name is alexander , just like 1968 socialist alexander dubcek . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

these soldier-athletes have won their country countless medals over the years , but they are not quite ordinary soldiers . the repeated success of german soldiers at the biathlon is perhaps unsurprising given their military shooting training , but the bundeswehr athletes ' expertise is by no means limited to militant pursuits . this was demonstrated by germany 's first gold medalists at the beijing olympics , corporals alexander grimm and ole bischof , in single kayak slalom and middleweight judo , respectively . the success of these soldier-athletes may seem less surprising considering the german ministry of defense spends 27 million euros -lrb- $ 40 million -rrb- each year on supporting top athletes and is one of the biggest supporters of sports in germany . soccer world champion and two-time bronze medalist kerstin stegemann belongs to one of the army 's training programs .

she said nato took note of the decision .
however , the spokeswoman told reporters that alliance foreign ministers had already agreed earlier in the week that they could not continue business as usual with russia until moscow fulfiled the terms of its peace deal with georgia .
the tit-for-tat refusals to cooperate mark the lowest point in nato-russia relations since the foundation of the nato-russia council , a body which was meant to improve dialogue between the cold war foes , in 2002 .
however , both sides have also stressed that they are keen to resume cooperation as soon as the other proves more tractable , in an apparent attempt to limit the diplomatic fallout of the conflict .
nato wo n't cooperate with russia : us spokesperson bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the white house says military cooperation with russia is currently a no-go simultaneously , the white house warned thursday that there can be no russia-nato military cooperation until the crisis in georgia has been remedied .

" it all depends on nato priorities : if they prefer to support the bankrupt saakashvili regime to partnership with russia , that will not be our fault , ” he said .
estonia , latvia , norway informed by letter in tallinn , a spokesman for estonia 's defence ministry said it had been informed by letter that russia had decided on the temporary suspension of military cooperation with nato states .
the spokesman said the note , consisting of one sentence , had no extra details or an indication of a timescale .
in latvia , a spokesman for the defence ministry said his nation had also received such a note .
both latvia and estonia said their countries had no military cooperation with russia that would be affected by such a suspension .

21 , that it had sold its stake in the ailing business bank ikb to lone star for an undisclosed price . the dallas-based equity group is to acquire a 90.8 percent stake in ikb , which specializes in loans to small and medium sized businesses . ikb 's stock price skyrocketed by more than 10 percent when news of the deal reached traders on thursday . last year , kfw was forced to throw ikb a financial lifeline worth 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 14.8 billion dollars -rrb- as the global credit crunch triggered by us mortgage industry upheaval took shape . despite the bailouts , the battered bank was hit by heavy losses .
ikb collapsed in july 2007 when a department that bought subprime mortgages ran out of funds .
four ikb managers were since ousted , included ceo stefan ortseifen . in march , german stock market operator deutsche boerse suspended trading in ikb shares after the bank revealed that it did not expect to post a significant profit for the foreseeable future . the decision came after an auction of most of ikb 's 3 billion euro portfolio of risky securities had been suspended due to a lack of satisfactory bids . in april , ikb was also subject to investigation for possible insider trading . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she said nato took note of the decision .
however , the spokeswoman told reporters that alliance foreign ministers had already agreed earlier in the week that they could not continue business as usual with russia until moscow fulfiled the terms of its peace deal with georgia .
the tit-for-tat refusals to cooperate mark the lowest point in nato-russia relations since the foundation of the nato-russia council , a body which was meant to improve dialogue between the cold war foes , in 2002 .
however , both sides have also stressed that they are keen to resume cooperation as soon as the other proves more tractable , in an apparent attempt to limit the diplomatic fallout of the conflict .

" it all depends on nato priorities : if they prefer to support the bankrupt saakashvili regime to partnership with russia , that will not be our fault , ” he said .
estonia , latvia , norway informed by letter in tallinn , a spokesman for estonia 's defence ministry said it had been informed by letter that russia had decided on the temporary suspension of military cooperation with nato states .
the spokesman said the note , consisting of one sentence , had no extra details or an indication of a timescale .
in latvia , a spokesman for the defence ministry said his nation had also received such a note .
both latvia and estonia said their countries had no military cooperation with russia that would be affected by such a suspension .

in just his second appearance for his country , 19-year-old marko marin scored the match 's second goal with a curling shot into the far corner in the 77th minute . " the result is very satisfactory , the 2-0 win was well deserved , " germany coach joachim loew said , according to the dpa news agency .
" but the result was of secondary importance to me .
i mostly wanted to see the team try to make combinations , to move the ball quickly , to finish the game quickly .
the players interpreted that well and managed it very well . " loew praised young defender serdar tasci 's national team debut in front of the 34,117 spectators in nuremberg , adding that the 21-year-old " delivered everything we expected from him . " german striker lukas podolski missed a good opportunity when he was fouled hard by belgian goalkeeper stijn stijnen . a hard time for belgium despite displaying a mostly solid defense against germany , belgium could not deliver in the offensive third . " we had our chances against a good german side but technically we made some mistakes which was disappointing , " belgian coach rene vandereycken told reporters . it was germany 's first match of the new international soccer season and they are warming up ahead of their first world cup 2010 qualifier match against liechtenstein on sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nato -pipe- 21.08.2008 russia halts nato military cooperation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has suspended military cooperation with nato nations nato says russia has halted all military cooperation with the western alliance in the latest sign of tension between moscow and the west over the invasion of georgia . alliance spokeswoman carmen romero said thursday that nato had received notification through military channels that russia 's defense ministry had decided “ to halt international military cooperation events between russia and nato countries until further instructions . ”
she said nato took note of the decision .
however , the spokeswoman told reporters that alliance foreign ministers had already agreed earlier in the week that they could not continue business as usual with russia until moscow fulfiled the terms of its peace deal with georgia .
the tit-for-tat refusals to cooperate mark the lowest point in nato-russia relations since the foundation of the nato-russia council , a body which was meant to improve dialogue between the cold war foes , in 2002 .
however , both sides have also stressed that they are keen to resume cooperation as soon as the other proves more tractable , in an apparent attempt to limit the diplomatic fallout of the conflict .
nato wo n't cooperate with russia : us spokesperson bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the white house says military cooperation with russia is currently a no-go simultaneously , the white house warned thursday that there can be no russia-nato military cooperation until the crisis in georgia has been remedied .
" i ca n't imagine a circumstance right now that we would engage in military cooperation with the russians until the situation in georgia is resolved , " us national security council spokesman gordon johndroe told reporters .

" i do n't think this is a new cold war , " rice told reporters shortly after she signed a deal in warsaw on deploying part of a us missile shield on polish territory in the face of deep russian anger .
" it is a difficult time but i think we should n't overstate the depth of the difficulties , " rice said on wednesday , aug .

washington plans to deploy 10 interceptor missiles in poland plus a radar facility in the neighbouring czech republic between 2011 and 2013 as part of a system to ward off what it says is the risk of attack by " rogue states " such as iran and north korea .
russia has rejected the us arguments for the shield - which was endorsed by all 26 nato member states earlier this year - dubbing it a security threat designed to undermine russia 's nuclear deterrent .

" that 's not the way to deal in the 21st century . ”
she said russia 's renewed aviation activity was " a very dangerous game and perhaps one that i suggest the russians want to reconsider .
this is not one that is cost-free . "
russia trying to undermine saakashvili : rice rice added that the alaska patrols and the invasion of georgia contradicted russia 's stated desire for political and economic integration into the international community .
she charged that russia 's offensive deep into georgia was aimed at " undermining " the pro-us government of president mikhail saakashvili and crippling the impoverished nation by damaging and destroying vital economic infrastructure .
" that is an objective that will be denied because georgian democracy stands and it will stand with the help of its allies around the world , " rice said .
" georgian infrastructure will be rebuilt .
georgia 's economy will be reinforced . "
rice said that nato foreign ministers would consider measures to reinforce us and european support for georgia 's territorial integrity .
but she said the united states would not push to accelerate approval by the 26 foreign ministers of plans for the admission to nato of georgia and the former soviet republic of ukraine . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i do n't think this is a new cold war , " rice told reporters shortly after she signed a deal in warsaw on deploying part of a us missile shield on polish territory in the face of deep russian anger .
" it is a difficult time but i think we should n't overstate the depth of the difficulties , " rice said on wednesday , aug .
20 .
she noted that during the cold war , which lasted from the end of world war ii until the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 , there were vast ideological differences between east and west .
" the cold war is over , " she said .
washington plans to deploy 10 interceptor missiles in poland plus a radar facility in the neighbouring czech republic between 2011 and 2013 as part of a system to ward off what it says is the risk of attack by " rogue states " such as iran and north korea .
russia has rejected the us arguments for the shield - which was endorsed by all 26 nato member states earlier this year - dubbing it a security threat designed to undermine russia 's nuclear deterrent .
some russian politicians and generals have said poland must be prepared for a preventive attack on the site in the future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski says us missile shield will strengthen poland " poland made this decision as a sovereign state , " polish president lech kaczynski said in a speech to the nation broadcast late tuesday , as reported by bloomberg news .
" nobody has the right to tell poland what to do - those times have passed . "
us-russia relations at low-point the signing of the missile deal comes with relations between moscow and the us - as well as with america 's nato allies - at their lowest ebb in years over russia 's conflict with pro-western georgia .
as the conflict in georgia continues to simmer , rice warned russia that it is playing " a very dangerous game " by resuming cold war-era strategic bomber patrols close to the alaskan coast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian tu-95 's have flown patrols near alaska " russia is a state that is , unfortunately , using the one tool that it has always used whenever it wishes to deliver a message , and that 's its military power , " rice said en route to an emergency meeting of nato foreign ministers wednesday .
" that 's not the way to deal in the 21st century . ”
she said russia 's renewed aviation activity was " a very dangerous game and perhaps one that i suggest the russians want to reconsider .
this is not one that is cost-free . "
russia trying to undermine saakashvili : rice rice added that the alaska patrols and the invasion of georgia contradicted russia 's stated desire for political and economic integration into the international community .
she charged that russia 's offensive deep into georgia was aimed at " undermining " the pro-us government of president mikhail saakashvili and crippling the impoverished nation by damaging and destroying vital economic infrastructure .
" that is an objective that will be denied because georgian democracy stands and it will stand with the help of its allies around the world , " rice said .
" georgian infrastructure will be rebuilt .
georgia 's economy will be reinforced . "
rice said that nato foreign ministers would consider measures to reinforce us and european support for georgia 's territorial integrity .
but she said the united states would not push to accelerate approval by the 26 foreign ministers of plans for the admission to nato of georgia and the former soviet republic of ukraine . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

21 , 1968 , when east german radio announced that " personalities of the party and the state of the czechoslovak socialist republic -lrb- cssr -rrb- " had called on the soviet union and other allied states to grant them " help , including help from armed forces , " hartmut zwahr was n't the only one choking on his breakfast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands still demonstrated peacefully in prague 's main square on aug .
20 , 1968 " my wife came into the kitchen and said : ' they 've invaded , " ' zwahr said .
" one had always feared that this was going to happen . " at the time , zwahr was a 32-year-old historian with high hopes at leipzig 's karl marx university .
he was fascinated by the attempts to renew socialism in the neighboring country .
he 's a member of germany 's sorb minority , speaks czech and regularly traveled to the cssr , where he read local papers , which at the time were often sold out in leipzig . sobering experience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander dubcek gave hope to east germans as well during the summer of 1968 , east germans were clearly on the side of the cssr 's reformist leader , alexander dubcek .
the invasion is a rude awakening after dreaming of socialism with a human face . " it was sobering , it was a knockdown , " zwahr said , adding that dubcek 's democratization efforts had already led to the release of political prisoners . " i began fearing the secret police , " he said .
" i stopped making friends in my field . " zwahr said he led a double life during the months of the prague spring .
at university , he functioned as it was expected of him as a good comrade . but at night , he filled his diary with entries about party meetings , where die-hard communists led the way and dubcek supporters kept quiet out of fear .
he wrote about his internal conflicts , his heretic thoughts , political jokes and the frustrations of everyday life .
only decades later , he published his diary under the tile " the swallow 's frozen wings .

she sent them to residents in her city after getting their addresses from the phone book .
when she got to the letter k , agents from the stasi , the former east german secret police , were already at her door . " we 'd sent out about 150 letters , but very few actually reached their recipients , " becker said , adding that she found out later in her stasi files that many people turned the letters in to the authorities . in a strictly controlled republic , actions like becker 's represented a wave a protest . between aug .
21 and the end of november 1968 , 1,290 people in east germany were investigated for painting graffiti , distributing pamphlets or even just publicly criticizing the invasion , according to stasi files . those arrested included young workers , students , pupils , some of them the children of famous party and state functionaries . life-long memories becker ended up in prison for her actions .
from her cell , she was able to hear the bells of her father 's church .
while she was n't a member of east germany 's communist youth organizations , she still did n't see herself as an enemy of socialism . " it had a certain attraction , " she said .
" that 's why i thought : it ca n't be that they move in with tanks in socialism . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east germans followed their czech neighbors in 1989 after three months in jail , becker was released just in time to celebrate christmas with her family .
she was allowed to finish school and study civil engineering and theology .
she became active in east germany 's democratization movement of 1989 . hartmut zwahr , on the other hand , became a respected social historian , who taught in leipzig until 2001 .
his diary is n't the only thing that reminds him of the prague spring : his son 's name is alexander , just like 1968 socialist alexander dubcek . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she said russia 's renewed aviation activity was " a very dangerous game and perhaps one that i suggest the russians want to reconsider .
this is not one that is cost-free . "
russia trying to undermine saakashvili : rice rice added that the alaska patrols and the invasion of georgia contradicted russia 's stated desire for political and economic integration into the international community .
she charged that russia 's offensive deep into georgia was aimed at " undermining " the pro-us government of president mikhail saakashvili and crippling the impoverished nation by damaging and destroying vital economic infrastructure .
" that is an objective that will be denied because georgian democracy stands and it will stand with the help of its allies around the world , " rice said .
" georgian infrastructure will be rebuilt .
georgia 's economy will be reinforced . "
rice said that nato foreign ministers would consider measures to reinforce us and european support for georgia 's territorial integrity .

norway could lose the bronze medal it won in the team show-jumping event after rider tony andre hansen 's horse camiro tested positive for the same banned substance capsaicin , the international equestrian federation -lrb- fei -rrb- confirmed thursday . if the b sample confirms the failed dope test then hansen 's team drop off the medal podium and will be replaced by switzerland .
gold in the event monday went to the united states while canada took silver . lantinus , the horse of ireland 's denis lynch , and brazilian bernhard alves ' horse chupa chup also failed dope tests , making lynch ineligible for thursday 's individual competition . it 's not the first time that the olympic equestrian events have been marred by doping .

21 , that it had sold its stake in the ailing business bank ikb to lone star for an undisclosed price . the dallas-based equity group is to acquire a 90.8 percent stake in ikb , which specializes in loans to small and medium sized businesses . ikb 's stock price skyrocketed by more than 10 percent when news of the deal reached traders on thursday . last year , kfw was forced to throw ikb a financial lifeline worth 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 14.8 billion dollars -rrb- as the global credit crunch triggered by us mortgage industry upheaval took shape . despite the bailouts , the battered bank was hit by heavy losses .
ikb collapsed in july 2007 when a department that bought subprime mortgages ran out of funds .
four ikb managers were since ousted , included ceo stefan ortseifen . in march , german stock market operator deutsche boerse suspended trading in ikb shares after the bank revealed that it did not expect to post a significant profit for the foreseeable future . the decision came after an auction of most of ikb 's 3 billion euro portfolio of risky securities had been suspended due to a lack of satisfactory bids . in april , ikb was also subject to investigation for possible insider trading . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on tuesday , karadzic filed a motion to the court claiming that judge alphons orie was not suitable to preside over his case . the president of the international criminal tribunal for former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , judge fausto pocar , said the prosecution had originally intended to combine karadzic 's case with the proceedings against momcilo perisic , one of the most senior generals under late serbian leader slobodan milosevic .
but after prosecutors recently informed the court they had changed their plans , the icty decided to assign the karadzic trial to a different judge .
karadzic labels judge inappropriate the former wartime bosnian serb leader had argued that orie would not be neutral , as he had already sentenced one of his close assistants in the balkan war , momcilo krajisnik .

dw spoke with two of them . in the early morning of aug .
21 , 1968 , when east german radio announced that " personalities of the party and the state of the czechoslovak socialist republic -lrb- cssr -rrb- " had called on the soviet union and other allied states to grant them " help , including help from armed forces , " hartmut zwahr was n't the only one choking on his breakfast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands still demonstrated peacefully in prague 's main square on aug .
20 , 1968 " my wife came into the kitchen and said : ' they 've invaded , " ' zwahr said .
" one had always feared that this was going to happen . " at the time , zwahr was a 32-year-old historian with high hopes at leipzig 's karl marx university .
he was fascinated by the attempts to renew socialism in the neighboring country .
he 's a member of germany 's sorb minority , speaks czech and regularly traveled to the cssr , where he read local papers , which at the time were often sold out in leipzig . sobering experience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander dubcek gave hope to east germans as well during the summer of 1968 , east germans were clearly on the side of the cssr 's reformist leader , alexander dubcek .
the invasion is a rude awakening after dreaming of socialism with a human face . " it was sobering , it was a knockdown , " zwahr said , adding that dubcek 's democratization efforts had already led to the release of political prisoners . " i began fearing the secret police , " he said .
" i stopped making friends in my field . " zwahr said he led a double life during the months of the prague spring .
at university , he functioned as it was expected of him as a good comrade . but at night , he filled his diary with entries about party meetings , where die-hard communists led the way and dubcek supporters kept quiet out of fear .
he wrote about his internal conflicts , his heretic thoughts , political jokes and the frustrations of everyday life .
only decades later , he published his diary under the tile " the swallow 's frozen wings . " typewritten protest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : becker 's protest brought her to prison hildegart becker , a 17-year-old student in the east german town of frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- near the polish border , also felt compelled to write during those days in august 1968 . together with a friend and her sister , she used the typewriter of her father , a protestant pastor , to compose a protest flyer against the invasion .
she sent them to residents in her city after getting their addresses from the phone book .
when she got to the letter k , agents from the stasi , the former east german secret police , were already at her door . " we 'd sent out about 150 letters , but very few actually reached their recipients , " becker said , adding that she found out later in her stasi files that many people turned the letters in to the authorities . in a strictly controlled republic , actions like becker 's represented a wave a protest . between aug .
21 and the end of november 1968 , 1,290 people in east germany were investigated for painting graffiti , distributing pamphlets or even just publicly criticizing the invasion , according to stasi files . those arrested included young workers , students , pupils , some of them the children of famous party and state functionaries . life-long memories becker ended up in prison for her actions .
from her cell , she was able to hear the bells of her father 's church .
while she was n't a member of east germany 's communist youth organizations , she still did n't see herself as an enemy of socialism . " it had a certain attraction , " she said .
" that 's why i thought : it ca n't be that they move in with tanks in socialism . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east germans followed their czech neighbors in 1989 after three months in jail , becker was released just in time to celebrate christmas with her family .
she was allowed to finish school and study civil engineering and theology .
she became active in east germany 's democratization movement of 1989 . hartmut zwahr , on the other hand , became a respected social historian , who taught in leipzig until 2001 .
his diary is n't the only thing that reminds him of the prague spring : his son 's name is alexander , just like 1968 socialist alexander dubcek . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the tit-for-tat refusals to cooperate mark the lowest point in nato-russia relations since the foundation of the nato-russia council , a body which was meant to improve dialogue between the cold war foes , in 2002 .
however , both sides have also stressed that they are keen to resume cooperation as soon as the other proves more tractable , in an apparent attempt to limit the diplomatic fallout of the conflict .

both latvia and estonia said their countries had no military cooperation with russia that would be affected by such a suspension .

she noted that during the cold war , which lasted from the end of world war ii until the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 , there were vast ideological differences between east and west .
" the cold war is over , " she said .
washington plans to deploy 10 interceptor missiles in poland plus a radar facility in the neighbouring czech republic between 2011 and 2013 as part of a system to ward off what it says is the risk of attack by " rogue states " such as iran and north korea .
russia has rejected the us arguments for the shield - which was endorsed by all 26 nato member states earlier this year - dubbing it a security threat designed to undermine russia 's nuclear deterrent .
some russian politicians and generals have said poland must be prepared for a preventive attack on the site in the future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski says us missile shield will strengthen poland " poland made this decision as a sovereign state , " polish president lech kaczynski said in a speech to the nation broadcast late tuesday , as reported by bloomberg news .
" nobody has the right to tell poland what to do - those times have passed . "
us-russia relations at low-point the signing of the missile deal comes with relations between moscow and the us - as well as with america 's nato allies - at their lowest ebb in years over russia 's conflict with pro-western georgia .
as the conflict in georgia continues to simmer , rice warned russia that it is playing " a very dangerous game " by resuming cold war-era strategic bomber patrols close to the alaskan coast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian tu-95 's have flown patrols near alaska " russia is a state that is , unfortunately , using the one tool that it has always used whenever it wishes to deliver a message , and that 's its military power , " rice said en route to an emergency meeting of nato foreign ministers wednesday .
" that 's not the way to deal in the 21st century . ”
she said russia 's renewed aviation activity was " a very dangerous game and perhaps one that i suggest the russians want to reconsider .
this is not one that is cost-free . "
russia trying to undermine saakashvili : rice rice added that the alaska patrols and the invasion of georgia contradicted russia 's stated desire for political and economic integration into the international community .
she charged that russia 's offensive deep into georgia was aimed at " undermining " the pro-us government of president mikhail saakashvili and crippling the impoverished nation by damaging and destroying vital economic infrastructure .
" that is an objective that will be denied because georgian democracy stands and it will stand with the help of its allies around the world , " rice said .
" georgian infrastructure will be rebuilt .
georgia 's economy will be reinforced . "
rice said that nato foreign ministers would consider measures to reinforce us and european support for georgia 's territorial integrity .
but she said the united states would not push to accelerate approval by the 26 foreign ministers of plans for the admission to nato of georgia and the former soviet republic of ukraine . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the invasion is a rude awakening after dreaming of socialism with a human face . " it was sobering , it was a knockdown , " zwahr said , adding that dubcek 's democratization efforts had already led to the release of political prisoners . " i began fearing the secret police , " he said .

on tuesday , karadzic filed a motion to the court claiming that judge alphons orie was not suitable to preside over his case . the president of the international criminal tribunal for former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , judge fausto pocar , said the prosecution had originally intended to combine karadzic 's case with the proceedings against momcilo perisic , one of the most senior generals under late serbian leader slobodan milosevic .
but after prosecutors recently informed the court they had changed their plans , the icty decided to assign the karadzic trial to a different judge .
karadzic labels judge inappropriate the former wartime bosnian serb leader had argued that orie would not be neutral , as he had already sentenced one of his close assistants in the balkan war , momcilo krajisnik .
the bosnian-serb war crimes suspect was captured in the serbian capital belgrade in july after nearly 13 years on the run .
he has been indicted for crimes against humanity and genocide over the massacre of up to 8,000 bosnian muslims in srebrenica in 1995 and the siege of sarajevo in which thousands of people were also killed .

dw spoke with two of them . in the early morning of aug .
21 , 1968 , when east german radio announced that " personalities of the party and the state of the czechoslovak socialist republic -lrb- cssr -rrb- " had called on the soviet union and other allied states to grant them " help , including help from armed forces , " hartmut zwahr was n't the only one choking on his breakfast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands still demonstrated peacefully in prague 's main square on aug .
20 , 1968 " my wife came into the kitchen and said : ' they 've invaded , " ' zwahr said .
" one had always feared that this was going to happen . " at the time , zwahr was a 32-year-old historian with high hopes at leipzig 's karl marx university .
he was fascinated by the attempts to renew socialism in the neighboring country .
he 's a member of germany 's sorb minority , speaks czech and regularly traveled to the cssr , where he read local papers , which at the time were often sold out in leipzig . sobering experience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander dubcek gave hope to east germans as well during the summer of 1968 , east germans were clearly on the side of the cssr 's reformist leader , alexander dubcek .
the invasion is a rude awakening after dreaming of socialism with a human face . " it was sobering , it was a knockdown , " zwahr said , adding that dubcek 's democratization efforts had already led to the release of political prisoners . " i began fearing the secret police , " he said .
" i stopped making friends in my field . " zwahr said he led a double life during the months of the prague spring .
at university , he functioned as it was expected of him as a good comrade . but at night , he filled his diary with entries about party meetings , where die-hard communists led the way and dubcek supporters kept quiet out of fear .
he wrote about his internal conflicts , his heretic thoughts , political jokes and the frustrations of everyday life .
only decades later , he published his diary under the tile " the swallow 's frozen wings . " typewritten protest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : becker 's protest brought her to prison hildegart becker , a 17-year-old student in the east german town of frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- near the polish border , also felt compelled to write during those days in august 1968 . together with a friend and her sister , she used the typewriter of her father , a protestant pastor , to compose a protest flyer against the invasion .
she sent them to residents in her city after getting their addresses from the phone book .
when she got to the letter k , agents from the stasi , the former east german secret police , were already at her door . " we 'd sent out about 150 letters , but very few actually reached their recipients , " becker said , adding that she found out later in her stasi files that many people turned the letters in to the authorities . in a strictly controlled republic , actions like becker 's represented a wave a protest . between aug .
21 and the end of november 1968 , 1,290 people in east germany were investigated for painting graffiti , distributing pamphlets or even just publicly criticizing the invasion , according to stasi files . those arrested included young workers , students , pupils , some of them the children of famous party and state functionaries . life-long memories becker ended up in prison for her actions .
from her cell , she was able to hear the bells of her father 's church .
while she was n't a member of east germany 's communist youth organizations , she still did n't see herself as an enemy of socialism . " it had a certain attraction , " she said .
" that 's why i thought : it ca n't be that they move in with tanks in socialism . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : east germans followed their czech neighbors in 1989 after three months in jail , becker was released just in time to celebrate christmas with her family .
she was allowed to finish school and study civil engineering and theology .
she became active in east germany 's democratization movement of 1989 . hartmut zwahr , on the other hand , became a respected social historian , who taught in leipzig until 2001 .
his diary is n't the only thing that reminds him of the prague spring : his son 's name is alexander , just like 1968 socialist alexander dubcek . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i do n't think this is a new cold war , " rice told reporters shortly after she signed a deal in warsaw on deploying part of a us missile shield on polish territory in the face of deep russian anger .
" it is a difficult time but i think we should n't overstate the depth of the difficulties , " rice said on wednesday , aug .
20 .
she noted that during the cold war , which lasted from the end of world war ii until the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 , there were vast ideological differences between east and west .
" the cold war is over , " she said .
washington plans to deploy 10 interceptor missiles in poland plus a radar facility in the neighbouring czech republic between 2011 and 2013 as part of a system to ward off what it says is the risk of attack by " rogue states " such as iran and north korea .
russia has rejected the us arguments for the shield - which was endorsed by all 26 nato member states earlier this year - dubbing it a security threat designed to undermine russia 's nuclear deterrent .
some russian politicians and generals have said poland must be prepared for a preventive attack on the site in the future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski says us missile shield will strengthen poland " poland made this decision as a sovereign state , " polish president lech kaczynski said in a speech to the nation broadcast late tuesday , as reported by bloomberg news .
" nobody has the right to tell poland what to do - those times have passed . "
us-russia relations at low-point the signing of the missile deal comes with relations between moscow and the us - as well as with america 's nato allies - at their lowest ebb in years over russia 's conflict with pro-western georgia .
as the conflict in georgia continues to simmer , rice warned russia that it is playing " a very dangerous game " by resuming cold war-era strategic bomber patrols close to the alaskan coast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian tu-95 's have flown patrols near alaska " russia is a state that is , unfortunately , using the one tool that it has always used whenever it wishes to deliver a message , and that 's its military power , " rice said en route to an emergency meeting of nato foreign ministers wednesday .
" that 's not the way to deal in the 21st century . ”
she said russia 's renewed aviation activity was " a very dangerous game and perhaps one that i suggest the russians want to reconsider .
this is not one that is cost-free . "
russia trying to undermine saakashvili : rice rice added that the alaska patrols and the invasion of georgia contradicted russia 's stated desire for political and economic integration into the international community .
she charged that russia 's offensive deep into georgia was aimed at " undermining " the pro-us government of president mikhail saakashvili and crippling the impoverished nation by damaging and destroying vital economic infrastructure .
" that is an objective that will be denied because georgian democracy stands and it will stand with the help of its allies around the world , " rice said .
" georgian infrastructure will be rebuilt .
georgia 's economy will be reinforced . "
rice said that nato foreign ministers would consider measures to reinforce us and european support for georgia 's territorial integrity .
but she said the united states would not push to accelerate approval by the 26 foreign ministers of plans for the admission to nato of georgia and the former soviet republic of ukraine . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i do n't think this is a new cold war , " rice told reporters shortly after she signed a deal in warsaw on deploying part of a us missile shield on polish territory in the face of deep russian anger .
" it is a difficult time but i think we should n't overstate the depth of the difficulties , " rice said on wednesday , aug .

russia has rejected the us arguments for the shield - which was endorsed by all 26 nato member states earlier this year - dubbing it a security threat designed to undermine russia 's nuclear deterrent .
some russian politicians and generals have said poland must be prepared for a preventive attack on the site in the future .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski says us missile shield will strengthen poland " poland made this decision as a sovereign state , " polish president lech kaczynski said in a speech to the nation broadcast late tuesday , as reported by bloomberg news .
" nobody has the right to tell poland what to do - those times have passed . "
us-russia relations at low-point the signing of the missile deal comes with relations between moscow and the us - as well as with america 's nato allies - at their lowest ebb in years over russia 's conflict with pro-western georgia .
as the conflict in georgia continues to simmer , rice warned russia that it is playing " a very dangerous game " by resuming cold war-era strategic bomber patrols close to the alaskan coast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian tu-95 's have flown patrols near alaska " russia is a state that is , unfortunately , using the one tool that it has always used whenever it wishes to deliver a message , and that 's its military power , " rice said en route to an emergency meeting of nato foreign ministers wednesday .
" that 's not the way to deal in the 21st century . ”
she said russia 's renewed aviation activity was " a very dangerous game and perhaps one that i suggest the russians want to reconsider .
this is not one that is cost-free . "
russia trying to undermine saakashvili : rice rice added that the alaska patrols and the invasion of georgia contradicted russia 's stated desire for political and economic integration into the international community .
she charged that russia 's offensive deep into georgia was aimed at " undermining " the pro-us government of president mikhail saakashvili and crippling the impoverished nation by damaging and destroying vital economic infrastructure .
" that is an objective that will be denied because georgian democracy stands and it will stand with the help of its allies around the world , " rice said .
" georgian infrastructure will be rebuilt .
georgia 's economy will be reinforced . "
rice said that nato foreign ministers would consider measures to reinforce us and european support for georgia 's territorial integrity .
but she said the united states would not push to accelerate approval by the 26 foreign ministers of plans for the admission to nato of georgia and the former soviet republic of ukraine . dw staff -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on tuesday , karadzic filed a motion to the court claiming that judge alphons orie was not suitable to preside over his case . the president of the international criminal tribunal for former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , judge fausto pocar , said the prosecution had originally intended to combine karadzic 's case with the proceedings against momcilo perisic , one of the most senior generals under late serbian leader slobodan milosevic .
but after prosecutors recently informed the court they had changed their plans , the icty decided to assign the karadzic trial to a different judge .
karadzic labels judge inappropriate the former wartime bosnian serb leader had argued that orie would not be neutral , as he had already sentenced one of his close assistants in the balkan war , momcilo krajisnik .
the bosnian-serb war crimes suspect was captured in the serbian capital belgrade in july after nearly 13 years on the run .
he has been indicted for crimes against humanity and genocide over the massacre of up to 8,000 bosnian muslims in srebrenica in 1995 and the siege of sarajevo in which thousands of people were also killed .

on tuesday , karadzic filed a motion to the court claiming that judge alphons orie was not suitable to preside over his case . the president of the international criminal tribunal for former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , judge fausto pocar , said the prosecution had originally intended to combine karadzic 's case with the proceedings against momcilo perisic , one of the most senior generals under late serbian leader slobodan milosevic .
but after prosecutors recently informed the court they had changed their plans , the icty decided to assign the karadzic trial to a different judge .
karadzic labels judge inappropriate the former wartime bosnian serb leader had argued that orie would not be neutral , as he had already sentenced one of his close assistants in the balkan war , momcilo krajisnik .
the bosnian-serb war crimes suspect was captured in the serbian capital belgrade in july after nearly 13 years on the run .
he has been indicted for crimes against humanity and genocide over the massacre of up to 8,000 bosnian muslims in srebrenica in 1995 and the siege of sarajevo in which thousands of people were also killed .
karadzic is due to appear before the icty again august 29 to enter a plea to the charges brought against him . dpa news agency -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on tuesday , karadzic filed a motion to the court claiming that judge alphons orie was not suitable to preside over his case . the president of the international criminal tribunal for former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , judge fausto pocar , said the prosecution had originally intended to combine karadzic 's case with the proceedings against momcilo perisic , one of the most senior generals under late serbian leader slobodan milosevic .
but after prosecutors recently informed the court they had changed their plans , the icty decided to assign the karadzic trial to a different judge .
karadzic labels judge inappropriate the former wartime bosnian serb leader had argued that orie would not be neutral , as he had already sentenced one of his close assistants in the balkan war , momcilo krajisnik .
the bosnian-serb war crimes suspect was captured in the serbian capital belgrade in july after nearly 13 years on the run .
he has been indicted for crimes against humanity and genocide over the massacre of up to 8,000 bosnian muslims in srebrenica in 1995 and the siege of sarajevo in which thousands of people were also killed .
karadzic is due to appear before the icty again august 29 to enter a plea to the charges brought against him . dpa news agency -lrb- dm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ikb collapsed in july 2007 when a department that bought subprime mortgages ran out of funds .
four ikb managers were since ousted , included ceo stefan ortseifen . in march , german stock market operator deutsche boerse suspended trading in ikb shares after the bank revealed that it did not expect to post a significant profit for the foreseeable future . the decision came after an auction of most of ikb 's 3 billion euro portfolio of risky securities had been suspended due to a lack of satisfactory bids . in april , ikb was also subject to investigation for possible insider trading . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she said nato took note of the decision .
however , the spokeswoman told reporters that alliance foreign ministers had already agreed earlier in the week that they could not continue business as usual with russia until moscow fulfiled the terms of its peace deal with georgia .

air accident investigators determining the cause of wednesday 's crash of a spanair jet at madrid 's barajas airport are faced with a conundrum that could take a significant time to unravel .
their role is that of assembling the pieces of a giant jigsaw puzzle as they attempt to determine beyond doubt what caused the accident .
while some initial findings may be forthcoming in a matter of days , it is almost always the case that a definitive determination of cause will take many months .
from official and anecdotal reports it appears clear that a fire in the left-side engine of the mcdonnell douglas md 82 took hold as the aircraft made its take-off roll .
such engine fires are extremely rare , but when they do occur they are , invariably , the result of some form of mechanical failure .
the precursor to such a mechanical failure is what accident investigators must now attempt to discover .
air accidents generate headlines and much speculation follows as we seek context to the horror that unfolds before our eyes .
questions are asked as to the safety record of the aircraft type in question , if there have been accidents in the past and if there is a possible link .
inevitably , questions are also posed of the airline , its safety history and its ability to maintain aircraft within the fleet .
exemplary record spanair began operations in 1988 .
it is a subsidiary of scandinavian airline systems and a member of the star alliance group of airlines .
operating short , medium and , in the past , long haul flights , it has a current fleet of 61 aircraft and reportedly carried 11 million passengers in 2007 .
spanair has had what many in the aviation industry would consider an exemplary safety record throughout its history .
seven of the md 82 type now remain in the fleet , primarily utilised for short and medium flights within the european region .
the md 82 itself is a derivative of the mcdonnell douglas dc9 and capable of carrying between 130 and 170 passengers , depending on seating configuration .
prior to the madrid barajas airport crash , only five other incidents and accidents had been recorded for the type , representing a very low attrition rate .
earlier this year the us federal aviation administration took the drastic step of grounding md 80 type aircraft operated by american airlines .
other us air carriers operating the types in question followed suit pending safety checks .
it is important to remember that faa action was prompted by the discovery of anomalies in the maintenance schedule of american airlines md 80s and related to an issue more than likely removed from that which occurred onboard spanair flight jk5022 .
of course , nothing can be ruled out as the air accident investigators get to work to discover the sequence of events that lead to this horrific accident .
only detailed and painstaking analysis over the passage of time will yield the answers .

helicopters were called in to dump water on the plane , which was ablaze air accident investigators determining the cause of wednesday 's crash of a spanair jet at madrid 's barajas airport are faced with a conundrum that could take a significant time to unravel .
their role is that of assembling the pieces of a giant jigsaw puzzle as they attempt to determine beyond doubt what caused the accident .
while some initial findings may be forthcoming in a matter of days , it is almost always the case that a definitive determination of cause will take many months .
from official and anecdotal reports it appears clear that a fire in the left-side engine of the mcdonnell douglas md 82 took hold as the aircraft made its take-off roll .
such engine fires are extremely rare , but when they do occur they are , invariably , the result of some form of mechanical failure .
the precursor to such a mechanical failure is what accident investigators must now attempt to discover .
air accidents generate headlines and much speculation follows as we seek context to the horror that unfolds before our eyes .
questions are asked as to the safety record of the aircraft type in question , if there have been accidents in the past and if there is a possible link .
inevitably , questions are also posed of the airline , its safety history and its ability to maintain aircraft within the fleet .
exemplary record the md 82 plane type has a very low rate of accidents and incidents spanair began operations in 1988 .
it is a subsidiary of scandinavian airline systems and a member of the star alliance group of airlines .
operating short , medium and , in the past , long haul flights , it has a current fleet of 61 aircraft and reportedly carried 11 million passengers in 2007 .
spanair has had what many in the aviation industry would consider an exemplary safety record throughout its history .
seven of the md 82 type now remain in the fleet , primarily utilised for short and medium flights within the european region .
the md 82 itself is a derivative of the mcdonnell douglas dc9 and capable of carrying between 130 and 170 passengers , depending on seating configuration .
prior to the madrid barajas airport crash , only five other incidents and accidents had been recorded for the type , representing a very low attrition rate .
earlier this year the us federal aviation administration took the drastic step of grounding md 80 type aircraft operated by american airlines .
other us air carriers operating the types in question followed suit pending safety checks .
it is important to remember that faa action was prompted by the discovery of anomalies in the maintenance schedule of american airlines md 80s and related to an issue more than likely removed from that which occurred onboard spanair flight jk5022 .
of course , nothing can be ruled out as the air accident investigators get to work to discover the sequence of events that lead to this horrific accident .
only detailed and painstaking analysis over the passage of time will yield the answers .

elderly men with flowing robes and turbans carry bundles of firewood to their homes .
women carry bundles of grass on their heads to family courtyards shared by children and livestock .
it looks idyllic but life in jawlaia is not easy .
it may take just one hour to reach the village from islamabad but the two places are separated by a huge economic divide .
in the capital , the country 's wealthy elite has spent a second day discussing what to do after the resignation of president musharraf .
his long , drawn-out exit from office has left something of a power vacuum - for the moment the government is weak , divided and ineffective .
and for pakistan 's politicians , the most urgent question is who will emerge and be the next strongman .
but away from the smoke-filled political salons , most pakistanis have very different concerns .
the majority live in the countryside , where social and economic indicators make bleak reading .
jawlaia , in north west frontier province , is home to 8,000 people and it should be thriving .
it has plenty of water and fertile soil which the villagers use to grow oranges , wheat and maize .

" musharraf put the army into the flour mills to control prices .

mr sadiq works for eight hours every day chiselling blocks of rock into bowls for grinding corn .
the electricity supply in jawlaia is intermittent - it is off around half the time .

each day she gathers grass for her cow , puts it in a huge bundle on her head and walks back home .
but she says the cow is still too young to produce much milk and she is left with mounting bills .
" it is very difficult to manage because inflation is so high , " she said .
jawlaia has four mosques and the mullah in one of them , mohammed tayyib , gets a weekly congregation of 200 to 300 .
he said that villagers come to him complaining that they are not managing to provide for their families .
" what people want from the government is relief for the poor , " he said .
rising global fuel and oil prices have hit pakistan hard .
former president musharraf has insisted that his government oversaw years of economic growth and that the new civilian government is to blame for the worsening economic conditions .
the new government blames the military for giving it a disastrous economic legacy and in particular for failing to build more power plants to meet a growing demand for electricity .
some villagers are willing to give the new administration the benefit of the doubt saying it is too soon to know whether it will address their needs .
but like many pakistanis they are not very hopeful that the political elite really will deliver higher living standards .

stone mason mohammad sadiq blames the government for high prices elderly men with flowing robes and turbans carry bundles of firewood to their homes .
women carry bundles of grass on their heads to family courtyards shared by children and livestock .
it looks idyllic but life in jawlaia is not easy .
it may take just one hour to reach the village from islamabad but the two places are separated by a huge economic divide .
in the capital , the country 's wealthy elite has spent a second day discussing what to do after the resignation of president musharraf .
his long , drawn-out exit from office has left something of a power vacuum - for the moment the government is weak , divided and ineffective .
and for pakistan 's politicians , the most urgent question is who will emerge and be the next strongman .
but away from the smoke-filled political salons , most pakistanis have very different concerns .
the majority live in the countryside , where social and economic indicators make bleak reading .
widow maqsooda baig says she has mounting bills jawlaia , in north west frontier province , is home to 8,000 people and it should be thriving .
it has plenty of water and fertile soil which the villagers use to grow oranges , wheat and maize .
but the people of jawlaia are not happy .
" because of this new government , the economy is out of control .
everything has become so expensive , " said stone mason mohammad sadiq .
" musharraf put the army into the flour mills to control prices .
but with this government everything is out of control . "
mr sadiq works for eight hours every day chiselling blocks of rock into bowls for grinding corn .
the electricity supply in jawlaia is intermittent - it is off around half the time .
tough times because of plentiful rain , the village has enjoyed good crops this year .
even so , farmers say it is tough to make ends meet .
since her husband died two years ago , maqsooda baig has had to look after her two teenage daughters on her own .
each day she gathers grass for her cow , puts it in a huge bundle on her head and walks back home .
but she says the cow is still too young to produce much milk and she is left with mounting bills .
mullah mohammed tayyib says the poor need government help " it is very difficult to manage because inflation is so high , " she said .
jawlaia has four mosques and the mullah in one of them , mohammed tayyib , gets a weekly congregation of 200 to 300 .
he said that villagers come to him complaining that they are not managing to provide for their families .
" what people want from the government is relief for the poor , " he said .

stone mason mohammad sadiq blames the government for high prices elderly men with flowing robes and turbans carry bundles of firewood to their homes .
women carry bundles of grass on their heads to family courtyards shared by children and livestock .
it looks idyllic but life in jawlaia is not easy .
it may take just one hour to reach the village from islamabad but the two places are separated by a huge economic divide .
in the capital , the country 's wealthy elite has spent a second day discussing what to do after the resignation of president musharraf .
his long , drawn-out exit from office has left something of a power vacuum - for the moment the government is weak , divided and ineffective .
and for pakistan 's politicians , the most urgent question is who will emerge and be the next strongman .
but away from the smoke-filled political salons , most pakistanis have very different concerns .
the majority live in the countryside , where social and economic indicators make bleak reading .
widow maqsooda baig says she has mounting bills jawlaia , in north west frontier province , is home to 8,000 people and it should be thriving .
it has plenty of water and fertile soil which the villagers use to grow oranges , wheat and maize .
but the people of jawlaia are not happy .
" because of this new government , the economy is out of control .
everything has become so expensive , " said stone mason mohammad sadiq .
" musharraf put the army into the flour mills to control prices .
but with this government everything is out of control . "
mr sadiq works for eight hours every day chiselling blocks of rock into bowls for grinding corn .
the electricity supply in jawlaia is intermittent - it is off around half the time .
tough times because of plentiful rain , the village has enjoyed good crops this year .
even so , farmers say it is tough to make ends meet .
since her husband died two years ago , maqsooda baig has had to look after her two teenage daughters on her own .
each day she gathers grass for her cow , puts it in a huge bundle on her head and walks back home .
but she says the cow is still too young to produce much milk and she is left with mounting bills .
mullah mohammed tayyib says the poor need government help " it is very difficult to manage because inflation is so high , " she said .
jawlaia has four mosques and the mullah in one of them , mohammed tayyib , gets a weekly congregation of 200 to 300 .
he said that villagers come to him complaining that they are not managing to provide for their families .
" what people want from the government is relief for the poor , " he said .
rising global fuel and oil prices have hit pakistan hard .
former president musharraf has insisted that his government oversaw years of economic growth and that the new civilian government is to blame for the worsening economic conditions .
the new government blames the military for giving it a disastrous economic legacy and in particular for failing to build more power plants to meet a growing demand for electricity .

but like many pakistanis they are not very hopeful that the political elite really will deliver higher living standards .

their action was called off after a congressional committee voted to repeal two laws which the tribes say make it easier for companies to buy their land .
the laws , supported by president alan garcia , are aimed at promoting private investment in communal territories .
mr garcia called the committee 's decision a grave mistake .
peru 's congress will now have to vote on the committee 's decision , which was apparently prompted by the public outcry at the laws .
it is a blow to mr garcia 's plans for state reform , the bbc 's dan collyns in lima reports .
a state of emergency had been declared in peru after thousands of amazonian tribespeople armed with spears , bows and arrows took over main roads , a hydroelectric dam , and oil and gas installations in the provinces of cusco , loreto and amazonas .
we have faith and expect congress to follow through alberto pizango aidesep head the protestors from 65 tribes feared the laws would make it easier for investors to buy their energy-rich land in peru 's amazon basin , parts of which are rich in oil and gas .
the legislation was introduced as part of the country 's free trade agreement with the us .
the tribes are distrustful as companies extracting oil or gas have , in the past , brought contamination , which has had an impact on both their environment and health , says our correspondent .
' huge mistake ' " we have lifted the strike , " said alberto pizango , head of the indigenous amazonian organisation , aidesep , after the congressional committee 's decision .
mr garcia said repealing the laws would hold up progress " we have faith and expect congress to follow through . "
mr garcia , who passed the laws earlier this year under special powers granted by congress , said repealing them would be a grave error .
" i am obliged to say to peru that it would be a huge mistake which would hold up change and keep those farming communities in poverty and marginalisation for another century , " he said in a televised address .
mr garcia says bringing investment and industrialisation to peru 's remoter areas are the only way to tackle widespread poverty .
but it is clear many people in peru 's amazon see this as a threat to their way of life , says our correspondent .

their action was called off after a congressional committee voted to repeal two laws which the tribes say make it easier for companies to buy their land .
the laws , supported by president alan garcia , are aimed at promoting private investment in communal territories .
mr garcia called the committee 's decision a grave mistake .
peru 's congress will now have to vote on the committee 's decision , which was apparently prompted by the public outcry at the laws .
it is a blow to mr garcia 's plans for state reform , the bbc 's dan collyns in lima reports .
a state of emergency had been declared in peru after thousands of amazonian tribespeople armed with spears , bows and arrows took over main roads , a hydroelectric dam , and oil and gas installations in the provinces of cusco , loreto and amazonas .
we have faith and expect congress to follow through alberto pizango aidesep head the protestors from 65 tribes feared the laws would make it easier for investors to buy their energy-rich land in peru 's amazon basin , parts of which are rich in oil and gas .
the legislation was introduced as part of the country 's free trade agreement with the us .
the tribes are distrustful as companies extracting oil or gas have , in the past , brought contamination , which has had an impact on both their environment and health , says our correspondent .
' huge mistake ' " we have lifted the strike , " said alberto pizango , head of the indigenous amazonian organisation , aidesep , after the congressional committee 's decision .
mr garcia said repealing the laws would hold up progress " we have faith and expect congress to follow through . "
mr garcia , who passed the laws earlier this year under special powers granted by congress , said repealing them would be a grave error .
" i am obliged to say to peru that it would be a huge mistake which would hold up change and keep those farming communities in poverty and marginalisation for another century , " he said in a televised address .
mr garcia says bringing investment and industrialisation to peru 's remoter areas are the only way to tackle widespread poverty .
but it is clear many people in peru 's amazon see this as a threat to their way of life , says our correspondent .

mr bush , speaking during a visit to the city , said recovery was being boosted by $ 126bn -lrb- £ 67.5bn -rrb- in aid given to the us gulf coast region .
but he acknowledged that much work remained to be done .
katrina struck on 29 august 2005 , leaving some 1,800 people dead in louisiana and mississippi .
much of new orleans was flooded after levees broke under the pressure of the storm .
katrina was one of the costliest hurricanes in us history , causing hundreds of billions of dollars in damage .
' brighter day ' the loss of life and property in the wake of katrina stunned the us " who would have thought three years after the storm the president could come and say , ' new orleans , louisiana , is on its way back as a stronger and better city ' , " president bush said during his visit on wednesday .
" i think the message here today is hope is being restored .
hope is coming back , " he said .
" there are people hurting .
i fully understand that ; people waiting to get back in their home , wondering whether a brighter day is possible .
yet a brighter day is coming . "
mr bush 's visit , nine days before the actual anniversary , was his 11th to the region since katrina , a strong category three hurricane with winds of 140mph -lrb- 225km / h -rrb- , battered coastal regions .
the political legacy of the hurricane still lingers .
the bush administration 's slow response to the unfolding catastrophe provoked huge criticism , especially from african-americans who argued that race was a factor in the slowness of rescue and recovery operations .
critics also say the federal government is still failing to deliver sufficient help .

forestry commission scotland 's new biodiversity plan aims to create " stronger , more adaptable ecosystems " .
it identifies the capercaillie , black grouse , red squirrel , pearl-bordered fritillary , chequered skipper butterfly and juniper as important species .
environment minister mike russell launched the plan at the carrick forest in dumfries and galloway .
he said scotland 's forests had a key part to play in protecting endangered species .
criteria for selecting the six priority species all declining and / or threatened but still widely distributed scotland holds a large proportion of the uk population forestry is important to their habitats managing of these species should have wider biodiversity benefits ln pictures : woodland report " woodlands - and the open spaces within them - have a vital contribution to make towards conserving scotland 's threatened habitats and species , " he said .
" we are very fortunate in scotland to enjoy a wealth of biodiversity that is for the most part robust and healthy .
" however , some elements are extremely fragile and making sure that they thrive will require some large-scale thinking and landscape scale vision - both of which are forestry sector strengths . "
the biodiversity programme - woods for nature - sets out how fcs is helping to conserve and expand woodlands .
that , in turn , can assist the six priority species .
three of them - the capercaillie , grouse and red squirrel - are the subject of " species action notes " published to coincide with the biodiversity plan .
biggest threats further reports will follow for the pearl-bordered fritillary , chequered skipper butterfly and juniper .
the programme looks at most of the major issues facing woodland development across the country .
among the biggest threats listed are " widespread browsing by deer or sheep " and " invasive non-native trees and shrubs " .
however , the report highlights sample projects which could help ensure the survival of as many key species as possible .
in moray , forest enterprise scotland has undertaken work to " naturalise " scots pine plantations .
it has encouraged natural regeneration of pine , rowan and birches .
it has also helped the spread of plants like the blaeberry which is an important source of food and cover for young capercaillie .
at glen garry in the highlands , they have come up with an unusual " forest management tool " .
it is hoped that controlled grazing by highland cattle can help encourage a more diverse native woodland in future .
meanwhile , mabie forest in dumfries and galloway has been identified as a particularly rich site for butterflies .
fcs and butterfly conservation have joined forces to create a nature reserve in the centre of the forest .
however , they face a challenge in producing the right kind of habitat for different endangered species like the pearl-bordered fritillary , dingy skipper and forester moth .
' wildlife haven ' elsewhere in scotland , rhododendron control is considered a major issue .
now a regional project in argyll and bute hopes to go some way to addressing that problem .
the report does not limit its observations to rural areas .
an urban woodland at drumchapel in glasgow and a " wildlife haven " at a former mine site in south lanarkshire are also highlighted as important projects .
between all these schemes and many other initiatives , it is hoped that the six key species and many others can enjoy a safer future .
the fcs believes that can ultimately increase public awareness and enjoyment of the nation 's woodland areas .
