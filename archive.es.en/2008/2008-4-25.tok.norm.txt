24 -rrb- that trade and industry minister amin farhang was the actual target of the operation .
no explanation has been given for why he was under scrutiny .
farhang , who lived in germany for a number of years , has told the german newspaper neue osnabruecker zeitung that his life was now at risk because the measure implied that he was co-operating with hostile forces .

" the trust between the parliamentary committee and the leadership of the bnd is damaged , " committee chairman thomas oppermann -lrb- spd -rrb- said in a statement .
opposition members of parliament said the issue was not so much uhrlau 's position , but concern that the intelligence services were running out of control as a result of concerns on international terrorism .

in the meantime , there have been calls for a boycott of the games , politicians and athletes have said they would not take part in the opening ceremonies , and the city of paris this week named the dalai lama an honorary citizen . china has responded with anger and many chinese have started to boycott french companies .
hundreds of anti-china demonstrators took to the streets in europe last week to protest against china 's approach to tibet , as thousands of chinese marched in counter-demonstrations in berlin , london and paris .
the controversy is unlikely to die down until well after the beijing olympics , which run from august 8-24 , are over .
it 's a tough time for olympic sponsors , such as coca-cola , volkswagen or adidas . dw-world discussed their difficulties with thorsten hofmann , the ceo of prsg , a berlin-based consultancy for political and crisis management .
the company recently acquired an olympic sponsor as a client . dw-world.de : an old adage says " all publicity is good publicity . "
at what point does the damage make it not worthwhile for a sponsor ? thorsten hofmann : starting with " all publicity is good publicity : " that 's a dangerous statement , because when you 're in a crisis situation , you have the greatest amount of attention a firm could ever want , but unfortunately not in the context you would want it , and that , of course , is the most important thing .
if you want publicity , you generally want it in a nice , harmonious context with a positive image transfer .
in our concrete example , the olympic games , everyone who positioned themselves as sponsors - and invested somewhere between 50 and 100 million euros -lrb- $ 80 to $ 160 million -rrb- - wants to take the olympics ' positive image and create a brand transfer .
adidas as a sports brand wants to participate , vw wants to profit from the dynamics of the games , and above all , everything should be nice and harmonious .
and now for the big dilemma : if the olympics do n't go off as they could , but rather if - as is now the case - there 's a disregard for human rights , violent attacks , attacks on the torch bearers and disturbances of a political nature , then naturally this image transfer also rubs off on the sponsors .
it 's no longer so nice and smooth , and at some point as a sponsor you will be asked what your own position is .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights activists have been vocal in their criticism of china that is , what was originally planned - we participate in a collective sports competition , the olympics , and appear prominently as a main sponsor - can turn into the opposite .
for when a state in which the olympic games take place , like china , presents itself to the world as riding roughshod over human rights - that 's the outside perception - then the world asks itself , " what do the sponsors think of this ?
do human rights not matter to them ?
do they put the value of money above human rights ? "
that 's the negative side of the image transfer . a similar case is that of t-mobile and others companies sponsoring cycling in germany . it is definitely similar .
the cycling sponsors have always profited from the sporting image and the high spectator numbers of , for example , the tour de france .
now , because of all the doping cases , cycling has become dirty , and this dirtiness at some point rubs off on a brand .
accordingly , ever more sponsors are pulling out .
there are cases in the context of sporting events which are absolutely negative for the sponsors ' image , for the sponsors ' brands , and we , as sponsors , have to decide : " what do i do ? " .
with cycling , sponsors tried at the beginning of the doping crisis to introduce responsibility into the equation , to say i 'll create my own guidelines , anyone who takes drugs will be kicked out , i want to fight for clean cycling .
but at some point it became clear that the fight was futile , and sponsors said the recurring negative news is affecting my brand negatively , and at some point i pull out .
that 's what happened . with the olympics , at what point should sponsors pull out ?
when has it gone too far ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been protests in china against french companies that 's a super hard question , because you have to see it in the context of a giant market .
china is the market of the future - i think we all agree on that - and that 's why they all have put their energies and their sponsoring budgets into the olympics .
in addition , you have to take into account that china has an entirely different culture from our western culture .
that means , if i start to talk at the chinese about their culture and to publicly question the things they do , they lose face .
losing face is an affront in china , and you can be sure that as a consequence your company will have a big problem gaining a foothold there . but on the other hand , if you carry on with sponsoring and incidents occur at the olympics - from violent attacks on demonstrators to deaths - then the companies from outside must be prepared for the rest of the world to ask : " how far does the so-called kowtow to the communist dictatorship go ? "
for the companies , the question also arises : " how important are human rights to me and how important is money ? "
that 's the predicament the companies currently find themselves in .
they are caught between a rock and a hard place . but getting back to the question .
when should they pull out ?
it becomes very , very critical when there are deaths .
if there is suddenly fighting , or in the worst case - as has happened before in china - there 's shooting , demonstrators are killed with the world watching , then the company has to carefully consider , " how are my opportunities in this market , what should i do now , and how do my other markets judge my behavior ? "
it 's always an individual decision , that has to be made according to the situation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the torch relay went undisturbed in india ; protesters could n't get near it if i decide i 'm interested in a sponsoring contract - and am prepared to spend 50 to 100 million euros or more - why do n't i put some thought into a prevention plan ?
that is , i know china , and i 'm familiar with all of its sources of conflict , i 'm also familiar with the conflict situation with tibet , the issues of human rights , poverty , child labor and so on .
why have i not yet given some thought to how i could react to accusations of this nature ?
the classic tool is crisis prevention work , and it could have had an effect here .
and i think , actually , i know that that is the current situation the companies face .
they are literally surprised by a matter of course . one would assume they would have prepared for such an eventuality ? exactly , you 're absolutely right .
if i 'm prepared to become a sponsor , to spruce up my brand , then i also have to develop my protective shield so my brand is n't damaged .
and this shield is preventive work , crisis prevention .
at the moment i have the impression that everyone is surprised by what is happening .
that something could have happened , must have been clear to everyone .
because china functions differently than western societies , it 's just not understood by the rest of the world . do you have sporting events sponsors or olympic sponsors as clients ? yes on both counts .
the latter we got relatively recently , which is why i can reconstruct things well .
it 's the case that most of the sponsors have n't given any thought to these things . what can your company do for them ?
how can you protect them ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese students rallied this week to express their pride in their country of course , to start with we were surprised that there was no concept and in many areas no thought had gone into things .
what we 're now doing is thinking about how you can show that sponsoring does n't just mean money to develop a brand , as is assumed , but also to try to participate in shaping societal change .
in concrete terms that means developing one 's own projects that are cross-nation , that take place with china , in which sensitive issues , like human rights , exposure to publicity , etc . , are addressed and in which the added value for a country like china is apparent .
the chinese do n't see any added value in developing an internet that is not controlled , why they should allow press freedom , why they should be transparent or why , for example , they could allow demonstrations as an articulation of free expression . what do you do if there are calls for boycotts of sponsors ? we have to determine what messages we want to send for the different situations that could arise .
say our sports clothes or our cars are n't being bought anymore .
here the company has to take a stand , and formulating the message is very difficult .
they remain between a rock and a hard place , which means that every word hangs in the balance .
every word is a tightrope walk .
on the one hand , they have to consider to what extent do i want to damage my future business in china , and on the other hand , i want to clarify my position to the rest of the world .
and that is very difficult . interview : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it says it will approach berlin in the next few days . news broke at the weekend that the bnd had read e-mail correspondence between der spiegel reporter susanne koelbl and an afghan politician between june and november 2006 , sparking outrage because of the breach of press freedom .
it only emerged on thursday -lrb- apr .
24 -rrb- that trade and industry minister amin farhang was the actual target of the operation .
no explanation has been given for why he was under scrutiny .
farhang , who lived in germany for a number of years , has told the german newspaper neue osnabruecker zeitung that his life was now at risk because the measure implied that he was co-operating with hostile forces .
" because of this absurd lie that i 'm some kind of double agent , my life and the lives of my family are in great danger , " he said .
" i could be shot on the street tomorrow , " he added .
kabul is " disappointed " about the spying revelations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bnd head faced a second day of questioning by a parliamentary committee kabul has declined to comment directly on the events , but afghan foreign minister rangeen dadfar spanta told the financial times deutschlan d -lrb- ftd -rrb- that his government would bring up the matter with berlin in the next few days .
the ftd reported that government sources spoke of " disappointment " about what had happened and the fact that neither the government or the bnd had been in contact with the targeted minister to apologize over the affair , or explain why the surveillance had been carried out in the first place .
but the foreign ministry in berlin said on friday -lrb- apr .
25 -rrb- that relations with kabul remained " close . "
spokesman martin jaeger said kabul had not made any official request for an explanation , nor had the german ambassador to kabul been summoned to discuss the issue .
on thursday , the chancellor 's office ordered disciplinary measures to be taken against three intelligence service members , including the chief-of-staff of bnd head , ernst uhrlau , as well as the head of the department responsible for the spying operation .
uhrlau , who faced a second of questioning thursday by a parliamentary oversight committee -lrb- pkg -rrb- , had faced calls for his resignation over the spy scandal .
but the pkg has stopped short of demanding he step down .
bnd chief 's head does not roll bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uhrlau apologized to journalist koelbl , but apparently not to the afghan minister the committee condemned the fact that uhrlau had not informed the government or parliamentarians about the monitoring of the der spiegel journalist , but that this activity did not mean that he should quit .
" the trust between the parliamentary committee and the leadership of the bnd is damaged , " committee chairman thomas oppermann -lrb- spd -rrb- said in a statement .
opposition members of parliament said the issue was not so much uhrlau 's position , but concern that the intelligence services were running out of control as a result of concerns on international terrorism .
max stadler , of the free democrats , said the bnd was in danger of becoming a " state within a state " .
as well as the diplomatic ramifications of this affair , the activities clearly breach germany 's basic law on press freedom .
german news weekly der spiegel announced on thursday that it was considering legal action .
" in view of this renewed serious breach of press freedom , der spiegel has decided to look at the legal and constitutional implications of this case , " it said .
the chairman of the association of german journalists -lrb- djv -rrb- , michael konken , accused the intelligence services of " developing a james bond mentality . " two years ago , the bnd admitted spying on journalists to discover their sources - but apologized calling it a one-off .
this week , another journalist who had worked in afghanistan said he was told that he was being bugged by a senior diplomat . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i am particularly encouraged by our open and frank exchanges on tibet , " said barroso after meeting with wen .
" i hope to see positive developments soon .
i have reiterated the eu position on this matter . "
barroso , leading a large eu delegation to the chinese capital amid tension over china 's rule in tibet and the beijing olympics , said he reassured wen that europe considered the himalayan region as part of chinese territory .
he said europe supported china 's territorial integrity and unity " and that naturally applies to tibet . "
however , he did urge china to reverse its current policy and grant free access for foreign journalists and foreign visitors to tibet .
barroso traveled to beijing with nine european union commissioners to address a range of topics from climate protection , trade and market issues to energy cooperation .
the talks have been overshadowed by protests against chinese authorities in tibet and a security crackdown there .
china 's response to the unrest and criticism of its rights record has sparked noisy protests that have disrupted the olympic torch 's round-the-world relay ahead of the august games , infuriating chinese authorities .
the government 's harsh reaction has prompted calls in europe for a boycott of the games ' opening ceremony .
rejects calls for olympic boycott bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe has debated a boycott but barroso has rejected the idea barroso deflected calls for a boycott of at least the opening ceremony of the games .
" the olympics must be a celebration of the youth of the world and it must be a success .
that is why i 'm against the boycott . "
for the olympics to " be a success " they must take place " in a peaceful atmosphere , " he said , adding that it was necessary that " human rights are comprehensively respected . "
eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner reiterated the eu 's call for chinese leaders to engage in a constructive dialog with the representatives of tibet 's spiritual leader the dalai lama to seek a stable and long-term solution in tibet .
it was later reported by the official state news agency xinhua that the chinese government would begin talks with representatives of the dalai lama within days .
the meeting was spurred by " requests repeatedly made by the dalai side for resuming talks , " an official was quoted by xinhua .
ground rules for dialog bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama and his fellow tibetans want dialog china 's policy regarding tibet has not changed , said the official , who added that he hoped through dialog that " the dalai side will take credible moves to stop activities aimed at splitting china . "
they must also " stop plotting and inciting violence " and " disrupting and sabotaging the beijing olympic games , " in order to create conditions conducive to talks , said the official as quoted by xinhua .
meanwhile , dalai lama spokesman tenzin takhla welcomed the offer , saying it was a " positive step in the right direction . "
" all i can say is that we have received no official communication about this .
however his holiness is committed to resolving the tibet issue and the only way to resolve the tibet issue is by meeting the chinese representatives face-to-face and addressing the grievances of tibetans , " he said .
" therefore , if talks take place it would be a positive step in the right direction , " takhla said over the phone from india 's northern hill town of dharamsala where the dalai lama and the tibetan government-in-exile is based .
ferrero-waldner was skeptical whether direct talks with the dalai lama would take place .
" we are not that far yet , " she said , adding that she was encouraged and that there was " a very open atmosphere here , and that is already a certain breakthrough . "
sino-european relations on life support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the divide between china dn the eu has grown recently friday 's talks were the first round of a series of high-ranking meetings between china and the european union , which had been agreed upon months ago .
since then , relations between the two powers have been strained over the situation in tibet and the protests around the olympics .
china 's state media acknowledged shortly after barroso 's arrival that the china-eu relationship had " soured " over tibet .
" the main purpose is to mend the fissure that has occurred in the sino-eu relationship , " shen jiru , a researcher at the chinese academy of social sciences , told xinhua .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 25.04.2008 impact of the fake hitler diaries press scandal 25 years later großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad kujau 's forgeries were technically and historically flawed " stern " magazine 's discovery of the hitler diaries a quarter-century ago was a media sensation - and a spectacular hoax .
insiders illuminate the pitfalls of publishers influencing editorial policy . " all the ingredients for a programmed catastrophe were there from day one , " said michael seufert , author of the newly released book " the scandal surrounding the hitler diaries . " seufert was stern 's domestic editor on april 25 , 1983 when the weekly newsmagazine publicized its sensational scoop : 62 volumes of adolf hitler 's journal entries from 1932 to 1945 bound in black imitation leather had been unearthed . the fanfare over the stern exclusive was , however , short-lived .
two weeks later , the diaries were exposed as complete forgeries .
it had turned out that stern 's source in obtaining the alleged diaries was a con artist and petty thief named konrad kujau , who made a small fortune in fabricating and selling old nazi memorabilia . kujau found a taker for his forgeries in stern reporter gerd heidemann , and that 's where the disaster began , according to seufert . " heidemann had such a morbid fascination with nazi collectibles that he even wound up befriending war criminals and was ready to believe in anything , " seufert said . downfall of publisher meddling in editorial matters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stern billed the diaries as the scoop of the century if heidemann 's gullibility were the only issue , the fake hitler diaries would have never seen the light of day .
the downfall was that the top brass at stern 's publisher , gruener + jahr , had also been blind-sided and were so eager for an exclusive scoop that they not only forked over a colossal sum in cash to obtain the diaries , but had even guaranteed that only heidemann and one other editor could review its contents . the project was shrouded in secrecy in order to protect alleged sources in the former east germany dictatorship , according to seufert , who described the collusion of reporter and publisher with a counterfeiter and the cold war as a backdrop , as fatal . " we editors were completely kept out of the loop , so all the normal checks and balances to authenticate stories were brushed aside , " said seufert , who confirmed that the publishing house had paid out 9.34 million dm -lrb- worth more than $ 4 million at the time -rrb- altogether to heidemann and kujau .
both had served over four years of prison time each on fraud charges , while stern 's two top editors had resigned . since most of the key players in the whole saga , including kujau , are either dead now or refuse to discuss the scandal publicly , corroborating seufert 's version of the events is difficult . however magnus linklater , who had been features editor of the sunday times of london , which had serial rights to publish extracts of the diaries in english , shared seufert 's frustrations at the time .
linklater had smelled a rat when he read the material . " it didn ’ t sound right , " he said . purchased sight unseen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : handwriting experts had not been allowed to examine diaries " but the deal was that rupert murdoch , whose company owns the times , bought the diaries from stern , and the condition of purchase was that we were not allowed to conduct our own independent investigation , " linklater added .
" this was a clear case of the editorial and business side of newspapers clashing .
we had to take the pig in a poke so to say . " before publication , linklater did however talk to the eminent hitler historian hugh trevor-roper , who assured him the diaries were genuine . " his word was good enough for me , but it goes to show how gullible we can all be , " linklater said .
" the point is if you are offered a scoop , you can keep it secret , but that does n't mean you ca n't do internal checks . " as it turned out , the hitler documents were so technically flawed that forensic experts were able to easily determine that the paper , ink and glue that held the book bindings together were manufactured with post-war materials .
even hitler 's handwriting had not been subject to analysis . importance of internal checks and controls " you need outside experts to look at the handwriting or paper , so it is understandable that stern , which was so paranoid about secrecy , was afraid of leaks , " said gerhard weinberg , a world war ii historian , whom newsweek had hired as a consultant to examine the authenticity of the diaries .
" but what is unfathomable is why they did no internal checks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stern reporter gerd heidemann was obsessed by nazi collectibles , such as fake diaries weinberg pointed out that the diaries were full of mistakes that would have been recognized had stern allowed experts to examine even typed versions of the diaries . " someone in-house could have then read the diary and would have discovered things that were so preposterous that hitler couldn ’ t have possibly written them , " weinberg said .
" hitler , for instance , would never have gotten the color of his own uniform wrong . " hendrik zoerner , spokesman for the german journalists ' association -lrb- djv -rrb- said stern normally does subject its stories to internal control mechanisms .
the fake hitler diaries were an exceptional case of gross negligence that would never be repeated again by stern or any other media outlet , he said . " but we in the media will be making other kinds of mistakes that are less spectacular than what happened at stern , " zoerner said .
" nowadays journalists are under such time pressure that they spend less time doing sound research and fact-checking , so they wind up slipping up and making smaller mistakes on a daily basis . " zoerner added that mistakes , even big ones are inevitable , but responsible journalists need to own up to them . " stern admitted its mistakes and worked through its crisis in public , " he said .
" by doing so , it restored some credibility to its image . " diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

insiders illuminate the pitfalls of publishers influencing editorial policy . " all the ingredients for a programmed catastrophe were there from day one , " said michael seufert , author of the newly released book " the scandal surrounding the hitler diaries . " seufert was stern 's domestic editor on april 25 , 1983 when the weekly newsmagazine publicized its sensational scoop : 62 volumes of adolf hitler 's journal entries from 1932 to 1945 bound in black imitation leather had been unearthed . the fanfare over the stern exclusive was , however , short-lived .
two weeks later , the diaries were exposed as complete forgeries .
it had turned out that stern 's source in obtaining the alleged diaries was a con artist and petty thief named konrad kujau , who made a small fortune in fabricating and selling old nazi memorabilia . kujau found a taker for his forgeries in stern reporter gerd heidemann , and that 's where the disaster began , according to seufert . " heidemann had such a morbid fascination with nazi collectibles that he even wound up befriending war criminals and was ready to believe in anything , " seufert said . downfall of publisher meddling in editorial matters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stern billed the diaries as the scoop of the century if heidemann 's gullibility were the only issue , the fake hitler diaries would have never seen the light of day .
the downfall was that the top brass at stern 's publisher , gruener + jahr , had also been blind-sided and were so eager for an exclusive scoop that they not only forked over a colossal sum in cash to obtain the diaries , but had even guaranteed that only heidemann and one other editor could review its contents . the project was shrouded in secrecy in order to protect alleged sources in the former east germany dictatorship , according to seufert , who described the collusion of reporter and publisher with a counterfeiter and the cold war as a backdrop , as fatal . " we editors were completely kept out of the loop , so all the normal checks and balances to authenticate stories were brushed aside , " said seufert , who confirmed that the publishing house had paid out 9.34 million dm -lrb- worth more than $ 4 million at the time -rrb- altogether to heidemann and kujau .
both had served over four years of prison time each on fraud charges , while stern 's two top editors had resigned . since most of the key players in the whole saga , including kujau , are either dead now or refuse to discuss the scandal publicly , corroborating seufert 's version of the events is difficult . however magnus linklater , who had been features editor of the sunday times of london , which had serial rights to publish extracts of the diaries in english , shared seufert 's frustrations at the time .
linklater had smelled a rat when he read the material . " it didn ’ t sound right , " he said . purchased sight unseen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : handwriting experts had not been allowed to examine diaries " but the deal was that rupert murdoch , whose company owns the times , bought the diaries from stern , and the condition of purchase was that we were not allowed to conduct our own independent investigation , " linklater added .
" this was a clear case of the editorial and business side of newspapers clashing .
we had to take the pig in a poke so to say . " before publication , linklater did however talk to the eminent hitler historian hugh trevor-roper , who assured him the diaries were genuine . " his word was good enough for me , but it goes to show how gullible we can all be , " linklater said .
" the point is if you are offered a scoop , you can keep it secret , but that does n't mean you ca n't do internal checks . " as it turned out , the hitler documents were so technically flawed that forensic experts were able to easily determine that the paper , ink and glue that held the book bindings together were manufactured with post-war materials .
even hitler 's handwriting had not been subject to analysis . importance of internal checks and controls " you need outside experts to look at the handwriting or paper , so it is understandable that stern , which was so paranoid about secrecy , was afraid of leaks , " said gerhard weinberg , a world war ii historian , whom newsweek had hired as a consultant to examine the authenticity of the diaries .
" but what is unfathomable is why they did no internal checks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stern reporter gerd heidemann was obsessed by nazi collectibles , such as fake diaries weinberg pointed out that the diaries were full of mistakes that would have been recognized had stern allowed experts to examine even typed versions of the diaries . " someone in-house could have then read the diary and would have discovered things that were so preposterous that hitler couldn ’ t have possibly written them , " weinberg said .
" hitler , for instance , would never have gotten the color of his own uniform wrong . " hendrik zoerner , spokesman for the german journalists ' association -lrb- djv -rrb- said stern normally does subject its stories to internal control mechanisms .
the fake hitler diaries were an exceptional case of gross negligence that would never be repeated again by stern or any other media outlet , he said . " but we in the media will be making other kinds of mistakes that are less spectacular than what happened at stern , " zoerner said .
" nowadays journalists are under such time pressure that they spend less time doing sound research and fact-checking , so they wind up slipping up and making smaller mistakes on a daily basis . " zoerner added that mistakes , even big ones are inevitable , but responsible journalists need to own up to them . " stern admitted its mistakes and worked through its crisis in public , " he said .

" i am particularly encouraged by our open and frank exchanges on tibet , " said barroso after meeting with wen .
" i hope to see positive developments soon .
i have reiterated the eu position on this matter . "
barroso , leading a large eu delegation to the chinese capital amid tension over china 's rule in tibet and the beijing olympics , said he reassured wen that europe considered the himalayan region as part of chinese territory .
he said europe supported china 's territorial integrity and unity " and that naturally applies to tibet . "
however , he did urge china to reverse its current policy and grant free access for foreign journalists and foreign visitors to tibet .
barroso traveled to beijing with nine european union commissioners to address a range of topics from climate protection , trade and market issues to energy cooperation .
the talks have been overshadowed by protests against chinese authorities in tibet and a security crackdown there .
china 's response to the unrest and criticism of its rights record has sparked noisy protests that have disrupted the olympic torch 's round-the-world relay ahead of the august games , infuriating chinese authorities .

for the olympics to " be a success " they must take place " in a peaceful atmosphere , " he said , adding that it was necessary that " human rights are comprehensively respected . "
eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner reiterated the eu 's call for chinese leaders to engage in a constructive dialog with the representatives of tibet 's spiritual leader the dalai lama to seek a stable and long-term solution in tibet .

"
they must also " stop plotting and inciting violence " and " disrupting and sabotaging the beijing olympic games , " in order to create conditions conducive to talks , said the official as quoted by xinhua .
meanwhile , dalai lama spokesman tenzin takhla welcomed the offer , saying it was a " positive step in the right direction . "
" all i can say is that we have received no official communication about this .
however his holiness is committed to resolving the tibet issue and the only way to resolve the tibet issue is by meeting the chinese representatives face-to-face and addressing the grievances of tibetans , " he said .
" therefore , if talks take place it would be a positive step in the right direction , " takhla said over the phone from india 's northern hill town of dharamsala where the dalai lama and the tibetan government-in-exile is based .
ferrero-waldner was skeptical whether direct talks with the dalai lama would take place .

annotated versions of other texts by hitler and other nazi leaders are in print , however . hitler considered himself a writer and composed all his speeches himself , said wehler , adding that it can reasonably be presumed that the nazi leader wrote most of " mein kampf " himself as well . " since he had a terribly ruinous effect on world history , these parts should be kept in a critical edition , " the historian said . copyright expires soon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler wrote his own speeches the copyright for " mein kampf " expires 70 years after hitler 's death , in 2015 .
some , including the board of trustees at the nuremberg documentation center have said that publishing an annotated copy now could help prevent neo-nazis from taking advantage of the lifting of the copyright and misusing the text for propaganda purposes . wehler , however , said he did n't think right-wing radicals would be very interested in the text .
" every skinhead is one too many , but there 's not a very passionate hitler readership in this country , " he said . the annotated edition would mainly be sold to universities , libraries and academic institutions . the documentation center 's board of trustees said it has already taken its request for the publication to bavaria 's prime minister guenter beckstein , since the state 's finance ministry was granted possession of the copyright by the allied forces after world war ii . the munich institute of contemporary history would likely be commissioned to publish the volume , which could take several years to complete . jewish leader in favour of publication a top figure in germany 's jewish community said friday he wants hitler 's book to be republished , but together with an accompanying commentary . " in principle i am in favor of the book being made public with a commentary , " both in normal book form and on the internet , stephan kramer , general secretary of the central council of jews , told deutschlandfunk radio . kramer said the central council of jews was ready to help write the commentary . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de olympics -pipe- 25.04.2008 olympic sponsors between a rock and a hard place großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : torn between the west and china , olympic sponsors , like adidas , are having a tough time the beijing olympics sponsors need to find ways to prevent international outrage over the situation in tibet from morphing into a backlash against them .
dw-world.de spoke to one of their advisors about what can be done . international outrage has been simmering since the chinese crackdown on protests in tibet in march , in which an unknown number of people were jailed or even killed .
in the meantime , there have been calls for a boycott of the games , politicians and athletes have said they would not take part in the opening ceremonies , and the city of paris this week named the dalai lama an honorary citizen . china has responded with anger and many chinese have started to boycott french companies .
hundreds of anti-china demonstrators took to the streets in europe last week to protest against china 's approach to tibet , as thousands of chinese marched in counter-demonstrations in berlin , london and paris .
the controversy is unlikely to die down until well after the beijing olympics , which run from august 8-24 , are over .
it 's a tough time for olympic sponsors , such as coca-cola , volkswagen or adidas . dw-world discussed their difficulties with thorsten hofmann , the ceo of prsg , a berlin-based consultancy for political and crisis management .
the company recently acquired an olympic sponsor as a client . dw-world.de : an old adage says " all publicity is good publicity . "
at what point does the damage make it not worthwhile for a sponsor ? thorsten hofmann : starting with " all publicity is good publicity : " that 's a dangerous statement , because when you 're in a crisis situation , you have the greatest amount of attention a firm could ever want , but unfortunately not in the context you would want it , and that , of course , is the most important thing .
if you want publicity , you generally want it in a nice , harmonious context with a positive image transfer .
in our concrete example , the olympic games , everyone who positioned themselves as sponsors - and invested somewhere between 50 and 100 million euros -lrb- $ 80 to $ 160 million -rrb- - wants to take the olympics ' positive image and create a brand transfer .
adidas as a sports brand wants to participate , vw wants to profit from the dynamics of the games , and above all , everything should be nice and harmonious .
and now for the big dilemma : if the olympics do n't go off as they could , but rather if - as is now the case - there 's a disregard for human rights , violent attacks , attacks on the torch bearers and disturbances of a political nature , then naturally this image transfer also rubs off on the sponsors .
it 's no longer so nice and smooth , and at some point as a sponsor you will be asked what your own position is .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights activists have been vocal in their criticism of china that is , what was originally planned - we participate in a collective sports competition , the olympics , and appear prominently as a main sponsor - can turn into the opposite .
for when a state in which the olympic games take place , like china , presents itself to the world as riding roughshod over human rights - that 's the outside perception - then the world asks itself , " what do the sponsors think of this ?
do human rights not matter to them ?
do they put the value of money above human rights ? "
that 's the negative side of the image transfer . a similar case is that of t-mobile and others companies sponsoring cycling in germany . it is definitely similar .
the cycling sponsors have always profited from the sporting image and the high spectator numbers of , for example , the tour de france .
now , because of all the doping cases , cycling has become dirty , and this dirtiness at some point rubs off on a brand .
accordingly , ever more sponsors are pulling out .
there are cases in the context of sporting events which are absolutely negative for the sponsors ' image , for the sponsors ' brands , and we , as sponsors , have to decide : " what do i do ? " .
with cycling , sponsors tried at the beginning of the doping crisis to introduce responsibility into the equation , to say i 'll create my own guidelines , anyone who takes drugs will be kicked out , i want to fight for clean cycling .
but at some point it became clear that the fight was futile , and sponsors said the recurring negative news is affecting my brand negatively , and at some point i pull out .
that 's what happened . with the olympics , at what point should sponsors pull out ?
when has it gone too far ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been protests in china against french companies that 's a super hard question , because you have to see it in the context of a giant market .
china is the market of the future - i think we all agree on that - and that 's why they all have put their energies and their sponsoring budgets into the olympics .
in addition , you have to take into account that china has an entirely different culture from our western culture .
that means , if i start to talk at the chinese about their culture and to publicly question the things they do , they lose face .
losing face is an affront in china , and you can be sure that as a consequence your company will have a big problem gaining a foothold there . but on the other hand , if you carry on with sponsoring and incidents occur at the olympics - from violent attacks on demonstrators to deaths - then the companies from outside must be prepared for the rest of the world to ask : " how far does the so-called kowtow to the communist dictatorship go ? "
for the companies , the question also arises : " how important are human rights to me and how important is money ? "
that 's the predicament the companies currently find themselves in .
they are caught between a rock and a hard place . but getting back to the question .
when should they pull out ?
it becomes very , very critical when there are deaths .
if there is suddenly fighting , or in the worst case - as has happened before in china - there 's shooting , demonstrators are killed with the world watching , then the company has to carefully consider , " how are my opportunities in this market , what should i do now , and how do my other markets judge my behavior ? "
it 's always an individual decision , that has to be made according to the situation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the torch relay went undisturbed in india ; protesters could n't get near it if i decide i 'm interested in a sponsoring contract - and am prepared to spend 50 to 100 million euros or more - why do n't i put some thought into a prevention plan ?
that is , i know china , and i 'm familiar with all of its sources of conflict , i 'm also familiar with the conflict situation with tibet , the issues of human rights , poverty , child labor and so on .
why have i not yet given some thought to how i could react to accusations of this nature ?
the classic tool is crisis prevention work , and it could have had an effect here .
and i think , actually , i know that that is the current situation the companies face .
they are literally surprised by a matter of course . one would assume they would have prepared for such an eventuality ? exactly , you 're absolutely right .
if i 'm prepared to become a sponsor , to spruce up my brand , then i also have to develop my protective shield so my brand is n't damaged .
and this shield is preventive work , crisis prevention .
at the moment i have the impression that everyone is surprised by what is happening .
that something could have happened , must have been clear to everyone .
because china functions differently than western societies , it 's just not understood by the rest of the world . do you have sporting events sponsors or olympic sponsors as clients ? yes on both counts .
the latter we got relatively recently , which is why i can reconstruct things well .
it 's the case that most of the sponsors have n't given any thought to these things . what can your company do for them ?
how can you protect them ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese students rallied this week to express their pride in their country of course , to start with we were surprised that there was no concept and in many areas no thought had gone into things .
what we 're now doing is thinking about how you can show that sponsoring does n't just mean money to develop a brand , as is assumed , but also to try to participate in shaping societal change .
in concrete terms that means developing one 's own projects that are cross-nation , that take place with china , in which sensitive issues , like human rights , exposure to publicity , etc . , are addressed and in which the added value for a country like china is apparent .
the chinese do n't see any added value in developing an internet that is not controlled , why they should allow press freedom , why they should be transparent or why , for example , they could allow demonstrations as an articulation of free expression . what do you do if there are calls for boycotts of sponsors ? we have to determine what messages we want to send for the different situations that could arise .
say our sports clothes or our cars are n't being bought anymore .
here the company has to take a stand , and formulating the message is very difficult .
they remain between a rock and a hard place , which means that every word hangs in the balance .
every word is a tightrope walk .
on the one hand , they have to consider to what extent do i want to damage my future business in china , and on the other hand , i want to clarify my position to the rest of the world .

annotated versions of other texts by hitler and other nazi leaders are in print , however . hitler considered himself a writer and composed all his speeches himself , said wehler , adding that it can reasonably be presumed that the nazi leader wrote most of " mein kampf " himself as well . " since he had a terribly ruinous effect on world history , these parts should be kept in a critical edition , " the historian said . copyright expires soon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler wrote his own speeches the copyright for " mein kampf " expires 70 years after hitler 's death , in 2015 .
some , including the board of trustees at the nuremberg documentation center have said that publishing an annotated copy now could help prevent neo-nazis from taking advantage of the lifting of the copyright and misusing the text for propaganda purposes . wehler , however , said he did n't think right-wing radicals would be very interested in the text .
" every skinhead is one too many , but there 's not a very passionate hitler readership in this country , " he said . the annotated edition would mainly be sold to universities , libraries and academic institutions . the documentation center 's board of trustees said it has already taken its request for the publication to bavaria 's prime minister guenter beckstein , since the state 's finance ministry was granted possession of the copyright by the allied forces after world war ii . the munich institute of contemporary history would likely be commissioned to publish the volume , which could take several years to complete . jewish leader in favour of publication a top figure in germany 's jewish community said friday he wants hitler 's book to be republished , but together with an accompanying commentary . " in principle i am in favor of the book being made public with a commentary , " both in normal book form and on the internet , stephan kramer , general secretary of the central council of jews , told deutschlandfunk radio . kramer said the central council of jews was ready to help write the commentary . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but child advocates said they do n't think it will do much good . in cases of child abuse and neglect , courts in germany previously had to show that parents were unfit .
this is often difficult to prove and , if verified , usually leads to the children being taken away and placed in foster care . according to a new law , approved by the german parliament on thursday , april 24 , courts can get involved earlier , before significant physical or emotional damage has been caused to the child and before the parents lose custody . the tragic deaths of several children in the past few months show that there are considerable deficits in the system , said justice minister brigitte zypries . " we want courts to be able to intervene earlier in the future , " said zypries . courts can order parents to get help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister brigitte zypries to intervene with preventative measures , authorities now have to show that the child 's well-being is endangered and that the parents can not or do not want to improve the situation . the new law allows courts to force parents to take certain steps that promote their child 's well-being : going to counseling , taking their child to the doctor , making their child go to school or attending a non-violence course . the courts should also make clear to the parents that they face consequences , which may include losing their child , if they do n't participate in the preventative programs . in addition , courts are now required to work more quickly when a child 's well-being is a stake , with the first court appointment to take place within one month of the case being filed . recommendations for many of the law 's measures were put together by an expert commission initiated by zypries in 2006 . criticism from child aid group bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new law aims to help troubled parents do a better job - but will it work ?
the german children 's aid group deutsche kinderhilfe called the new law " a drop in the bucket , " saying that there simply were n't enough judges to carry out the newly adopted measures and that most judges were n't trained as social workers . " the law is n't wrong , but the demands it places are completely exaggerated , " the group 's president heinz hilgers said in an interview with television broadcaster n24 . he added that he did n't think " the law would prevent a single case " like that of 5-year-old lea-sophie in schwerin who died of malnutrition in november 2007 after being neglected by her parents for months . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i am particularly encouraged by our open and frank exchanges on tibet , " said barroso after meeting with wen .
" i hope to see positive developments soon .
i have reiterated the eu position on this matter . "
barroso , leading a large eu delegation to the chinese capital amid tension over china 's rule in tibet and the beijing olympics , said he reassured wen that europe considered the himalayan region as part of chinese territory .
he said europe supported china 's territorial integrity and unity " and that naturally applies to tibet . "
however , he did urge china to reverse its current policy and grant free access for foreign journalists and foreign visitors to tibet .
barroso traveled to beijing with nine european union commissioners to address a range of topics from climate protection , trade and market issues to energy cooperation .
the talks have been overshadowed by protests against chinese authorities in tibet and a security crackdown there .
china 's response to the unrest and criticism of its rights record has sparked noisy protests that have disrupted the olympic torch 's round-the-world relay ahead of the august games , infuriating chinese authorities .
the government 's harsh reaction has prompted calls in europe for a boycott of the games ' opening ceremony .
rejects calls for olympic boycott bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe has debated a boycott but barroso has rejected the idea barroso deflected calls for a boycott of at least the opening ceremony of the games .
" the olympics must be a celebration of the youth of the world and it must be a success .

it was later reported by the official state news agency xinhua that the chinese government would begin talks with representatives of the dalai lama within days .
the meeting was spurred by " requests repeatedly made by the dalai side for resuming talks , " an official was quoted by xinhua .
ground rules for dialog bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama and his fellow tibetans want dialog china 's policy regarding tibet has not changed , said the official , who added that he hoped through dialog that " the dalai side will take credible moves to stop activities aimed at splitting china . "
they must also " stop plotting and inciting violence " and " disrupting and sabotaging the beijing olympic games , " in order to create conditions conducive to talks , said the official as quoted by xinhua .
meanwhile , dalai lama spokesman tenzin takhla welcomed the offer , saying it was a " positive step in the right direction . "
" all i can say is that we have received no official communication about this .
however his holiness is committed to resolving the tibet issue and the only way to resolve the tibet issue is by meeting the chinese representatives face-to-face and addressing the grievances of tibetans , " he said .
" therefore , if talks take place it would be a positive step in the right direction , " takhla said over the phone from india 's northern hill town of dharamsala where the dalai lama and the tibetan government-in-exile is based .
ferrero-waldner was skeptical whether direct talks with the dalai lama would take place .
" we are not that far yet , " she said , adding that she was encouraged and that there was " a very open atmosphere here , and that is already a certain breakthrough . "
sino-european relations on life support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the divide between china dn the eu has grown recently friday 's talks were the first round of a series of high-ranking meetings between china and the european union , which had been agreed upon months ago .
since then , relations between the two powers have been strained over the situation in tibet and the protests around the olympics .
china 's state media acknowledged shortly after barroso 's arrival that the china-eu relationship had " soured " over tibet .
" the main purpose is to mend the fissure that has occurred in the sino-eu relationship , " shen jiru , a researcher at the chinese academy of social sciences , told xinhua .

insiders illuminate the pitfalls of publishers influencing editorial policy . " all the ingredients for a programmed catastrophe were there from day one , " said michael seufert , author of the newly released book " the scandal surrounding the hitler diaries . " seufert was stern 's domestic editor on april 25 , 1983 when the weekly newsmagazine publicized its sensational scoop : 62 volumes of adolf hitler 's journal entries from 1932 to 1945 bound in black imitation leather had been unearthed . the fanfare over the stern exclusive was , however , short-lived .
two weeks later , the diaries were exposed as complete forgeries .
it had turned out that stern 's source in obtaining the alleged diaries was a con artist and petty thief named konrad kujau , who made a small fortune in fabricating and selling old nazi memorabilia . kujau found a taker for his forgeries in stern reporter gerd heidemann , and that 's where the disaster began , according to seufert . " heidemann had such a morbid fascination with nazi collectibles that he even wound up befriending war criminals and was ready to believe in anything , " seufert said . downfall of publisher meddling in editorial matters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stern billed the diaries as the scoop of the century if heidemann 's gullibility were the only issue , the fake hitler diaries would have never seen the light of day .
the downfall was that the top brass at stern 's publisher , gruener + jahr , had also been blind-sided and were so eager for an exclusive scoop that they not only forked over a colossal sum in cash to obtain the diaries , but had even guaranteed that only heidemann and one other editor could review its contents . the project was shrouded in secrecy in order to protect alleged sources in the former east germany dictatorship , according to seufert , who described the collusion of reporter and publisher with a counterfeiter and the cold war as a backdrop , as fatal . " we editors were completely kept out of the loop , so all the normal checks and balances to authenticate stories were brushed aside , " said seufert , who confirmed that the publishing house had paid out 9.34 million dm -lrb- worth more than $ 4 million at the time -rrb- altogether to heidemann and kujau .
both had served over four years of prison time each on fraud charges , while stern 's two top editors had resigned . since most of the key players in the whole saga , including kujau , are either dead now or refuse to discuss the scandal publicly , corroborating seufert 's version of the events is difficult . however magnus linklater , who had been features editor of the sunday times of london , which had serial rights to publish extracts of the diaries in english , shared seufert 's frustrations at the time .

" we hope that our dear son sinan will also be free soon , " al tornachi said in a video message in arabic , which was posted on german public broadcaster zdf 's web site on thursday , april 24 . zdf 's deputy editor-in-chief elmar thevessen said his broadcaster had offered the video to several arab partners , including al jazeera and al arabiya , and that they had shown interest in it . the kidnappers , who reportedly belong to the militant islamist group " the arrows of righteousness brigade , " have threatened to execute krause if germany does not pull its troops out of afghanistan .
some 3,500 german troops are stationed in northern afghanistan , where they are mainly involved in peacekeeping and reconstruction . " the crisis team at the foreign ministry continues to work intensively on finding a solution , " said a spokeswoman thursday , confirming that the ministry knew of the video . hannelore krause immigrated to iraq some 40 years ago .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children -pipe- 25.04.2008 new child protection law aimed at early intervention großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several recent deaths have alerted the state to child neglect and abuse courts can intervene sooner and more easily in cases of suspected child neglect , according to a new law passed by the german parliament .
but child advocates said they do n't think it will do much good . in cases of child abuse and neglect , courts in germany previously had to show that parents were unfit .
this is often difficult to prove and , if verified , usually leads to the children being taken away and placed in foster care . according to a new law , approved by the german parliament on thursday , april 24 , courts can get involved earlier , before significant physical or emotional damage has been caused to the child and before the parents lose custody . the tragic deaths of several children in the past few months show that there are considerable deficits in the system , said justice minister brigitte zypries . " we want courts to be able to intervene earlier in the future , " said zypries . courts can order parents to get help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister brigitte zypries to intervene with preventative measures , authorities now have to show that the child 's well-being is endangered and that the parents can not or do not want to improve the situation . the new law allows courts to force parents to take certain steps that promote their child 's well-being : going to counseling , taking their child to the doctor , making their child go to school or attending a non-violence course . the courts should also make clear to the parents that they face consequences , which may include losing their child , if they do n't participate in the preventative programs . in addition , courts are now required to work more quickly when a child 's well-being is a stake , with the first court appointment to take place within one month of the case being filed . recommendations for many of the law 's measures were put together by an expert commission initiated by zypries in 2006 . criticism from child aid group bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new law aims to help troubled parents do a better job - but will it work ?
the german children 's aid group deutsche kinderhilfe called the new law " a drop in the bucket , " saying that there simply were n't enough judges to carry out the newly adopted measures and that most judges were n't trained as social workers . " the law is n't wrong , but the demands it places are completely exaggerated , " the group 's president heinz hilgers said in an interview with television broadcaster n24 . he added that he did n't think " the law would prevent a single case " like that of 5-year-old lea-sophie in schwerin who died of malnutrition in november 2007 after being neglected by her parents for months . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but child advocates said they do n't think it will do much good . in cases of child abuse and neglect , courts in germany previously had to show that parents were unfit .
this is often difficult to prove and , if verified , usually leads to the children being taken away and placed in foster care . according to a new law , approved by the german parliament on thursday , april 24 , courts can get involved earlier , before significant physical or emotional damage has been caused to the child and before the parents lose custody . the tragic deaths of several children in the past few months show that there are considerable deficits in the system , said justice minister brigitte zypries . " we want courts to be able to intervene earlier in the future , " said zypries . courts can order parents to get help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister brigitte zypries to intervene with preventative measures , authorities now have to show that the child 's well-being is endangered and that the parents can not or do not want to improve the situation . the new law allows courts to force parents to take certain steps that promote their child 's well-being : going to counseling , taking their child to the doctor , making their child go to school or attending a non-violence course . the courts should also make clear to the parents that they face consequences , which may include losing their child , if they do n't participate in the preventative programs . in addition , courts are now required to work more quickly when a child 's well-being is a stake , with the first court appointment to take place within one month of the case being filed . recommendations for many of the law 's measures were put together by an expert commission initiated by zypries in 2006 . criticism from child aid group bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new law aims to help troubled parents do a better job - but will it work ?
the german children 's aid group deutsche kinderhilfe called the new law " a drop in the bucket , " saying that there simply were n't enough judges to carry out the newly adopted measures and that most judges were n't trained as social workers . " the law is n't wrong , but the demands it places are completely exaggerated , " the group 's president heinz hilgers said in an interview with television broadcaster n24 . he added that he did n't think " the law would prevent a single case " like that of 5-year-old lea-sophie in schwerin who died of malnutrition in november 2007 after being neglected by her parents for months . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

insiders illuminate the pitfalls of publishers influencing editorial policy . " all the ingredients for a programmed catastrophe were there from day one , " said michael seufert , author of the newly released book " the scandal surrounding the hitler diaries . " seufert was stern 's domestic editor on april 25 , 1983 when the weekly newsmagazine publicized its sensational scoop : 62 volumes of adolf hitler 's journal entries from 1932 to 1945 bound in black imitation leather had been unearthed . the fanfare over the stern exclusive was , however , short-lived .
two weeks later , the diaries were exposed as complete forgeries .
it had turned out that stern 's source in obtaining the alleged diaries was a con artist and petty thief named konrad kujau , who made a small fortune in fabricating and selling old nazi memorabilia . kujau found a taker for his forgeries in stern reporter gerd heidemann , and that 's where the disaster began , according to seufert . " heidemann had such a morbid fascination with nazi collectibles that he even wound up befriending war criminals and was ready to believe in anything , " seufert said . downfall of publisher meddling in editorial matters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stern billed the diaries as the scoop of the century if heidemann 's gullibility were the only issue , the fake hitler diaries would have never seen the light of day .
the downfall was that the top brass at stern 's publisher , gruener + jahr , had also been blind-sided and were so eager for an exclusive scoop that they not only forked over a colossal sum in cash to obtain the diaries , but had even guaranteed that only heidemann and one other editor could review its contents . the project was shrouded in secrecy in order to protect alleged sources in the former east germany dictatorship , according to seufert , who described the collusion of reporter and publisher with a counterfeiter and the cold war as a backdrop , as fatal . " we editors were completely kept out of the loop , so all the normal checks and balances to authenticate stories were brushed aside , " said seufert , who confirmed that the publishing house had paid out 9.34 million dm -lrb- worth more than $ 4 million at the time -rrb- altogether to heidemann and kujau .
both had served over four years of prison time each on fraud charges , while stern 's two top editors had resigned . since most of the key players in the whole saga , including kujau , are either dead now or refuse to discuss the scandal publicly , corroborating seufert 's version of the events is difficult . however magnus linklater , who had been features editor of the sunday times of london , which had serial rights to publish extracts of the diaries in english , shared seufert 's frustrations at the time .
linklater had smelled a rat when he read the material . " it didn ’ t sound right , " he said . purchased sight unseen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : handwriting experts had not been allowed to examine diaries " but the deal was that rupert murdoch , whose company owns the times , bought the diaries from stern , and the condition of purchase was that we were not allowed to conduct our own independent investigation , " linklater added .
" this was a clear case of the editorial and business side of newspapers clashing .
we had to take the pig in a poke so to say . " before publication , linklater did however talk to the eminent hitler historian hugh trevor-roper , who assured him the diaries were genuine . " his word was good enough for me , but it goes to show how gullible we can all be , " linklater said .
" the point is if you are offered a scoop , you can keep it secret , but that does n't mean you ca n't do internal checks . " as it turned out , the hitler documents were so technically flawed that forensic experts were able to easily determine that the paper , ink and glue that held the book bindings together were manufactured with post-war materials .
even hitler 's handwriting had not been subject to analysis . importance of internal checks and controls " you need outside experts to look at the handwriting or paper , so it is understandable that stern , which was so paranoid about secrecy , was afraid of leaks , " said gerhard weinberg , a world war ii historian , whom newsweek had hired as a consultant to examine the authenticity of the diaries .
" but what is unfathomable is why they did no internal checks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stern reporter gerd heidemann was obsessed by nazi collectibles , such as fake diaries weinberg pointed out that the diaries were full of mistakes that would have been recognized had stern allowed experts to examine even typed versions of the diaries . " someone in-house could have then read the diary and would have discovered things that were so preposterous that hitler couldn ’ t have possibly written them , " weinberg said .
" hitler , for instance , would never have gotten the color of his own uniform wrong . " hendrik zoerner , spokesman for the german journalists ' association -lrb- djv -rrb- said stern normally does subject its stories to internal control mechanisms .
the fake hitler diaries were an exceptional case of gross negligence that would never be repeated again by stern or any other media outlet , he said . " but we in the media will be making other kinds of mistakes that are less spectacular than what happened at stern , " zoerner said .
" nowadays journalists are under such time pressure that they spend less time doing sound research and fact-checking , so they wind up slipping up and making smaller mistakes on a daily basis .

" " france and germany have until now remained deaf to the suffering of these innocent victims of a conflict that they did not know , " he said on thursday , april 24 . " i speak of the children of war , those who were damned in france as the offspring of the boches , " he said , using a pejorative term for germans , by which many of the children became known . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the popularity of marshall petain 's pro-german vichy government became taboo in post-war france , many of these children were treated as a personification of the german enemy and were abandoned by their mothers , spurned by their families and ostracized by society . kouchner stressed that the identity of these children - born of war and suffering , of love and hatred - mirrored the identity of europe itself . for decades , the existence of these children remained taboo in france - tangible proof that french resistance to the german occupation was not as widespread as many wanted to believe .
jean-paul picaper spent 10 years trying to find a publisher for his book , " enfants maudits " -lrb- cursed children -rrb- , which finally appeared in both germany and france in 2004 . in germany , too , very little was done to acknowledge this particular war legacy .

" symbolic recognition for their dual origins bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the freeze in franco-german relations began to ease in 1963 , but not all problems were solved in calling for recognition of these children , kouchner said that not all of these children wanted dual nationality .
but he said that most wanted a " symbolic gesture . " the french minister said he would like historians , archivists , lawyers , philosophers and others from both countries to work together examine what shape this could take . " i am far from waking up the ghosts of the past , " he said , but " no person in france or germany should have to hide his origins on the grounds that they lie on the other side of the rhine .

" i am particularly encouraged by our open and frank exchanges on tibet , " said barroso after meeting with wen .
" i hope to see positive developments soon .
i have reiterated the eu position on this matter . "
barroso , leading a large eu delegation to the chinese capital amid tension over china 's rule in tibet and the beijing olympics , said he reassured wen that europe considered the himalayan region as part of chinese territory .
he said europe supported china 's territorial integrity and unity " and that naturally applies to tibet . "
however , he did urge china to reverse its current policy and grant free access for foreign journalists and foreign visitors to tibet .
barroso traveled to beijing with nine european union commissioners to address a range of topics from climate protection , trade and market issues to energy cooperation .
the talks have been overshadowed by protests against chinese authorities in tibet and a security crackdown there .
china 's response to the unrest and criticism of its rights record has sparked noisy protests that have disrupted the olympic torch 's round-the-world relay ahead of the august games , infuriating chinese authorities .
the government 's harsh reaction has prompted calls in europe for a boycott of the games ' opening ceremony .
rejects calls for olympic boycott bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe has debated a boycott but barroso has rejected the idea barroso deflected calls for a boycott of at least the opening ceremony of the games .
" the olympics must be a celebration of the youth of the world and it must be a success .
that is why i 'm against the boycott . "
for the olympics to " be a success " they must take place " in a peaceful atmosphere , " he said , adding that it was necessary that " human rights are comprehensively respected . "
eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner reiterated the eu 's call for chinese leaders to engage in a constructive dialog with the representatives of tibet 's spiritual leader the dalai lama to seek a stable and long-term solution in tibet .
it was later reported by the official state news agency xinhua that the chinese government would begin talks with representatives of the dalai lama within days .
the meeting was spurred by " requests repeatedly made by the dalai side for resuming talks , " an official was quoted by xinhua .
ground rules for dialog bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama and his fellow tibetans want dialog china 's policy regarding tibet has not changed , said the official , who added that he hoped through dialog that " the dalai side will take credible moves to stop activities aimed at splitting china . "
they must also " stop plotting and inciting violence " and " disrupting and sabotaging the beijing olympic games , " in order to create conditions conducive to talks , said the official as quoted by xinhua .
meanwhile , dalai lama spokesman tenzin takhla welcomed the offer , saying it was a " positive step in the right direction . "
" all i can say is that we have received no official communication about this .
however his holiness is committed to resolving the tibet issue and the only way to resolve the tibet issue is by meeting the chinese representatives face-to-face and addressing the grievances of tibetans , " he said .
" therefore , if talks take place it would be a positive step in the right direction , " takhla said over the phone from india 's northern hill town of dharamsala where the dalai lama and the tibetan government-in-exile is based .
ferrero-waldner was skeptical whether direct talks with the dalai lama would take place .
" we are not that far yet , " she said , adding that she was encouraged and that there was " a very open atmosphere here , and that is already a certain breakthrough . "

since then , relations between the two powers have been strained over the situation in tibet and the protests around the olympics .
china 's state media acknowledged shortly after barroso 's arrival that the china-eu relationship had " soured " over tibet .
" the main purpose is to mend the fissure that has occurred in the sino-eu relationship , " shen jiru , a researcher at the chinese academy of social sciences , told xinhua .

"
the united states welcomed the decision , saying it was " pleased " and germany and japan also heralded the new sign of movement toward easing tensions in tibet .
" it 's a major step .
the resumption of dialog carries some real hope , " sarkozy said in a statement , one day after declaring that he had been " shocked " by events in tibet where there has been a crackdown on anti-china protests .
" france was heavily mobilized to help bring about the conditions for a resumption of dialog between the chinese authorities and the dalai lama , " the president told reporters during a visit to monaco .
sarkozy 's diplomatic advisor , jean-david levitte , was in china friday for talks with top chinese officials , aimed at easing tensions over tibet and the beijing olympics .
the french president had previously indicated that he might stay away from the august 8 olympic games opening ceremony in beijing unless china opened talks with the dalai lama over the recent unrest .
" china and the representatives of the dalai lama are showing their desire to move towards a permanent solution that would allow tibetans to feel they can live out their cultural and spiritual identity within the people 's republic of china , " sarkozy said in the statement .
asked whether he would attend the ceremony , sarkozy replied : " i will make a decision based on how the dialog evolves . "
us , germany herald potential breakthrough in washington , the white house celebrated china 's announcement that it would hold talks with a " private representative " of the dalai lama .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush is one of those who have entertained the dalai lama " we are pleased to hear this , " us national security council spokesman gordon johndroe said , adding that president george w. bush applauded the efforts of both sides to find a solution and commended those involved in restarting the dialog .
" we welcome the news that the chinese authorities will engage with the dalai lama 's representatives . "
germany lauded the breakthrough and was also quick to highlight the importance of china 's move .
" we emphatically welcome this step , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jaeger told a news conference .
" we hope very much that this can contribute to resolving the conflict in tibet . "
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier had telephoned his chinese counterpart yang jiechi three times in recent weeks about the issue and pressed for talks , jaeger added .
praise also came friday from roland koch , the premier of the state of hesse , one of germany 's most prominent backers of the dalai lama .
he described the move as " an important and hopeful sign . "
" it shows that what is said by way of world public opinion is taken seriously by the chinese government , " he said .
michael vesper , director general of the german olympic sports association dosb , said , " this is exactly the right way to deal with this problem . "
a first important step bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso was encouraged by his talks on tibet in china european commission president jose manuel barroso , who is in beijing , said : " we are of course very happy with this announcement . "
his words were echoed by the slovenian eu presidency which issued a statement which acclaimed the chinese announcement .
in tokyo , japan 's foreign minister masahiko komura complimented china and tibet on the breakthrough and said the talks could be crucial first step to resolving the tension .
french activist robert menard , who has played a key role in worldwide protests on the beijing olympic torch relay over china 's action in tibet and its rights record , also said dialog was an important move in the right direction .
menard , founder of reporters without borders , plans to demonstrate at the relay saturday in the japanese mountain town of nagano but said he preferred dialog to demonstrations .
discussions could end olympic protests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests may end depending on the outcome of talks " bravo , " said menard of china 's decision .
" no one 's going to interfere in china 's internal affairs .
if we finally get to that point and there 's dialog , i 'd be very pleased , " he told reporters in tokyo .
" if tomorrow there are serious decisions , we 'll stop .
we do n't want to demonstrate just for the sake of demonstrating . "
menard and two others disrupted the flame-lighting ceremony in greece by unfurling a protest banner , setting the stage for demonstrations throughout the torch relay .
china has come under intense foreign pressure to hold talks with the dalai lama since rioting erupted in the regional capital lhasa last month , spreading to other areas populated by tibetans .
beijing 's crackdown in the himalayan region , as well as its human rights record , have triggered protests that have dogged the olympic torch as it travels the world before the games in august .
exiled tibetan leaders say the chinese crackdown last month left more than 150 people dead .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de olympics -pipe- 25.04.2008 olympic sponsors between a rock and a hard place großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : torn between the west and china , olympic sponsors , like adidas , are having a tough time the beijing olympics sponsors need to find ways to prevent international outrage over the situation in tibet from morphing into a backlash against them .
dw-world.de spoke to one of their advisors about what can be done . international outrage has been simmering since the chinese crackdown on protests in tibet in march , in which an unknown number of people were jailed or even killed .
in the meantime , there have been calls for a boycott of the games , politicians and athletes have said they would not take part in the opening ceremonies , and the city of paris this week named the dalai lama an honorary citizen . china has responded with anger and many chinese have started to boycott french companies .
hundreds of anti-china demonstrators took to the streets in europe last week to protest against china 's approach to tibet , as thousands of chinese marched in counter-demonstrations in berlin , london and paris .
the controversy is unlikely to die down until well after the beijing olympics , which run from august 8-24 , are over .
it 's a tough time for olympic sponsors , such as coca-cola , volkswagen or adidas . dw-world discussed their difficulties with thorsten hofmann , the ceo of prsg , a berlin-based consultancy for political and crisis management .
the company recently acquired an olympic sponsor as a client . dw-world.de : an old adage says " all publicity is good publicity . "
at what point does the damage make it not worthwhile for a sponsor ? thorsten hofmann : starting with " all publicity is good publicity : " that 's a dangerous statement , because when you 're in a crisis situation , you have the greatest amount of attention a firm could ever want , but unfortunately not in the context you would want it , and that , of course , is the most important thing .
if you want publicity , you generally want it in a nice , harmonious context with a positive image transfer .
in our concrete example , the olympic games , everyone who positioned themselves as sponsors - and invested somewhere between 50 and 100 million euros -lrb- $ 80 to $ 160 million -rrb- - wants to take the olympics ' positive image and create a brand transfer .
adidas as a sports brand wants to participate , vw wants to profit from the dynamics of the games , and above all , everything should be nice and harmonious .
and now for the big dilemma : if the olympics do n't go off as they could , but rather if - as is now the case - there 's a disregard for human rights , violent attacks , attacks on the torch bearers and disturbances of a political nature , then naturally this image transfer also rubs off on the sponsors .
it 's no longer so nice and smooth , and at some point as a sponsor you will be asked what your own position is .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights activists have been vocal in their criticism of china that is , what was originally planned - we participate in a collective sports competition , the olympics , and appear prominently as a main sponsor - can turn into the opposite .
for when a state in which the olympic games take place , like china , presents itself to the world as riding roughshod over human rights - that 's the outside perception - then the world asks itself , " what do the sponsors think of this ?
do human rights not matter to them ?
do they put the value of money above human rights ? "
that 's the negative side of the image transfer . a similar case is that of t-mobile and others companies sponsoring cycling in germany . it is definitely similar .
the cycling sponsors have always profited from the sporting image and the high spectator numbers of , for example , the tour de france .
now , because of all the doping cases , cycling has become dirty , and this dirtiness at some point rubs off on a brand .
accordingly , ever more sponsors are pulling out .
there are cases in the context of sporting events which are absolutely negative for the sponsors ' image , for the sponsors ' brands , and we , as sponsors , have to decide : " what do i do ? " .
with cycling , sponsors tried at the beginning of the doping crisis to introduce responsibility into the equation , to say i 'll create my own guidelines , anyone who takes drugs will be kicked out , i want to fight for clean cycling .
but at some point it became clear that the fight was futile , and sponsors said the recurring negative news is affecting my brand negatively , and at some point i pull out .
that 's what happened . with the olympics , at what point should sponsors pull out ?
when has it gone too far ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been protests in china against french companies that 's a super hard question , because you have to see it in the context of a giant market .
china is the market of the future - i think we all agree on that - and that 's why they all have put their energies and their sponsoring budgets into the olympics .
in addition , you have to take into account that china has an entirely different culture from our western culture .
that means , if i start to talk at the chinese about their culture and to publicly question the things they do , they lose face .
losing face is an affront in china , and you can be sure that as a consequence your company will have a big problem gaining a foothold there . but on the other hand , if you carry on with sponsoring and incidents occur at the olympics - from violent attacks on demonstrators to deaths - then the companies from outside must be prepared for the rest of the world to ask : " how far does the so-called kowtow to the communist dictatorship go ? "
for the companies , the question also arises : " how important are human rights to me and how important is money ? "
that 's the predicament the companies currently find themselves in .
they are caught between a rock and a hard place . but getting back to the question .
when should they pull out ?
it becomes very , very critical when there are deaths .
if there is suddenly fighting , or in the worst case - as has happened before in china - there 's shooting , demonstrators are killed with the world watching , then the company has to carefully consider , " how are my opportunities in this market , what should i do now , and how do my other markets judge my behavior ? "
it 's always an individual decision , that has to be made according to the situation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the torch relay went undisturbed in india ; protesters could n't get near it if i decide i 'm interested in a sponsoring contract - and am prepared to spend 50 to 100 million euros or more - why do n't i put some thought into a prevention plan ?
that is , i know china , and i 'm familiar with all of its sources of conflict , i 'm also familiar with the conflict situation with tibet , the issues of human rights , poverty , child labor and so on .
why have i not yet given some thought to how i could react to accusations of this nature ?
the classic tool is crisis prevention work , and it could have had an effect here .
and i think , actually , i know that that is the current situation the companies face .
they are literally surprised by a matter of course . one would assume they would have prepared for such an eventuality ? exactly , you 're absolutely right .
if i 'm prepared to become a sponsor , to spruce up my brand , then i also have to develop my protective shield so my brand is n't damaged .
and this shield is preventive work , crisis prevention .
at the moment i have the impression that everyone is surprised by what is happening .
that something could have happened , must have been clear to everyone .
because china functions differently than western societies , it 's just not understood by the rest of the world . do you have sporting events sponsors or olympic sponsors as clients ? yes on both counts .
the latter we got relatively recently , which is why i can reconstruct things well .
it 's the case that most of the sponsors have n't given any thought to these things . what can your company do for them ?
how can you protect them ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese students rallied this week to express their pride in their country of course , to start with we were surprised that there was no concept and in many areas no thought had gone into things .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de olympics -pipe- 25.04.2008 olympic sponsors between a rock and a hard place großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : torn between the west and china , olympic sponsors , like adidas , are having a tough time the beijing olympics sponsors need to find ways to prevent international outrage over the situation in tibet from morphing into a backlash against them .
dw-world.de spoke to one of their advisors about what can be done . international outrage has been simmering since the chinese crackdown on protests in tibet in march , in which an unknown number of people were jailed or even killed .
in the meantime , there have been calls for a boycott of the games , politicians and athletes have said they would not take part in the opening ceremonies , and the city of paris this week named the dalai lama an honorary citizen . china has responded with anger and many chinese have started to boycott french companies .
hundreds of anti-china demonstrators took to the streets in europe last week to protest against china 's approach to tibet , as thousands of chinese marched in counter-demonstrations in berlin , london and paris .
the controversy is unlikely to die down until well after the beijing olympics , which run from august 8-24 , are over .
it 's a tough time for olympic sponsors , such as coca-cola , volkswagen or adidas . dw-world discussed their difficulties with thorsten hofmann , the ceo of prsg , a berlin-based consultancy for political and crisis management .
the company recently acquired an olympic sponsor as a client . dw-world.de : an old adage says " all publicity is good publicity . "
at what point does the damage make it not worthwhile for a sponsor ? thorsten hofmann : starting with " all publicity is good publicity : " that 's a dangerous statement , because when you 're in a crisis situation , you have the greatest amount of attention a firm could ever want , but unfortunately not in the context you would want it , and that , of course , is the most important thing .
if you want publicity , you generally want it in a nice , harmonious context with a positive image transfer .
in our concrete example , the olympic games , everyone who positioned themselves as sponsors - and invested somewhere between 50 and 100 million euros -lrb- $ 80 to $ 160 million -rrb- - wants to take the olympics ' positive image and create a brand transfer .
adidas as a sports brand wants to participate , vw wants to profit from the dynamics of the games , and above all , everything should be nice and harmonious .
and now for the big dilemma : if the olympics do n't go off as they could , but rather if - as is now the case - there 's a disregard for human rights , violent attacks , attacks on the torch bearers and disturbances of a political nature , then naturally this image transfer also rubs off on the sponsors .
it 's no longer so nice and smooth , and at some point as a sponsor you will be asked what your own position is .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights activists have been vocal in their criticism of china that is , what was originally planned - we participate in a collective sports competition , the olympics , and appear prominently as a main sponsor - can turn into the opposite .
for when a state in which the olympic games take place , like china , presents itself to the world as riding roughshod over human rights - that 's the outside perception - then the world asks itself , " what do the sponsors think of this ?
do human rights not matter to them ?
do they put the value of money above human rights ? "
that 's the negative side of the image transfer . a similar case is that of t-mobile and others companies sponsoring cycling in germany . it is definitely similar .
the cycling sponsors have always profited from the sporting image and the high spectator numbers of , for example , the tour de france .
now , because of all the doping cases , cycling has become dirty , and this dirtiness at some point rubs off on a brand .
accordingly , ever more sponsors are pulling out .
there are cases in the context of sporting events which are absolutely negative for the sponsors ' image , for the sponsors ' brands , and we , as sponsors , have to decide : " what do i do ? " .
with cycling , sponsors tried at the beginning of the doping crisis to introduce responsibility into the equation , to say i 'll create my own guidelines , anyone who takes drugs will be kicked out , i want to fight for clean cycling .
but at some point it became clear that the fight was futile , and sponsors said the recurring negative news is affecting my brand negatively , and at some point i pull out .
that 's what happened . with the olympics , at what point should sponsors pull out ?
when has it gone too far ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been protests in china against french companies that 's a super hard question , because you have to see it in the context of a giant market .
china is the market of the future - i think we all agree on that - and that 's why they all have put their energies and their sponsoring budgets into the olympics .
in addition , you have to take into account that china has an entirely different culture from our western culture .
that means , if i start to talk at the chinese about their culture and to publicly question the things they do , they lose face .
losing face is an affront in china , and you can be sure that as a consequence your company will have a big problem gaining a foothold there . but on the other hand , if you carry on with sponsoring and incidents occur at the olympics - from violent attacks on demonstrators to deaths - then the companies from outside must be prepared for the rest of the world to ask : " how far does the so-called kowtow to the communist dictatorship go ? "
for the companies , the question also arises : " how important are human rights to me and how important is money ? "
that 's the predicament the companies currently find themselves in .
they are caught between a rock and a hard place . but getting back to the question .
when should they pull out ?
it becomes very , very critical when there are deaths .
if there is suddenly fighting , or in the worst case - as has happened before in china - there 's shooting , demonstrators are killed with the world watching , then the company has to carefully consider , " how are my opportunities in this market , what should i do now , and how do my other markets judge my behavior ? "
it 's always an individual decision , that has to be made according to the situation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the torch relay went undisturbed in india ; protesters could n't get near it if i decide i 'm interested in a sponsoring contract - and am prepared to spend 50 to 100 million euros or more - why do n't i put some thought into a prevention plan ?
that is , i know china , and i 'm familiar with all of its sources of conflict , i 'm also familiar with the conflict situation with tibet , the issues of human rights , poverty , child labor and so on .
why have i not yet given some thought to how i could react to accusations of this nature ?
the classic tool is crisis prevention work , and it could have had an effect here .
and i think , actually , i know that that is the current situation the companies face .
they are literally surprised by a matter of course . one would assume they would have prepared for such an eventuality ? exactly , you 're absolutely right .
if i 'm prepared to become a sponsor , to spruce up my brand , then i also have to develop my protective shield so my brand is n't damaged .
and this shield is preventive work , crisis prevention .
at the moment i have the impression that everyone is surprised by what is happening .
that something could have happened , must have been clear to everyone .
because china functions differently than western societies , it 's just not understood by the rest of the world . do you have sporting events sponsors or olympic sponsors as clients ? yes on both counts .
the latter we got relatively recently , which is why i can reconstruct things well .
it 's the case that most of the sponsors have n't given any thought to these things . what can your company do for them ?
how can you protect them ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese students rallied this week to express their pride in their country of course , to start with we were surprised that there was no concept and in many areas no thought had gone into things .

"
the united states welcomed the decision , saying it was " pleased " and germany and japan also heralded the new sign of movement toward easing tensions in tibet .
" it 's a major step .
the resumption of dialog carries some real hope , " sarkozy said in a statement , one day after declaring that he had been " shocked " by events in tibet where there has been a crackdown on anti-china protests .
" france was heavily mobilized to help bring about the conditions for a resumption of dialog between the chinese authorities and the dalai lama , " the president told reporters during a visit to monaco .
sarkozy 's diplomatic advisor , jean-david levitte , was in china friday for talks with top chinese officials , aimed at easing tensions over tibet and the beijing olympics .
the french president had previously indicated that he might stay away from the august 8 olympic games opening ceremony in beijing unless china opened talks with the dalai lama over the recent unrest .
" china and the representatives of the dalai lama are showing their desire to move towards a permanent solution that would allow tibetans to feel they can live out their cultural and spiritual identity within the people 's republic of china , " sarkozy said in the statement .
asked whether he would attend the ceremony , sarkozy replied : " i will make a decision based on how the dialog evolves . "
us , germany herald potential breakthrough in washington , the white house celebrated china 's announcement that it would hold talks with a " private representative " of the dalai lama .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush is one of those who have entertained the dalai lama " we are pleased to hear this , " us national security council spokesman gordon johndroe said , adding that president george w. bush applauded the efforts of both sides to find a solution and commended those involved in restarting the dialog .
" we welcome the news that the chinese authorities will engage with the dalai lama 's representatives . "
germany lauded the breakthrough and was also quick to highlight the importance of china 's move .
" we emphatically welcome this step , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jaeger told a news conference .
" we hope very much that this can contribute to resolving the conflict in tibet . "
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier had telephoned his chinese counterpart yang jiechi three times in recent weeks about the issue and pressed for talks , jaeger added .
praise also came friday from roland koch , the premier of the state of hesse , one of germany 's most prominent backers of the dalai lama .
he described the move as " an important and hopeful sign . "
" it shows that what is said by way of world public opinion is taken seriously by the chinese government , " he said .
michael vesper , director general of the german olympic sports association dosb , said , " this is exactly the right way to deal with this problem . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de olympics -pipe- 25.04.2008 olympic sponsors between a rock and a hard place großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : torn between the west and china , olympic sponsors , like adidas , are having a tough time the beijing olympics sponsors need to find ways to prevent international outrage over the situation in tibet from morphing into a backlash against them .
dw-world.de spoke to one of their advisors about what can be done . international outrage has been simmering since the chinese crackdown on protests in tibet in march , in which an unknown number of people were jailed or even killed .
in the meantime , there have been calls for a boycott of the games , politicians and athletes have said they would not take part in the opening ceremonies , and the city of paris this week named the dalai lama an honorary citizen . china has responded with anger and many chinese have started to boycott french companies .
hundreds of anti-china demonstrators took to the streets in europe last week to protest against china 's approach to tibet , as thousands of chinese marched in counter-demonstrations in berlin , london and paris .
the controversy is unlikely to die down until well after the beijing olympics , which run from august 8-24 , are over .
it 's a tough time for olympic sponsors , such as coca-cola , volkswagen or adidas . dw-world discussed their difficulties with thorsten hofmann , the ceo of prsg , a berlin-based consultancy for political and crisis management .
the company recently acquired an olympic sponsor as a client . dw-world.de : an old adage says " all publicity is good publicity . "
at what point does the damage make it not worthwhile for a sponsor ? thorsten hofmann : starting with " all publicity is good publicity : " that 's a dangerous statement , because when you 're in a crisis situation , you have the greatest amount of attention a firm could ever want , but unfortunately not in the context you would want it , and that , of course , is the most important thing .
if you want publicity , you generally want it in a nice , harmonious context with a positive image transfer .
in our concrete example , the olympic games , everyone who positioned themselves as sponsors - and invested somewhere between 50 and 100 million euros -lrb- $ 80 to $ 160 million -rrb- - wants to take the olympics ' positive image and create a brand transfer .
adidas as a sports brand wants to participate , vw wants to profit from the dynamics of the games , and above all , everything should be nice and harmonious .
and now for the big dilemma : if the olympics do n't go off as they could , but rather if - as is now the case - there 's a disregard for human rights , violent attacks , attacks on the torch bearers and disturbances of a political nature , then naturally this image transfer also rubs off on the sponsors .
it 's no longer so nice and smooth , and at some point as a sponsor you will be asked what your own position is .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights activists have been vocal in their criticism of china that is , what was originally planned - we participate in a collective sports competition , the olympics , and appear prominently as a main sponsor - can turn into the opposite .
for when a state in which the olympic games take place , like china , presents itself to the world as riding roughshod over human rights - that 's the outside perception - then the world asks itself , " what do the sponsors think of this ?
do human rights not matter to them ?
do they put the value of money above human rights ? "
that 's the negative side of the image transfer . a similar case is that of t-mobile and others companies sponsoring cycling in germany . it is definitely similar .
the cycling sponsors have always profited from the sporting image and the high spectator numbers of , for example , the tour de france .
now , because of all the doping cases , cycling has become dirty , and this dirtiness at some point rubs off on a brand .
accordingly , ever more sponsors are pulling out .
there are cases in the context of sporting events which are absolutely negative for the sponsors ' image , for the sponsors ' brands , and we , as sponsors , have to decide : " what do i do ? " .
with cycling , sponsors tried at the beginning of the doping crisis to introduce responsibility into the equation , to say i 'll create my own guidelines , anyone who takes drugs will be kicked out , i want to fight for clean cycling .
but at some point it became clear that the fight was futile , and sponsors said the recurring negative news is affecting my brand negatively , and at some point i pull out .
that 's what happened . with the olympics , at what point should sponsors pull out ?
when has it gone too far ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been protests in china against french companies that 's a super hard question , because you have to see it in the context of a giant market .
china is the market of the future - i think we all agree on that - and that 's why they all have put their energies and their sponsoring budgets into the olympics .
in addition , you have to take into account that china has an entirely different culture from our western culture .
that means , if i start to talk at the chinese about their culture and to publicly question the things they do , they lose face .
losing face is an affront in china , and you can be sure that as a consequence your company will have a big problem gaining a foothold there . but on the other hand , if you carry on with sponsoring and incidents occur at the olympics - from violent attacks on demonstrators to deaths - then the companies from outside must be prepared for the rest of the world to ask : " how far does the so-called kowtow to the communist dictatorship go ? "
for the companies , the question also arises : " how important are human rights to me and how important is money ? "
that 's the predicament the companies currently find themselves in .
they are caught between a rock and a hard place . but getting back to the question .
when should they pull out ?
it becomes very , very critical when there are deaths .
if there is suddenly fighting , or in the worst case - as has happened before in china - there 's shooting , demonstrators are killed with the world watching , then the company has to carefully consider , " how are my opportunities in this market , what should i do now , and how do my other markets judge my behavior ? "
it 's always an individual decision , that has to be made according to the situation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the torch relay went undisturbed in india ; protesters could n't get near it if i decide i 'm interested in a sponsoring contract - and am prepared to spend 50 to 100 million euros or more - why do n't i put some thought into a prevention plan ?
that is , i know china , and i 'm familiar with all of its sources of conflict , i 'm also familiar with the conflict situation with tibet , the issues of human rights , poverty , child labor and so on .
why have i not yet given some thought to how i could react to accusations of this nature ?
the classic tool is crisis prevention work , and it could have had an effect here .
and i think , actually , i know that that is the current situation the companies face .
they are literally surprised by a matter of course . one would assume they would have prepared for such an eventuality ? exactly , you 're absolutely right .
if i 'm prepared to become a sponsor , to spruce up my brand , then i also have to develop my protective shield so my brand is n't damaged .
and this shield is preventive work , crisis prevention .
at the moment i have the impression that everyone is surprised by what is happening .
that something could have happened , must have been clear to everyone .
because china functions differently than western societies , it 's just not understood by the rest of the world . do you have sporting events sponsors or olympic sponsors as clients ? yes on both counts .
the latter we got relatively recently , which is why i can reconstruct things well .
it 's the case that most of the sponsors have n't given any thought to these things . what can your company do for them ?
how can you protect them ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese students rallied this week to express their pride in their country of course , to start with we were surprised that there was no concept and in many areas no thought had gone into things .
what we 're now doing is thinking about how you can show that sponsoring does n't just mean money to develop a brand , as is assumed , but also to try to participate in shaping societal change .
in concrete terms that means developing one 's own projects that are cross-nation , that take place with china , in which sensitive issues , like human rights , exposure to publicity , etc . , are addressed and in which the added value for a country like china is apparent .
the chinese do n't see any added value in developing an internet that is not controlled , why they should allow press freedom , why they should be transparent or why , for example , they could allow demonstrations as an articulation of free expression . what do you do if there are calls for boycotts of sponsors ? we have to determine what messages we want to send for the different situations that could arise .
say our sports clothes or our cars are n't being bought anymore .
here the company has to take a stand , and formulating the message is very difficult .
they remain between a rock and a hard place , which means that every word hangs in the balance .
every word is a tightrope walk .
on the one hand , they have to consider to what extent do i want to damage my future business in china , and on the other hand , i want to clarify my position to the rest of the world .
and that is very difficult . interview : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de olympics -pipe- 25.04.2008 olympic sponsors between a rock and a hard place großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : torn between the west and china , olympic sponsors , like adidas , are having a tough time the beijing olympics sponsors need to find ways to prevent international outrage over the situation in tibet from morphing into a backlash against them .
dw-world.de spoke to one of their advisors about what can be done . international outrage has been simmering since the chinese crackdown on protests in tibet in march , in which an unknown number of people were jailed or even killed .
in the meantime , there have been calls for a boycott of the games , politicians and athletes have said they would not take part in the opening ceremonies , and the city of paris this week named the dalai lama an honorary citizen . china has responded with anger and many chinese have started to boycott french companies .
hundreds of anti-china demonstrators took to the streets in europe last week to protest against china 's approach to tibet , as thousands of chinese marched in counter-demonstrations in berlin , london and paris .
the controversy is unlikely to die down until well after the beijing olympics , which run from august 8-24 , are over .
it 's a tough time for olympic sponsors , such as coca-cola , volkswagen or adidas . dw-world discussed their difficulties with thorsten hofmann , the ceo of prsg , a berlin-based consultancy for political and crisis management .
the company recently acquired an olympic sponsor as a client . dw-world.de : an old adage says " all publicity is good publicity . "
at what point does the damage make it not worthwhile for a sponsor ? thorsten hofmann : starting with " all publicity is good publicity : " that 's a dangerous statement , because when you 're in a crisis situation , you have the greatest amount of attention a firm could ever want , but unfortunately not in the context you would want it , and that , of course , is the most important thing .
if you want publicity , you generally want it in a nice , harmonious context with a positive image transfer .
in our concrete example , the olympic games , everyone who positioned themselves as sponsors - and invested somewhere between 50 and 100 million euros -lrb- $ 80 to $ 160 million -rrb- - wants to take the olympics ' positive image and create a brand transfer .
adidas as a sports brand wants to participate , vw wants to profit from the dynamics of the games , and above all , everything should be nice and harmonious .
and now for the big dilemma : if the olympics do n't go off as they could , but rather if - as is now the case - there 's a disregard for human rights , violent attacks , attacks on the torch bearers and disturbances of a political nature , then naturally this image transfer also rubs off on the sponsors .
it 's no longer so nice and smooth , and at some point as a sponsor you will be asked what your own position is .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights activists have been vocal in their criticism of china that is , what was originally planned - we participate in a collective sports competition , the olympics , and appear prominently as a main sponsor - can turn into the opposite .
for when a state in which the olympic games take place , like china , presents itself to the world as riding roughshod over human rights - that 's the outside perception - then the world asks itself , " what do the sponsors think of this ?
do human rights not matter to them ?
do they put the value of money above human rights ? "
that 's the negative side of the image transfer . a similar case is that of t-mobile and others companies sponsoring cycling in germany . it is definitely similar .
the cycling sponsors have always profited from the sporting image and the high spectator numbers of , for example , the tour de france .
now , because of all the doping cases , cycling has become dirty , and this dirtiness at some point rubs off on a brand .
accordingly , ever more sponsors are pulling out .
there are cases in the context of sporting events which are absolutely negative for the sponsors ' image , for the sponsors ' brands , and we , as sponsors , have to decide : " what do i do ? " .
with cycling , sponsors tried at the beginning of the doping crisis to introduce responsibility into the equation , to say i 'll create my own guidelines , anyone who takes drugs will be kicked out , i want to fight for clean cycling .
but at some point it became clear that the fight was futile , and sponsors said the recurring negative news is affecting my brand negatively , and at some point i pull out .
that 's what happened . with the olympics , at what point should sponsors pull out ?
when has it gone too far ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been protests in china against french companies that 's a super hard question , because you have to see it in the context of a giant market .
china is the market of the future - i think we all agree on that - and that 's why they all have put their energies and their sponsoring budgets into the olympics .
in addition , you have to take into account that china has an entirely different culture from our western culture .
that means , if i start to talk at the chinese about their culture and to publicly question the things they do , they lose face .
losing face is an affront in china , and you can be sure that as a consequence your company will have a big problem gaining a foothold there . but on the other hand , if you carry on with sponsoring and incidents occur at the olympics - from violent attacks on demonstrators to deaths - then the companies from outside must be prepared for the rest of the world to ask : " how far does the so-called kowtow to the communist dictatorship go ? "
for the companies , the question also arises : " how important are human rights to me and how important is money ? "
that 's the predicament the companies currently find themselves in .
they are caught between a rock and a hard place . but getting back to the question .
when should they pull out ?
it becomes very , very critical when there are deaths .
if there is suddenly fighting , or in the worst case - as has happened before in china - there 's shooting , demonstrators are killed with the world watching , then the company has to carefully consider , " how are my opportunities in this market , what should i do now , and how do my other markets judge my behavior ? "
it 's always an individual decision , that has to be made according to the situation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the torch relay went undisturbed in india ; protesters could n't get near it if i decide i 'm interested in a sponsoring contract - and am prepared to spend 50 to 100 million euros or more - why do n't i put some thought into a prevention plan ?
that is , i know china , and i 'm familiar with all of its sources of conflict , i 'm also familiar with the conflict situation with tibet , the issues of human rights , poverty , child labor and so on .
why have i not yet given some thought to how i could react to accusations of this nature ?
the classic tool is crisis prevention work , and it could have had an effect here .
and i think , actually , i know that that is the current situation the companies face .
they are literally surprised by a matter of course . one would assume they would have prepared for such an eventuality ? exactly , you 're absolutely right .
if i 'm prepared to become a sponsor , to spruce up my brand , then i also have to develop my protective shield so my brand is n't damaged .
and this shield is preventive work , crisis prevention .
at the moment i have the impression that everyone is surprised by what is happening .
that something could have happened , must have been clear to everyone .
because china functions differently than western societies , it 's just not understood by the rest of the world . do you have sporting events sponsors or olympic sponsors as clients ? yes on both counts .
the latter we got relatively recently , which is why i can reconstruct things well .
it 's the case that most of the sponsors have n't given any thought to these things . what can your company do for them ?
how can you protect them ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese students rallied this week to express their pride in their country of course , to start with we were surprised that there was no concept and in many areas no thought had gone into things .
what we 're now doing is thinking about how you can show that sponsoring does n't just mean money to develop a brand , as is assumed , but also to try to participate in shaping societal change .
in concrete terms that means developing one 's own projects that are cross-nation , that take place with china , in which sensitive issues , like human rights , exposure to publicity , etc . , are addressed and in which the added value for a country like china is apparent .
the chinese do n't see any added value in developing an internet that is not controlled , why they should allow press freedom , why they should be transparent or why , for example , they could allow demonstrations as an articulation of free expression . what do you do if there are calls for boycotts of sponsors ? we have to determine what messages we want to send for the different situations that could arise .
say our sports clothes or our cars are n't being bought anymore .
here the company has to take a stand , and formulating the message is very difficult .
they remain between a rock and a hard place , which means that every word hangs in the balance .
every word is a tightrope walk .
on the one hand , they have to consider to what extent do i want to damage my future business in china , and on the other hand , i want to clarify my position to the rest of the world .
and that is very difficult . interview : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

when should they pull out ?
it becomes very , very critical when there are deaths .
if there is suddenly fighting , or in the worst case - as has happened before in china - there 's shooting , demonstrators are killed with the world watching , then the company has to carefully consider , " how are my opportunities in this market , what should i do now , and how do my other markets judge my behavior ? "
it 's always an individual decision , that has to be made according to the situation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the torch relay went undisturbed in india ; protesters could n't get near it if i decide i 'm interested in a sponsoring contract - and am prepared to spend 50 to 100 million euros or more - why do n't i put some thought into a prevention plan ?
that is , i know china , and i 'm familiar with all of its sources of conflict , i 'm also familiar with the conflict situation with tibet , the issues of human rights , poverty , child labor and so on .
why have i not yet given some thought to how i could react to accusations of this nature ?
the classic tool is crisis prevention work , and it could have had an effect here .
and i think , actually , i know that that is the current situation the companies face .
they are literally surprised by a matter of course . one would assume they would have prepared for such an eventuality ? exactly , you 're absolutely right .
if i 'm prepared to become a sponsor , to spruce up my brand , then i also have to develop my protective shield so my brand is n't damaged .
and this shield is preventive work , crisis prevention .
at the moment i have the impression that everyone is surprised by what is happening .
that something could have happened , must have been clear to everyone .
because china functions differently than western societies , it 's just not understood by the rest of the world . do you have sporting events sponsors or olympic sponsors as clients ? yes on both counts .
the latter we got relatively recently , which is why i can reconstruct things well .
it 's the case that most of the sponsors have n't given any thought to these things . what can your company do for them ?
how can you protect them ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese students rallied this week to express their pride in their country of course , to start with we were surprised that there was no concept and in many areas no thought had gone into things .
what we 're now doing is thinking about how you can show that sponsoring does n't just mean money to develop a brand , as is assumed , but also to try to participate in shaping societal change .
in concrete terms that means developing one 's own projects that are cross-nation , that take place with china , in which sensitive issues , like human rights , exposure to publicity , etc . , are addressed and in which the added value for a country like china is apparent .
the chinese do n't see any added value in developing an internet that is not controlled , why they should allow press freedom , why they should be transparent or why , for example , they could allow demonstrations as an articulation of free expression . what do you do if there are calls for boycotts of sponsors ? we have to determine what messages we want to send for the different situations that could arise .
say our sports clothes or our cars are n't being bought anymore .
here the company has to take a stand , and formulating the message is very difficult .
they remain between a rock and a hard place , which means that every word hangs in the balance .
every word is a tightrope walk .
on the one hand , they have to consider to what extent do i want to damage my future business in china , and on the other hand , i want to clarify my position to the rest of the world .
and that is very difficult . interview : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

annotated versions of other texts by hitler and other nazi leaders are in print , however . hitler considered himself a writer and composed all his speeches himself , said wehler , adding that it can reasonably be presumed that the nazi leader wrote most of " mein kampf " himself as well . " since he had a terribly ruinous effect on world history , these parts should be kept in a critical edition , " the historian said . copyright expires soon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler wrote his own speeches the copyright for " mein kampf " expires 70 years after hitler 's death , in 2015 .
some , including the board of trustees at the nuremberg documentation center have said that publishing an annotated copy now could help prevent neo-nazis from taking advantage of the lifting of the copyright and misusing the text for propaganda purposes . wehler , however , said he did n't think right-wing radicals would be very interested in the text .
" every skinhead is one too many , but there 's not a very passionate hitler readership in this country , " he said . the annotated edition would mainly be sold to universities , libraries and academic institutions . the documentation center 's board of trustees said it has already taken its request for the publication to bavaria 's prime minister guenter beckstein , since the state 's finance ministry was granted possession of the copyright by the allied forces after world war ii . the munich institute of contemporary history would likely be commissioned to publish the volume , which could take several years to complete . jewish leader in favour of publication a top figure in germany 's jewish community said friday he wants hitler 's book to be republished , but together with an accompanying commentary . " in principle i am in favor of the book being made public with a commentary , " both in normal book form and on the internet , stephan kramer , general secretary of the central council of jews , told deutschlandfunk radio . kramer said the central council of jews was ready to help write the commentary . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i am particularly encouraged by our open and frank exchanges on tibet , " said barroso after meeting with wen .
" i hope to see positive developments soon .
i have reiterated the eu position on this matter . "
barroso , leading a large eu delegation to the chinese capital amid tension over china 's rule in tibet and the beijing olympics , said he reassured wen that europe considered the himalayan region as part of chinese territory .
he said europe supported china 's territorial integrity and unity " and that naturally applies to tibet . "
however , he did urge china to reverse its current policy and grant free access for foreign journalists and foreign visitors to tibet .
barroso traveled to beijing with nine european union commissioners to address a range of topics from climate protection , trade and market issues to energy cooperation .
the talks have been overshadowed by protests against chinese authorities in tibet and a security crackdown there .
china 's response to the unrest and criticism of its rights record has sparked noisy protests that have disrupted the olympic torch 's round-the-world relay ahead of the august games , infuriating chinese authorities .
the government 's harsh reaction has prompted calls in europe for a boycott of the games ' opening ceremony .
rejects calls for olympic boycott bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe has debated a boycott but barroso has rejected the idea barroso deflected calls for a boycott of at least the opening ceremony of the games .
" the olympics must be a celebration of the youth of the world and it must be a success .
that is why i 'm against the boycott . "
for the olympics to " be a success " they must take place " in a peaceful atmosphere , " he said , adding that it was necessary that " human rights are comprehensively respected . "
eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner reiterated the eu 's call for chinese leaders to engage in a constructive dialog with the representatives of tibet 's spiritual leader the dalai lama to seek a stable and long-term solution in tibet .
it was later reported by the official state news agency xinhua that the chinese government would begin talks with representatives of the dalai lama within days .
the meeting was spurred by " requests repeatedly made by the dalai side for resuming talks , " an official was quoted by xinhua .
ground rules for dialog bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama and his fellow tibetans want dialog china 's policy regarding tibet has not changed , said the official , who added that he hoped through dialog that " the dalai side will take credible moves to stop activities aimed at splitting china . "
they must also " stop plotting and inciting violence " and " disrupting and sabotaging the beijing olympic games , " in order to create conditions conducive to talks , said the official as quoted by xinhua .
meanwhile , dalai lama spokesman tenzin takhla welcomed the offer , saying it was a " positive step in the right direction . "
" all i can say is that we have received no official communication about this .
however his holiness is committed to resolving the tibet issue and the only way to resolve the tibet issue is by meeting the chinese representatives face-to-face and addressing the grievances of tibetans , " he said .
" therefore , if talks take place it would be a positive step in the right direction , " takhla said over the phone from india 's northern hill town of dharamsala where the dalai lama and the tibetan government-in-exile is based .
ferrero-waldner was skeptical whether direct talks with the dalai lama would take place .
" we are not that far yet , " she said , adding that she was encouraged and that there was " a very open atmosphere here , and that is already a certain breakthrough . "
sino-european relations on life support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the divide between china dn the eu has grown recently friday 's talks were the first round of a series of high-ranking meetings between china and the european union , which had been agreed upon months ago .
since then , relations between the two powers have been strained over the situation in tibet and the protests around the olympics .
china 's state media acknowledged shortly after barroso 's arrival that the china-eu relationship had " soured " over tibet .
" the main purpose is to mend the fissure that has occurred in the sino-eu relationship , " shen jiru , a researcher at the chinese academy of social sciences , told xinhua .

" i am particularly encouraged by our open and frank exchanges on tibet , " said barroso after meeting with wen .
" i hope to see positive developments soon .
i have reiterated the eu position on this matter . "
barroso , leading a large eu delegation to the chinese capital amid tension over china 's rule in tibet and the beijing olympics , said he reassured wen that europe considered the himalayan region as part of chinese territory .
he said europe supported china 's territorial integrity and unity " and that naturally applies to tibet . "
however , he did urge china to reverse its current policy and grant free access for foreign journalists and foreign visitors to tibet .
barroso traveled to beijing with nine european union commissioners to address a range of topics from climate protection , trade and market issues to energy cooperation .
the talks have been overshadowed by protests against chinese authorities in tibet and a security crackdown there .
china 's response to the unrest and criticism of its rights record has sparked noisy protests that have disrupted the olympic torch 's round-the-world relay ahead of the august games , infuriating chinese authorities .
the government 's harsh reaction has prompted calls in europe for a boycott of the games ' opening ceremony .
rejects calls for olympic boycott bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe has debated a boycott but barroso has rejected the idea barroso deflected calls for a boycott of at least the opening ceremony of the games .
" the olympics must be a celebration of the youth of the world and it must be a success .
that is why i 'm against the boycott . "
for the olympics to " be a success " they must take place " in a peaceful atmosphere , " he said , adding that it was necessary that " human rights are comprehensively respected . "
eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner reiterated the eu 's call for chinese leaders to engage in a constructive dialog with the representatives of tibet 's spiritual leader the dalai lama to seek a stable and long-term solution in tibet .
it was later reported by the official state news agency xinhua that the chinese government would begin talks with representatives of the dalai lama within days .
the meeting was spurred by " requests repeatedly made by the dalai side for resuming talks , " an official was quoted by xinhua .
ground rules for dialog bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama and his fellow tibetans want dialog china 's policy regarding tibet has not changed , said the official , who added that he hoped through dialog that " the dalai side will take credible moves to stop activities aimed at splitting china . "
they must also " stop plotting and inciting violence " and " disrupting and sabotaging the beijing olympic games , " in order to create conditions conducive to talks , said the official as quoted by xinhua .
meanwhile , dalai lama spokesman tenzin takhla welcomed the offer , saying it was a " positive step in the right direction . "
" all i can say is that we have received no official communication about this .
however his holiness is committed to resolving the tibet issue and the only way to resolve the tibet issue is by meeting the chinese representatives face-to-face and addressing the grievances of tibetans , " he said .
" therefore , if talks take place it would be a positive step in the right direction , " takhla said over the phone from india 's northern hill town of dharamsala where the dalai lama and the tibetan government-in-exile is based .
ferrero-waldner was skeptical whether direct talks with the dalai lama would take place .
" we are not that far yet , " she said , adding that she was encouraged and that there was " a very open atmosphere here , and that is already a certain breakthrough . "
sino-european relations on life support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the divide between china dn the eu has grown recently friday 's talks were the first round of a series of high-ranking meetings between china and the european union , which had been agreed upon months ago .
since then , relations between the two powers have been strained over the situation in tibet and the protests around the olympics .
china 's state media acknowledged shortly after barroso 's arrival that the china-eu relationship had " soured " over tibet .
" the main purpose is to mend the fissure that has occurred in the sino-eu relationship , " shen jiru , a researcher at the chinese academy of social sciences , told xinhua .

annotated versions of other texts by hitler and other nazi leaders are in print , however . hitler considered himself a writer and composed all his speeches himself , said wehler , adding that it can reasonably be presumed that the nazi leader wrote most of " mein kampf " himself as well . " since he had a terribly ruinous effect on world history , these parts should be kept in a critical edition , " the historian said . copyright expires soon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler wrote his own speeches the copyright for " mein kampf " expires 70 years after hitler 's death , in 2015 .
some , including the board of trustees at the nuremberg documentation center have said that publishing an annotated copy now could help prevent neo-nazis from taking advantage of the lifting of the copyright and misusing the text for propaganda purposes . wehler , however , said he did n't think right-wing radicals would be very interested in the text .
" every skinhead is one too many , but there 's not a very passionate hitler readership in this country , " he said . the annotated edition would mainly be sold to universities , libraries and academic institutions . the documentation center 's board of trustees said it has already taken its request for the publication to bavaria 's prime minister guenter beckstein , since the state 's finance ministry was granted possession of the copyright by the allied forces after world war ii . the munich institute of contemporary history would likely be commissioned to publish the volume , which could take several years to complete . jewish leader in favour of publication a top figure in germany 's jewish community said friday he wants hitler 's book to be republished , but together with an accompanying commentary . " in principle i am in favor of the book being made public with a commentary , " both in normal book form and on the internet , stephan kramer , general secretary of the central council of jews , told deutschlandfunk radio . kramer said the central council of jews was ready to help write the commentary . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

insiders illuminate the pitfalls of publishers influencing editorial policy . " all the ingredients for a programmed catastrophe were there from day one , " said michael seufert , author of the newly released book " the scandal surrounding the hitler diaries . " seufert was stern 's domestic editor on april 25 , 1983 when the weekly newsmagazine publicized its sensational scoop : 62 volumes of adolf hitler 's journal entries from 1932 to 1945 bound in black imitation leather had been unearthed . the fanfare over the stern exclusive was , however , short-lived .
two weeks later , the diaries were exposed as complete forgeries .
it had turned out that stern 's source in obtaining the alleged diaries was a con artist and petty thief named konrad kujau , who made a small fortune in fabricating and selling old nazi memorabilia . kujau found a taker for his forgeries in stern reporter gerd heidemann , and that 's where the disaster began , according to seufert .

" we editors were completely kept out of the loop , so all the normal checks and balances to authenticate stories were brushed aside , " said seufert , who confirmed that the publishing house had paid out 9.34 million dm -lrb- worth more than $ 4 million at the time -rrb- altogether to heidemann and kujau .
both had served over four years of prison time each on fraud charges , while stern 's two top editors had resigned . since most of the key players in the whole saga , including kujau , are either dead now or refuse to discuss the scandal publicly , corroborating seufert 's version of the events is difficult . however magnus linklater , who had been features editor of the sunday times of london , which had serial rights to publish extracts of the diaries in english , shared seufert 's frustrations at the time .

"
the united states welcomed the decision , saying it was " pleased " and germany and japan also heralded the new sign of movement toward easing tensions in tibet .
" it 's a major step .
the resumption of dialog carries some real hope , " sarkozy said in a statement , one day after declaring that he had been " shocked " by events in tibet where there has been a crackdown on anti-china protests .
" france was heavily mobilized to help bring about the conditions for a resumption of dialog between the chinese authorities and the dalai lama , " the president told reporters during a visit to monaco .
sarkozy 's diplomatic advisor , jean-david levitte , was in china friday for talks with top chinese officials , aimed at easing tensions over tibet and the beijing olympics .
the french president had previously indicated that he might stay away from the august 8 olympic games opening ceremony in beijing unless china opened talks with the dalai lama over the recent unrest .
" china and the representatives of the dalai lama are showing their desire to move towards a permanent solution that would allow tibetans to feel they can live out their cultural and spiritual identity within the people 's republic of china , " sarkozy said in the statement .
asked whether he would attend the ceremony , sarkozy replied : " i will make a decision based on how the dialog evolves . "
us , germany herald potential breakthrough in washington , the white house celebrated china 's announcement that it would hold talks with a " private representative " of the dalai lama .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush is one of those who have entertained the dalai lama " we are pleased to hear this , " us national security council spokesman gordon johndroe said , adding that president george w. bush applauded the efforts of both sides to find a solution and commended those involved in restarting the dialog .
" we welcome the news that the chinese authorities will engage with the dalai lama 's representatives . "
germany lauded the breakthrough and was also quick to highlight the importance of china 's move .
" we emphatically welcome this step , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jaeger told a news conference .
" we hope very much that this can contribute to resolving the conflict in tibet . "
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier had telephoned his chinese counterpart yang jiechi three times in recent weeks about the issue and pressed for talks , jaeger added .
praise also came friday from roland koch , the premier of the state of hesse , one of germany 's most prominent backers of the dalai lama .
he described the move as " an important and hopeful sign . "
" it shows that what is said by way of world public opinion is taken seriously by the chinese government , " he said .

"
the united states welcomed the decision , saying it was " pleased " and germany and japan also heralded the new sign of movement toward easing tensions in tibet .
" it 's a major step .
the resumption of dialog carries some real hope , " sarkozy said in a statement , one day after declaring that he had been " shocked " by events in tibet where there has been a crackdown on anti-china protests .
" france was heavily mobilized to help bring about the conditions for a resumption of dialog between the chinese authorities and the dalai lama , " the president told reporters during a visit to monaco .
sarkozy 's diplomatic advisor , jean-david levitte , was in china friday for talks with top chinese officials , aimed at easing tensions over tibet and the beijing olympics .
the french president had previously indicated that he might stay away from the august 8 olympic games opening ceremony in beijing unless china opened talks with the dalai lama over the recent unrest .
" china and the representatives of the dalai lama are showing their desire to move towards a permanent solution that would allow tibetans to feel they can live out their cultural and spiritual identity within the people 's republic of china , " sarkozy said in the statement .
asked whether he would attend the ceremony , sarkozy replied : " i will make a decision based on how the dialog evolves . "

germany lauded the breakthrough and was also quick to highlight the importance of china 's move .
" we emphatically welcome this step , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jaeger told a news conference .
" we hope very much that this can contribute to resolving the conflict in tibet . "
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier had telephoned his chinese counterpart yang jiechi three times in recent weeks about the issue and pressed for talks , jaeger added .
praise also came friday from roland koch , the premier of the state of hesse , one of germany 's most prominent backers of the dalai lama .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de olympics -pipe- 25.04.2008 olympic sponsors between a rock and a hard place großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : torn between the west and china , olympic sponsors , like adidas , are having a tough time the beijing olympics sponsors need to find ways to prevent international outrage over the situation in tibet from morphing into a backlash against them .
dw-world.de spoke to one of their advisors about what can be done . international outrage has been simmering since the chinese crackdown on protests in tibet in march , in which an unknown number of people were jailed or even killed .
in the meantime , there have been calls for a boycott of the games , politicians and athletes have said they would not take part in the opening ceremonies , and the city of paris this week named the dalai lama an honorary citizen . china has responded with anger and many chinese have started to boycott french companies .
hundreds of anti-china demonstrators took to the streets in europe last week to protest against china 's approach to tibet , as thousands of chinese marched in counter-demonstrations in berlin , london and paris .
the controversy is unlikely to die down until well after the beijing olympics , which run from august 8-24 , are over .
it 's a tough time for olympic sponsors , such as coca-cola , volkswagen or adidas . dw-world discussed their difficulties with thorsten hofmann , the ceo of prsg , a berlin-based consultancy for political and crisis management .
the company recently acquired an olympic sponsor as a client . dw-world.de : an old adage says " all publicity is good publicity . "
at what point does the damage make it not worthwhile for a sponsor ? thorsten hofmann : starting with " all publicity is good publicity : " that 's a dangerous statement , because when you 're in a crisis situation , you have the greatest amount of attention a firm could ever want , but unfortunately not in the context you would want it , and that , of course , is the most important thing .
if you want publicity , you generally want it in a nice , harmonious context with a positive image transfer .
in our concrete example , the olympic games , everyone who positioned themselves as sponsors - and invested somewhere between 50 and 100 million euros -lrb- $ 80 to $ 160 million -rrb- - wants to take the olympics ' positive image and create a brand transfer .
adidas as a sports brand wants to participate , vw wants to profit from the dynamics of the games , and above all , everything should be nice and harmonious .
and now for the big dilemma : if the olympics do n't go off as they could , but rather if - as is now the case - there 's a disregard for human rights , violent attacks , attacks on the torch bearers and disturbances of a political nature , then naturally this image transfer also rubs off on the sponsors .
it 's no longer so nice and smooth , and at some point as a sponsor you will be asked what your own position is .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights activists have been vocal in their criticism of china that is , what was originally planned - we participate in a collective sports competition , the olympics , and appear prominently as a main sponsor - can turn into the opposite .
for when a state in which the olympic games take place , like china , presents itself to the world as riding roughshod over human rights - that 's the outside perception - then the world asks itself , " what do the sponsors think of this ?
do human rights not matter to them ?
do they put the value of money above human rights ? "
that 's the negative side of the image transfer . a similar case is that of t-mobile and others companies sponsoring cycling in germany . it is definitely similar .
the cycling sponsors have always profited from the sporting image and the high spectator numbers of , for example , the tour de france .
now , because of all the doping cases , cycling has become dirty , and this dirtiness at some point rubs off on a brand .
accordingly , ever more sponsors are pulling out .
there are cases in the context of sporting events which are absolutely negative for the sponsors ' image , for the sponsors ' brands , and we , as sponsors , have to decide : " what do i do ? " .
with cycling , sponsors tried at the beginning of the doping crisis to introduce responsibility into the equation , to say i 'll create my own guidelines , anyone who takes drugs will be kicked out , i want to fight for clean cycling .
but at some point it became clear that the fight was futile , and sponsors said the recurring negative news is affecting my brand negatively , and at some point i pull out .
that 's what happened . with the olympics , at what point should sponsors pull out ?
when has it gone too far ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been protests in china against french companies that 's a super hard question , because you have to see it in the context of a giant market .
china is the market of the future - i think we all agree on that - and that 's why they all have put their energies and their sponsoring budgets into the olympics .
in addition , you have to take into account that china has an entirely different culture from our western culture .
that means , if i start to talk at the chinese about their culture and to publicly question the things they do , they lose face .
losing face is an affront in china , and you can be sure that as a consequence your company will have a big problem gaining a foothold there . but on the other hand , if you carry on with sponsoring and incidents occur at the olympics - from violent attacks on demonstrators to deaths - then the companies from outside must be prepared for the rest of the world to ask : " how far does the so-called kowtow to the communist dictatorship go ? "
for the companies , the question also arises : " how important are human rights to me and how important is money ? "
that 's the predicament the companies currently find themselves in .
they are caught between a rock and a hard place . but getting back to the question .
when should they pull out ?
it becomes very , very critical when there are deaths .
if there is suddenly fighting , or in the worst case - as has happened before in china - there 's shooting , demonstrators are killed with the world watching , then the company has to carefully consider , " how are my opportunities in this market , what should i do now , and how do my other markets judge my behavior ? "
it 's always an individual decision , that has to be made according to the situation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the torch relay went undisturbed in india ; protesters could n't get near it if i decide i 'm interested in a sponsoring contract - and am prepared to spend 50 to 100 million euros or more - why do n't i put some thought into a prevention plan ?
that is , i know china , and i 'm familiar with all of its sources of conflict , i 'm also familiar with the conflict situation with tibet , the issues of human rights , poverty , child labor and so on .
why have i not yet given some thought to how i could react to accusations of this nature ?
the classic tool is crisis prevention work , and it could have had an effect here .
and i think , actually , i know that that is the current situation the companies face .
they are literally surprised by a matter of course . one would assume they would have prepared for such an eventuality ? exactly , you 're absolutely right .
if i 'm prepared to become a sponsor , to spruce up my brand , then i also have to develop my protective shield so my brand is n't damaged .
and this shield is preventive work , crisis prevention .
at the moment i have the impression that everyone is surprised by what is happening .
that something could have happened , must have been clear to everyone .
because china functions differently than western societies , it 's just not understood by the rest of the world . do you have sporting events sponsors or olympic sponsors as clients ? yes on both counts .
the latter we got relatively recently , which is why i can reconstruct things well .
it 's the case that most of the sponsors have n't given any thought to these things . what can your company do for them ?
how can you protect them ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese students rallied this week to express their pride in their country of course , to start with we were surprised that there was no concept and in many areas no thought had gone into things .
what we 're now doing is thinking about how you can show that sponsoring does n't just mean money to develop a brand , as is assumed , but also to try to participate in shaping societal change .
in concrete terms that means developing one 's own projects that are cross-nation , that take place with china , in which sensitive issues , like human rights , exposure to publicity , etc . , are addressed and in which the added value for a country like china is apparent .
the chinese do n't see any added value in developing an internet that is not controlled , why they should allow press freedom , why they should be transparent or why , for example , they could allow demonstrations as an articulation of free expression . what do you do if there are calls for boycotts of sponsors ? we have to determine what messages we want to send for the different situations that could arise .
say our sports clothes or our cars are n't being bought anymore .
here the company has to take a stand , and formulating the message is very difficult .
they remain between a rock and a hard place , which means that every word hangs in the balance .
every word is a tightrope walk .
on the one hand , they have to consider to what extent do i want to damage my future business in china , and on the other hand , i want to clarify my position to the rest of the world .
and that is very difficult . interview : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
the united states welcomed the decision , saying it was " pleased " and germany and japan also heralded the new sign of movement toward easing tensions in tibet .
" it 's a major step .
the resumption of dialog carries some real hope , " sarkozy said in a statement , one day after declaring that he had been " shocked " by events in tibet where there has been a crackdown on anti-china protests .
" france was heavily mobilized to help bring about the conditions for a resumption of dialog between the chinese authorities and the dalai lama , " the president told reporters during a visit to monaco .
sarkozy 's diplomatic advisor , jean-david levitte , was in china friday for talks with top chinese officials , aimed at easing tensions over tibet and the beijing olympics .
the french president had previously indicated that he might stay away from the august 8 olympic games opening ceremony in beijing unless china opened talks with the dalai lama over the recent unrest .
" china and the representatives of the dalai lama are showing their desire to move towards a permanent solution that would allow tibetans to feel they can live out their cultural and spiritual identity within the people 's republic of china , " sarkozy said in the statement .
asked whether he would attend the ceremony , sarkozy replied : " i will make a decision based on how the dialog evolves . "
us , germany herald potential breakthrough in washington , the white house celebrated china 's announcement that it would hold talks with a " private representative " of the dalai lama .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush is one of those who have entertained the dalai lama " we are pleased to hear this , " us national security council spokesman gordon johndroe said , adding that president george w. bush applauded the efforts of both sides to find a solution and commended those involved in restarting the dialog .
" we welcome the news that the chinese authorities will engage with the dalai lama 's representatives . "
germany lauded the breakthrough and was also quick to highlight the importance of china 's move .
" we emphatically welcome this step , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jaeger told a news conference .
" we hope very much that this can contribute to resolving the conflict in tibet . "
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier had telephoned his chinese counterpart yang jiechi three times in recent weeks about the issue and pressed for talks , jaeger added .
praise also came friday from roland koch , the premier of the state of hesse , one of germany 's most prominent backers of the dalai lama .
he described the move as " an important and hopeful sign . "
" it shows that what is said by way of world public opinion is taken seriously by the chinese government , " he said .
michael vesper , director general of the german olympic sports association dosb , said , " this is exactly the right way to deal with this problem . "
a first important step bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso was encouraged by his talks on tibet in china european commission president jose manuel barroso , who is in beijing , said : " we are of course very happy with this announcement . "
his words were echoed by the slovenian eu presidency which issued a statement which acclaimed the chinese announcement .
in tokyo , japan 's foreign minister masahiko komura complimented china and tibet on the breakthrough and said the talks could be crucial first step to resolving the tension .
french activist robert menard , who has played a key role in worldwide protests on the beijing olympic torch relay over china 's action in tibet and its rights record , also said dialog was an important move in the right direction .
menard , founder of reporters without borders , plans to demonstrate at the relay saturday in the japanese mountain town of nagano but said he preferred dialog to demonstrations .
discussions could end olympic protests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests may end depending on the outcome of talks " bravo , " said menard of china 's decision .
" no one 's going to interfere in china 's internal affairs .
if we finally get to that point and there 's dialog , i 'd be very pleased , " he told reporters in tokyo .
" if tomorrow there are serious decisions , we 'll stop .
we do n't want to demonstrate just for the sake of demonstrating . "
menard and two others disrupted the flame-lighting ceremony in greece by unfurling a protest banner , setting the stage for demonstrations throughout the torch relay .
china has come under intense foreign pressure to hold talks with the dalai lama since rioting erupted in the regional capital lhasa last month , spreading to other areas populated by tibetans .
beijing 's crackdown in the himalayan region , as well as its human rights record , have triggered protests that have dogged the olympic torch as it travels the world before the games in august .
exiled tibetan leaders say the chinese crackdown last month left more than 150 people dead .
beijing insists it acted with restraint , killing no one , and blames tibetan " rioters " for the deaths of 20 people . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
the united states welcomed the decision , saying it was " pleased " and germany and japan also heralded the new sign of movement toward easing tensions in tibet .
" it 's a major step .
the resumption of dialog carries some real hope , " sarkozy said in a statement , one day after declaring that he had been " shocked " by events in tibet where there has been a crackdown on anti-china protests .
" france was heavily mobilized to help bring about the conditions for a resumption of dialog between the chinese authorities and the dalai lama , " the president told reporters during a visit to monaco .
sarkozy 's diplomatic advisor , jean-david levitte , was in china friday for talks with top chinese officials , aimed at easing tensions over tibet and the beijing olympics .
the french president had previously indicated that he might stay away from the august 8 olympic games opening ceremony in beijing unless china opened talks with the dalai lama over the recent unrest .
" china and the representatives of the dalai lama are showing their desire to move towards a permanent solution that would allow tibetans to feel they can live out their cultural and spiritual identity within the people 's republic of china , " sarkozy said in the statement .
asked whether he would attend the ceremony , sarkozy replied : " i will make a decision based on how the dialog evolves . "
us , germany herald potential breakthrough in washington , the white house celebrated china 's announcement that it would hold talks with a " private representative " of the dalai lama .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush is one of those who have entertained the dalai lama " we are pleased to hear this , " us national security council spokesman gordon johndroe said , adding that president george w. bush applauded the efforts of both sides to find a solution and commended those involved in restarting the dialog .
" we welcome the news that the chinese authorities will engage with the dalai lama 's representatives . "
germany lauded the breakthrough and was also quick to highlight the importance of china 's move .
" we emphatically welcome this step , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jaeger told a news conference .
" we hope very much that this can contribute to resolving the conflict in tibet . "
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier had telephoned his chinese counterpart yang jiechi three times in recent weeks about the issue and pressed for talks , jaeger added .
praise also came friday from roland koch , the premier of the state of hesse , one of germany 's most prominent backers of the dalai lama .
he described the move as " an important and hopeful sign . "
" it shows that what is said by way of world public opinion is taken seriously by the chinese government , " he said .
michael vesper , director general of the german olympic sports association dosb , said , " this is exactly the right way to deal with this problem . "
a first important step bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso was encouraged by his talks on tibet in china european commission president jose manuel barroso , who is in beijing , said : " we are of course very happy with this announcement . "
his words were echoed by the slovenian eu presidency which issued a statement which acclaimed the chinese announcement .
in tokyo , japan 's foreign minister masahiko komura complimented china and tibet on the breakthrough and said the talks could be crucial first step to resolving the tension .
french activist robert menard , who has played a key role in worldwide protests on the beijing olympic torch relay over china 's action in tibet and its rights record , also said dialog was an important move in the right direction .
menard , founder of reporters without borders , plans to demonstrate at the relay saturday in the japanese mountain town of nagano but said he preferred dialog to demonstrations .
discussions could end olympic protests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests may end depending on the outcome of talks " bravo , " said menard of china 's decision .
" no one 's going to interfere in china 's internal affairs .
if we finally get to that point and there 's dialog , i 'd be very pleased , " he told reporters in tokyo .
" if tomorrow there are serious decisions , we 'll stop .
we do n't want to demonstrate just for the sake of demonstrating . "
menard and two others disrupted the flame-lighting ceremony in greece by unfurling a protest banner , setting the stage for demonstrations throughout the torch relay .
china has come under intense foreign pressure to hold talks with the dalai lama since rioting erupted in the regional capital lhasa last month , spreading to other areas populated by tibetans .
beijing 's crackdown in the himalayan region , as well as its human rights record , have triggered protests that have dogged the olympic torch as it travels the world before the games in august .
exiled tibetan leaders say the chinese crackdown last month left more than 150 people dead .
beijing insists it acted with restraint , killing no one , and blames tibetan " rioters " for the deaths of 20 people . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i am particularly encouraged by our open and frank exchanges on tibet , " said barroso after meeting with wen .
" i hope to see positive developments soon .
i have reiterated the eu position on this matter . "
barroso , leading a large eu delegation to the chinese capital amid tension over china 's rule in tibet and the beijing olympics , said he reassured wen that europe considered the himalayan region as part of chinese territory .
he said europe supported china 's territorial integrity and unity " and that naturally applies to tibet . "
however , he did urge china to reverse its current policy and grant free access for foreign journalists and foreign visitors to tibet .
barroso traveled to beijing with nine european union commissioners to address a range of topics from climate protection , trade and market issues to energy cooperation .
the talks have been overshadowed by protests against chinese authorities in tibet and a security crackdown there .
china 's response to the unrest and criticism of its rights record has sparked noisy protests that have disrupted the olympic torch 's round-the-world relay ahead of the august games , infuriating chinese authorities .
the government 's harsh reaction has prompted calls in europe for a boycott of the games ' opening ceremony .
rejects calls for olympic boycott bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe has debated a boycott but barroso has rejected the idea barroso deflected calls for a boycott of at least the opening ceremony of the games .
" the olympics must be a celebration of the youth of the world and it must be a success .
that is why i 'm against the boycott . "
for the olympics to " be a success " they must take place " in a peaceful atmosphere , " he said , adding that it was necessary that " human rights are comprehensively respected . "
eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner reiterated the eu 's call for chinese leaders to engage in a constructive dialog with the representatives of tibet 's spiritual leader the dalai lama to seek a stable and long-term solution in tibet .
it was later reported by the official state news agency xinhua that the chinese government would begin talks with representatives of the dalai lama within days .
the meeting was spurred by " requests repeatedly made by the dalai side for resuming talks , " an official was quoted by xinhua .
ground rules for dialog bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama and his fellow tibetans want dialog china 's policy regarding tibet has not changed , said the official , who added that he hoped through dialog that " the dalai side will take credible moves to stop activities aimed at splitting china . "
they must also " stop plotting and inciting violence " and " disrupting and sabotaging the beijing olympic games , " in order to create conditions conducive to talks , said the official as quoted by xinhua .
meanwhile , dalai lama spokesman tenzin takhla welcomed the offer , saying it was a " positive step in the right direction . "
" all i can say is that we have received no official communication about this .
however his holiness is committed to resolving the tibet issue and the only way to resolve the tibet issue is by meeting the chinese representatives face-to-face and addressing the grievances of tibetans , " he said .
" therefore , if talks take place it would be a positive step in the right direction , " takhla said over the phone from india 's northern hill town of dharamsala where the dalai lama and the tibetan government-in-exile is based .
ferrero-waldner was skeptical whether direct talks with the dalai lama would take place .
" we are not that far yet , " she said , adding that she was encouraged and that there was " a very open atmosphere here , and that is already a certain breakthrough . "
sino-european relations on life support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the divide between china dn the eu has grown recently friday 's talks were the first round of a series of high-ranking meetings between china and the european union , which had been agreed upon months ago .
since then , relations between the two powers have been strained over the situation in tibet and the protests around the olympics .
china 's state media acknowledged shortly after barroso 's arrival that the china-eu relationship had " soured " over tibet .
" the main purpose is to mend the fissure that has occurred in the sino-eu relationship , " shen jiru , a researcher at the chinese academy of social sciences , told xinhua .

annotated versions of other texts by hitler and other nazi leaders are in print , however . hitler considered himself a writer and composed all his speeches himself , said wehler , adding that it can reasonably be presumed that the nazi leader wrote most of " mein kampf " himself as well . " since he had a terribly ruinous effect on world history , these parts should be kept in a critical edition , " the historian said . copyright expires soon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler wrote his own speeches the copyright for " mein kampf " expires 70 years after hitler 's death , in 2015 .
some , including the board of trustees at the nuremberg documentation center have said that publishing an annotated copy now could help prevent neo-nazis from taking advantage of the lifting of the copyright and misusing the text for propaganda purposes . wehler , however , said he did n't think right-wing radicals would be very interested in the text .
" every skinhead is one too many , but there 's not a very passionate hitler readership in this country , " he said . the annotated edition would mainly be sold to universities , libraries and academic institutions . the documentation center 's board of trustees said it has already taken its request for the publication to bavaria 's prime minister guenter beckstein , since the state 's finance ministry was granted possession of the copyright by the allied forces after world war ii . the munich institute of contemporary history would likely be commissioned to publish the volume , which could take several years to complete . jewish leader in favour of publication a top figure in germany 's jewish community said friday he wants hitler 's book to be republished , but together with an accompanying commentary . " in principle i am in favor of the book being made public with a commentary , " both in normal book form and on the internet , stephan kramer , general secretary of the central council of jews , told deutschlandfunk radio . kramer said the central council of jews was ready to help write the commentary . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it says it will approach berlin in the next few days . news broke at the weekend that the bnd had read e-mail correspondence between der spiegel reporter susanne koelbl and an afghan politician between june and november 2006 , sparking outrage because of the breach of press freedom .
it only emerged on thursday -lrb- apr .
24 -rrb- that trade and industry minister amin farhang was the actual target of the operation .
no explanation has been given for why he was under scrutiny .
farhang , who lived in germany for a number of years , has told the german newspaper neue osnabruecker zeitung that his life was now at risk because the measure implied that he was co-operating with hostile forces .
" because of this absurd lie that i 'm some kind of double agent , my life and the lives of my family are in great danger , " he said .
" i could be shot on the street tomorrow , " he added .
kabul is " disappointed " about the spying revelations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bnd head faced a second day of questioning by a parliamentary committee kabul has declined to comment directly on the events , but afghan foreign minister rangeen dadfar spanta told the financial times deutschlan d -lrb- ftd -rrb- that his government would bring up the matter with berlin in the next few days .
the ftd reported that government sources spoke of " disappointment " about what had happened and the fact that neither the government or the bnd had been in contact with the targeted minister to apologize over the affair , or explain why the surveillance had been carried out in the first place .
but the foreign ministry in berlin said on friday -lrb- apr .
25 -rrb- that relations with kabul remained " close . "
spokesman martin jaeger said kabul had not made any official request for an explanation , nor had the german ambassador to kabul been summoned to discuss the issue .
on thursday , the chancellor 's office ordered disciplinary measures to be taken against three intelligence service members , including the chief-of-staff of bnd head , ernst uhrlau , as well as the head of the department responsible for the spying operation .
uhrlau , who faced a second of questioning thursday by a parliamentary oversight committee -lrb- pkg -rrb- , had faced calls for his resignation over the spy scandal .
but the pkg has stopped short of demanding he step down .
bnd chief 's head does not roll bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uhrlau apologized to journalist koelbl , but apparently not to the afghan minister the committee condemned the fact that uhrlau had not informed the government or parliamentarians about the monitoring of the der spiegel journalist , but that this activity did not mean that he should quit .
" the trust between the parliamentary committee and the leadership of the bnd is damaged , " committee chairman thomas oppermann -lrb- spd -rrb- said in a statement .
opposition members of parliament said the issue was not so much uhrlau 's position , but concern that the intelligence services were running out of control as a result of concerns on international terrorism .
max stadler , of the free democrats , said the bnd was in danger of becoming a " state within a state " .
as well as the diplomatic ramifications of this affair , the activities clearly breach germany 's basic law on press freedom .
german news weekly der spiegel announced on thursday that it was considering legal action .
" in view of this renewed serious breach of press freedom , der spiegel has decided to look at the legal and constitutional implications of this case , " it said .
the chairman of the association of german journalists -lrb- djv -rrb- , michael konken , accused the intelligence services of " developing a james bond mentality . " two years ago , the bnd admitted spying on journalists to discover their sources - but apologized calling it a one-off .
this week , another journalist who had worked in afghanistan said he was told that he was being bugged by a senior diplomat . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
the united states welcomed the decision , saying it was " pleased " and germany and japan also heralded the new sign of movement toward easing tensions in tibet .
" it 's a major step .
the resumption of dialog carries some real hope , " sarkozy said in a statement , one day after declaring that he had been " shocked " by events in tibet where there has been a crackdown on anti-china protests .
" france was heavily mobilized to help bring about the conditions for a resumption of dialog between the chinese authorities and the dalai lama , " the president told reporters during a visit to monaco .
sarkozy 's diplomatic advisor , jean-david levitte , was in china friday for talks with top chinese officials , aimed at easing tensions over tibet and the beijing olympics .
the french president had previously indicated that he might stay away from the august 8 olympic games opening ceremony in beijing unless china opened talks with the dalai lama over the recent unrest .
" china and the representatives of the dalai lama are showing their desire to move towards a permanent solution that would allow tibetans to feel they can live out their cultural and spiritual identity within the people 's republic of china , " sarkozy said in the statement .
asked whether he would attend the ceremony , sarkozy replied : " i will make a decision based on how the dialog evolves . "
us , germany herald potential breakthrough in washington , the white house celebrated china 's announcement that it would hold talks with a " private representative " of the dalai lama .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush is one of those who have entertained the dalai lama " we are pleased to hear this , " us national security council spokesman gordon johndroe said , adding that president george w. bush applauded the efforts of both sides to find a solution and commended those involved in restarting the dialog .
" we welcome the news that the chinese authorities will engage with the dalai lama 's representatives . "
germany lauded the breakthrough and was also quick to highlight the importance of china 's move .
" we emphatically welcome this step , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jaeger told a news conference .
" we hope very much that this can contribute to resolving the conflict in tibet . "
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier had telephoned his chinese counterpart yang jiechi three times in recent weeks about the issue and pressed for talks , jaeger added .
praise also came friday from roland koch , the premier of the state of hesse , one of germany 's most prominent backers of the dalai lama .
he described the move as " an important and hopeful sign . "
" it shows that what is said by way of world public opinion is taken seriously by the chinese government , " he said .
michael vesper , director general of the german olympic sports association dosb , said , " this is exactly the right way to deal with this problem . "
a first important step bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso was encouraged by his talks on tibet in china european commission president jose manuel barroso , who is in beijing , said : " we are of course very happy with this announcement . "
his words were echoed by the slovenian eu presidency which issued a statement which acclaimed the chinese announcement .
in tokyo , japan 's foreign minister masahiko komura complimented china and tibet on the breakthrough and said the talks could be crucial first step to resolving the tension .
french activist robert menard , who has played a key role in worldwide protests on the beijing olympic torch relay over china 's action in tibet and its rights record , also said dialog was an important move in the right direction .
menard , founder of reporters without borders , plans to demonstrate at the relay saturday in the japanese mountain town of nagano but said he preferred dialog to demonstrations .
discussions could end olympic protests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests may end depending on the outcome of talks " bravo , " said menard of china 's decision .
" no one 's going to interfere in china 's internal affairs .
if we finally get to that point and there 's dialog , i 'd be very pleased , " he told reporters in tokyo .
" if tomorrow there are serious decisions , we 'll stop .
we do n't want to demonstrate just for the sake of demonstrating . "
menard and two others disrupted the flame-lighting ceremony in greece by unfurling a protest banner , setting the stage for demonstrations throughout the torch relay .
china has come under intense foreign pressure to hold talks with the dalai lama since rioting erupted in the regional capital lhasa last month , spreading to other areas populated by tibetans .
beijing 's crackdown in the himalayan region , as well as its human rights record , have triggered protests that have dogged the olympic torch as it travels the world before the games in august .
exiled tibetan leaders say the chinese crackdown last month left more than 150 people dead .
beijing insists it acted with restraint , killing no one , and blames tibetan " rioters " for the deaths of 20 people . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it says it will approach berlin in the next few days . news broke at the weekend that the bnd had read e-mail correspondence between der spiegel reporter susanne koelbl and an afghan politician between june and november 2006 , sparking outrage because of the breach of press freedom .
it only emerged on thursday -lrb- apr .
24 -rrb- that trade and industry minister amin farhang was the actual target of the operation .
no explanation has been given for why he was under scrutiny .
farhang , who lived in germany for a number of years , has told the german newspaper neue osnabruecker zeitung that his life was now at risk because the measure implied that he was co-operating with hostile forces .
" because of this absurd lie that i 'm some kind of double agent , my life and the lives of my family are in great danger , " he said .
" i could be shot on the street tomorrow , " he added .

the ftd reported that government sources spoke of " disappointment " about what had happened and the fact that neither the government or the bnd had been in contact with the targeted minister to apologize over the affair , or explain why the surveillance had been carried out in the first place .

" the trust between the parliamentary committee and the leadership of the bnd is damaged , " committee chairman thomas oppermann -lrb- spd -rrb- said in a statement .
opposition members of parliament said the issue was not so much uhrlau 's position , but concern that the intelligence services were running out of control as a result of concerns on international terrorism .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 25.04.2008 impact of the fake hitler diaries press scandal 25 years later großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad kujau 's forgeries were technically and historically flawed " stern " magazine 's discovery of the hitler diaries a quarter-century ago was a media sensation - and a spectacular hoax .
insiders illuminate the pitfalls of publishers influencing editorial policy . " all the ingredients for a programmed catastrophe were there from day one , " said michael seufert , author of the newly released book " the scandal surrounding the hitler diaries . " seufert was stern 's domestic editor on april 25 , 1983 when the weekly newsmagazine publicized its sensational scoop : 62 volumes of adolf hitler 's journal entries from 1932 to 1945 bound in black imitation leather had been unearthed . the fanfare over the stern exclusive was , however , short-lived .
two weeks later , the diaries were exposed as complete forgeries .
it had turned out that stern 's source in obtaining the alleged diaries was a con artist and petty thief named konrad kujau , who made a small fortune in fabricating and selling old nazi memorabilia . kujau found a taker for his forgeries in stern reporter gerd heidemann , and that 's where the disaster began , according to seufert . " heidemann had such a morbid fascination with nazi collectibles that he even wound up befriending war criminals and was ready to believe in anything , " seufert said . downfall of publisher meddling in editorial matters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stern billed the diaries as the scoop of the century if heidemann 's gullibility were the only issue , the fake hitler diaries would have never seen the light of day .
the downfall was that the top brass at stern 's publisher , gruener + jahr , had also been blind-sided and were so eager for an exclusive scoop that they not only forked over a colossal sum in cash to obtain the diaries , but had even guaranteed that only heidemann and one other editor could review its contents . the project was shrouded in secrecy in order to protect alleged sources in the former east germany dictatorship , according to seufert , who described the collusion of reporter and publisher with a counterfeiter and the cold war as a backdrop , as fatal . " we editors were completely kept out of the loop , so all the normal checks and balances to authenticate stories were brushed aside , " said seufert , who confirmed that the publishing house had paid out 9.34 million dm -lrb- worth more than $ 4 million at the time -rrb- altogether to heidemann and kujau .
both had served over four years of prison time each on fraud charges , while stern 's two top editors had resigned . since most of the key players in the whole saga , including kujau , are either dead now or refuse to discuss the scandal publicly , corroborating seufert 's version of the events is difficult . however magnus linklater , who had been features editor of the sunday times of london , which had serial rights to publish extracts of the diaries in english , shared seufert 's frustrations at the time .
linklater had smelled a rat when he read the material . " it didn ’ t sound right , " he said . purchased sight unseen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : handwriting experts had not been allowed to examine diaries " but the deal was that rupert murdoch , whose company owns the times , bought the diaries from stern , and the condition of purchase was that we were not allowed to conduct our own independent investigation , " linklater added .
" this was a clear case of the editorial and business side of newspapers clashing .
we had to take the pig in a poke so to say . " before publication , linklater did however talk to the eminent hitler historian hugh trevor-roper , who assured him the diaries were genuine . " his word was good enough for me , but it goes to show how gullible we can all be , " linklater said .
" the point is if you are offered a scoop , you can keep it secret , but that does n't mean you ca n't do internal checks . " as it turned out , the hitler documents were so technically flawed that forensic experts were able to easily determine that the paper , ink and glue that held the book bindings together were manufactured with post-war materials .
even hitler 's handwriting had not been subject to analysis . importance of internal checks and controls " you need outside experts to look at the handwriting or paper , so it is understandable that stern , which was so paranoid about secrecy , was afraid of leaks , " said gerhard weinberg , a world war ii historian , whom newsweek had hired as a consultant to examine the authenticity of the diaries .
" but what is unfathomable is why they did no internal checks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stern reporter gerd heidemann was obsessed by nazi collectibles , such as fake diaries weinberg pointed out that the diaries were full of mistakes that would have been recognized had stern allowed experts to examine even typed versions of the diaries . " someone in-house could have then read the diary and would have discovered things that were so preposterous that hitler couldn ’ t have possibly written them , " weinberg said .
" hitler , for instance , would never have gotten the color of his own uniform wrong . " hendrik zoerner , spokesman for the german journalists ' association -lrb- djv -rrb- said stern normally does subject its stories to internal control mechanisms .
the fake hitler diaries were an exceptional case of gross negligence that would never be repeated again by stern or any other media outlet , he said . " but we in the media will be making other kinds of mistakes that are less spectacular than what happened at stern , " zoerner said .
" nowadays journalists are under such time pressure that they spend less time doing sound research and fact-checking , so they wind up slipping up and making smaller mistakes on a daily basis . " zoerner added that mistakes , even big ones are inevitable , but responsible journalists need to own up to them . " stern admitted its mistakes and worked through its crisis in public , " he said .
" by doing so , it restored some credibility to its image . " diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it only emerged on thursday -lrb- apr .
24 -rrb- that trade and industry minister amin farhang was the actual target of the operation .
no explanation has been given for why he was under scrutiny .
farhang , who lived in germany for a number of years , has told the german newspaper neue osnabruecker zeitung that his life was now at risk because the measure implied that he was co-operating with hostile forces .
" because of this absurd lie that i 'm some kind of double agent , my life and the lives of my family are in great danger , " he said .
" i could be shot on the street tomorrow , " he added .
kabul is " disappointed " about the spying revelations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bnd head faced a second day of questioning by a parliamentary committee kabul has declined to comment directly on the events , but afghan foreign minister rangeen dadfar spanta told the financial times deutschlan d -lrb- ftd -rrb- that his government would bring up the matter with berlin in the next few days .
the ftd reported that government sources spoke of " disappointment " about what had happened and the fact that neither the government or the bnd had been in contact with the targeted minister to apologize over the affair , or explain why the surveillance had been carried out in the first place .
but the foreign ministry in berlin said on friday -lrb- apr .
25 -rrb- that relations with kabul remained " close . "
spokesman martin jaeger said kabul had not made any official request for an explanation , nor had the german ambassador to kabul been summoned to discuss the issue .
on thursday , the chancellor 's office ordered disciplinary measures to be taken against three intelligence service members , including the chief-of-staff of bnd head , ernst uhrlau , as well as the head of the department responsible for the spying operation .

" the trust between the parliamentary committee and the leadership of the bnd is damaged , " committee chairman thomas oppermann -lrb- spd -rrb- said in a statement .
opposition members of parliament said the issue was not so much uhrlau 's position , but concern that the intelligence services were running out of control as a result of concerns on international terrorism .
max stadler , of the free democrats , said the bnd was in danger of becoming a " state within a state " .
as well as the diplomatic ramifications of this affair , the activities clearly breach germany 's basic law on press freedom .
german news weekly der spiegel announced on thursday that it was considering legal action .
" in view of this renewed serious breach of press freedom , der spiegel has decided to look at the legal and constitutional implications of this case , " it said .
the chairman of the association of german journalists -lrb- djv -rrb- , michael konken , accused the intelligence services of " developing a james bond mentality . " two years ago , the bnd admitted spying on journalists to discover their sources - but apologized calling it a one-off .

" i am particularly encouraged by our open and frank exchanges on tibet , " said barroso after meeting with wen .
" i hope to see positive developments soon .
i have reiterated the eu position on this matter . "
barroso , leading a large eu delegation to the chinese capital amid tension over china 's rule in tibet and the beijing olympics , said he reassured wen that europe considered the himalayan region as part of chinese territory .
he said europe supported china 's territorial integrity and unity " and that naturally applies to tibet . "
however , he did urge china to reverse its current policy and grant free access for foreign journalists and foreign visitors to tibet .
barroso traveled to beijing with nine european union commissioners to address a range of topics from climate protection , trade and market issues to energy cooperation .
the talks have been overshadowed by protests against chinese authorities in tibet and a security crackdown there .
china 's response to the unrest and criticism of its rights record has sparked noisy protests that have disrupted the olympic torch 's round-the-world relay ahead of the august games , infuriating chinese authorities .

eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner reiterated the eu 's call for chinese leaders to engage in a constructive dialog with the representatives of tibet 's spiritual leader the dalai lama to seek a stable and long-term solution in tibet .

"
they must also " stop plotting and inciting violence " and " disrupting and sabotaging the beijing olympic games , " in order to create conditions conducive to talks , said the official as quoted by xinhua .
meanwhile , dalai lama spokesman tenzin takhla welcomed the offer , saying it was a " positive step in the right direction . "
" all i can say is that we have received no official communication about this .

" therefore , if talks take place it would be a positive step in the right direction , " takhla said over the phone from india 's northern hill town of dharamsala where the dalai lama and the tibetan government-in-exile is based .
ferrero-waldner was skeptical whether direct talks with the dalai lama would take place .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de olympics -pipe- 25.04.2008 olympic sponsors between a rock and a hard place großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : torn between the west and china , olympic sponsors , like adidas , are having a tough time the beijing olympics sponsors need to find ways to prevent international outrage over the situation in tibet from morphing into a backlash against them .
dw-world.de spoke to one of their advisors about what can be done . international outrage has been simmering since the chinese crackdown on protests in tibet in march , in which an unknown number of people were jailed or even killed .
in the meantime , there have been calls for a boycott of the games , politicians and athletes have said they would not take part in the opening ceremonies , and the city of paris this week named the dalai lama an honorary citizen . china has responded with anger and many chinese have started to boycott french companies .
hundreds of anti-china demonstrators took to the streets in europe last week to protest against china 's approach to tibet , as thousands of chinese marched in counter-demonstrations in berlin , london and paris .
the controversy is unlikely to die down until well after the beijing olympics , which run from august 8-24 , are over .
it 's a tough time for olympic sponsors , such as coca-cola , volkswagen or adidas . dw-world discussed their difficulties with thorsten hofmann , the ceo of prsg , a berlin-based consultancy for political and crisis management .
the company recently acquired an olympic sponsor as a client . dw-world.de : an old adage says " all publicity is good publicity . "
at what point does the damage make it not worthwhile for a sponsor ? thorsten hofmann : starting with " all publicity is good publicity : " that 's a dangerous statement , because when you 're in a crisis situation , you have the greatest amount of attention a firm could ever want , but unfortunately not in the context you would want it , and that , of course , is the most important thing .
if you want publicity , you generally want it in a nice , harmonious context with a positive image transfer .
in our concrete example , the olympic games , everyone who positioned themselves as sponsors - and invested somewhere between 50 and 100 million euros -lrb- $ 80 to $ 160 million -rrb- - wants to take the olympics ' positive image and create a brand transfer .
adidas as a sports brand wants to participate , vw wants to profit from the dynamics of the games , and above all , everything should be nice and harmonious .
and now for the big dilemma : if the olympics do n't go off as they could , but rather if - as is now the case - there 's a disregard for human rights , violent attacks , attacks on the torch bearers and disturbances of a political nature , then naturally this image transfer also rubs off on the sponsors .
it 's no longer so nice and smooth , and at some point as a sponsor you will be asked what your own position is .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights activists have been vocal in their criticism of china that is , what was originally planned - we participate in a collective sports competition , the olympics , and appear prominently as a main sponsor - can turn into the opposite .
for when a state in which the olympic games take place , like china , presents itself to the world as riding roughshod over human rights - that 's the outside perception - then the world asks itself , " what do the sponsors think of this ?
do human rights not matter to them ?
do they put the value of money above human rights ? "
that 's the negative side of the image transfer . a similar case is that of t-mobile and others companies sponsoring cycling in germany . it is definitely similar .
the cycling sponsors have always profited from the sporting image and the high spectator numbers of , for example , the tour de france .
now , because of all the doping cases , cycling has become dirty , and this dirtiness at some point rubs off on a brand .
accordingly , ever more sponsors are pulling out .
there are cases in the context of sporting events which are absolutely negative for the sponsors ' image , for the sponsors ' brands , and we , as sponsors , have to decide : " what do i do ? " .
with cycling , sponsors tried at the beginning of the doping crisis to introduce responsibility into the equation , to say i 'll create my own guidelines , anyone who takes drugs will be kicked out , i want to fight for clean cycling .
but at some point it became clear that the fight was futile , and sponsors said the recurring negative news is affecting my brand negatively , and at some point i pull out .
that 's what happened . with the olympics , at what point should sponsors pull out ?
when has it gone too far ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been protests in china against french companies that 's a super hard question , because you have to see it in the context of a giant market .
china is the market of the future - i think we all agree on that - and that 's why they all have put their energies and their sponsoring budgets into the olympics .
in addition , you have to take into account that china has an entirely different culture from our western culture .
that means , if i start to talk at the chinese about their culture and to publicly question the things they do , they lose face .
losing face is an affront in china , and you can be sure that as a consequence your company will have a big problem gaining a foothold there . but on the other hand , if you carry on with sponsoring and incidents occur at the olympics - from violent attacks on demonstrators to deaths - then the companies from outside must be prepared for the rest of the world to ask : " how far does the so-called kowtow to the communist dictatorship go ? "
for the companies , the question also arises : " how important are human rights to me and how important is money ? "
that 's the predicament the companies currently find themselves in .
they are caught between a rock and a hard place . but getting back to the question .
when should they pull out ?
it becomes very , very critical when there are deaths .
if there is suddenly fighting , or in the worst case - as has happened before in china - there 's shooting , demonstrators are killed with the world watching , then the company has to carefully consider , " how are my opportunities in this market , what should i do now , and how do my other markets judge my behavior ? "
it 's always an individual decision , that has to be made according to the situation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the torch relay went undisturbed in india ; protesters could n't get near it if i decide i 'm interested in a sponsoring contract - and am prepared to spend 50 to 100 million euros or more - why do n't i put some thought into a prevention plan ?
that is , i know china , and i 'm familiar with all of its sources of conflict , i 'm also familiar with the conflict situation with tibet , the issues of human rights , poverty , child labor and so on .
why have i not yet given some thought to how i could react to accusations of this nature ?
the classic tool is crisis prevention work , and it could have had an effect here .
and i think , actually , i know that that is the current situation the companies face .
they are literally surprised by a matter of course . one would assume they would have prepared for such an eventuality ? exactly , you 're absolutely right .
if i 'm prepared to become a sponsor , to spruce up my brand , then i also have to develop my protective shield so my brand is n't damaged .
and this shield is preventive work , crisis prevention .
at the moment i have the impression that everyone is surprised by what is happening .
that something could have happened , must have been clear to everyone .
because china functions differently than western societies , it 's just not understood by the rest of the world . do you have sporting events sponsors or olympic sponsors as clients ? yes on both counts .
the latter we got relatively recently , which is why i can reconstruct things well .
it 's the case that most of the sponsors have n't given any thought to these things . what can your company do for them ?
how can you protect them ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese students rallied this week to express their pride in their country of course , to start with we were surprised that there was no concept and in many areas no thought had gone into things .
what we 're now doing is thinking about how you can show that sponsoring does n't just mean money to develop a brand , as is assumed , but also to try to participate in shaping societal change .
in concrete terms that means developing one 's own projects that are cross-nation , that take place with china , in which sensitive issues , like human rights , exposure to publicity , etc . , are addressed and in which the added value for a country like china is apparent .
the chinese do n't see any added value in developing an internet that is not controlled , why they should allow press freedom , why they should be transparent or why , for example , they could allow demonstrations as an articulation of free expression . what do you do if there are calls for boycotts of sponsors ? we have to determine what messages we want to send for the different situations that could arise .
say our sports clothes or our cars are n't being bought anymore .
here the company has to take a stand , and formulating the message is very difficult .
they remain between a rock and a hard place , which means that every word hangs in the balance .
every word is a tightrope walk .
on the one hand , they have to consider to what extent do i want to damage my future business in china , and on the other hand , i want to clarify my position to the rest of the world .
and that is very difficult . interview : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the meantime , there have been calls for a boycott of the games , politicians and athletes have said they would not take part in the opening ceremonies , and the city of paris this week named the dalai lama an honorary citizen . china has responded with anger and many chinese have started to boycott french companies .
hundreds of anti-china demonstrators took to the streets in europe last week to protest against china 's approach to tibet , as thousands of chinese marched in counter-demonstrations in berlin , london and paris .
the controversy is unlikely to die down until well after the beijing olympics , which run from august 8-24 , are over .
it 's a tough time for olympic sponsors , such as coca-cola , volkswagen or adidas . dw-world discussed their difficulties with thorsten hofmann , the ceo of prsg , a berlin-based consultancy for political and crisis management .
the company recently acquired an olympic sponsor as a client . dw-world.de : an old adage says " all publicity is good publicity . "
at what point does the damage make it not worthwhile for a sponsor ? thorsten hofmann : starting with " all publicity is good publicity : " that 's a dangerous statement , because when you 're in a crisis situation , you have the greatest amount of attention a firm could ever want , but unfortunately not in the context you would want it , and that , of course , is the most important thing .
if you want publicity , you generally want it in a nice , harmonious context with a positive image transfer .
in our concrete example , the olympic games , everyone who positioned themselves as sponsors - and invested somewhere between 50 and 100 million euros -lrb- $ 80 to $ 160 million -rrb- - wants to take the olympics ' positive image and create a brand transfer .
adidas as a sports brand wants to participate , vw wants to profit from the dynamics of the games , and above all , everything should be nice and harmonious .
and now for the big dilemma : if the olympics do n't go off as they could , but rather if - as is now the case - there 's a disregard for human rights , violent attacks , attacks on the torch bearers and disturbances of a political nature , then naturally this image transfer also rubs off on the sponsors .
it 's no longer so nice and smooth , and at some point as a sponsor you will be asked what your own position is .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights activists have been vocal in their criticism of china that is , what was originally planned - we participate in a collective sports competition , the olympics , and appear prominently as a main sponsor - can turn into the opposite .
for when a state in which the olympic games take place , like china , presents itself to the world as riding roughshod over human rights - that 's the outside perception - then the world asks itself , " what do the sponsors think of this ?
do human rights not matter to them ?
do they put the value of money above human rights ? "
that 's the negative side of the image transfer . a similar case is that of t-mobile and others companies sponsoring cycling in germany . it is definitely similar .
the cycling sponsors have always profited from the sporting image and the high spectator numbers of , for example , the tour de france .
now , because of all the doping cases , cycling has become dirty , and this dirtiness at some point rubs off on a brand .
accordingly , ever more sponsors are pulling out .
there are cases in the context of sporting events which are absolutely negative for the sponsors ' image , for the sponsors ' brands , and we , as sponsors , have to decide : " what do i do ? " .
with cycling , sponsors tried at the beginning of the doping crisis to introduce responsibility into the equation , to say i 'll create my own guidelines , anyone who takes drugs will be kicked out , i want to fight for clean cycling .
but at some point it became clear that the fight was futile , and sponsors said the recurring negative news is affecting my brand negatively , and at some point i pull out .
that 's what happened . with the olympics , at what point should sponsors pull out ?
when has it gone too far ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been protests in china against french companies that 's a super hard question , because you have to see it in the context of a giant market .
china is the market of the future - i think we all agree on that - and that 's why they all have put their energies and their sponsoring budgets into the olympics .
in addition , you have to take into account that china has an entirely different culture from our western culture .
that means , if i start to talk at the chinese about their culture and to publicly question the things they do , they lose face .
losing face is an affront in china , and you can be sure that as a consequence your company will have a big problem gaining a foothold there . but on the other hand , if you carry on with sponsoring and incidents occur at the olympics - from violent attacks on demonstrators to deaths - then the companies from outside must be prepared for the rest of the world to ask : " how far does the so-called kowtow to the communist dictatorship go ? "
for the companies , the question also arises : " how important are human rights to me and how important is money ? "
that 's the predicament the companies currently find themselves in .
they are caught between a rock and a hard place . but getting back to the question .
when should they pull out ?
it becomes very , very critical when there are deaths .
if there is suddenly fighting , or in the worst case - as has happened before in china - there 's shooting , demonstrators are killed with the world watching , then the company has to carefully consider , " how are my opportunities in this market , what should i do now , and how do my other markets judge my behavior ? "
it 's always an individual decision , that has to be made according to the situation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the torch relay went undisturbed in india ; protesters could n't get near it if i decide i 'm interested in a sponsoring contract - and am prepared to spend 50 to 100 million euros or more - why do n't i put some thought into a prevention plan ?
that is , i know china , and i 'm familiar with all of its sources of conflict , i 'm also familiar with the conflict situation with tibet , the issues of human rights , poverty , child labor and so on .
why have i not yet given some thought to how i could react to accusations of this nature ?
the classic tool is crisis prevention work , and it could have had an effect here .
and i think , actually , i know that that is the current situation the companies face .
they are literally surprised by a matter of course . one would assume they would have prepared for such an eventuality ? exactly , you 're absolutely right .
if i 'm prepared to become a sponsor , to spruce up my brand , then i also have to develop my protective shield so my brand is n't damaged .
and this shield is preventive work , crisis prevention .
at the moment i have the impression that everyone is surprised by what is happening .
that something could have happened , must have been clear to everyone .
because china functions differently than western societies , it 's just not understood by the rest of the world . do you have sporting events sponsors or olympic sponsors as clients ? yes on both counts .
the latter we got relatively recently , which is why i can reconstruct things well .
it 's the case that most of the sponsors have n't given any thought to these things . what can your company do for them ?
how can you protect them ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese students rallied this week to express their pride in their country of course , to start with we were surprised that there was no concept and in many areas no thought had gone into things .
what we 're now doing is thinking about how you can show that sponsoring does n't just mean money to develop a brand , as is assumed , but also to try to participate in shaping societal change .
in concrete terms that means developing one 's own projects that are cross-nation , that take place with china , in which sensitive issues , like human rights , exposure to publicity , etc . , are addressed and in which the added value for a country like china is apparent .
the chinese do n't see any added value in developing an internet that is not controlled , why they should allow press freedom , why they should be transparent or why , for example , they could allow demonstrations as an articulation of free expression . what do you do if there are calls for boycotts of sponsors ? we have to determine what messages we want to send for the different situations that could arise .
say our sports clothes or our cars are n't being bought anymore .
here the company has to take a stand , and formulating the message is very difficult .
they remain between a rock and a hard place , which means that every word hangs in the balance .
every word is a tightrope walk .
on the one hand , they have to consider to what extent do i want to damage my future business in china , and on the other hand , i want to clarify my position to the rest of the world .

what we 're now doing is thinking about how you can show that sponsoring does n't just mean money to develop a brand , as is assumed , but also to try to participate in shaping societal change .
in concrete terms that means developing one 's own projects that are cross-nation , that take place with china , in which sensitive issues , like human rights , exposure to publicity , etc . , are addressed and in which the added value for a country like china is apparent .
the chinese do n't see any added value in developing an internet that is not controlled , why they should allow press freedom , why they should be transparent or why , for example , they could allow demonstrations as an articulation of free expression . what do you do if there are calls for boycotts of sponsors ? we have to determine what messages we want to send for the different situations that could arise .
say our sports clothes or our cars are n't being bought anymore .
here the company has to take a stand , and formulating the message is very difficult .
they remain between a rock and a hard place , which means that every word hangs in the balance .
every word is a tightrope walk .
on the one hand , they have to consider to what extent do i want to damage my future business in china , and on the other hand , i want to clarify my position to the rest of the world .
and that is very difficult . interview : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it says it will approach berlin in the next few days . news broke at the weekend that the bnd had read e-mail correspondence between der spiegel reporter susanne koelbl and an afghan politician between june and november 2006 , sparking outrage because of the breach of press freedom .
it only emerged on thursday -lrb- apr .
24 -rrb- that trade and industry minister amin farhang was the actual target of the operation .
no explanation has been given for why he was under scrutiny .
farhang , who lived in germany for a number of years , has told the german newspaper neue osnabruecker zeitung that his life was now at risk because the measure implied that he was co-operating with hostile forces .
" because of this absurd lie that i 'm some kind of double agent , my life and the lives of my family are in great danger , " he said .
" i could be shot on the street tomorrow , " he added .
kabul is " disappointed " about the spying revelations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bnd head faced a second day of questioning by a parliamentary committee kabul has declined to comment directly on the events , but afghan foreign minister rangeen dadfar spanta told the financial times deutschlan d -lrb- ftd -rrb- that his government would bring up the matter with berlin in the next few days .
the ftd reported that government sources spoke of " disappointment " about what had happened and the fact that neither the government or the bnd had been in contact with the targeted minister to apologize over the affair , or explain why the surveillance had been carried out in the first place .
but the foreign ministry in berlin said on friday -lrb- apr .
25 -rrb- that relations with kabul remained " close . "
spokesman martin jaeger said kabul had not made any official request for an explanation , nor had the german ambassador to kabul been summoned to discuss the issue .
on thursday , the chancellor 's office ordered disciplinary measures to be taken against three intelligence service members , including the chief-of-staff of bnd head , ernst uhrlau , as well as the head of the department responsible for the spying operation .
uhrlau , who faced a second of questioning thursday by a parliamentary oversight committee -lrb- pkg -rrb- , had faced calls for his resignation over the spy scandal .
but the pkg has stopped short of demanding he step down .
bnd chief 's head does not roll bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uhrlau apologized to journalist koelbl , but apparently not to the afghan minister the committee condemned the fact that uhrlau had not informed the government or parliamentarians about the monitoring of the der spiegel journalist , but that this activity did not mean that he should quit .
" the trust between the parliamentary committee and the leadership of the bnd is damaged , " committee chairman thomas oppermann -lrb- spd -rrb- said in a statement .
opposition members of parliament said the issue was not so much uhrlau 's position , but concern that the intelligence services were running out of control as a result of concerns on international terrorism .
max stadler , of the free democrats , said the bnd was in danger of becoming a " state within a state " .
as well as the diplomatic ramifications of this affair , the activities clearly breach germany 's basic law on press freedom .
german news weekly der spiegel announced on thursday that it was considering legal action .
" in view of this renewed serious breach of press freedom , der spiegel has decided to look at the legal and constitutional implications of this case , " it said .
the chairman of the association of german journalists -lrb- djv -rrb- , michael konken , accused the intelligence services of " developing a james bond mentality . " two years ago , the bnd admitted spying on journalists to discover their sources - but apologized calling it a one-off .
this week , another journalist who had worked in afghanistan said he was told that he was being bugged by a senior diplomat . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de china -pipe- 25.04.2008 china , tibet commended by world powers for planned dialog großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is prepared to talk with representatives of the exiled dalai lama world powers on friday praised china 's decision to hold talks with representatives of exiled tibetan spiritual leader , the dalai lama , following the recent unrest in tibet . french president nicolas sarkozy hailed the move as a " major step . "
the united states welcomed the decision , saying it was " pleased " and germany and japan also heralded the new sign of movement toward easing tensions in tibet .
" it 's a major step .
the resumption of dialog carries some real hope , " sarkozy said in a statement , one day after declaring that he had been " shocked " by events in tibet where there has been a crackdown on anti-china protests .
" france was heavily mobilized to help bring about the conditions for a resumption of dialog between the chinese authorities and the dalai lama , " the president told reporters during a visit to monaco .
sarkozy 's diplomatic advisor , jean-david levitte , was in china friday for talks with top chinese officials , aimed at easing tensions over tibet and the beijing olympics .
the french president had previously indicated that he might stay away from the august 8 olympic games opening ceremony in beijing unless china opened talks with the dalai lama over the recent unrest .
" china and the representatives of the dalai lama are showing their desire to move towards a permanent solution that would allow tibetans to feel they can live out their cultural and spiritual identity within the people 's republic of china , " sarkozy said in the statement .
asked whether he would attend the ceremony , sarkozy replied : " i will make a decision based on how the dialog evolves . "
us , germany herald potential breakthrough in washington , the white house celebrated china 's announcement that it would hold talks with a " private representative " of the dalai lama .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush is one of those who have entertained the dalai lama " we are pleased to hear this , " us national security council spokesman gordon johndroe said , adding that president george w. bush applauded the efforts of both sides to find a solution and commended those involved in restarting the dialog .
" we welcome the news that the chinese authorities will engage with the dalai lama 's representatives . "
germany lauded the breakthrough and was also quick to highlight the importance of china 's move .
" we emphatically welcome this step , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jaeger told a news conference .
" we hope very much that this can contribute to resolving the conflict in tibet . "
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier had telephoned his chinese counterpart yang jiechi three times in recent weeks about the issue and pressed for talks , jaeger added .
praise also came friday from roland koch , the premier of the state of hesse , one of germany 's most prominent backers of the dalai lama .
he described the move as " an important and hopeful sign . "
" it shows that what is said by way of world public opinion is taken seriously by the chinese government , " he said .
michael vesper , director general of the german olympic sports association dosb , said , " this is exactly the right way to deal with this problem . "
a first important step bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso was encouraged by his talks on tibet in china european commission president jose manuel barroso , who is in beijing , said : " we are of course very happy with this announcement . "
his words were echoed by the slovenian eu presidency which issued a statement which acclaimed the chinese announcement .
in tokyo , japan 's foreign minister masahiko komura complimented china and tibet on the breakthrough and said the talks could be crucial first step to resolving the tension .
french activist robert menard , who has played a key role in worldwide protests on the beijing olympic torch relay over china 's action in tibet and its rights record , also said dialog was an important move in the right direction .
menard , founder of reporters without borders , plans to demonstrate at the relay saturday in the japanese mountain town of nagano but said he preferred dialog to demonstrations .
discussions could end olympic protests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests may end depending on the outcome of talks " bravo , " said menard of china 's decision .
" no one 's going to interfere in china 's internal affairs .
if we finally get to that point and there 's dialog , i 'd be very pleased , " he told reporters in tokyo .
" if tomorrow there are serious decisions , we 'll stop .
we do n't want to demonstrate just for the sake of demonstrating . "
menard and two others disrupted the flame-lighting ceremony in greece by unfurling a protest banner , setting the stage for demonstrations throughout the torch relay .
china has come under intense foreign pressure to hold talks with the dalai lama since rioting erupted in the regional capital lhasa last month , spreading to other areas populated by tibetans .
beijing 's crackdown in the himalayan region , as well as its human rights record , have triggered protests that have dogged the olympic torch as it travels the world before the games in august .
exiled tibetan leaders say the chinese crackdown last month left more than 150 people dead .
beijing insists it acted with restraint , killing no one , and blames tibetan " rioters " for the deaths of 20 people . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de olympics -pipe- 25.04.2008 olympic sponsors between a rock and a hard place großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : torn between the west and china , olympic sponsors , like adidas , are having a tough time the beijing olympics sponsors need to find ways to prevent international outrage over the situation in tibet from morphing into a backlash against them .
dw-world.de spoke to one of their advisors about what can be done . international outrage has been simmering since the chinese crackdown on protests in tibet in march , in which an unknown number of people were jailed or even killed .
in the meantime , there have been calls for a boycott of the games , politicians and athletes have said they would not take part in the opening ceremonies , and the city of paris this week named the dalai lama an honorary citizen . china has responded with anger and many chinese have started to boycott french companies .
hundreds of anti-china demonstrators took to the streets in europe last week to protest against china 's approach to tibet , as thousands of chinese marched in counter-demonstrations in berlin , london and paris .
the controversy is unlikely to die down until well after the beijing olympics , which run from august 8-24 , are over .
it 's a tough time for olympic sponsors , such as coca-cola , volkswagen or adidas . dw-world discussed their difficulties with thorsten hofmann , the ceo of prsg , a berlin-based consultancy for political and crisis management .
the company recently acquired an olympic sponsor as a client . dw-world.de : an old adage says " all publicity is good publicity . "
at what point does the damage make it not worthwhile for a sponsor ? thorsten hofmann : starting with " all publicity is good publicity : " that 's a dangerous statement , because when you 're in a crisis situation , you have the greatest amount of attention a firm could ever want , but unfortunately not in the context you would want it , and that , of course , is the most important thing .
if you want publicity , you generally want it in a nice , harmonious context with a positive image transfer .
in our concrete example , the olympic games , everyone who positioned themselves as sponsors - and invested somewhere between 50 and 100 million euros -lrb- $ 80 to $ 160 million -rrb- - wants to take the olympics ' positive image and create a brand transfer .
adidas as a sports brand wants to participate , vw wants to profit from the dynamics of the games , and above all , everything should be nice and harmonious .
and now for the big dilemma : if the olympics do n't go off as they could , but rather if - as is now the case - there 's a disregard for human rights , violent attacks , attacks on the torch bearers and disturbances of a political nature , then naturally this image transfer also rubs off on the sponsors .
it 's no longer so nice and smooth , and at some point as a sponsor you will be asked what your own position is .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights activists have been vocal in their criticism of china that is , what was originally planned - we participate in a collective sports competition , the olympics , and appear prominently as a main sponsor - can turn into the opposite .
for when a state in which the olympic games take place , like china , presents itself to the world as riding roughshod over human rights - that 's the outside perception - then the world asks itself , " what do the sponsors think of this ?
do human rights not matter to them ?
do they put the value of money above human rights ? "
that 's the negative side of the image transfer . a similar case is that of t-mobile and others companies sponsoring cycling in germany . it is definitely similar .
the cycling sponsors have always profited from the sporting image and the high spectator numbers of , for example , the tour de france .
now , because of all the doping cases , cycling has become dirty , and this dirtiness at some point rubs off on a brand .
accordingly , ever more sponsors are pulling out .
there are cases in the context of sporting events which are absolutely negative for the sponsors ' image , for the sponsors ' brands , and we , as sponsors , have to decide : " what do i do ? " .
with cycling , sponsors tried at the beginning of the doping crisis to introduce responsibility into the equation , to say i 'll create my own guidelines , anyone who takes drugs will be kicked out , i want to fight for clean cycling .
but at some point it became clear that the fight was futile , and sponsors said the recurring negative news is affecting my brand negatively , and at some point i pull out .
that 's what happened . with the olympics , at what point should sponsors pull out ?
when has it gone too far ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been protests in china against french companies that 's a super hard question , because you have to see it in the context of a giant market .
china is the market of the future - i think we all agree on that - and that 's why they all have put their energies and their sponsoring budgets into the olympics .
in addition , you have to take into account that china has an entirely different culture from our western culture .
that means , if i start to talk at the chinese about their culture and to publicly question the things they do , they lose face .
losing face is an affront in china , and you can be sure that as a consequence your company will have a big problem gaining a foothold there . but on the other hand , if you carry on with sponsoring and incidents occur at the olympics - from violent attacks on demonstrators to deaths - then the companies from outside must be prepared for the rest of the world to ask : " how far does the so-called kowtow to the communist dictatorship go ? "
for the companies , the question also arises : " how important are human rights to me and how important is money ? "
that 's the predicament the companies currently find themselves in .
they are caught between a rock and a hard place . but getting back to the question .
when should they pull out ?
it becomes very , very critical when there are deaths .
if there is suddenly fighting , or in the worst case - as has happened before in china - there 's shooting , demonstrators are killed with the world watching , then the company has to carefully consider , " how are my opportunities in this market , what should i do now , and how do my other markets judge my behavior ? "
it 's always an individual decision , that has to be made according to the situation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the torch relay went undisturbed in india ; protesters could n't get near it if i decide i 'm interested in a sponsoring contract - and am prepared to spend 50 to 100 million euros or more - why do n't i put some thought into a prevention plan ?
that is , i know china , and i 'm familiar with all of its sources of conflict , i 'm also familiar with the conflict situation with tibet , the issues of human rights , poverty , child labor and so on .
why have i not yet given some thought to how i could react to accusations of this nature ?
the classic tool is crisis prevention work , and it could have had an effect here .
and i think , actually , i know that that is the current situation the companies face .
they are literally surprised by a matter of course . one would assume they would have prepared for such an eventuality ? exactly , you 're absolutely right .
if i 'm prepared to become a sponsor , to spruce up my brand , then i also have to develop my protective shield so my brand is n't damaged .
and this shield is preventive work , crisis prevention .
at the moment i have the impression that everyone is surprised by what is happening .
that something could have happened , must have been clear to everyone .
because china functions differently than western societies , it 's just not understood by the rest of the world . do you have sporting events sponsors or olympic sponsors as clients ? yes on both counts .
the latter we got relatively recently , which is why i can reconstruct things well .
it 's the case that most of the sponsors have n't given any thought to these things . what can your company do for them ?
how can you protect them ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese students rallied this week to express their pride in their country of course , to start with we were surprised that there was no concept and in many areas no thought had gone into things .
what we 're now doing is thinking about how you can show that sponsoring does n't just mean money to develop a brand , as is assumed , but also to try to participate in shaping societal change .
in concrete terms that means developing one 's own projects that are cross-nation , that take place with china , in which sensitive issues , like human rights , exposure to publicity , etc . , are addressed and in which the added value for a country like china is apparent .
the chinese do n't see any added value in developing an internet that is not controlled , why they should allow press freedom , why they should be transparent or why , for example , they could allow demonstrations as an articulation of free expression . what do you do if there are calls for boycotts of sponsors ? we have to determine what messages we want to send for the different situations that could arise .
say our sports clothes or our cars are n't being bought anymore .
here the company has to take a stand , and formulating the message is very difficult .
they remain between a rock and a hard place , which means that every word hangs in the balance .
every word is a tightrope walk .
on the one hand , they have to consider to what extent do i want to damage my future business in china , and on the other hand , i want to clarify my position to the rest of the world .
and that is very difficult . interview : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

annotated versions of other texts by hitler and other nazi leaders are in print , however . hitler considered himself a writer and composed all his speeches himself , said wehler , adding that it can reasonably be presumed that the nazi leader wrote most of " mein kampf " himself as well . " since he had a terribly ruinous effect on world history , these parts should be kept in a critical edition , " the historian said . copyright expires soon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler wrote his own speeches the copyright for " mein kampf " expires 70 years after hitler 's death , in 2015 .
some , including the board of trustees at the nuremberg documentation center have said that publishing an annotated copy now could help prevent neo-nazis from taking advantage of the lifting of the copyright and misusing the text for propaganda purposes . wehler , however , said he did n't think right-wing radicals would be very interested in the text .

it says it will approach berlin in the next few days . news broke at the weekend that the bnd had read e-mail correspondence between der spiegel reporter susanne koelbl and an afghan politician between june and november 2006 , sparking outrage because of the breach of press freedom .
it only emerged on thursday -lrb- apr .
24 -rrb- that trade and industry minister amin farhang was the actual target of the operation .
no explanation has been given for why he was under scrutiny .
farhang , who lived in germany for a number of years , has told the german newspaper neue osnabruecker zeitung that his life was now at risk because the measure implied that he was co-operating with hostile forces .
" because of this absurd lie that i 'm some kind of double agent , my life and the lives of my family are in great danger , " he said .
" i could be shot on the street tomorrow , " he added .
kabul is " disappointed " about the spying revelations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bnd head faced a second day of questioning by a parliamentary committee kabul has declined to comment directly on the events , but afghan foreign minister rangeen dadfar spanta told the financial times deutschlan d -lrb- ftd -rrb- that his government would bring up the matter with berlin in the next few days .
the ftd reported that government sources spoke of " disappointment " about what had happened and the fact that neither the government or the bnd had been in contact with the targeted minister to apologize over the affair , or explain why the surveillance had been carried out in the first place .
but the foreign ministry in berlin said on friday -lrb- apr .
25 -rrb- that relations with kabul remained " close . "
spokesman martin jaeger said kabul had not made any official request for an explanation , nor had the german ambassador to kabul been summoned to discuss the issue .
on thursday , the chancellor 's office ordered disciplinary measures to be taken against three intelligence service members , including the chief-of-staff of bnd head , ernst uhrlau , as well as the head of the department responsible for the spying operation .
uhrlau , who faced a second of questioning thursday by a parliamentary oversight committee -lrb- pkg -rrb- , had faced calls for his resignation over the spy scandal .
but the pkg has stopped short of demanding he step down .
bnd chief 's head does not roll bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uhrlau apologized to journalist koelbl , but apparently not to the afghan minister the committee condemned the fact that uhrlau had not informed the government or parliamentarians about the monitoring of the der spiegel journalist , but that this activity did not mean that he should quit .
" the trust between the parliamentary committee and the leadership of the bnd is damaged , " committee chairman thomas oppermann -lrb- spd -rrb- said in a statement .
opposition members of parliament said the issue was not so much uhrlau 's position , but concern that the intelligence services were running out of control as a result of concerns on international terrorism .
max stadler , of the free democrats , said the bnd was in danger of becoming a " state within a state " .
as well as the diplomatic ramifications of this affair , the activities clearly breach germany 's basic law on press freedom .
german news weekly der spiegel announced on thursday that it was considering legal action .
" in view of this renewed serious breach of press freedom , der spiegel has decided to look at the legal and constitutional implications of this case , " it said .
the chairman of the association of german journalists -lrb- djv -rrb- , michael konken , accused the intelligence services of " developing a james bond mentality . " two years ago , the bnd admitted spying on journalists to discover their sources - but apologized calling it a one-off .
this week , another journalist who had worked in afghanistan said he was told that he was being bugged by a senior diplomat . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
the united states welcomed the decision , saying it was " pleased " and germany and japan also heralded the new sign of movement toward easing tensions in tibet .
" it 's a major step .
the resumption of dialog carries some real hope , " sarkozy said in a statement , one day after declaring that he had been " shocked " by events in tibet where there has been a crackdown on anti-china protests .
" france was heavily mobilized to help bring about the conditions for a resumption of dialog between the chinese authorities and the dalai lama , " the president told reporters during a visit to monaco .
sarkozy 's diplomatic advisor , jean-david levitte , was in china friday for talks with top chinese officials , aimed at easing tensions over tibet and the beijing olympics .
the french president had previously indicated that he might stay away from the august 8 olympic games opening ceremony in beijing unless china opened talks with the dalai lama over the recent unrest .
" china and the representatives of the dalai lama are showing their desire to move towards a permanent solution that would allow tibetans to feel they can live out their cultural and spiritual identity within the people 's republic of china , " sarkozy said in the statement .
asked whether he would attend the ceremony , sarkozy replied : " i will make a decision based on how the dialog evolves . "
us , germany herald potential breakthrough in washington , the white house celebrated china 's announcement that it would hold talks with a " private representative " of the dalai lama .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush is one of those who have entertained the dalai lama " we are pleased to hear this , " us national security council spokesman gordon johndroe said , adding that president george w. bush applauded the efforts of both sides to find a solution and commended those involved in restarting the dialog .
" we welcome the news that the chinese authorities will engage with the dalai lama 's representatives . "
germany lauded the breakthrough and was also quick to highlight the importance of china 's move .
" we emphatically welcome this step , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jaeger told a news conference .
" we hope very much that this can contribute to resolving the conflict in tibet . "
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier had telephoned his chinese counterpart yang jiechi three times in recent weeks about the issue and pressed for talks , jaeger added .
praise also came friday from roland koch , the premier of the state of hesse , one of germany 's most prominent backers of the dalai lama .
he described the move as " an important and hopeful sign . "
" it shows that what is said by way of world public opinion is taken seriously by the chinese government , " he said .
michael vesper , director general of the german olympic sports association dosb , said , " this is exactly the right way to deal with this problem . "
a first important step bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso was encouraged by his talks on tibet in china european commission president jose manuel barroso , who is in beijing , said : " we are of course very happy with this announcement . "
his words were echoed by the slovenian eu presidency which issued a statement which acclaimed the chinese announcement .
in tokyo , japan 's foreign minister masahiko komura complimented china and tibet on the breakthrough and said the talks could be crucial first step to resolving the tension .
french activist robert menard , who has played a key role in worldwide protests on the beijing olympic torch relay over china 's action in tibet and its rights record , also said dialog was an important move in the right direction .
menard , founder of reporters without borders , plans to demonstrate at the relay saturday in the japanese mountain town of nagano but said he preferred dialog to demonstrations .
discussions could end olympic protests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests may end depending on the outcome of talks " bravo , " said menard of china 's decision .
" no one 's going to interfere in china 's internal affairs .
if we finally get to that point and there 's dialog , i 'd be very pleased , " he told reporters in tokyo .
" if tomorrow there are serious decisions , we 'll stop .
we do n't want to demonstrate just for the sake of demonstrating . "
menard and two others disrupted the flame-lighting ceremony in greece by unfurling a protest banner , setting the stage for demonstrations throughout the torch relay .
china has come under intense foreign pressure to hold talks with the dalai lama since rioting erupted in the regional capital lhasa last month , spreading to other areas populated by tibetans .
beijing 's crackdown in the himalayan region , as well as its human rights record , have triggered protests that have dogged the olympic torch as it travels the world before the games in august .
exiled tibetan leaders say the chinese crackdown last month left more than 150 people dead .
beijing insists it acted with restraint , killing no one , and blames tibetan " rioters " for the deaths of 20 people . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it 's a major step .
the resumption of dialog carries some real hope , " sarkozy said in a statement , one day after declaring that he had been " shocked " by events in tibet where there has been a crackdown on anti-china protests .
" france was heavily mobilized to help bring about the conditions for a resumption of dialog between the chinese authorities and the dalai lama , " the president told reporters during a visit to monaco .

the french president had previously indicated that he might stay away from the august 8 olympic games opening ceremony in beijing unless china opened talks with the dalai lama over the recent unrest .

he described the move as " an important and hopeful sign . "
" it shows that what is said by way of world public opinion is taken seriously by the chinese government , " he said .

" we hope that our dear son sinan will also be free soon , " al tornachi said in a video message in arabic , which was posted on german public broadcaster zdf 's web site on thursday , april 24 . zdf 's deputy editor-in-chief elmar thevessen said his broadcaster had offered the video to several arab partners , including al jazeera and al arabiya , and that they had shown interest in it . the kidnappers , who reportedly belong to the militant islamist group " the arrows of righteousness brigade , " have threatened to execute krause if germany does not pull its troops out of afghanistan .
some 3,500 german troops are stationed in northern afghanistan , where they are mainly involved in peacekeeping and reconstruction . " the crisis team at the foreign ministry continues to work intensively on finding a solution , " said a spokeswoman thursday , confirming that the ministry knew of the video . hannelore krause immigrated to iraq some 40 years ago .
sinan krause , who married shortly before his abduction , was employed at the iraqi foreign ministry in baghdad . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this is often difficult to prove and , if verified , usually leads to the children being taken away and placed in foster care . according to a new law , approved by the german parliament on thursday , april 24 , courts can get involved earlier , before significant physical or emotional damage has been caused to the child and before the parents lose custody . the tragic deaths of several children in the past few months show that there are considerable deficits in the system , said justice minister brigitte zypries . " we want courts to be able to intervene earlier in the future , " said zypries . courts can order parents to get help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister brigitte zypries to intervene with preventative measures , authorities now have to show that the child 's well-being is endangered and that the parents can not or do not want to improve the situation . the new law allows courts to force parents to take certain steps that promote their child 's well-being : going to counseling , taking their child to the doctor , making their child go to school or attending a non-violence course . the courts should also make clear to the parents that they face consequences , which may include losing their child , if they do n't participate in the preventative programs . in addition , courts are now required to work more quickly when a child 's well-being is a stake , with the first court appointment to take place within one month of the case being filed . recommendations for many of the law 's measures were put together by an expert commission initiated by zypries in 2006 . criticism from child aid group bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new law aims to help troubled parents do a better job - but will it work ?
the german children 's aid group deutsche kinderhilfe called the new law " a drop in the bucket , " saying that there simply were n't enough judges to carry out the newly adopted measures and that most judges were n't trained as social workers . " the law is n't wrong , but the demands it places are completely exaggerated , " the group 's president heinz hilgers said in an interview with television broadcaster n24 . he added that he did n't think " the law would prevent a single case " like that of 5-year-old lea-sophie in schwerin who died of malnutrition in november 2007 after being neglected by her parents for months . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

annotated versions of other texts by hitler and other nazi leaders are in print , however . hitler considered himself a writer and composed all his speeches himself , said wehler , adding that it can reasonably be presumed that the nazi leader wrote most of " mein kampf " himself as well . " since he had a terribly ruinous effect on world history , these parts should be kept in a critical edition , " the historian said . copyright expires soon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler wrote his own speeches the copyright for " mein kampf " expires 70 years after hitler 's death , in 2015 .
some , including the board of trustees at the nuremberg documentation center have said that publishing an annotated copy now could help prevent neo-nazis from taking advantage of the lifting of the copyright and misusing the text for propaganda purposes . wehler , however , said he did n't think right-wing radicals would be very interested in the text .
" every skinhead is one too many , but there 's not a very passionate hitler readership in this country , " he said . the annotated edition would mainly be sold to universities , libraries and academic institutions . the documentation center 's board of trustees said it has already taken its request for the publication to bavaria 's prime minister guenter beckstein , since the state 's finance ministry was granted possession of the copyright by the allied forces after world war ii . the munich institute of contemporary history would likely be commissioned to publish the volume , which could take several years to complete . jewish leader in favour of publication a top figure in germany 's jewish community said friday he wants hitler 's book to be republished , but together with an accompanying commentary . " in principle i am in favor of the book being made public with a commentary , " both in normal book form and on the internet , stephan kramer , general secretary of the central council of jews , told deutschlandfunk radio . kramer said the central council of jews was ready to help write the commentary . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

insiders illuminate the pitfalls of publishers influencing editorial policy . " all the ingredients for a programmed catastrophe were there from day one , " said michael seufert , author of the newly released book " the scandal surrounding the hitler diaries . " seufert was stern 's domestic editor on april 25 , 1983 when the weekly newsmagazine publicized its sensational scoop : 62 volumes of adolf hitler 's journal entries from 1932 to 1945 bound in black imitation leather had been unearthed . the fanfare over the stern exclusive was , however , short-lived .
two weeks later , the diaries were exposed as complete forgeries .
it had turned out that stern 's source in obtaining the alleged diaries was a con artist and petty thief named konrad kujau , who made a small fortune in fabricating and selling old nazi memorabilia . kujau found a taker for his forgeries in stern reporter gerd heidemann , and that 's where the disaster began , according to seufert . " heidemann had such a morbid fascination with nazi collectibles that he even wound up befriending war criminals and was ready to believe in anything , " seufert said . downfall of publisher meddling in editorial matters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stern billed the diaries as the scoop of the century if heidemann 's gullibility were the only issue , the fake hitler diaries would have never seen the light of day .
the downfall was that the top brass at stern 's publisher , gruener + jahr , had also been blind-sided and were so eager for an exclusive scoop that they not only forked over a colossal sum in cash to obtain the diaries , but had even guaranteed that only heidemann and one other editor could review its contents . the project was shrouded in secrecy in order to protect alleged sources in the former east germany dictatorship , according to seufert , who described the collusion of reporter and publisher with a counterfeiter and the cold war as a backdrop , as fatal . " we editors were completely kept out of the loop , so all the normal checks and balances to authenticate stories were brushed aside , " said seufert , who confirmed that the publishing house had paid out 9.34 million dm -lrb- worth more than $ 4 million at the time -rrb- altogether to heidemann and kujau .
both had served over four years of prison time each on fraud charges , while stern 's two top editors had resigned . since most of the key players in the whole saga , including kujau , are either dead now or refuse to discuss the scandal publicly , corroborating seufert 's version of the events is difficult . however magnus linklater , who had been features editor of the sunday times of london , which had serial rights to publish extracts of the diaries in english , shared seufert 's frustrations at the time .
linklater had smelled a rat when he read the material . " it didn ’ t sound right , " he said . purchased sight unseen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : handwriting experts had not been allowed to examine diaries " but the deal was that rupert murdoch , whose company owns the times , bought the diaries from stern , and the condition of purchase was that we were not allowed to conduct our own independent investigation , " linklater added .

" the point is if you are offered a scoop , you can keep it secret , but that does n't mean you ca n't do internal checks . " as it turned out , the hitler documents were so technically flawed that forensic experts were able to easily determine that the paper , ink and glue that held the book bindings together were manufactured with post-war materials .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de olympics -pipe- 25.04.2008 olympic sponsors between a rock and a hard place großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : torn between the west and china , olympic sponsors , like adidas , are having a tough time the beijing olympics sponsors need to find ways to prevent international outrage over the situation in tibet from morphing into a backlash against them .
dw-world.de spoke to one of their advisors about what can be done . international outrage has been simmering since the chinese crackdown on protests in tibet in march , in which an unknown number of people were jailed or even killed .
in the meantime , there have been calls for a boycott of the games , politicians and athletes have said they would not take part in the opening ceremonies , and the city of paris this week named the dalai lama an honorary citizen . china has responded with anger and many chinese have started to boycott french companies .
hundreds of anti-china demonstrators took to the streets in europe last week to protest against china 's approach to tibet , as thousands of chinese marched in counter-demonstrations in berlin , london and paris .
the controversy is unlikely to die down until well after the beijing olympics , which run from august 8-24 , are over .
it 's a tough time for olympic sponsors , such as coca-cola , volkswagen or adidas . dw-world discussed their difficulties with thorsten hofmann , the ceo of prsg , a berlin-based consultancy for political and crisis management .
the company recently acquired an olympic sponsor as a client . dw-world.de : an old adage says " all publicity is good publicity . "
at what point does the damage make it not worthwhile for a sponsor ? thorsten hofmann : starting with " all publicity is good publicity : " that 's a dangerous statement , because when you 're in a crisis situation , you have the greatest amount of attention a firm could ever want , but unfortunately not in the context you would want it , and that , of course , is the most important thing .
if you want publicity , you generally want it in a nice , harmonious context with a positive image transfer .
in our concrete example , the olympic games , everyone who positioned themselves as sponsors - and invested somewhere between 50 and 100 million euros -lrb- $ 80 to $ 160 million -rrb- - wants to take the olympics ' positive image and create a brand transfer .
adidas as a sports brand wants to participate , vw wants to profit from the dynamics of the games , and above all , everything should be nice and harmonious .
and now for the big dilemma : if the olympics do n't go off as they could , but rather if - as is now the case - there 's a disregard for human rights , violent attacks , attacks on the torch bearers and disturbances of a political nature , then naturally this image transfer also rubs off on the sponsors .
it 's no longer so nice and smooth , and at some point as a sponsor you will be asked what your own position is .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights activists have been vocal in their criticism of china that is , what was originally planned - we participate in a collective sports competition , the olympics , and appear prominently as a main sponsor - can turn into the opposite .
for when a state in which the olympic games take place , like china , presents itself to the world as riding roughshod over human rights - that 's the outside perception - then the world asks itself , " what do the sponsors think of this ?
do human rights not matter to them ?
do they put the value of money above human rights ? "
that 's the negative side of the image transfer . a similar case is that of t-mobile and others companies sponsoring cycling in germany . it is definitely similar .
the cycling sponsors have always profited from the sporting image and the high spectator numbers of , for example , the tour de france .
now , because of all the doping cases , cycling has become dirty , and this dirtiness at some point rubs off on a brand .
accordingly , ever more sponsors are pulling out .
there are cases in the context of sporting events which are absolutely negative for the sponsors ' image , for the sponsors ' brands , and we , as sponsors , have to decide : " what do i do ? " .
with cycling , sponsors tried at the beginning of the doping crisis to introduce responsibility into the equation , to say i 'll create my own guidelines , anyone who takes drugs will be kicked out , i want to fight for clean cycling .
but at some point it became clear that the fight was futile , and sponsors said the recurring negative news is affecting my brand negatively , and at some point i pull out .
that 's what happened . with the olympics , at what point should sponsors pull out ?
when has it gone too far ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been protests in china against french companies that 's a super hard question , because you have to see it in the context of a giant market .
china is the market of the future - i think we all agree on that - and that 's why they all have put their energies and their sponsoring budgets into the olympics .
in addition , you have to take into account that china has an entirely different culture from our western culture .
that means , if i start to talk at the chinese about their culture and to publicly question the things they do , they lose face .
losing face is an affront in china , and you can be sure that as a consequence your company will have a big problem gaining a foothold there . but on the other hand , if you carry on with sponsoring and incidents occur at the olympics - from violent attacks on demonstrators to deaths - then the companies from outside must be prepared for the rest of the world to ask : " how far does the so-called kowtow to the communist dictatorship go ? "
for the companies , the question also arises : " how important are human rights to me and how important is money ? "
that 's the predicament the companies currently find themselves in .
they are caught between a rock and a hard place . but getting back to the question .
when should they pull out ?
it becomes very , very critical when there are deaths .
if there is suddenly fighting , or in the worst case - as has happened before in china - there 's shooting , demonstrators are killed with the world watching , then the company has to carefully consider , " how are my opportunities in this market , what should i do now , and how do my other markets judge my behavior ? "
it 's always an individual decision , that has to be made according to the situation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the torch relay went undisturbed in india ; protesters could n't get near it if i decide i 'm interested in a sponsoring contract - and am prepared to spend 50 to 100 million euros or more - why do n't i put some thought into a prevention plan ?
that is , i know china , and i 'm familiar with all of its sources of conflict , i 'm also familiar with the conflict situation with tibet , the issues of human rights , poverty , child labor and so on .
why have i not yet given some thought to how i could react to accusations of this nature ?
the classic tool is crisis prevention work , and it could have had an effect here .
and i think , actually , i know that that is the current situation the companies face .
they are literally surprised by a matter of course . one would assume they would have prepared for such an eventuality ? exactly , you 're absolutely right .
if i 'm prepared to become a sponsor , to spruce up my brand , then i also have to develop my protective shield so my brand is n't damaged .
and this shield is preventive work , crisis prevention .
at the moment i have the impression that everyone is surprised by what is happening .
that something could have happened , must have been clear to everyone .
because china functions differently than western societies , it 's just not understood by the rest of the world . do you have sporting events sponsors or olympic sponsors as clients ? yes on both counts .
the latter we got relatively recently , which is why i can reconstruct things well .
it 's the case that most of the sponsors have n't given any thought to these things . what can your company do for them ?
how can you protect them ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese students rallied this week to express their pride in their country of course , to start with we were surprised that there was no concept and in many areas no thought had gone into things .
what we 're now doing is thinking about how you can show that sponsoring does n't just mean money to develop a brand , as is assumed , but also to try to participate in shaping societal change .
in concrete terms that means developing one 's own projects that are cross-nation , that take place with china , in which sensitive issues , like human rights , exposure to publicity , etc . , are addressed and in which the added value for a country like china is apparent .
the chinese do n't see any added value in developing an internet that is not controlled , why they should allow press freedom , why they should be transparent or why , for example , they could allow demonstrations as an articulation of free expression . what do you do if there are calls for boycotts of sponsors ? we have to determine what messages we want to send for the different situations that could arise .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de olympics -pipe- 25.04.2008 olympic sponsors between a rock and a hard place großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : torn between the west and china , olympic sponsors , like adidas , are having a tough time the beijing olympics sponsors need to find ways to prevent international outrage over the situation in tibet from morphing into a backlash against them .
dw-world.de spoke to one of their advisors about what can be done . international outrage has been simmering since the chinese crackdown on protests in tibet in march , in which an unknown number of people were jailed or even killed .
in the meantime , there have been calls for a boycott of the games , politicians and athletes have said they would not take part in the opening ceremonies , and the city of paris this week named the dalai lama an honorary citizen . china has responded with anger and many chinese have started to boycott french companies .
hundreds of anti-china demonstrators took to the streets in europe last week to protest against china 's approach to tibet , as thousands of chinese marched in counter-demonstrations in berlin , london and paris .
the controversy is unlikely to die down until well after the beijing olympics , which run from august 8-24 , are over .
it 's a tough time for olympic sponsors , such as coca-cola , volkswagen or adidas . dw-world discussed their difficulties with thorsten hofmann , the ceo of prsg , a berlin-based consultancy for political and crisis management .
the company recently acquired an olympic sponsor as a client . dw-world.de : an old adage says " all publicity is good publicity . "
at what point does the damage make it not worthwhile for a sponsor ? thorsten hofmann : starting with " all publicity is good publicity : " that 's a dangerous statement , because when you 're in a crisis situation , you have the greatest amount of attention a firm could ever want , but unfortunately not in the context you would want it , and that , of course , is the most important thing .
if you want publicity , you generally want it in a nice , harmonious context with a positive image transfer .
in our concrete example , the olympic games , everyone who positioned themselves as sponsors - and invested somewhere between 50 and 100 million euros -lrb- $ 80 to $ 160 million -rrb- - wants to take the olympics ' positive image and create a brand transfer .
adidas as a sports brand wants to participate , vw wants to profit from the dynamics of the games , and above all , everything should be nice and harmonious .
and now for the big dilemma : if the olympics do n't go off as they could , but rather if - as is now the case - there 's a disregard for human rights , violent attacks , attacks on the torch bearers and disturbances of a political nature , then naturally this image transfer also rubs off on the sponsors .
it 's no longer so nice and smooth , and at some point as a sponsor you will be asked what your own position is .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights activists have been vocal in their criticism of china that is , what was originally planned - we participate in a collective sports competition , the olympics , and appear prominently as a main sponsor - can turn into the opposite .
for when a state in which the olympic games take place , like china , presents itself to the world as riding roughshod over human rights - that 's the outside perception - then the world asks itself , " what do the sponsors think of this ?
do human rights not matter to them ?
do they put the value of money above human rights ? "
that 's the negative side of the image transfer . a similar case is that of t-mobile and others companies sponsoring cycling in germany . it is definitely similar .
the cycling sponsors have always profited from the sporting image and the high spectator numbers of , for example , the tour de france .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de olympics -pipe- 25.04.2008 olympic sponsors between a rock and a hard place großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : torn between the west and china , olympic sponsors , like adidas , are having a tough time the beijing olympics sponsors need to find ways to prevent international outrage over the situation in tibet from morphing into a backlash against them .
dw-world.de spoke to one of their advisors about what can be done . international outrage has been simmering since the chinese crackdown on protests in tibet in march , in which an unknown number of people were jailed or even killed .
in the meantime , there have been calls for a boycott of the games , politicians and athletes have said they would not take part in the opening ceremonies , and the city of paris this week named the dalai lama an honorary citizen . china has responded with anger and many chinese have started to boycott french companies .
hundreds of anti-china demonstrators took to the streets in europe last week to protest against china 's approach to tibet , as thousands of chinese marched in counter-demonstrations in berlin , london and paris .
the controversy is unlikely to die down until well after the beijing olympics , which run from august 8-24 , are over .
it 's a tough time for olympic sponsors , such as coca-cola , volkswagen or adidas . dw-world discussed their difficulties with thorsten hofmann , the ceo of prsg , a berlin-based consultancy for political and crisis management .
the company recently acquired an olympic sponsor as a client . dw-world.de : an old adage says " all publicity is good publicity . "
at what point does the damage make it not worthwhile for a sponsor ? thorsten hofmann : starting with " all publicity is good publicity : " that 's a dangerous statement , because when you 're in a crisis situation , you have the greatest amount of attention a firm could ever want , but unfortunately not in the context you would want it , and that , of course , is the most important thing .
if you want publicity , you generally want it in a nice , harmonious context with a positive image transfer .
in our concrete example , the olympic games , everyone who positioned themselves as sponsors - and invested somewhere between 50 and 100 million euros -lrb- $ 80 to $ 160 million -rrb- - wants to take the olympics ' positive image and create a brand transfer .
adidas as a sports brand wants to participate , vw wants to profit from the dynamics of the games , and above all , everything should be nice and harmonious .
and now for the big dilemma : if the olympics do n't go off as they could , but rather if - as is now the case - there 's a disregard for human rights , violent attacks , attacks on the torch bearers and disturbances of a political nature , then naturally this image transfer also rubs off on the sponsors .
it 's no longer so nice and smooth , and at some point as a sponsor you will be asked what your own position is .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights activists have been vocal in their criticism of china that is , what was originally planned - we participate in a collective sports competition , the olympics , and appear prominently as a main sponsor - can turn into the opposite .
for when a state in which the olympic games take place , like china , presents itself to the world as riding roughshod over human rights - that 's the outside perception - then the world asks itself , " what do the sponsors think of this ?
do human rights not matter to them ?
do they put the value of money above human rights ? "
that 's the negative side of the image transfer . a similar case is that of t-mobile and others companies sponsoring cycling in germany . it is definitely similar .
the cycling sponsors have always profited from the sporting image and the high spectator numbers of , for example , the tour de france .
now , because of all the doping cases , cycling has become dirty , and this dirtiness at some point rubs off on a brand .
accordingly , ever more sponsors are pulling out .
there are cases in the context of sporting events which are absolutely negative for the sponsors ' image , for the sponsors ' brands , and we , as sponsors , have to decide : " what do i do ? " .
with cycling , sponsors tried at the beginning of the doping crisis to introduce responsibility into the equation , to say i 'll create my own guidelines , anyone who takes drugs will be kicked out , i want to fight for clean cycling .
but at some point it became clear that the fight was futile , and sponsors said the recurring negative news is affecting my brand negatively , and at some point i pull out .
that 's what happened . with the olympics , at what point should sponsors pull out ?
when has it gone too far ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been protests in china against french companies that 's a super hard question , because you have to see it in the context of a giant market .
china is the market of the future - i think we all agree on that - and that 's why they all have put their energies and their sponsoring budgets into the olympics .
in addition , you have to take into account that china has an entirely different culture from our western culture .
that means , if i start to talk at the chinese about their culture and to publicly question the things they do , they lose face .
losing face is an affront in china , and you can be sure that as a consequence your company will have a big problem gaining a foothold there . but on the other hand , if you carry on with sponsoring and incidents occur at the olympics - from violent attacks on demonstrators to deaths - then the companies from outside must be prepared for the rest of the world to ask : " how far does the so-called kowtow to the communist dictatorship go ? "
for the companies , the question also arises : " how important are human rights to me and how important is money ? "
that 's the predicament the companies currently find themselves in .
they are caught between a rock and a hard place . but getting back to the question .
when should they pull out ?
it becomes very , very critical when there are deaths .
if there is suddenly fighting , or in the worst case - as has happened before in china - there 's shooting , demonstrators are killed with the world watching , then the company has to carefully consider , " how are my opportunities in this market , what should i do now , and how do my other markets judge my behavior ? "
it 's always an individual decision , that has to be made according to the situation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the torch relay went undisturbed in india ; protesters could n't get near it if i decide i 'm interested in a sponsoring contract - and am prepared to spend 50 to 100 million euros or more - why do n't i put some thought into a prevention plan ?
that is , i know china , and i 'm familiar with all of its sources of conflict , i 'm also familiar with the conflict situation with tibet , the issues of human rights , poverty , child labor and so on .
why have i not yet given some thought to how i could react to accusations of this nature ?
the classic tool is crisis prevention work , and it could have had an effect here .
and i think , actually , i know that that is the current situation the companies face .
they are literally surprised by a matter of course . one would assume they would have prepared for such an eventuality ? exactly , you 're absolutely right .
if i 'm prepared to become a sponsor , to spruce up my brand , then i also have to develop my protective shield so my brand is n't damaged .
and this shield is preventive work , crisis prevention .
at the moment i have the impression that everyone is surprised by what is happening .
that something could have happened , must have been clear to everyone .
because china functions differently than western societies , it 's just not understood by the rest of the world . do you have sporting events sponsors or olympic sponsors as clients ? yes on both counts .
the latter we got relatively recently , which is why i can reconstruct things well .
it 's the case that most of the sponsors have n't given any thought to these things . what can your company do for them ?
how can you protect them ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese students rallied this week to express their pride in their country of course , to start with we were surprised that there was no concept and in many areas no thought had gone into things .
what we 're now doing is thinking about how you can show that sponsoring does n't just mean money to develop a brand , as is assumed , but also to try to participate in shaping societal change .
in concrete terms that means developing one 's own projects that are cross-nation , that take place with china , in which sensitive issues , like human rights , exposure to publicity , etc . , are addressed and in which the added value for a country like china is apparent .
the chinese do n't see any added value in developing an internet that is not controlled , why they should allow press freedom , why they should be transparent or why , for example , they could allow demonstrations as an articulation of free expression . what do you do if there are calls for boycotts of sponsors ? we have to determine what messages we want to send for the different situations that could arise .
say our sports clothes or our cars are n't being bought anymore .
here the company has to take a stand , and formulating the message is very difficult .
they remain between a rock and a hard place , which means that every word hangs in the balance .
every word is a tightrope walk .
on the one hand , they have to consider to what extent do i want to damage my future business in china , and on the other hand , i want to clarify my position to the rest of the world .
and that is very difficult . interview : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

if there is suddenly fighting , or in the worst case - as has happened before in china - there 's shooting , demonstrators are killed with the world watching , then the company has to carefully consider , " how are my opportunities in this market , what should i do now , and how do my other markets judge my behavior ? "
it 's always an individual decision , that has to be made according to the situation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the torch relay went undisturbed in india ; protesters could n't get near it if i decide i 'm interested in a sponsoring contract - and am prepared to spend 50 to 100 million euros or more - why do n't i put some thought into a prevention plan ?
that is , i know china , and i 'm familiar with all of its sources of conflict , i 'm also familiar with the conflict situation with tibet , the issues of human rights , poverty , child labor and so on .
why have i not yet given some thought to how i could react to accusations of this nature ?
the classic tool is crisis prevention work , and it could have had an effect here .
and i think , actually , i know that that is the current situation the companies face .
they are literally surprised by a matter of course . one would assume they would have prepared for such an eventuality ? exactly , you 're absolutely right .
if i 'm prepared to become a sponsor , to spruce up my brand , then i also have to develop my protective shield so my brand is n't damaged .
and this shield is preventive work , crisis prevention .
at the moment i have the impression that everyone is surprised by what is happening .
that something could have happened , must have been clear to everyone .
because china functions differently than western societies , it 's just not understood by the rest of the world . do you have sporting events sponsors or olympic sponsors as clients ? yes on both counts .
the latter we got relatively recently , which is why i can reconstruct things well .
it 's the case that most of the sponsors have n't given any thought to these things . what can your company do for them ?
how can you protect them ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese students rallied this week to express their pride in their country of course , to start with we were surprised that there was no concept and in many areas no thought had gone into things .
what we 're now doing is thinking about how you can show that sponsoring does n't just mean money to develop a brand , as is assumed , but also to try to participate in shaping societal change .
in concrete terms that means developing one 's own projects that are cross-nation , that take place with china , in which sensitive issues , like human rights , exposure to publicity , etc . , are addressed and in which the added value for a country like china is apparent .
the chinese do n't see any added value in developing an internet that is not controlled , why they should allow press freedom , why they should be transparent or why , for example , they could allow demonstrations as an articulation of free expression . what do you do if there are calls for boycotts of sponsors ? we have to determine what messages we want to send for the different situations that could arise .
say our sports clothes or our cars are n't being bought anymore .
here the company has to take a stand , and formulating the message is very difficult .
they remain between a rock and a hard place , which means that every word hangs in the balance .
every word is a tightrope walk .
on the one hand , they have to consider to what extent do i want to damage my future business in china , and on the other hand , i want to clarify my position to the rest of the world .
and that is very difficult . interview : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it says it will approach berlin in the next few days . news broke at the weekend that the bnd had read e-mail correspondence between der spiegel reporter susanne koelbl and an afghan politician between june and november 2006 , sparking outrage because of the breach of press freedom .
it only emerged on thursday -lrb- apr .
24 -rrb- that trade and industry minister amin farhang was the actual target of the operation .
no explanation has been given for why he was under scrutiny .
farhang , who lived in germany for a number of years , has told the german newspaper neue osnabruecker zeitung that his life was now at risk because the measure implied that he was co-operating with hostile forces .
" because of this absurd lie that i 'm some kind of double agent , my life and the lives of my family are in great danger , " he said .
" i could be shot on the street tomorrow , " he added .
kabul is " disappointed " about the spying revelations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bnd head faced a second day of questioning by a parliamentary committee kabul has declined to comment directly on the events , but afghan foreign minister rangeen dadfar spanta told the financial times deutschlan d -lrb- ftd -rrb- that his government would bring up the matter with berlin in the next few days .
the ftd reported that government sources spoke of " disappointment " about what had happened and the fact that neither the government or the bnd had been in contact with the targeted minister to apologize over the affair , or explain why the surveillance had been carried out in the first place .
but the foreign ministry in berlin said on friday -lrb- apr .
25 -rrb- that relations with kabul remained " close . "
spokesman martin jaeger said kabul had not made any official request for an explanation , nor had the german ambassador to kabul been summoned to discuss the issue .
on thursday , the chancellor 's office ordered disciplinary measures to be taken against three intelligence service members , including the chief-of-staff of bnd head , ernst uhrlau , as well as the head of the department responsible for the spying operation .
uhrlau , who faced a second of questioning thursday by a parliamentary oversight committee -lrb- pkg -rrb- , had faced calls for his resignation over the spy scandal .
but the pkg has stopped short of demanding he step down .
bnd chief 's head does not roll bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uhrlau apologized to journalist koelbl , but apparently not to the afghan minister the committee condemned the fact that uhrlau had not informed the government or parliamentarians about the monitoring of the der spiegel journalist , but that this activity did not mean that he should quit .
" the trust between the parliamentary committee and the leadership of the bnd is damaged , " committee chairman thomas oppermann -lrb- spd -rrb- said in a statement .
opposition members of parliament said the issue was not so much uhrlau 's position , but concern that the intelligence services were running out of control as a result of concerns on international terrorism .
max stadler , of the free democrats , said the bnd was in danger of becoming a " state within a state " .
as well as the diplomatic ramifications of this affair , the activities clearly breach germany 's basic law on press freedom .
german news weekly der spiegel announced on thursday that it was considering legal action .
" in view of this renewed serious breach of press freedom , der spiegel has decided to look at the legal and constitutional implications of this case , " it said .
the chairman of the association of german journalists -lrb- djv -rrb- , michael konken , accused the intelligence services of " developing a james bond mentality . " two years ago , the bnd admitted spying on journalists to discover their sources - but apologized calling it a one-off .
this week , another journalist who had worked in afghanistan said he was told that he was being bugged by a senior diplomat . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 25.04.2008 impact of the fake hitler diaries press scandal 25 years later großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad kujau 's forgeries were technically and historically flawed " stern " magazine 's discovery of the hitler diaries a quarter-century ago was a media sensation - and a spectacular hoax .
insiders illuminate the pitfalls of publishers influencing editorial policy . " all the ingredients for a programmed catastrophe were there from day one , " said michael seufert , author of the newly released book " the scandal surrounding the hitler diaries . " seufert was stern 's domestic editor on april 25 , 1983 when the weekly newsmagazine publicized its sensational scoop : 62 volumes of adolf hitler 's journal entries from 1932 to 1945 bound in black imitation leather had been unearthed . the fanfare over the stern exclusive was , however , short-lived .
two weeks later , the diaries were exposed as complete forgeries .
it had turned out that stern 's source in obtaining the alleged diaries was a con artist and petty thief named konrad kujau , who made a small fortune in fabricating and selling old nazi memorabilia . kujau found a taker for his forgeries in stern reporter gerd heidemann , and that 's where the disaster began , according to seufert . " heidemann had such a morbid fascination with nazi collectibles that he even wound up befriending war criminals and was ready to believe in anything , " seufert said . downfall of publisher meddling in editorial matters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stern billed the diaries as the scoop of the century if heidemann 's gullibility were the only issue , the fake hitler diaries would have never seen the light of day .
the downfall was that the top brass at stern 's publisher , gruener + jahr , had also been blind-sided and were so eager for an exclusive scoop that they not only forked over a colossal sum in cash to obtain the diaries , but had even guaranteed that only heidemann and one other editor could review its contents . the project was shrouded in secrecy in order to protect alleged sources in the former east germany dictatorship , according to seufert , who described the collusion of reporter and publisher with a counterfeiter and the cold war as a backdrop , as fatal . " we editors were completely kept out of the loop , so all the normal checks and balances to authenticate stories were brushed aside , " said seufert , who confirmed that the publishing house had paid out 9.34 million dm -lrb- worth more than $ 4 million at the time -rrb- altogether to heidemann and kujau .
both had served over four years of prison time each on fraud charges , while stern 's two top editors had resigned . since most of the key players in the whole saga , including kujau , are either dead now or refuse to discuss the scandal publicly , corroborating seufert 's version of the events is difficult . however magnus linklater , who had been features editor of the sunday times of london , which had serial rights to publish extracts of the diaries in english , shared seufert 's frustrations at the time .
linklater had smelled a rat when he read the material . " it didn ’ t sound right , " he said . purchased sight unseen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : handwriting experts had not been allowed to examine diaries " but the deal was that rupert murdoch , whose company owns the times , bought the diaries from stern , and the condition of purchase was that we were not allowed to conduct our own independent investigation , " linklater added .
" this was a clear case of the editorial and business side of newspapers clashing .
we had to take the pig in a poke so to say . " before publication , linklater did however talk to the eminent hitler historian hugh trevor-roper , who assured him the diaries were genuine . " his word was good enough for me , but it goes to show how gullible we can all be , " linklater said .
" the point is if you are offered a scoop , you can keep it secret , but that does n't mean you ca n't do internal checks . " as it turned out , the hitler documents were so technically flawed that forensic experts were able to easily determine that the paper , ink and glue that held the book bindings together were manufactured with post-war materials .
even hitler 's handwriting had not been subject to analysis . importance of internal checks and controls " you need outside experts to look at the handwriting or paper , so it is understandable that stern , which was so paranoid about secrecy , was afraid of leaks , " said gerhard weinberg , a world war ii historian , whom newsweek had hired as a consultant to examine the authenticity of the diaries .
" but what is unfathomable is why they did no internal checks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stern reporter gerd heidemann was obsessed by nazi collectibles , such as fake diaries weinberg pointed out that the diaries were full of mistakes that would have been recognized had stern allowed experts to examine even typed versions of the diaries . " someone in-house could have then read the diary and would have discovered things that were so preposterous that hitler couldn ’ t have possibly written them , " weinberg said .
" hitler , for instance , would never have gotten the color of his own uniform wrong . " hendrik zoerner , spokesman for the german journalists ' association -lrb- djv -rrb- said stern normally does subject its stories to internal control mechanisms .
the fake hitler diaries were an exceptional case of gross negligence that would never be repeated again by stern or any other media outlet , he said . " but we in the media will be making other kinds of mistakes that are less spectacular than what happened at stern , " zoerner said .
" nowadays journalists are under such time pressure that they spend less time doing sound research and fact-checking , so they wind up slipping up and making smaller mistakes on a daily basis . " zoerner added that mistakes , even big ones are inevitable , but responsible journalists need to own up to them . " stern admitted its mistakes and worked through its crisis in public , " he said .
" by doing so , it restored some credibility to its image . " diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de olympics -pipe- 25.04.2008 olympic sponsors between a rock and a hard place großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : torn between the west and china , olympic sponsors , like adidas , are having a tough time the beijing olympics sponsors need to find ways to prevent international outrage over the situation in tibet from morphing into a backlash against them .
dw-world.de spoke to one of their advisors about what can be done . international outrage has been simmering since the chinese crackdown on protests in tibet in march , in which an unknown number of people were jailed or even killed .
in the meantime , there have been calls for a boycott of the games , politicians and athletes have said they would not take part in the opening ceremonies , and the city of paris this week named the dalai lama an honorary citizen . china has responded with anger and many chinese have started to boycott french companies .
hundreds of anti-china demonstrators took to the streets in europe last week to protest against china 's approach to tibet , as thousands of chinese marched in counter-demonstrations in berlin , london and paris .
the controversy is unlikely to die down until well after the beijing olympics , which run from august 8-24 , are over .
it 's a tough time for olympic sponsors , such as coca-cola , volkswagen or adidas . dw-world discussed their difficulties with thorsten hofmann , the ceo of prsg , a berlin-based consultancy for political and crisis management .
the company recently acquired an olympic sponsor as a client . dw-world.de : an old adage says " all publicity is good publicity . "
at what point does the damage make it not worthwhile for a sponsor ? thorsten hofmann : starting with " all publicity is good publicity : " that 's a dangerous statement , because when you 're in a crisis situation , you have the greatest amount of attention a firm could ever want , but unfortunately not in the context you would want it , and that , of course , is the most important thing .
if you want publicity , you generally want it in a nice , harmonious context with a positive image transfer .
in our concrete example , the olympic games , everyone who positioned themselves as sponsors - and invested somewhere between 50 and 100 million euros -lrb- $ 80 to $ 160 million -rrb- - wants to take the olympics ' positive image and create a brand transfer .
adidas as a sports brand wants to participate , vw wants to profit from the dynamics of the games , and above all , everything should be nice and harmonious .
and now for the big dilemma : if the olympics do n't go off as they could , but rather if - as is now the case - there 's a disregard for human rights , violent attacks , attacks on the torch bearers and disturbances of a political nature , then naturally this image transfer also rubs off on the sponsors .
it 's no longer so nice and smooth , and at some point as a sponsor you will be asked what your own position is .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights activists have been vocal in their criticism of china that is , what was originally planned - we participate in a collective sports competition , the olympics , and appear prominently as a main sponsor - can turn into the opposite .
for when a state in which the olympic games take place , like china , presents itself to the world as riding roughshod over human rights - that 's the outside perception - then the world asks itself , " what do the sponsors think of this ?
do human rights not matter to them ?
do they put the value of money above human rights ? "
that 's the negative side of the image transfer . a similar case is that of t-mobile and others companies sponsoring cycling in germany . it is definitely similar .
the cycling sponsors have always profited from the sporting image and the high spectator numbers of , for example , the tour de france .
now , because of all the doping cases , cycling has become dirty , and this dirtiness at some point rubs off on a brand .
accordingly , ever more sponsors are pulling out .
there are cases in the context of sporting events which are absolutely negative for the sponsors ' image , for the sponsors ' brands , and we , as sponsors , have to decide : " what do i do ? " .
with cycling , sponsors tried at the beginning of the doping crisis to introduce responsibility into the equation , to say i 'll create my own guidelines , anyone who takes drugs will be kicked out , i want to fight for clean cycling .
but at some point it became clear that the fight was futile , and sponsors said the recurring negative news is affecting my brand negatively , and at some point i pull out .
that 's what happened . with the olympics , at what point should sponsors pull out ?
when has it gone too far ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been protests in china against french companies that 's a super hard question , because you have to see it in the context of a giant market .
china is the market of the future - i think we all agree on that - and that 's why they all have put their energies and their sponsoring budgets into the olympics .
in addition , you have to take into account that china has an entirely different culture from our western culture .
that means , if i start to talk at the chinese about their culture and to publicly question the things they do , they lose face .
losing face is an affront in china , and you can be sure that as a consequence your company will have a big problem gaining a foothold there . but on the other hand , if you carry on with sponsoring and incidents occur at the olympics - from violent attacks on demonstrators to deaths - then the companies from outside must be prepared for the rest of the world to ask : " how far does the so-called kowtow to the communist dictatorship go ? "
for the companies , the question also arises : " how important are human rights to me and how important is money ? "
that 's the predicament the companies currently find themselves in .
they are caught between a rock and a hard place . but getting back to the question .
when should they pull out ?
it becomes very , very critical when there are deaths .
if there is suddenly fighting , or in the worst case - as has happened before in china - there 's shooting , demonstrators are killed with the world watching , then the company has to carefully consider , " how are my opportunities in this market , what should i do now , and how do my other markets judge my behavior ? "
it 's always an individual decision , that has to be made according to the situation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the torch relay went undisturbed in india ; protesters could n't get near it if i decide i 'm interested in a sponsoring contract - and am prepared to spend 50 to 100 million euros or more - why do n't i put some thought into a prevention plan ?
that is , i know china , and i 'm familiar with all of its sources of conflict , i 'm also familiar with the conflict situation with tibet , the issues of human rights , poverty , child labor and so on .
why have i not yet given some thought to how i could react to accusations of this nature ?
the classic tool is crisis prevention work , and it could have had an effect here .
and i think , actually , i know that that is the current situation the companies face .
they are literally surprised by a matter of course . one would assume they would have prepared for such an eventuality ? exactly , you 're absolutely right .
if i 'm prepared to become a sponsor , to spruce up my brand , then i also have to develop my protective shield so my brand is n't damaged .
and this shield is preventive work , crisis prevention .
at the moment i have the impression that everyone is surprised by what is happening .
that something could have happened , must have been clear to everyone .
because china functions differently than western societies , it 's just not understood by the rest of the world . do you have sporting events sponsors or olympic sponsors as clients ? yes on both counts .
the latter we got relatively recently , which is why i can reconstruct things well .
it 's the case that most of the sponsors have n't given any thought to these things . what can your company do for them ?
how can you protect them ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese students rallied this week to express their pride in their country of course , to start with we were surprised that there was no concept and in many areas no thought had gone into things .
what we 're now doing is thinking about how you can show that sponsoring does n't just mean money to develop a brand , as is assumed , but also to try to participate in shaping societal change .
in concrete terms that means developing one 's own projects that are cross-nation , that take place with china , in which sensitive issues , like human rights , exposure to publicity , etc . , are addressed and in which the added value for a country like china is apparent .
the chinese do n't see any added value in developing an internet that is not controlled , why they should allow press freedom , why they should be transparent or why , for example , they could allow demonstrations as an articulation of free expression . what do you do if there are calls for boycotts of sponsors ? we have to determine what messages we want to send for the different situations that could arise .
say our sports clothes or our cars are n't being bought anymore .
here the company has to take a stand , and formulating the message is very difficult .
they remain between a rock and a hard place , which means that every word hangs in the balance .
every word is a tightrope walk .
on the one hand , they have to consider to what extent do i want to damage my future business in china , and on the other hand , i want to clarify my position to the rest of the world .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de olympics -pipe- 25.04.2008 olympic sponsors between a rock and a hard place großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : torn between the west and china , olympic sponsors , like adidas , are having a tough time the beijing olympics sponsors need to find ways to prevent international outrage over the situation in tibet from morphing into a backlash against them .
dw-world.de spoke to one of their advisors about what can be done . international outrage has been simmering since the chinese crackdown on protests in tibet in march , in which an unknown number of people were jailed or even killed .
in the meantime , there have been calls for a boycott of the games , politicians and athletes have said they would not take part in the opening ceremonies , and the city of paris this week named the dalai lama an honorary citizen . china has responded with anger and many chinese have started to boycott french companies .
hundreds of anti-china demonstrators took to the streets in europe last week to protest against china 's approach to tibet , as thousands of chinese marched in counter-demonstrations in berlin , london and paris .
the controversy is unlikely to die down until well after the beijing olympics , which run from august 8-24 , are over .
it 's a tough time for olympic sponsors , such as coca-cola , volkswagen or adidas . dw-world discussed their difficulties with thorsten hofmann , the ceo of prsg , a berlin-based consultancy for political and crisis management .
the company recently acquired an olympic sponsor as a client . dw-world.de : an old adage says " all publicity is good publicity . "
at what point does the damage make it not worthwhile for a sponsor ? thorsten hofmann : starting with " all publicity is good publicity : " that 's a dangerous statement , because when you 're in a crisis situation , you have the greatest amount of attention a firm could ever want , but unfortunately not in the context you would want it , and that , of course , is the most important thing .
if you want publicity , you generally want it in a nice , harmonious context with a positive image transfer .
in our concrete example , the olympic games , everyone who positioned themselves as sponsors - and invested somewhere between 50 and 100 million euros -lrb- $ 80 to $ 160 million -rrb- - wants to take the olympics ' positive image and create a brand transfer .
adidas as a sports brand wants to participate , vw wants to profit from the dynamics of the games , and above all , everything should be nice and harmonious .
and now for the big dilemma : if the olympics do n't go off as they could , but rather if - as is now the case - there 's a disregard for human rights , violent attacks , attacks on the torch bearers and disturbances of a political nature , then naturally this image transfer also rubs off on the sponsors .
it 's no longer so nice and smooth , and at some point as a sponsor you will be asked what your own position is .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights activists have been vocal in their criticism of china that is , what was originally planned - we participate in a collective sports competition , the olympics , and appear prominently as a main sponsor - can turn into the opposite .
for when a state in which the olympic games take place , like china , presents itself to the world as riding roughshod over human rights - that 's the outside perception - then the world asks itself , " what do the sponsors think of this ?
do human rights not matter to them ?
do they put the value of money above human rights ? "
that 's the negative side of the image transfer . a similar case is that of t-mobile and others companies sponsoring cycling in germany . it is definitely similar .
the cycling sponsors have always profited from the sporting image and the high spectator numbers of , for example , the tour de france .
now , because of all the doping cases , cycling has become dirty , and this dirtiness at some point rubs off on a brand .
accordingly , ever more sponsors are pulling out .
there are cases in the context of sporting events which are absolutely negative for the sponsors ' image , for the sponsors ' brands , and we , as sponsors , have to decide : " what do i do ? " .
with cycling , sponsors tried at the beginning of the doping crisis to introduce responsibility into the equation , to say i 'll create my own guidelines , anyone who takes drugs will be kicked out , i want to fight for clean cycling .
but at some point it became clear that the fight was futile , and sponsors said the recurring negative news is affecting my brand negatively , and at some point i pull out .
that 's what happened . with the olympics , at what point should sponsors pull out ?
when has it gone too far ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been protests in china against french companies that 's a super hard question , because you have to see it in the context of a giant market .
china is the market of the future - i think we all agree on that - and that 's why they all have put their energies and their sponsoring budgets into the olympics .
in addition , you have to take into account that china has an entirely different culture from our western culture .
that means , if i start to talk at the chinese about their culture and to publicly question the things they do , they lose face .
losing face is an affront in china , and you can be sure that as a consequence your company will have a big problem gaining a foothold there . but on the other hand , if you carry on with sponsoring and incidents occur at the olympics - from violent attacks on demonstrators to deaths - then the companies from outside must be prepared for the rest of the world to ask : " how far does the so-called kowtow to the communist dictatorship go ? "
for the companies , the question also arises : " how important are human rights to me and how important is money ? "
that 's the predicament the companies currently find themselves in .
they are caught between a rock and a hard place . but getting back to the question .
when should they pull out ?
it becomes very , very critical when there are deaths .
if there is suddenly fighting , or in the worst case - as has happened before in china - there 's shooting , demonstrators are killed with the world watching , then the company has to carefully consider , " how are my opportunities in this market , what should i do now , and how do my other markets judge my behavior ? "
it 's always an individual decision , that has to be made according to the situation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the torch relay went undisturbed in india ; protesters could n't get near it if i decide i 'm interested in a sponsoring contract - and am prepared to spend 50 to 100 million euros or more - why do n't i put some thought into a prevention plan ?

annotated versions of other texts by hitler and other nazi leaders are in print , however . hitler considered himself a writer and composed all his speeches himself , said wehler , adding that it can reasonably be presumed that the nazi leader wrote most of " mein kampf " himself as well . " since he had a terribly ruinous effect on world history , these parts should be kept in a critical edition , " the historian said . copyright expires soon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler wrote his own speeches the copyright for " mein kampf " expires 70 years after hitler 's death , in 2015 .
some , including the board of trustees at the nuremberg documentation center have said that publishing an annotated copy now could help prevent neo-nazis from taking advantage of the lifting of the copyright and misusing the text for propaganda purposes . wehler , however , said he did n't think right-wing radicals would be very interested in the text .
" every skinhead is one too many , but there 's not a very passionate hitler readership in this country , " he said . the annotated edition would mainly be sold to universities , libraries and academic institutions . the documentation center 's board of trustees said it has already taken its request for the publication to bavaria 's prime minister guenter beckstein , since the state 's finance ministry was granted possession of the copyright by the allied forces after world war ii . the munich institute of contemporary history would likely be commissioned to publish the volume , which could take several years to complete . jewish leader in favour of publication a top figure in germany 's jewish community said friday he wants hitler 's book to be republished , but together with an accompanying commentary . " in principle i am in favor of the book being made public with a commentary , " both in normal book form and on the internet , stephan kramer , general secretary of the central council of jews , told deutschlandfunk radio . kramer said the central council of jews was ready to help write the commentary . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the ftd reported that government sources spoke of " disappointment " about what had happened and the fact that neither the government or the bnd had been in contact with the targeted minister to apologize over the affair , or explain why the surveillance had been carried out in the first place .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de olympics -pipe- 25.04.2008 olympic sponsors between a rock and a hard place großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : torn between the west and china , olympic sponsors , like adidas , are having a tough time the beijing olympics sponsors need to find ways to prevent international outrage over the situation in tibet from morphing into a backlash against them .
dw-world.de spoke to one of their advisors about what can be done . international outrage has been simmering since the chinese crackdown on protests in tibet in march , in which an unknown number of people were jailed or even killed .
in the meantime , there have been calls for a boycott of the games , politicians and athletes have said they would not take part in the opening ceremonies , and the city of paris this week named the dalai lama an honorary citizen . china has responded with anger and many chinese have started to boycott french companies .
hundreds of anti-china demonstrators took to the streets in europe last week to protest against china 's approach to tibet , as thousands of chinese marched in counter-demonstrations in berlin , london and paris .
the controversy is unlikely to die down until well after the beijing olympics , which run from august 8-24 , are over .
it 's a tough time for olympic sponsors , such as coca-cola , volkswagen or adidas . dw-world discussed their difficulties with thorsten hofmann , the ceo of prsg , a berlin-based consultancy for political and crisis management .
the company recently acquired an olympic sponsor as a client . dw-world.de : an old adage says " all publicity is good publicity . "
at what point does the damage make it not worthwhile for a sponsor ? thorsten hofmann : starting with " all publicity is good publicity : " that 's a dangerous statement , because when you 're in a crisis situation , you have the greatest amount of attention a firm could ever want , but unfortunately not in the context you would want it , and that , of course , is the most important thing .
if you want publicity , you generally want it in a nice , harmonious context with a positive image transfer .
in our concrete example , the olympic games , everyone who positioned themselves as sponsors - and invested somewhere between 50 and 100 million euros -lrb- $ 80 to $ 160 million -rrb- - wants to take the olympics ' positive image and create a brand transfer .
adidas as a sports brand wants to participate , vw wants to profit from the dynamics of the games , and above all , everything should be nice and harmonious .
and now for the big dilemma : if the olympics do n't go off as they could , but rather if - as is now the case - there 's a disregard for human rights , violent attacks , attacks on the torch bearers and disturbances of a political nature , then naturally this image transfer also rubs off on the sponsors .
it 's no longer so nice and smooth , and at some point as a sponsor you will be asked what your own position is .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights activists have been vocal in their criticism of china that is , what was originally planned - we participate in a collective sports competition , the olympics , and appear prominently as a main sponsor - can turn into the opposite .
for when a state in which the olympic games take place , like china , presents itself to the world as riding roughshod over human rights - that 's the outside perception - then the world asks itself , " what do the sponsors think of this ?
do human rights not matter to them ?
do they put the value of money above human rights ? "
that 's the negative side of the image transfer . a similar case is that of t-mobile and others companies sponsoring cycling in germany . it is definitely similar .
the cycling sponsors have always profited from the sporting image and the high spectator numbers of , for example , the tour de france .
now , because of all the doping cases , cycling has become dirty , and this dirtiness at some point rubs off on a brand .
accordingly , ever more sponsors are pulling out .
there are cases in the context of sporting events which are absolutely negative for the sponsors ' image , for the sponsors ' brands , and we , as sponsors , have to decide : " what do i do ? " .
with cycling , sponsors tried at the beginning of the doping crisis to introduce responsibility into the equation , to say i 'll create my own guidelines , anyone who takes drugs will be kicked out , i want to fight for clean cycling .
but at some point it became clear that the fight was futile , and sponsors said the recurring negative news is affecting my brand negatively , and at some point i pull out .
that 's what happened . with the olympics , at what point should sponsors pull out ?
when has it gone too far ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been protests in china against french companies that 's a super hard question , because you have to see it in the context of a giant market .
china is the market of the future - i think we all agree on that - and that 's why they all have put their energies and their sponsoring budgets into the olympics .
in addition , you have to take into account that china has an entirely different culture from our western culture .
that means , if i start to talk at the chinese about their culture and to publicly question the things they do , they lose face .
losing face is an affront in china , and you can be sure that as a consequence your company will have a big problem gaining a foothold there . but on the other hand , if you carry on with sponsoring and incidents occur at the olympics - from violent attacks on demonstrators to deaths - then the companies from outside must be prepared for the rest of the world to ask : " how far does the so-called kowtow to the communist dictatorship go ? "
for the companies , the question also arises : " how important are human rights to me and how important is money ? "
that 's the predicament the companies currently find themselves in .
they are caught between a rock and a hard place . but getting back to the question .
when should they pull out ?
it becomes very , very critical when there are deaths .
if there is suddenly fighting , or in the worst case - as has happened before in china - there 's shooting , demonstrators are killed with the world watching , then the company has to carefully consider , " how are my opportunities in this market , what should i do now , and how do my other markets judge my behavior ? "
it 's always an individual decision , that has to be made according to the situation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the torch relay went undisturbed in india ; protesters could n't get near it if i decide i 'm interested in a sponsoring contract - and am prepared to spend 50 to 100 million euros or more - why do n't i put some thought into a prevention plan ?
that is , i know china , and i 'm familiar with all of its sources of conflict , i 'm also familiar with the conflict situation with tibet , the issues of human rights , poverty , child labor and so on .
why have i not yet given some thought to how i could react to accusations of this nature ?
the classic tool is crisis prevention work , and it could have had an effect here .
and i think , actually , i know that that is the current situation the companies face .
they are literally surprised by a matter of course . one would assume they would have prepared for such an eventuality ? exactly , you 're absolutely right .
if i 'm prepared to become a sponsor , to spruce up my brand , then i also have to develop my protective shield so my brand is n't damaged .
and this shield is preventive work , crisis prevention .
at the moment i have the impression that everyone is surprised by what is happening .
that something could have happened , must have been clear to everyone .
because china functions differently than western societies , it 's just not understood by the rest of the world . do you have sporting events sponsors or olympic sponsors as clients ? yes on both counts .
the latter we got relatively recently , which is why i can reconstruct things well .
it 's the case that most of the sponsors have n't given any thought to these things . what can your company do for them ?
how can you protect them ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese students rallied this week to express their pride in their country of course , to start with we were surprised that there was no concept and in many areas no thought had gone into things .
what we 're now doing is thinking about how you can show that sponsoring does n't just mean money to develop a brand , as is assumed , but also to try to participate in shaping societal change .
in concrete terms that means developing one 's own projects that are cross-nation , that take place with china , in which sensitive issues , like human rights , exposure to publicity , etc . , are addressed and in which the added value for a country like china is apparent .
the chinese do n't see any added value in developing an internet that is not controlled , why they should allow press freedom , why they should be transparent or why , for example , they could allow demonstrations as an articulation of free expression . what do you do if there are calls for boycotts of sponsors ? we have to determine what messages we want to send for the different situations that could arise .
say our sports clothes or our cars are n't being bought anymore .
here the company has to take a stand , and formulating the message is very difficult .
they remain between a rock and a hard place , which means that every word hangs in the balance .
every word is a tightrope walk .
on the one hand , they have to consider to what extent do i want to damage my future business in china , and on the other hand , i want to clarify my position to the rest of the world .
and that is very difficult . interview : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but child advocates said they do n't think it will do much good . in cases of child abuse and neglect , courts in germany previously had to show that parents were unfit .
this is often difficult to prove and , if verified , usually leads to the children being taken away and placed in foster care . according to a new law , approved by the german parliament on thursday , april 24 , courts can get involved earlier , before significant physical or emotional damage has been caused to the child and before the parents lose custody . the tragic deaths of several children in the past few months show that there are considerable deficits in the system , said justice minister brigitte zypries . " we want courts to be able to intervene earlier in the future , " said zypries . courts can order parents to get help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister brigitte zypries to intervene with preventative measures , authorities now have to show that the child 's well-being is endangered and that the parents can not or do not want to improve the situation . the new law allows courts to force parents to take certain steps that promote their child 's well-being : going to counseling , taking their child to the doctor , making their child go to school or attending a non-violence course . the courts should also make clear to the parents that they face consequences , which may include losing their child , if they do n't participate in the preventative programs . in addition , courts are now required to work more quickly when a child 's well-being is a stake , with the first court appointment to take place within one month of the case being filed . recommendations for many of the law 's measures were put together by an expert commission initiated by zypries in 2006 . criticism from child aid group bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new law aims to help troubled parents do a better job - but will it work ?
the german children 's aid group deutsche kinderhilfe called the new law " a drop in the bucket , " saying that there simply were n't enough judges to carry out the newly adopted measures and that most judges were n't trained as social workers . " the law is n't wrong , but the demands it places are completely exaggerated , " the group 's president heinz hilgers said in an interview with television broadcaster n24 . he added that he did n't think " the law would prevent a single case " like that of 5-year-old lea-sophie in schwerin who died of malnutrition in november 2007 after being neglected by her parents for months . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

two weeks later , the diaries were exposed as complete forgeries .
it had turned out that stern 's source in obtaining the alleged diaries was a con artist and petty thief named konrad kujau , who made a small fortune in fabricating and selling old nazi memorabilia . kujau found a taker for his forgeries in stern reporter gerd heidemann , and that 's where the disaster began , according to seufert .

" we editors were completely kept out of the loop , so all the normal checks and balances to authenticate stories were brushed aside , " said seufert , who confirmed that the publishing house had paid out 9.34 million dm -lrb- worth more than $ 4 million at the time -rrb- altogether to heidemann and kujau .
both had served over four years of prison time each on fraud charges , while stern 's two top editors had resigned . since most of the key players in the whole saga , including kujau , are either dead now or refuse to discuss the scandal publicly , corroborating seufert 's version of the events is difficult . however magnus linklater , who had been features editor of the sunday times of london , which had serial rights to publish extracts of the diaries in english , shared seufert 's frustrations at the time .

it says it will approach berlin in the next few days . news broke at the weekend that the bnd had read e-mail correspondence between der spiegel reporter susanne koelbl and an afghan politician between june and november 2006 , sparking outrage because of the breach of press freedom .
it only emerged on thursday -lrb- apr .
24 -rrb- that trade and industry minister amin farhang was the actual target of the operation .
no explanation has been given for why he was under scrutiny .
farhang , who lived in germany for a number of years , has told the german newspaper neue osnabruecker zeitung that his life was now at risk because the measure implied that he was co-operating with hostile forces .
" because of this absurd lie that i 'm some kind of double agent , my life and the lives of my family are in great danger , " he said .
" i could be shot on the street tomorrow , " he added .
kabul is " disappointed " about the spying revelations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bnd head faced a second day of questioning by a parliamentary committee kabul has declined to comment directly on the events , but afghan foreign minister rangeen dadfar spanta told the financial times deutschlan d -lrb- ftd -rrb- that his government would bring up the matter with berlin in the next few days .
the ftd reported that government sources spoke of " disappointment " about what had happened and the fact that neither the government or the bnd had been in contact with the targeted minister to apologize over the affair , or explain why the surveillance had been carried out in the first place .
but the foreign ministry in berlin said on friday -lrb- apr .
25 -rrb- that relations with kabul remained " close . "
spokesman martin jaeger said kabul had not made any official request for an explanation , nor had the german ambassador to kabul been summoned to discuss the issue .
on thursday , the chancellor 's office ordered disciplinary measures to be taken against three intelligence service members , including the chief-of-staff of bnd head , ernst uhrlau , as well as the head of the department responsible for the spying operation .
uhrlau , who faced a second of questioning thursday by a parliamentary oversight committee -lrb- pkg -rrb- , had faced calls for his resignation over the spy scandal .
but the pkg has stopped short of demanding he step down .
bnd chief 's head does not roll bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uhrlau apologized to journalist koelbl , but apparently not to the afghan minister the committee condemned the fact that uhrlau had not informed the government or parliamentarians about the monitoring of the der spiegel journalist , but that this activity did not mean that he should quit .
" the trust between the parliamentary committee and the leadership of the bnd is damaged , " committee chairman thomas oppermann -lrb- spd -rrb- said in a statement .
opposition members of parliament said the issue was not so much uhrlau 's position , but concern that the intelligence services were running out of control as a result of concerns on international terrorism .
max stadler , of the free democrats , said the bnd was in danger of becoming a " state within a state " .
as well as the diplomatic ramifications of this affair , the activities clearly breach germany 's basic law on press freedom .
german news weekly der spiegel announced on thursday that it was considering legal action .
" in view of this renewed serious breach of press freedom , der spiegel has decided to look at the legal and constitutional implications of this case , " it said .
the chairman of the association of german journalists -lrb- djv -rrb- , michael konken , accused the intelligence services of " developing a james bond mentality . " two years ago , the bnd admitted spying on journalists to discover their sources - but apologized calling it a one-off .
this week , another journalist who had worked in afghanistan said he was told that he was being bugged by a senior diplomat . dw staff -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it says it will approach berlin in the next few days . news broke at the weekend that the bnd had read e-mail correspondence between der spiegel reporter susanne koelbl and an afghan politician between june and november 2006 , sparking outrage because of the breach of press freedom .
it only emerged on thursday -lrb- apr .
24 -rrb- that trade and industry minister amin farhang was the actual target of the operation .
no explanation has been given for why he was under scrutiny .
farhang , who lived in germany for a number of years , has told the german newspaper neue osnabruecker zeitung that his life was now at risk because the measure implied that he was co-operating with hostile forces .
" because of this absurd lie that i 'm some kind of double agent , my life and the lives of my family are in great danger , " he said .
" i could be shot on the street tomorrow , " he added .
kabul is " disappointed " about the spying revelations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bnd head faced a second day of questioning by a parliamentary committee kabul has declined to comment directly on the events , but afghan foreign minister rangeen dadfar spanta told the financial times deutschlan d -lrb- ftd -rrb- that his government would bring up the matter with berlin in the next few days .
the ftd reported that government sources spoke of " disappointment " about what had happened and the fact that neither the government or the bnd had been in contact with the targeted minister to apologize over the affair , or explain why the surveillance had been carried out in the first place .
but the foreign ministry in berlin said on friday -lrb- apr .
25 -rrb- that relations with kabul remained " close . "
spokesman martin jaeger said kabul had not made any official request for an explanation , nor had the german ambassador to kabul been summoned to discuss the issue .
on thursday , the chancellor 's office ordered disciplinary measures to be taken against three intelligence service members , including the chief-of-staff of bnd head , ernst uhrlau , as well as the head of the department responsible for the spying operation .
uhrlau , who faced a second of questioning thursday by a parliamentary oversight committee -lrb- pkg -rrb- , had faced calls for his resignation over the spy scandal .

" the trust between the parliamentary committee and the leadership of the bnd is damaged , " committee chairman thomas oppermann -lrb- spd -rrb- said in a statement .
opposition members of parliament said the issue was not so much uhrlau 's position , but concern that the intelligence services were running out of control as a result of concerns on international terrorism .
max stadler , of the free democrats , said the bnd was in danger of becoming a " state within a state " .
as well as the diplomatic ramifications of this affair , the activities clearly breach germany 's basic law on press freedom .

the chairman of the association of german journalists -lrb- djv -rrb- , michael konken , accused the intelligence services of " developing a james bond mentality . " two years ago , the bnd admitted spying on journalists to discover their sources - but apologized calling it a one-off .

insiders illuminate the pitfalls of publishers influencing editorial policy . " all the ingredients for a programmed catastrophe were there from day one , " said michael seufert , author of the newly released book " the scandal surrounding the hitler diaries . " seufert was stern 's domestic editor on april 25 , 1983 when the weekly newsmagazine publicized its sensational scoop : 62 volumes of adolf hitler 's journal entries from 1932 to 1945 bound in black imitation leather had been unearthed . the fanfare over the stern exclusive was , however , short-lived .
two weeks later , the diaries were exposed as complete forgeries .
it had turned out that stern 's source in obtaining the alleged diaries was a con artist and petty thief named konrad kujau , who made a small fortune in fabricating and selling old nazi memorabilia . kujau found a taker for his forgeries in stern reporter gerd heidemann , and that 's where the disaster began , according to seufert . " heidemann had such a morbid fascination with nazi collectibles that he even wound up befriending war criminals and was ready to believe in anything , " seufert said . downfall of publisher meddling in editorial matters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stern billed the diaries as the scoop of the century if heidemann 's gullibility were the only issue , the fake hitler diaries would have never seen the light of day .
the downfall was that the top brass at stern 's publisher , gruener + jahr , had also been blind-sided and were so eager for an exclusive scoop that they not only forked over a colossal sum in cash to obtain the diaries , but had even guaranteed that only heidemann and one other editor could review its contents . the project was shrouded in secrecy in order to protect alleged sources in the former east germany dictatorship , according to seufert , who described the collusion of reporter and publisher with a counterfeiter and the cold war as a backdrop , as fatal . " we editors were completely kept out of the loop , so all the normal checks and balances to authenticate stories were brushed aside , " said seufert , who confirmed that the publishing house had paid out 9.34 million dm -lrb- worth more than $ 4 million at the time -rrb- altogether to heidemann and kujau .
both had served over four years of prison time each on fraud charges , while stern 's two top editors had resigned . since most of the key players in the whole saga , including kujau , are either dead now or refuse to discuss the scandal publicly , corroborating seufert 's version of the events is difficult . however magnus linklater , who had been features editor of the sunday times of london , which had serial rights to publish extracts of the diaries in english , shared seufert 's frustrations at the time .
linklater had smelled a rat when he read the material . " it didn ’ t sound right , " he said . purchased sight unseen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : handwriting experts had not been allowed to examine diaries " but the deal was that rupert murdoch , whose company owns the times , bought the diaries from stern , and the condition of purchase was that we were not allowed to conduct our own independent investigation , " linklater added .
" this was a clear case of the editorial and business side of newspapers clashing .
we had to take the pig in a poke so to say . " before publication , linklater did however talk to the eminent hitler historian hugh trevor-roper , who assured him the diaries were genuine . " his word was good enough for me , but it goes to show how gullible we can all be , " linklater said .
" the point is if you are offered a scoop , you can keep it secret , but that does n't mean you ca n't do internal checks . " as it turned out , the hitler documents were so technically flawed that forensic experts were able to easily determine that the paper , ink and glue that held the book bindings together were manufactured with post-war materials .
even hitler 's handwriting had not been subject to analysis . importance of internal checks and controls " you need outside experts to look at the handwriting or paper , so it is understandable that stern , which was so paranoid about secrecy , was afraid of leaks , " said gerhard weinberg , a world war ii historian , whom newsweek had hired as a consultant to examine the authenticity of the diaries .
" but what is unfathomable is why they did no internal checks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stern reporter gerd heidemann was obsessed by nazi collectibles , such as fake diaries weinberg pointed out that the diaries were full of mistakes that would have been recognized had stern allowed experts to examine even typed versions of the diaries . " someone in-house could have then read the diary and would have discovered things that were so preposterous that hitler couldn ’ t have possibly written them , " weinberg said .
" hitler , for instance , would never have gotten the color of his own uniform wrong . " hendrik zoerner , spokesman for the german journalists ' association -lrb- djv -rrb- said stern normally does subject its stories to internal control mechanisms .
the fake hitler diaries were an exceptional case of gross negligence that would never be repeated again by stern or any other media outlet , he said . " but we in the media will be making other kinds of mistakes that are less spectacular than what happened at stern , " zoerner said .
" nowadays journalists are under such time pressure that they spend less time doing sound research and fact-checking , so they wind up slipping up and making smaller mistakes on a daily basis . " zoerner added that mistakes , even big ones are inevitable , but responsible journalists need to own up to them . " stern admitted its mistakes and worked through its crisis in public , " he said .
" by doing so , it restored some credibility to its image . " diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but child advocates said they do n't think it will do much good . in cases of child abuse and neglect , courts in germany previously had to show that parents were unfit .
this is often difficult to prove and , if verified , usually leads to the children being taken away and placed in foster care . according to a new law , approved by the german parliament on thursday , april 24 , courts can get involved earlier , before significant physical or emotional damage has been caused to the child and before the parents lose custody . the tragic deaths of several children in the past few months show that there are considerable deficits in the system , said justice minister brigitte zypries . " we want courts to be able to intervene earlier in the future , " said zypries . courts can order parents to get help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister brigitte zypries to intervene with preventative measures , authorities now have to show that the child 's well-being is endangered and that the parents can not or do not want to improve the situation . the new law allows courts to force parents to take certain steps that promote their child 's well-being : going to counseling , taking their child to the doctor , making their child go to school or attending a non-violence course . the courts should also make clear to the parents that they face consequences , which may include losing their child , if they do n't participate in the preventative programs . in addition , courts are now required to work more quickly when a child 's well-being is a stake , with the first court appointment to take place within one month of the case being filed . recommendations for many of the law 's measures were put together by an expert commission initiated by zypries in 2006 . criticism from child aid group bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new law aims to help troubled parents do a better job - but will it work ?
the german children 's aid group deutsche kinderhilfe called the new law " a drop in the bucket , " saying that there simply were n't enough judges to carry out the newly adopted measures and that most judges were n't trained as social workers . " the law is n't wrong , but the demands it places are completely exaggerated , " the group 's president heinz hilgers said in an interview with television broadcaster n24 . he added that he did n't think " the law would prevent a single case " like that of 5-year-old lea-sophie in schwerin who died of malnutrition in november 2007 after being neglected by her parents for months . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children -pipe- 25.04.2008 new child protection law aimed at early intervention großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several recent deaths have alerted the state to child neglect and abuse courts can intervene sooner and more easily in cases of suspected child neglect , according to a new law passed by the german parliament .
but child advocates said they do n't think it will do much good . in cases of child abuse and neglect , courts in germany previously had to show that parents were unfit .
this is often difficult to prove and , if verified , usually leads to the children being taken away and placed in foster care . according to a new law , approved by the german parliament on thursday , april 24 , courts can get involved earlier , before significant physical or emotional damage has been caused to the child and before the parents lose custody . the tragic deaths of several children in the past few months show that there are considerable deficits in the system , said justice minister brigitte zypries . " we want courts to be able to intervene earlier in the future , " said zypries . courts can order parents to get help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister brigitte zypries to intervene with preventative measures , authorities now have to show that the child 's well-being is endangered and that the parents can not or do not want to improve the situation . the new law allows courts to force parents to take certain steps that promote their child 's well-being : going to counseling , taking their child to the doctor , making their child go to school or attending a non-violence course . the courts should also make clear to the parents that they face consequences , which may include losing their child , if they do n't participate in the preventative programs . in addition , courts are now required to work more quickly when a child 's well-being is a stake , with the first court appointment to take place within one month of the case being filed . recommendations for many of the law 's measures were put together by an expert commission initiated by zypries in 2006 . criticism from child aid group bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new law aims to help troubled parents do a better job - but will it work ?
the german children 's aid group deutsche kinderhilfe called the new law " a drop in the bucket , " saying that there simply were n't enough judges to carry out the newly adopted measures and that most judges were n't trained as social workers . " the law is n't wrong , but the demands it places are completely exaggerated , " the group 's president heinz hilgers said in an interview with television broadcaster n24 . he added that he did n't think " the law would prevent a single case " like that of 5-year-old lea-sophie in schwerin who died of malnutrition in november 2007 after being neglected by her parents for months . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

insiders illuminate the pitfalls of publishers influencing editorial policy . " all the ingredients for a programmed catastrophe were there from day one , " said michael seufert , author of the newly released book " the scandal surrounding the hitler diaries . " seufert was stern 's domestic editor on april 25 , 1983 when the weekly newsmagazine publicized its sensational scoop : 62 volumes of adolf hitler 's journal entries from 1932 to 1945 bound in black imitation leather had been unearthed . the fanfare over the stern exclusive was , however , short-lived .
two weeks later , the diaries were exposed as complete forgeries .
it had turned out that stern 's source in obtaining the alleged diaries was a con artist and petty thief named konrad kujau , who made a small fortune in fabricating and selling old nazi memorabilia . kujau found a taker for his forgeries in stern reporter gerd heidemann , and that 's where the disaster began , according to seufert . " heidemann had such a morbid fascination with nazi collectibles that he even wound up befriending war criminals and was ready to believe in anything , " seufert said . downfall of publisher meddling in editorial matters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stern billed the diaries as the scoop of the century if heidemann 's gullibility were the only issue , the fake hitler diaries would have never seen the light of day .
the downfall was that the top brass at stern 's publisher , gruener + jahr , had also been blind-sided and were so eager for an exclusive scoop that they not only forked over a colossal sum in cash to obtain the diaries , but had even guaranteed that only heidemann and one other editor could review its contents . the project was shrouded in secrecy in order to protect alleged sources in the former east germany dictatorship , according to seufert , who described the collusion of reporter and publisher with a counterfeiter and the cold war as a backdrop , as fatal . " we editors were completely kept out of the loop , so all the normal checks and balances to authenticate stories were brushed aside , " said seufert , who confirmed that the publishing house had paid out 9.34 million dm -lrb- worth more than $ 4 million at the time -rrb- altogether to heidemann and kujau .
both had served over four years of prison time each on fraud charges , while stern 's two top editors had resigned . since most of the key players in the whole saga , including kujau , are either dead now or refuse to discuss the scandal publicly , corroborating seufert 's version of the events is difficult . however magnus linklater , who had been features editor of the sunday times of london , which had serial rights to publish extracts of the diaries in english , shared seufert 's frustrations at the time .
linklater had smelled a rat when he read the material . " it didn ’ t sound right , " he said . purchased sight unseen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : handwriting experts had not been allowed to examine diaries " but the deal was that rupert murdoch , whose company owns the times , bought the diaries from stern , and the condition of purchase was that we were not allowed to conduct our own independent investigation , " linklater added .
" this was a clear case of the editorial and business side of newspapers clashing .
we had to take the pig in a poke so to say . " before publication , linklater did however talk to the eminent hitler historian hugh trevor-roper , who assured him the diaries were genuine . " his word was good enough for me , but it goes to show how gullible we can all be , " linklater said .
" the point is if you are offered a scoop , you can keep it secret , but that does n't mean you ca n't do internal checks . " as it turned out , the hitler documents were so technically flawed that forensic experts were able to easily determine that the paper , ink and glue that held the book bindings together were manufactured with post-war materials .
even hitler 's handwriting had not been subject to analysis . importance of internal checks and controls " you need outside experts to look at the handwriting or paper , so it is understandable that stern , which was so paranoid about secrecy , was afraid of leaks , " said gerhard weinberg , a world war ii historian , whom newsweek had hired as a consultant to examine the authenticity of the diaries .
" but what is unfathomable is why they did no internal checks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stern reporter gerd heidemann was obsessed by nazi collectibles , such as fake diaries weinberg pointed out that the diaries were full of mistakes that would have been recognized had stern allowed experts to examine even typed versions of the diaries . " someone in-house could have then read the diary and would have discovered things that were so preposterous that hitler couldn ’ t have possibly written them , " weinberg said .
" hitler , for instance , would never have gotten the color of his own uniform wrong . " hendrik zoerner , spokesman for the german journalists ' association -lrb- djv -rrb- said stern normally does subject its stories to internal control mechanisms .
the fake hitler diaries were an exceptional case of gross negligence that would never be repeated again by stern or any other media outlet , he said . " but we in the media will be making other kinds of mistakes that are less spectacular than what happened at stern , " zoerner said .
" nowadays journalists are under such time pressure that they spend less time doing sound research and fact-checking , so they wind up slipping up and making smaller mistakes on a daily basis . " zoerner added that mistakes , even big ones are inevitable , but responsible journalists need to own up to them . " stern admitted its mistakes and worked through its crisis in public , " he said .
" by doing so , it restored some credibility to its image . " diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de china -pipe- 25.04.2008 china , tibet commended by world powers for planned dialog großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is prepared to talk with representatives of the exiled dalai lama world powers on friday praised china 's decision to hold talks with representatives of exiled tibetan spiritual leader , the dalai lama , following the recent unrest in tibet . french president nicolas sarkozy hailed the move as a " major step . "
the united states welcomed the decision , saying it was " pleased " and germany and japan also heralded the new sign of movement toward easing tensions in tibet .
" it 's a major step .
the resumption of dialog carries some real hope , " sarkozy said in a statement , one day after declaring that he had been " shocked " by events in tibet where there has been a crackdown on anti-china protests .
" france was heavily mobilized to help bring about the conditions for a resumption of dialog between the chinese authorities and the dalai lama , " the president told reporters during a visit to monaco .
sarkozy 's diplomatic advisor , jean-david levitte , was in china friday for talks with top chinese officials , aimed at easing tensions over tibet and the beijing olympics .
the french president had previously indicated that he might stay away from the august 8 olympic games opening ceremony in beijing unless china opened talks with the dalai lama over the recent unrest .
" china and the representatives of the dalai lama are showing their desire to move towards a permanent solution that would allow tibetans to feel they can live out their cultural and spiritual identity within the people 's republic of china , " sarkozy said in the statement .
asked whether he would attend the ceremony , sarkozy replied : " i will make a decision based on how the dialog evolves . "
us , germany herald potential breakthrough in washington , the white house celebrated china 's announcement that it would hold talks with a " private representative " of the dalai lama .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush is one of those who have entertained the dalai lama " we are pleased to hear this , " us national security council spokesman gordon johndroe said , adding that president george w. bush applauded the efforts of both sides to find a solution and commended those involved in restarting the dialog .
" we welcome the news that the chinese authorities will engage with the dalai lama 's representatives . "
germany lauded the breakthrough and was also quick to highlight the importance of china 's move .
" we emphatically welcome this step , " foreign ministry spokesman martin jaeger told a news conference .
" we hope very much that this can contribute to resolving the conflict in tibet . "
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier had telephoned his chinese counterpart yang jiechi three times in recent weeks about the issue and pressed for talks , jaeger added .
praise also came friday from roland koch , the premier of the state of hesse , one of germany 's most prominent backers of the dalai lama .
he described the move as " an important and hopeful sign . "
" it shows that what is said by way of world public opinion is taken seriously by the chinese government , " he said .
michael vesper , director general of the german olympic sports association dosb , said , " this is exactly the right way to deal with this problem . "
a first important step bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso was encouraged by his talks on tibet in china european commission president jose manuel barroso , who is in beijing , said : " we are of course very happy with this announcement . "
his words were echoed by the slovenian eu presidency which issued a statement which acclaimed the chinese announcement .
in tokyo , japan 's foreign minister masahiko komura complimented china and tibet on the breakthrough and said the talks could be crucial first step to resolving the tension .
french activist robert menard , who has played a key role in worldwide protests on the beijing olympic torch relay over china 's action in tibet and its rights record , also said dialog was an important move in the right direction .
menard , founder of reporters without borders , plans to demonstrate at the relay saturday in the japanese mountain town of nagano but said he preferred dialog to demonstrations .
discussions could end olympic protests bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests may end depending on the outcome of talks " bravo , " said menard of china 's decision .
" no one 's going to interfere in china 's internal affairs .
if we finally get to that point and there 's dialog , i 'd be very pleased , " he told reporters in tokyo .
" if tomorrow there are serious decisions , we 'll stop .
we do n't want to demonstrate just for the sake of demonstrating . "
menard and two others disrupted the flame-lighting ceremony in greece by unfurling a protest banner , setting the stage for demonstrations throughout the torch relay .
china has come under intense foreign pressure to hold talks with the dalai lama since rioting erupted in the regional capital lhasa last month , spreading to other areas populated by tibetans .
beijing 's crackdown in the himalayan region , as well as its human rights record , have triggered protests that have dogged the olympic torch as it travels the world before the games in august .
exiled tibetan leaders say the chinese crackdown last month left more than 150 people dead .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de olympics -pipe- 25.04.2008 olympic sponsors between a rock and a hard place großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : torn between the west and china , olympic sponsors , like adidas , are having a tough time the beijing olympics sponsors need to find ways to prevent international outrage over the situation in tibet from morphing into a backlash against them .
dw-world.de spoke to one of their advisors about what can be done . international outrage has been simmering since the chinese crackdown on protests in tibet in march , in which an unknown number of people were jailed or even killed .
in the meantime , there have been calls for a boycott of the games , politicians and athletes have said they would not take part in the opening ceremonies , and the city of paris this week named the dalai lama an honorary citizen . china has responded with anger and many chinese have started to boycott french companies .
hundreds of anti-china demonstrators took to the streets in europe last week to protest against china 's approach to tibet , as thousands of chinese marched in counter-demonstrations in berlin , london and paris .
the controversy is unlikely to die down until well after the beijing olympics , which run from august 8-24 , are over .
it 's a tough time for olympic sponsors , such as coca-cola , volkswagen or adidas . dw-world discussed their difficulties with thorsten hofmann , the ceo of prsg , a berlin-based consultancy for political and crisis management .
the company recently acquired an olympic sponsor as a client . dw-world.de : an old adage says " all publicity is good publicity . "
at what point does the damage make it not worthwhile for a sponsor ? thorsten hofmann : starting with " all publicity is good publicity : " that 's a dangerous statement , because when you 're in a crisis situation , you have the greatest amount of attention a firm could ever want , but unfortunately not in the context you would want it , and that , of course , is the most important thing .
if you want publicity , you generally want it in a nice , harmonious context with a positive image transfer .
in our concrete example , the olympic games , everyone who positioned themselves as sponsors - and invested somewhere between 50 and 100 million euros -lrb- $ 80 to $ 160 million -rrb- - wants to take the olympics ' positive image and create a brand transfer .
adidas as a sports brand wants to participate , vw wants to profit from the dynamics of the games , and above all , everything should be nice and harmonious .
and now for the big dilemma : if the olympics do n't go off as they could , but rather if - as is now the case - there 's a disregard for human rights , violent attacks , attacks on the torch bearers and disturbances of a political nature , then naturally this image transfer also rubs off on the sponsors .
it 's no longer so nice and smooth , and at some point as a sponsor you will be asked what your own position is .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights activists have been vocal in their criticism of china that is , what was originally planned - we participate in a collective sports competition , the olympics , and appear prominently as a main sponsor - can turn into the opposite .
for when a state in which the olympic games take place , like china , presents itself to the world as riding roughshod over human rights - that 's the outside perception - then the world asks itself , " what do the sponsors think of this ?
do human rights not matter to them ?
do they put the value of money above human rights ? "
that 's the negative side of the image transfer . a similar case is that of t-mobile and others companies sponsoring cycling in germany . it is definitely similar .
the cycling sponsors have always profited from the sporting image and the high spectator numbers of , for example , the tour de france .
now , because of all the doping cases , cycling has become dirty , and this dirtiness at some point rubs off on a brand .
accordingly , ever more sponsors are pulling out .
there are cases in the context of sporting events which are absolutely negative for the sponsors ' image , for the sponsors ' brands , and we , as sponsors , have to decide : " what do i do ? " .
with cycling , sponsors tried at the beginning of the doping crisis to introduce responsibility into the equation , to say i 'll create my own guidelines , anyone who takes drugs will be kicked out , i want to fight for clean cycling .
but at some point it became clear that the fight was futile , and sponsors said the recurring negative news is affecting my brand negatively , and at some point i pull out .
that 's what happened . with the olympics , at what point should sponsors pull out ?
when has it gone too far ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been protests in china against french companies that 's a super hard question , because you have to see it in the context of a giant market .
china is the market of the future - i think we all agree on that - and that 's why they all have put their energies and their sponsoring budgets into the olympics .
in addition , you have to take into account that china has an entirely different culture from our western culture .
that means , if i start to talk at the chinese about their culture and to publicly question the things they do , they lose face .
losing face is an affront in china , and you can be sure that as a consequence your company will have a big problem gaining a foothold there . but on the other hand , if you carry on with sponsoring and incidents occur at the olympics - from violent attacks on demonstrators to deaths - then the companies from outside must be prepared for the rest of the world to ask : " how far does the so-called kowtow to the communist dictatorship go ? "
for the companies , the question also arises : " how important are human rights to me and how important is money ? "
that 's the predicament the companies currently find themselves in .
they are caught between a rock and a hard place . but getting back to the question .
when should they pull out ?
it becomes very , very critical when there are deaths .
if there is suddenly fighting , or in the worst case - as has happened before in china - there 's shooting , demonstrators are killed with the world watching , then the company has to carefully consider , " how are my opportunities in this market , what should i do now , and how do my other markets judge my behavior ? "
it 's always an individual decision , that has to be made according to the situation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the torch relay went undisturbed in india ; protesters could n't get near it if i decide i 'm interested in a sponsoring contract - and am prepared to spend 50 to 100 million euros or more - why do n't i put some thought into a prevention plan ?
that is , i know china , and i 'm familiar with all of its sources of conflict , i 'm also familiar with the conflict situation with tibet , the issues of human rights , poverty , child labor and so on .
why have i not yet given some thought to how i could react to accusations of this nature ?
the classic tool is crisis prevention work , and it could have had an effect here .
and i think , actually , i know that that is the current situation the companies face .
they are literally surprised by a matter of course . one would assume they would have prepared for such an eventuality ? exactly , you 're absolutely right .
if i 'm prepared to become a sponsor , to spruce up my brand , then i also have to develop my protective shield so my brand is n't damaged .
and this shield is preventive work , crisis prevention .
at the moment i have the impression that everyone is surprised by what is happening .
that something could have happened , must have been clear to everyone .
because china functions differently than western societies , it 's just not understood by the rest of the world . do you have sporting events sponsors or olympic sponsors as clients ? yes on both counts .
the latter we got relatively recently , which is why i can reconstruct things well .
it 's the case that most of the sponsors have n't given any thought to these things . what can your company do for them ?
how can you protect them ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese students rallied this week to express their pride in their country of course , to start with we were surprised that there was no concept and in many areas no thought had gone into things .
what we 're now doing is thinking about how you can show that sponsoring does n't just mean money to develop a brand , as is assumed , but also to try to participate in shaping societal change .
in concrete terms that means developing one 's own projects that are cross-nation , that take place with china , in which sensitive issues , like human rights , exposure to publicity , etc . , are addressed and in which the added value for a country like china is apparent .
the chinese do n't see any added value in developing an internet that is not controlled , why they should allow press freedom , why they should be transparent or why , for example , they could allow demonstrations as an articulation of free expression . what do you do if there are calls for boycotts of sponsors ? we have to determine what messages we want to send for the different situations that could arise .
say our sports clothes or our cars are n't being bought anymore .
here the company has to take a stand , and formulating the message is very difficult .
they remain between a rock and a hard place , which means that every word hangs in the balance .
every word is a tightrope walk .
on the one hand , they have to consider to what extent do i want to damage my future business in china , and on the other hand , i want to clarify my position to the rest of the world .
and that is very difficult . interview : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke to one of their advisors about what can be done . international outrage has been simmering since the chinese crackdown on protests in tibet in march , in which an unknown number of people were jailed or even killed .
in the meantime , there have been calls for a boycott of the games , politicians and athletes have said they would not take part in the opening ceremonies , and the city of paris this week named the dalai lama an honorary citizen . china has responded with anger and many chinese have started to boycott french companies .
hundreds of anti-china demonstrators took to the streets in europe last week to protest against china 's approach to tibet , as thousands of chinese marched in counter-demonstrations in berlin , london and paris .
the controversy is unlikely to die down until well after the beijing olympics , which run from august 8-24 , are over .
it 's a tough time for olympic sponsors , such as coca-cola , volkswagen or adidas . dw-world discussed their difficulties with thorsten hofmann , the ceo of prsg , a berlin-based consultancy for political and crisis management .
the company recently acquired an olympic sponsor as a client . dw-world.de : an old adage says " all publicity is good publicity . "
at what point does the damage make it not worthwhile for a sponsor ? thorsten hofmann : starting with " all publicity is good publicity : " that 's a dangerous statement , because when you 're in a crisis situation , you have the greatest amount of attention a firm could ever want , but unfortunately not in the context you would want it , and that , of course , is the most important thing .
if you want publicity , you generally want it in a nice , harmonious context with a positive image transfer .
in our concrete example , the olympic games , everyone who positioned themselves as sponsors - and invested somewhere between 50 and 100 million euros -lrb- $ 80 to $ 160 million -rrb- - wants to take the olympics ' positive image and create a brand transfer .
adidas as a sports brand wants to participate , vw wants to profit from the dynamics of the games , and above all , everything should be nice and harmonious .
and now for the big dilemma : if the olympics do n't go off as they could , but rather if - as is now the case - there 's a disregard for human rights , violent attacks , attacks on the torch bearers and disturbances of a political nature , then naturally this image transfer also rubs off on the sponsors .
it 's no longer so nice and smooth , and at some point as a sponsor you will be asked what your own position is .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : human rights activists have been vocal in their criticism of china that is , what was originally planned - we participate in a collective sports competition , the olympics , and appear prominently as a main sponsor - can turn into the opposite .
for when a state in which the olympic games take place , like china , presents itself to the world as riding roughshod over human rights - that 's the outside perception - then the world asks itself , " what do the sponsors think of this ?
do human rights not matter to them ?
do they put the value of money above human rights ? "
that 's the negative side of the image transfer . a similar case is that of t-mobile and others companies sponsoring cycling in germany . it is definitely similar .
the cycling sponsors have always profited from the sporting image and the high spectator numbers of , for example , the tour de france .
now , because of all the doping cases , cycling has become dirty , and this dirtiness at some point rubs off on a brand .
accordingly , ever more sponsors are pulling out .
there are cases in the context of sporting events which are absolutely negative for the sponsors ' image , for the sponsors ' brands , and we , as sponsors , have to decide : " what do i do ? " .
with cycling , sponsors tried at the beginning of the doping crisis to introduce responsibility into the equation , to say i 'll create my own guidelines , anyone who takes drugs will be kicked out , i want to fight for clean cycling .
but at some point it became clear that the fight was futile , and sponsors said the recurring negative news is affecting my brand negatively , and at some point i pull out .
that 's what happened . with the olympics , at what point should sponsors pull out ?
when has it gone too far ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been protests in china against french companies that 's a super hard question , because you have to see it in the context of a giant market .
china is the market of the future - i think we all agree on that - and that 's why they all have put their energies and their sponsoring budgets into the olympics .
in addition , you have to take into account that china has an entirely different culture from our western culture .
that means , if i start to talk at the chinese about their culture and to publicly question the things they do , they lose face .
losing face is an affront in china , and you can be sure that as a consequence your company will have a big problem gaining a foothold there . but on the other hand , if you carry on with sponsoring and incidents occur at the olympics - from violent attacks on demonstrators to deaths - then the companies from outside must be prepared for the rest of the world to ask : " how far does the so-called kowtow to the communist dictatorship go ? "
for the companies , the question also arises : " how important are human rights to me and how important is money ? "
that 's the predicament the companies currently find themselves in .
they are caught between a rock and a hard place . but getting back to the question .
when should they pull out ?
it becomes very , very critical when there are deaths .
if there is suddenly fighting , or in the worst case - as has happened before in china - there 's shooting , demonstrators are killed with the world watching , then the company has to carefully consider , " how are my opportunities in this market , what should i do now , and how do my other markets judge my behavior ? "
it 's always an individual decision , that has to be made according to the situation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the torch relay went undisturbed in india ; protesters could n't get near it if i decide i 'm interested in a sponsoring contract - and am prepared to spend 50 to 100 million euros or more - why do n't i put some thought into a prevention plan ?
that is , i know china , and i 'm familiar with all of its sources of conflict , i 'm also familiar with the conflict situation with tibet , the issues of human rights , poverty , child labor and so on .
why have i not yet given some thought to how i could react to accusations of this nature ?
the classic tool is crisis prevention work , and it could have had an effect here .
and i think , actually , i know that that is the current situation the companies face .
they are literally surprised by a matter of course . one would assume they would have prepared for such an eventuality ? exactly , you 're absolutely right .
if i 'm prepared to become a sponsor , to spruce up my brand , then i also have to develop my protective shield so my brand is n't damaged .
and this shield is preventive work , crisis prevention .
at the moment i have the impression that everyone is surprised by what is happening .
that something could have happened , must have been clear to everyone .
because china functions differently than western societies , it 's just not understood by the rest of the world . do you have sporting events sponsors or olympic sponsors as clients ? yes on both counts .
the latter we got relatively recently , which is why i can reconstruct things well .
it 's the case that most of the sponsors have n't given any thought to these things . what can your company do for them ?
how can you protect them ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese students rallied this week to express their pride in their country of course , to start with we were surprised that there was no concept and in many areas no thought had gone into things .

do they put the value of money above human rights ? "
that 's the negative side of the image transfer . a similar case is that of t-mobile and others companies sponsoring cycling in germany . it is definitely similar .
the cycling sponsors have always profited from the sporting image and the high spectator numbers of , for example , the tour de france .
now , because of all the doping cases , cycling has become dirty , and this dirtiness at some point rubs off on a brand .
accordingly , ever more sponsors are pulling out .
there are cases in the context of sporting events which are absolutely negative for the sponsors ' image , for the sponsors ' brands , and we , as sponsors , have to decide : " what do i do ? " .
with cycling , sponsors tried at the beginning of the doping crisis to introduce responsibility into the equation , to say i 'll create my own guidelines , anyone who takes drugs will be kicked out , i want to fight for clean cycling .
but at some point it became clear that the fight was futile , and sponsors said the recurring negative news is affecting my brand negatively , and at some point i pull out .
that 's what happened . with the olympics , at what point should sponsors pull out ?
when has it gone too far ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been protests in china against french companies that 's a super hard question , because you have to see it in the context of a giant market .
china is the market of the future - i think we all agree on that - and that 's why they all have put their energies and their sponsoring budgets into the olympics .
in addition , you have to take into account that china has an entirely different culture from our western culture .
that means , if i start to talk at the chinese about their culture and to publicly question the things they do , they lose face .
losing face is an affront in china , and you can be sure that as a consequence your company will have a big problem gaining a foothold there . but on the other hand , if you carry on with sponsoring and incidents occur at the olympics - from violent attacks on demonstrators to deaths - then the companies from outside must be prepared for the rest of the world to ask : " how far does the so-called kowtow to the communist dictatorship go ? "
for the companies , the question also arises : " how important are human rights to me and how important is money ? "
that 's the predicament the companies currently find themselves in .
they are caught between a rock and a hard place . but getting back to the question .
when should they pull out ?
it becomes very , very critical when there are deaths .
if there is suddenly fighting , or in the worst case - as has happened before in china - there 's shooting , demonstrators are killed with the world watching , then the company has to carefully consider , " how are my opportunities in this market , what should i do now , and how do my other markets judge my behavior ? "
it 's always an individual decision , that has to be made according to the situation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the torch relay went undisturbed in india ; protesters could n't get near it if i decide i 'm interested in a sponsoring contract - and am prepared to spend 50 to 100 million euros or more - why do n't i put some thought into a prevention plan ?
that is , i know china , and i 'm familiar with all of its sources of conflict , i 'm also familiar with the conflict situation with tibet , the issues of human rights , poverty , child labor and so on .
why have i not yet given some thought to how i could react to accusations of this nature ?
the classic tool is crisis prevention work , and it could have had an effect here .
and i think , actually , i know that that is the current situation the companies face .
they are literally surprised by a matter of course . one would assume they would have prepared for such an eventuality ? exactly , you 're absolutely right .
if i 'm prepared to become a sponsor , to spruce up my brand , then i also have to develop my protective shield so my brand is n't damaged .
and this shield is preventive work , crisis prevention .
at the moment i have the impression that everyone is surprised by what is happening .
that something could have happened , must have been clear to everyone .
because china functions differently than western societies , it 's just not understood by the rest of the world . do you have sporting events sponsors or olympic sponsors as clients ? yes on both counts .
the latter we got relatively recently , which is why i can reconstruct things well .
it 's the case that most of the sponsors have n't given any thought to these things . what can your company do for them ?
how can you protect them ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese students rallied this week to express their pride in their country of course , to start with we were surprised that there was no concept and in many areas no thought had gone into things .
what we 're now doing is thinking about how you can show that sponsoring does n't just mean money to develop a brand , as is assumed , but also to try to participate in shaping societal change .
in concrete terms that means developing one 's own projects that are cross-nation , that take place with china , in which sensitive issues , like human rights , exposure to publicity , etc . , are addressed and in which the added value for a country like china is apparent .
the chinese do n't see any added value in developing an internet that is not controlled , why they should allow press freedom , why they should be transparent or why , for example , they could allow demonstrations as an articulation of free expression . what do you do if there are calls for boycotts of sponsors ? we have to determine what messages we want to send for the different situations that could arise .
say our sports clothes or our cars are n't being bought anymore .
here the company has to take a stand , and formulating the message is very difficult .
they remain between a rock and a hard place , which means that every word hangs in the balance .
every word is a tightrope walk .
on the one hand , they have to consider to what extent do i want to damage my future business in china , and on the other hand , i want to clarify my position to the rest of the world .
and that is very difficult . interview : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" " france and germany have until now remained deaf to the suffering of these innocent victims of a conflict that they did not know , " he said on thursday , april 24 . " i speak of the children of war , those who were damned in france as the offspring of the boches , " he said , using a pejorative term for germans , by which many of the children became known . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the popularity of marshall petain 's pro-german vichy government became taboo in post-war france , many of these children were treated as a personification of the german enemy and were abandoned by their mothers , spurned by their families and ostracized by society . kouchner stressed that the identity of these children - born of war and suffering , of love and hatred - mirrored the identity of europe itself . for decades , the existence of these children remained taboo in france - tangible proof that french resistance to the german occupation was not as widespread as many wanted to believe .
jean-paul picaper spent 10 years trying to find a publisher for his book , " enfants maudits " -lrb- cursed children -rrb- , which finally appeared in both germany and france in 2004 . in germany , too , very little was done to acknowledge this particular war legacy . " it should have set up a fund for them , " picaper said .
" they should have been given help in finding their fathers . " symbolic recognition for their dual origins bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the freeze in franco-german relations began to ease in 1963 , but not all problems were solved in calling for recognition of these children , kouchner said that not all of these children wanted dual nationality .
but he said that most wanted a " symbolic gesture . " the french minister said he would like historians , archivists , lawyers , philosophers and others from both countries to work together examine what shape this could take . " i am far from waking up the ghosts of the past , " he said , but " no person in france or germany should have to hide his origins on the grounds that they lie on the other side of the rhine .

but child advocates said they do n't think it will do much good . in cases of child abuse and neglect , courts in germany previously had to show that parents were unfit .
this is often difficult to prove and , if verified , usually leads to the children being taken away and placed in foster care . according to a new law , approved by the german parliament on thursday , april 24 , courts can get involved earlier , before significant physical or emotional damage has been caused to the child and before the parents lose custody . the tragic deaths of several children in the past few months show that there are considerable deficits in the system , said justice minister brigitte zypries . " we want courts to be able to intervene earlier in the future , " said zypries . courts can order parents to get help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : justice minister brigitte zypries to intervene with preventative measures , authorities now have to show that the child 's well-being is endangered and that the parents can not or do not want to improve the situation . the new law allows courts to force parents to take certain steps that promote their child 's well-being : going to counseling , taking their child to the doctor , making their child go to school or attending a non-violence course . the courts should also make clear to the parents that they face consequences , which may include losing their child , if they do n't participate in the preventative programs . in addition , courts are now required to work more quickly when a child 's well-being is a stake , with the first court appointment to take place within one month of the case being filed . recommendations for many of the law 's measures were put together by an expert commission initiated by zypries in 2006 . criticism from child aid group bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new law aims to help troubled parents do a better job - but will it work ?
the german children 's aid group deutsche kinderhilfe called the new law " a drop in the bucket , " saying that there simply were n't enough judges to carry out the newly adopted measures and that most judges were n't trained as social workers . " the law is n't wrong , but the demands it places are completely exaggerated , " the group 's president heinz hilgers said in an interview with television broadcaster n24 . he added that he did n't think " the law would prevent a single case " like that of 5-year-old lea-sophie in schwerin who died of malnutrition in november 2007 after being neglected by her parents for months . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 25.04.2008 impact of the fake hitler diaries press scandal 25 years later großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : konrad kujau 's forgeries were technically and historically flawed " stern " magazine 's discovery of the hitler diaries a quarter-century ago was a media sensation - and a spectacular hoax .
insiders illuminate the pitfalls of publishers influencing editorial policy . " all the ingredients for a programmed catastrophe were there from day one , " said michael seufert , author of the newly released book " the scandal surrounding the hitler diaries . " seufert was stern 's domestic editor on april 25 , 1983 when the weekly newsmagazine publicized its sensational scoop : 62 volumes of adolf hitler 's journal entries from 1932 to 1945 bound in black imitation leather had been unearthed . the fanfare over the stern exclusive was , however , short-lived .
two weeks later , the diaries were exposed as complete forgeries .
it had turned out that stern 's source in obtaining the alleged diaries was a con artist and petty thief named konrad kujau , who made a small fortune in fabricating and selling old nazi memorabilia . kujau found a taker for his forgeries in stern reporter gerd heidemann , and that 's where the disaster began , according to seufert . " heidemann had such a morbid fascination with nazi collectibles that he even wound up befriending war criminals and was ready to believe in anything , " seufert said . downfall of publisher meddling in editorial matters bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stern billed the diaries as the scoop of the century if heidemann 's gullibility were the only issue , the fake hitler diaries would have never seen the light of day .
the downfall was that the top brass at stern 's publisher , gruener + jahr , had also been blind-sided and were so eager for an exclusive scoop that they not only forked over a colossal sum in cash to obtain the diaries , but had even guaranteed that only heidemann and one other editor could review its contents . the project was shrouded in secrecy in order to protect alleged sources in the former east germany dictatorship , according to seufert , who described the collusion of reporter and publisher with a counterfeiter and the cold war as a backdrop , as fatal . " we editors were completely kept out of the loop , so all the normal checks and balances to authenticate stories were brushed aside , " said seufert , who confirmed that the publishing house had paid out 9.34 million dm -lrb- worth more than $ 4 million at the time -rrb- altogether to heidemann and kujau .
both had served over four years of prison time each on fraud charges , while stern 's two top editors had resigned . since most of the key players in the whole saga , including kujau , are either dead now or refuse to discuss the scandal publicly , corroborating seufert 's version of the events is difficult . however magnus linklater , who had been features editor of the sunday times of london , which had serial rights to publish extracts of the diaries in english , shared seufert 's frustrations at the time .
linklater had smelled a rat when he read the material . " it didn ’ t sound right , " he said . purchased sight unseen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : handwriting experts had not been allowed to examine diaries " but the deal was that rupert murdoch , whose company owns the times , bought the diaries from stern , and the condition of purchase was that we were not allowed to conduct our own independent investigation , " linklater added .
" this was a clear case of the editorial and business side of newspapers clashing .
we had to take the pig in a poke so to say . " before publication , linklater did however talk to the eminent hitler historian hugh trevor-roper , who assured him the diaries were genuine . " his word was good enough for me , but it goes to show how gullible we can all be , " linklater said .
" the point is if you are offered a scoop , you can keep it secret , but that does n't mean you ca n't do internal checks . " as it turned out , the hitler documents were so technically flawed that forensic experts were able to easily determine that the paper , ink and glue that held the book bindings together were manufactured with post-war materials .
even hitler 's handwriting had not been subject to analysis . importance of internal checks and controls " you need outside experts to look at the handwriting or paper , so it is understandable that stern , which was so paranoid about secrecy , was afraid of leaks , " said gerhard weinberg , a world war ii historian , whom newsweek had hired as a consultant to examine the authenticity of the diaries .
" but what is unfathomable is why they did no internal checks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stern reporter gerd heidemann was obsessed by nazi collectibles , such as fake diaries weinberg pointed out that the diaries were full of mistakes that would have been recognized had stern allowed experts to examine even typed versions of the diaries . " someone in-house could have then read the diary and would have discovered things that were so preposterous that hitler couldn ’ t have possibly written them , " weinberg said .
" hitler , for instance , would never have gotten the color of his own uniform wrong . " hendrik zoerner , spokesman for the german journalists ' association -lrb- djv -rrb- said stern normally does subject its stories to internal control mechanisms .
the fake hitler diaries were an exceptional case of gross negligence that would never be repeated again by stern or any other media outlet , he said . " but we in the media will be making other kinds of mistakes that are less spectacular than what happened at stern , " zoerner said .
" nowadays journalists are under such time pressure that they spend less time doing sound research and fact-checking , so they wind up slipping up and making smaller mistakes on a daily basis . " zoerner added that mistakes , even big ones are inevitable , but responsible journalists need to own up to them . " stern admitted its mistakes and worked through its crisis in public , " he said .
" by doing so , it restored some credibility to its image . " diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

annotated versions of other texts by hitler and other nazi leaders are in print , however . hitler considered himself a writer and composed all his speeches himself , said wehler , adding that it can reasonably be presumed that the nazi leader wrote most of " mein kampf " himself as well . " since he had a terribly ruinous effect on world history , these parts should be kept in a critical edition , " the historian said . copyright expires soon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler wrote his own speeches the copyright for " mein kampf " expires 70 years after hitler 's death , in 2015 .
some , including the board of trustees at the nuremberg documentation center have said that publishing an annotated copy now could help prevent neo-nazis from taking advantage of the lifting of the copyright and misusing the text for propaganda purposes . wehler , however , said he did n't think right-wing radicals would be very interested in the text .
" every skinhead is one too many , but there 's not a very passionate hitler readership in this country , " he said . the annotated edition would mainly be sold to universities , libraries and academic institutions . the documentation center 's board of trustees said it has already taken its request for the publication to bavaria 's prime minister guenter beckstein , since the state 's finance ministry was granted possession of the copyright by the allied forces after world war ii . the munich institute of contemporary history would likely be commissioned to publish the volume , which could take several years to complete . jewish leader in favour of publication a top figure in germany 's jewish community said friday he wants hitler 's book to be republished , but together with an accompanying commentary . " in principle i am in favor of the book being made public with a commentary , " both in normal book form and on the internet , stephan kramer , general secretary of the central council of jews , told deutschlandfunk radio . kramer said the central council of jews was ready to help write the commentary . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

developers at llanelli , including rugby stars dwayne peel and stephen jones , who have plans for a restaurant , have been told it will take two years .
there are concerns about sewerage entering the sea after heavy rain as the existing system is near capacity .
llanelli waterside is a 100-acre regeneration scheme with plans for a luxury hotel , offices and homes .
carmarthenshire council 's planning committee was told construction could continue but developments could only be occupied once the upgrade is completed . "
the authority has recognised concerns expressed in terms of the water quality in the burry port inlet " carmarthenshire council a joint project between the council and welsh assembly government , it aims to create up to 1,500 new jobs , provide 1,000 new homes , 340,000 sq ft of business and office space and 180,000 sq ft of leisure development .
welsh water told the council improvement works to a sewage pumping station and the town 's treatment works are due to begin next month and are scheduled for completion in march 2010 .
ryder cup bendigo 9-10 , a company backed by grand slam winners jones and peel , has been granted planning permission to transform the grade ii listed pump house at north dock into a restaurant .
but a condition was imposed that meant it could not open for business until after the upgrade .
at the same meeting a similar condition was imposed on a new large office block approved for land at nearby delta lakes , to be built by wrw .
a planning application is expected shortly from a hotel chain looking to develop a site near machynys golf course in time for the wales 2010 ryder cup , which will be held further east , in newport .
a council spokeswoman said : " carmarthenshire council has approved a number of developments in the south llanelli area , which is a clear indication that the authority 's regeneration strategy is effective .
" however , the authority has recognised concerns expressed in terms of the water quality in the burry port inlet , including conditions recommended by the environment agency and dwr cymru -lsb- welsh water -rsb- .
" these conditions prevent the beneficial use of any buildings until march 2010 , which is the date dwr cymru has scheduled for completion of the improvements at the treatment works .
" construction of the buildings can commence in the interim period . "
welsh water said studies showed the need for remedial work which is due to begin in may , and further investigations into the network were continuing .
a spokesman for environment agency wales said while the network was able to cope with the waste from existing businesses and households there was a capacity problem which meant at times of heavy rainfall diluted sewerage had been washed into the estuary .
he said the agency had asked the council not to allow any development that would add to the problem and the conditions imposed " seemed sensible " in the circumstances .

a planning application is expected shortly from a hotel chain looking to develop a site near machynys golf course in time for the wales 2010 ryder cup , which will be held further east , in newport .
rugby stars stephen jones and dwayne peel have united in business a council spokeswoman said : " carmarthenshire council has approved a number of developments in the south llanelli area , which is a clear indication that the authority 's regeneration strategy is effective .
" however , the authority has recognised concerns expressed in terms of the water quality in the burry port inlet , including conditions recommended by the environment agency and dwr cymru -lsb- welsh water -rsb- .
" these conditions prevent the beneficial use of any buildings until march 2010 , which is the date dwr cymru has scheduled for completion of the improvements at the treatment works .
" construction of the buildings can commence in the interim period . "
welsh water said studies showed the need for remedial work which is due to begin in may , and further investigations into the network were continuing .
a spokesman for environment agency wales said while the network was able to cope with the waste from existing businesses and households there was a capacity problem which meant at times of heavy rainfall diluted sewerage had been washed into the estuary .
he said the agency had asked the council not to allow any development that would add to the problem and the conditions imposed " seemed sensible " in the circumstances .

it did n't matter whether you were protestant , catholic , whether you had green , orange or purple hair , as long as you were punk it was fine terri hooley " in those days , there was a ring of steel around the city , " he said .
" the only people you saw in the city centre at night apart from the police and army , were the punks going down to the harp bar .
" the great thing about punk was it was the first time in 10 years that the kids could get together .
" it did n't matter whether you were protestant , catholic , whether you had green , orange or purple hair , as long as you were punk it was fine . "

" good friday , april 10th 1998 , the day that the parties in northern ireland agreed to a plan to end 30 years of sectarian violence , was one of the happiest days of my presidency , " he said .
bono performed at a belfast concert after the good friday agreement " while i am proud of my contribution in bringing about the agreement , i know that no government policy can truly succeed without the grassroots efforts of the people those policies would effect . "
mr clinton said good vibrations had " helped individual musicians realise their dreams , but also offered listeners the opportunity to better understand and appreciate one another through the common language of music " .
mr hooley said he was impressed by mr clinton 's tribute , which came ahead of a special concert on friday night .
" he is a musician as well - that 's what 's most important to me .

her family was told she could not understand anything going on around her and would die within a few weeks .
but her husband colin , who lives in harlow , essex , was convinced she was aware and was not in a vegetative state .
thanks to colin 's campaign , christine now gets specialist care at a centre in hertfordshire and can communicate " yes " or " no " answers by moving her eyes up or down .
he believes there are hundreds or even thousands of such patients who have been wrongly diagnosed but claims he has met resistance from the medical community .
" it 's now become an inconvenient truth that people in christine 's condition are aware and understand , " he says .
his views are being backed by pioneering research from a team in cambridge .
the team , led by dr adrian owen and dr martin coleman , have made breakthroughs in finding ways to communicate with people misdiagnosed as being in a vegetative condition using mri scans .
neuroscientist dr owen was one of the first in the uk to suspect that some people diagnosed as being in a vegetative state could be aware of their surroundings .
scientist dr adrian owen showed bbc 's colleen harris scans of her brain he recalls an early breakthrough case .
" i scanned a patient from addenbrooke 's hospital who was apparently vegetative , " he says .
" we showed her pictures of her family and friends and we saw activation in the area of the brain that we know responds to faces .
" when we first saw that this patient was actually consciously aware i was absolutely gobsmacked . "
what he had discovered was that while some patients described as vegetative were unable to express themselves through movement , their brain patterns showed awareness of their surroundings .
since then the team has come up with a way to communicate with patients by asking them to imagine playing tennis using their upper arm movements which activates one part of the brain .
or they will be asked to imagine walking around a house which can activate another part .
the team hope this technique will prevent misdiagnosis of patients as vegetative and also allow rudimentary communication with people who are not even able to move their eyes to indicate a " yes " or a " no " .
" it shows us that brain imaging can provide something in addition to clinical or bedside evaluation .
" in this case it told us that a patient that looked vegetative clinically was in fact entirely aware , " says dr owen .
" it 's important to stress that this will be a minority of patients , it does n't mean that all vegetative patients are aware but it does mean that we are now able to detect those that are . "
parts of the brain activate when people think of playing tennis he adds : " one obvious application of this research is that in future we may be able to adapt the brain imaging techniques to provide a rather rudimentary form of communication in patients that are n't able to communicate in any other way . "
mr simpson , who looks after his wife every day , says : " people such as christine need to be able to communicate their wishes , their understandings and their feelings .
" what they need above all is stimulation , and time of course .
" the team at cambridge have proved beyond doubt that they have far more awareness than they are generally given credit for by the medical community . "
the inside out documentary on communication with misdiagnosed vegetative patients will be shown on bbc1 in the east at 1930 bst on friday and then will be available on bbc iplayer for seven days .

her family was told she could not understand anything going on around her and would die within a few weeks .
but her husband colin , who lives in harlow , essex , was convinced she was aware and was not in a vegetative state .
thanks to colin 's campaign , christine now gets specialist care at a centre in hertfordshire and can communicate " yes " or " no " answers by moving her eyes up or down .
he believes there are hundreds or even thousands of such patients who have been wrongly diagnosed but claims he has met resistance from the medical community .
" it 's now become an inconvenient truth that people in christine 's condition are aware and understand , " he says .
his views are being backed by pioneering research from a team in cambridge .
the team , led by dr adrian owen and dr martin coleman , have made breakthroughs in finding ways to communicate with people misdiagnosed as being in a vegetative condition using mri scans .
neuroscientist dr owen was one of the first in the uk to suspect that some people diagnosed as being in a vegetative state could be aware of their surroundings .
scientist dr adrian owen showed bbc 's colleen harris scans of her brain he recalls an early breakthrough case .
" i scanned a patient from addenbrooke 's hospital who was apparently vegetative , " he says .
" we showed her pictures of her family and friends and we saw activation in the area of the brain that we know responds to faces .
" when we first saw that this patient was actually consciously aware i was absolutely gobsmacked . "
what he had discovered was that while some patients described as vegetative were unable to express themselves through movement , their brain patterns showed awareness of their surroundings .
since then the team has come up with a way to communicate with patients by asking them to imagine playing tennis using their upper arm movements which activates one part of the brain .
or they will be asked to imagine walking around a house which can activate another part .
the team hope this technique will prevent misdiagnosis of patients as vegetative and also allow rudimentary communication with people who are not even able to move their eyes to indicate a " yes " or a " no " .

" we showed her pictures of her family and friends and we saw activation in the area of the brain that we know responds to faces .
" when we first saw that this patient was actually consciously aware i was absolutely gobsmacked . "
what he had discovered was that while some patients described as vegetative were unable to express themselves through movement , their brain patterns showed awareness of their surroundings .
since then the team has come up with a way to communicate with patients by asking them to imagine playing tennis using their upper arm movements which activates one part of the brain .
or they will be asked to imagine walking around a house which can activate another part .
the team hope this technique will prevent misdiagnosis of patients as vegetative and also allow rudimentary communication with people who are not even able to move their eyes to indicate a " yes " or a " no " .
" it shows us that brain imaging can provide something in addition to clinical or bedside evaluation .
" in this case it told us that a patient that looked vegetative clinically was in fact entirely aware , " says dr owen .
" it 's important to stress that this will be a minority of patients , it does n't mean that all vegetative patients are aware but it does mean that we are now able to detect those that are . "
parts of the brain activate when people think of playing tennis he adds : " one obvious application of this research is that in future we may be able to adapt the brain imaging techniques to provide a rather rudimentary form of communication in patients that are n't able to communicate in any other way . "
mr simpson , who looks after his wife every day , says : " people such as christine need to be able to communicate their wishes , their understandings and their feelings .
" what they need above all is stimulation , and time of course .
" the team at cambridge have proved beyond doubt that they have far more awareness than they are generally given credit for by the medical community . "
the inside out documentary on communication with misdiagnosed vegetative patients will be shown on bbc1 in the east at 1930 bst on friday and then will be available on bbc iplayer for seven days .

the self-declared republic of somaliland announced its independence from the rest of somalia in may 1991 and has been searching for recognition in vain since then .
now , it has received support from a think-tank active in development and security issues , the senlis council .
" a fast-track to recognition is urgently needed for somaliland , " a report from the council states .
' state-in-waiting ' it supports somaliland 's claim that it is not another enclave seeking separation .
such a separation would be against the principles of the african union .
the senlis council argues that since somaliland is basically the old british somaliland , which was independent for five days in 1960 before uniting with italian somaliland , it should be regarded again as a state-in-waiting .
the report calls for a " path to recognition " - including a referendum on independence , full transition to multi-party democracy and the rule of law , resolution of its territorial dispute with another region of somalia , puntland , and aid from the united states .
" given the turmoil that characterises the bulk of somalia , the international community needs to be reawakened from its torpor on somaliland while relative calm exists , " the report says .
norine macdonald , the canadian lawyer who is the senlis council 's president , said : " this is an untold story of remarkable endeavour .
" somalia is not a functioning state .
somaliland is a functioning state .
it is asking for recognition and we call on president george bush to lead that recognition . "
she remarked that while she could not move around mogadishu on a recent visit , which she stressed was worse than afghanistan and desperate for international aid , she was able to walk freely around the capital of somaliland , hargeisa .
the report places somaliland in the context of what it calls the " chronic failures of the us-led war on terror " in afghanistan , where ms macdonald is based , and somalia .
this war , it claims , is " bolstering the legitimacy of somali and afghan extremists .
the recognition of somaliland is a political necessity in the fight against extremism . "
long struggle despite these calls , it is unlikely that the united states will move quickly towards formal recognition .
the position of the bush administration was spelled out in a statement by the state department on 17 january this year : " while the united states does not recognize somaliland as an independent state , and we continue to believe that the question of somaliland 's independence should be resolved by the african union , we continue regularly to engage with somaliland as a regional administration .

so there is a kind of de facto acceptance of the split , but the us probably can not afford to upset somali president abdullah yusuf ahmed , who opposes independence for somaliland .
recognition for somaliland would in effect be an admission that somalia as a state had failed .
the president is an ally in the us fight against islamic militants in the region , notably the council of islamic courts and the al-shabab movement .
the us is also seeking four suspects in somalia it says were part of the al-qaeda attacks on us embassies in kenya and tanzania in 1998 .
the african union itself does not favour rearranging the borders of african countries , especially where there is no agreement .
it feels that , rightly or wrongly , the colonial borders were fixed and that changing them would open up too much uncertainty .

the self-declared republic of somaliland announced its independence from the rest of somalia in may 1991 and has been searching for recognition in vain since then .
now , it has received support from a think-tank active in development and security issues , the senlis council .
" a fast-track to recognition is urgently needed for somaliland , " a report from the council states .
' state-in-waiting ' it supports somaliland 's claim that it is not another enclave seeking separation .
such a separation would be against the principles of the african union .
the senlis council argues that since somaliland is basically the old british somaliland , which was independent for five days in 1960 before uniting with italian somaliland , it should be regarded again as a state-in-waiting .
the report calls for a " path to recognition " - including a referendum on independence , full transition to multi-party democracy and the rule of law , resolution of its territorial dispute with another region of somalia , puntland , and aid from the united states .
" given the turmoil that characterises the bulk of somalia , the international community needs to be reawakened from its torpor on somaliland while relative calm exists , " the report says .
norine macdonald , the canadian lawyer who is the senlis council 's president , said : " this is an untold story of remarkable endeavour .
" somalia is not a functioning state .
somaliland is a functioning state .
it is asking for recognition and we call on president george bush to lead that recognition . "
she remarked that while she could not move around mogadishu on a recent visit , which she stressed was worse than afghanistan and desperate for international aid , she was able to walk freely around the capital of somaliland , hargeisa .
the report places somaliland in the context of what it calls the " chronic failures of the us-led war on terror " in afghanistan , where ms macdonald is based , and somalia .
this war , it claims , is " bolstering the legitimacy of somali and afghan extremists .
the recognition of somaliland is a political necessity in the fight against extremism . "

' state-in-waiting ' it supports somaliland 's claim that it is not another enclave seeking separation .
such a separation would be against the principles of the african union .
the senlis council argues that since somaliland is basically the old british somaliland , which was independent for five days in 1960 before uniting with italian somaliland , it should be regarded again as a state-in-waiting .
the report calls for a " path to recognition " - including a referendum on independence , full transition to multi-party democracy and the rule of law , resolution of its territorial dispute with another region of somalia , puntland , and aid from the united states .
" given the turmoil that characterises the bulk of somalia , the international community needs to be reawakened from its torpor on somaliland while relative calm exists , " the report says .
norine macdonald , the canadian lawyer who is the senlis council 's president , said : " this is an untold story of remarkable endeavour .
" somalia is not a functioning state .
somaliland is a functioning state .
it is asking for recognition and we call on president george bush to lead that recognition . "
she remarked that while she could not move around mogadishu on a recent visit , which she stressed was worse than afghanistan and desperate for international aid , she was able to walk freely around the capital of somaliland , hargeisa .
the report places somaliland in the context of what it calls the " chronic failures of the us-led war on terror " in afghanistan , where ms macdonald is based , and somalia .
this war , it claims , is " bolstering the legitimacy of somali and afghan extremists .
the recognition of somaliland is a political necessity in the fight against extremism . "
long struggle despite these calls , it is unlikely that the united states will move quickly towards formal recognition .
the position of the bush administration was spelled out in a statement by the state department on 17 january this year : " while the united states does not recognize somaliland as an independent state , and we continue to believe that the question of somaliland 's independence should be resolved by the african union , we continue regularly to engage with somaliland as a regional administration . "
the us assistant secretary for african affairs jendayi frazer met somaliland 's foreign minister last year .
so there is a kind of de facto acceptance of the split , but the us probably can not afford to upset somali president abdullah yusuf ahmed , who opposes independence for somaliland .
recognition for somaliland would in effect be an admission that somalia as a state had failed .
the president is an ally in the us fight against islamic militants in the region , notably the council of islamic courts and the al-shabab movement .
the us is also seeking four suspects in somalia it says were part of the al-qaeda attacks on us embassies in kenya and tanzania in 1998 .
the african union itself does not favour rearranging the borders of african countries , especially where there is no agreement .
it feels that , rightly or wrongly , the colonial borders were fixed and that changing them would open up too much uncertainty .
there have been calls -lrb- from , among others , the international crisis group , another think-tank devoted to offering proposals on world problems -rrb- for the au to take a more positive view of somaliland independence but this has not led very far .

the bill , which was approved by the house of representatives last december , was passed unopposed in the senate .
us-based burma campaigners welcomed the move , saying the imprisoned opposition leader " richly deserves " the award .
burma 's generals have held ms suu kyi for more than 12 of the past 18 years , mostly under house arrest .
her national league for democracy -lrb- nld -rrb- won polls in 1990 but the junta never handed over power .
' courage and kindness ' democratic senator dianne feinstein , who proposed the legislation with republican mitch mcconnell , confirmed the bill 's approval .
aung san suu kyi 1989 : put under house arrest as burma 's leaders declare martial law 1990 : national league for democracy -lrb- nld -rrb- wins general election ; military does not recognise the result 1991 : wins nobel peace prize 1995 : released from house arrest , but movements restricted 2000-02 : second period of house arrest may 2003 : detained after clash between nld and government forces sep 2003 : allowed home after medical treatment , but under effective house arrest " this congressional gold medal is a tribute to suu kyi 's courage and conviction , and a symbol of solidarity with the oppressed people of burma , " she said .
aung din , of the us campaign for burma , said burmese people would be proud that ms suu kyi was being honoured in such a way .
" the burmese military generals have tried to isolate aung san suu kyi from her own people and from the international community by keeping her under house arrest for over 12 years , " he said .
" however , the generals , who control over 400,000 soldiers , are losing a battle with a single , unarmed woman .
her only tools are courage and loving kindness . "
it was not clear when , or how , ms suu kyi would be presented with the medal .
more than 300 individuals and groups have received the congressional gold medal .
george washington was awarded the first medal , which originally was given to military heroes but was later expanded to include prominent humanitarians , scientists , explorers , artists and others .
non-american recipients of the medal include winston churchill , pope john paul ii , nelson mandela , the dalai lama and mother theresa .
