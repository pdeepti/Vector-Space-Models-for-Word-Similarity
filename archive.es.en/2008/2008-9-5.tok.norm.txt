5 , comes just days after an emergency eu summit on georgia and ahead of crucial talks next week between the french and russian presidents on the georgia crisis . it also coincides with us vice-president dick cheney 's visit to georgia and ukraine , widely seen to signal that washington has not turned its back on former soviet allies following the conflict in georgia . the five-day war between georgia and russia last month has sparked turmoil in the caucasus and heightened tensions between russia and the west .
russia sent tanks and troops into georgian territory on aug .
8 , a day after a georgian offensive to retake rebel south ossetia .
it has since withdrawn some forces but left others inside georgian territory . though the eu has stopped short of imposing sanctions on russia for its military push and occupation of georgian territory , it has frozen talks with moscow on a new strategic partnership pact until all russian forces withdraw from georgia . wide-ranging talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to cuts its reliance on russian gas by creating alternative routes but the informal talks in the french city of avignon wo n't just focus on the eu 's fraught relations with russia .
officials say they are likely to take in issues including energy security and relations with states such as moldova , ukraine and belarus . " the eu considers that it is more necessary than ever to support regional cooperation and step up its relations with its eastern neighbors , " eu leaders concluded at the emergency summit on monday - a meeting held in response to the russian-georgian war . the foreign ministers of the eu 's 27 member states meet informally every six months to discuss broad policy issues without the pressure to reach formal decisions . friday 's meeting is to " review the whole range of the eu 's relationship " with russia and georgia in order to see where it could " reinforce " its current policies , sources in the french government , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , told the dpa news agency . eu hopes to push democratic reforms the talks are also likely to focus on how the eu can promote democratic reforms and reconciliation in parts of the former ussr where russia and the west are competing openly for influence . diplomats said the meeting could include talks on how to handle belarus , where the authoritarian regime of president alexander lukashenko in the summer released the country 's last political prisoners in what was seen in brussels as a step towards greater freedom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe hopes to promote democracy in former soviet states ukraine also looks set to feature prominently ahead of an eu-ukraine summit scheduled for tuesday . the ministers are also likely to discuss how the eu can use its relations with moscow 's former satellites to boost its own energy security by creating supply routes which do not go through russia , officials in brussels said . that follows a call from eu leaders monday that " recent events illustrate the need for europe to intensify its efforts with regard to the security of energy supplies . " however , the ministers are not expected to propose a sudden leap towards membership for countries such as georgia and ukraine , officials said . rather , they are likely to discuss how they can improve their use of current diplomatic agreements , partnerships and financial incentives to tighten their links with their eastern neighbors without giving up on their long-standing calls for reform . they are also expected to discuss eu relations with the united states and the eu 's role in the middle east peace process . ministers are also to discuss an eu observer mission to monitor the ceasefire in georgia . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de ukraine -pipe- 05.09.2008 cheney pledges us support for ukraine großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cheney called for ukraine 's feuding parties to reunite the us vice president says ukrainians should be able to live " without the threat of tyranny " from russia as he met with the quarreling leaders of the ukraine 's government in kyiv . cheney 's visit to ukraine was part of a short tour of strategic allies in the region amid the fall-out from the brief war between georgia and russia .
talks ran on twice as long as expected on friday , sept .
5 , as cheney met separately with president viktor yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko amid a domestic political conflict .
urging ukraine 's leader to unite , the vice president implied that russia was behind the country 's difficulties .
" we believe in the right of men and women to live without the threat of tyranny , economic blackmail or military invasion or intimidation , " said cheney , referring to russia 's recent military intervention in georgia .
" ukraine 's best hope to overcome these threats is to be united - united domestically first and foremost and united with other democracies , " he added .
tensions mount over georgian war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time for yushchenko and tymoshenko to kiss and make up ?
tymoshenko and yushchenko have been feuding in recent weeks over ukraine 's ties to russia .
yushchenko 's office had accused the prime minister of failing to support georgia when russian troops invaded the georgian enclave of south ossetia early last month .
meanwhile , tymoshenko has denied reports that she has tilted towards moscow and is about to form a new coalition with the pro-russian opposition .
however , she has not openly criticized russia over the georgia crisis .
their feud culminated in the president 's parliamentary allies walking out of the alliance on tuesday and with yushchenko threatening to dissolve parliament and call for an election if a new government is not formed within 30 days .
it would be the third election in as many years in ukraine , where yushchenko swept to power in a 2004 " orange revolution " with the promise of greater integration with the west .
cheney 's visit to the country comes as european officials suggest ukraine could be the next flashpoint for tensions between russia and the west following the war in georgia .

talks ran on twice as long as expected on friday , sept .

urging ukraine 's leader to unite , the vice president implied that russia was behind the country 's difficulties .
" we believe in the right of men and women to live without the threat of tyranny , economic blackmail or military invasion or intimidation , " said cheney , referring to russia 's recent military intervention in georgia .

tensions mount over georgian war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time for yushchenko and tymoshenko to kiss and make up ?
tymoshenko and yushchenko have been feuding in recent weeks over ukraine 's ties to russia .
yushchenko 's office had accused the prime minister of failing to support georgia when russian troops invaded the georgian enclave of south ossetia early last month .
meanwhile , tymoshenko has denied reports that she has tilted towards moscow and is about to form a new coalition with the pro-russian opposition .
however , she has not openly criticized russia over the georgia crisis .
their feud culminated in the president 's parliamentary allies walking out of the alliance on tuesday and with yushchenko threatening to dissolve parliament and call for an election if a new government is not formed within 30 days .
it would be the third election in as many years in ukraine , where yushchenko swept to power in a 2004 " orange revolution " with the promise of greater integration with the west .
cheney 's visit to the country comes as european officials suggest ukraine could be the next flashpoint for tensions between russia and the west following the war in georgia .

in their coverage of the republican national convention in st. paul , european papers agreed that the star turn was alaska governor and vice presidential candidate sarah palin . " barack obama speaks to the urban middle classes , " wrote berlin 's daily tageszeitung .
" sarah palin represents the opinions of small town and rural america .
they have long been waiting for a charismatic representative .
their disgust at career politicians has been growing in recent years .
sarah palin comes across as a rebel , taking on the establishment .
unexpectedly , that makes her a threat to barack obama . "
the neue osnabruecker zeitung was not convinced .
" sarah palin gave a sterling performance at the convention , " it wrote .
" but too much should not be read into that .
at this point , too many strange and surprising details about the governor of alaska have emerged .
it seems that mccain 's people failed to vet her adequately ; especially given they were filling the most important position in a presidential candidate 's team .
this negligence is part of the problem .
might mccain continue shooting from the hip in the white house ?
to many voters , it 's an alarming prospect . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccain tends to shoot from the hip britain 's daily the guardian was equally unimpressed : " mccain , the self-styled maverick who has so often angered his own party by bucking the party line , was given a five-minute standing ovation at the start of his 50-minute speech and again at the end … .
but , a poor orator who has made few - if any - memorable speeches in the past , he failed to match either the rhetoric of obama in denver last week or even the feisty , sarcastic delivery of his own running mate , sarah palin .
some of the loudest cheers of the night were when palin , the new darling of the republican party , joined him at the end .
although the organizers said the theme of the day was " peace , " the tone of videos shown earlier in the night as well as in his speech and those of others was heavily militaristic . "
from vienna , the kurier described the nomination of sarah palin as evidence of the polarization of us society .
" the crisis in which the country found itself in recent years did nothing to unite it , whatever obama says .
on the contrary , it deepened divisions .
bush did not win elections thanks to moderates , but because he managed to mobilize the country 's right-wing .
with her angry narrow-mindedness , gun-toting palin has given these people back their pride , even with her weaknesses .
like bush when he first came to office , she appears human - especially to those americans who are made nervous by obama 's professional speeches , open-mindedness and skin color - racism does not disappear simply because one denies it exists . "
in france , the center-left daily le monde also focused as much on palin as mccain .
" in recent months it looked as though it would be the moderate republicans who decided the vote for mccain , " it wrote .
" but his choice of sarah palin as running mate is an attempt to win over the right wing of the party .
he is keen to take a stand against the harvard-educated elites , as supposedly embodied by his democratic rival barack obama .
one would have expected him to distance himself from the very unpopular george w. bush , but the convention in minneapolis reflected the current administration 's politics .
mccain is indeed what the obama camp would paint him : a natural heir to bush . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the warsaw newspaper quoted sources saying that they had seen the document but did not explicitly say that the prison served as a holding center for al-qaeda terrorist suspects as has been alleged in the american media .
the gazeta reported that according to the document the secret prison was set up after the us and poland signed an accord in 2002 to combat terrorism .
cia prison allegations surfaced in 2005 polish prosecutors had been investigating long-running allegations of a secret cia jail to interrogate top al-qaeda operatives near szymany in northeast poland .
in 2006 , the head of the secret services had presented the two-page document to two ministers from the then ruling conservative law and justice party and poland 's chief prosecutor janusz kaczmarek at the time , according to gazeta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top officials declined to speak to the polish newspaper kaczmarek confirmed the meeting with the ministers , but refused to comment on what transpired . the ex-ministers declined to speak with the newspaper .
in the past polish officials have consistently rejected media claims that warsaw allowed the cia to run a secret prison for captured islamic radicals .
polish top aide denies knowledge of memo but on friday , a top advisor to prime minister donald tusk did confirm that prosecutors were investigating the allegations , although he denied any knowledge of the secret memorandum .
" i am not familiar with such a note and i do n't think prime minister donald tusk is either , " said tusk 's aide slawomir nowak in an interview with poland 's tok fm radio .
" but the premier asked the justice minister to clarify this matter and the country 's prosecutor 's office is investigating the potential existence of the cia prison . "
back in 2005 , the washington post broke the story that cia prisons existed in europe .
close cooperation between us and polish secret services bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a top aide to poland 's tusk denied knowledge of secret memo " there definitely was cooperation between polish and american secret services , " a source close to the us intelligence agency told news agency reuters .
" but whether there was torture at the base , hopefully we will learn about that soon . "
rumors circulated in the us and foreign media that the base was operational between 2002 and 2005 at a time when poland was governed by the left-leaning governments of leszek miller and marek belka and then a rightist administration under kazimierz marcinkiewicz .
all three former leaders have denied any knowledge of such a prison or base , and tusk 's center-right government has until now also played down speculation of its existence .
" i hope this will not be confirmed , " nowak said to reuters .
" it would not only have serious consequences inside the country but would also take a very serious toll on the international scene .
this has to be investigated very carefully , without emotions . "

the warsaw newspaper quoted sources saying that they had seen the document but did not explicitly say that the prison served as a holding center for al-qaeda terrorist suspects as has been alleged in the american media .
the gazeta reported that according to the document the secret prison was set up after the us and poland signed an accord in 2002 to combat terrorism .
cia prison allegations surfaced in 2005 polish prosecutors had been investigating long-running allegations of a secret cia jail to interrogate top al-qaeda operatives near szymany in northeast poland .
in 2006 , the head of the secret services had presented the two-page document to two ministers from the then ruling conservative law and justice party and poland 's chief prosecutor janusz kaczmarek at the time , according to gazeta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top officials declined to speak to the polish newspaper kaczmarek confirmed the meeting with the ministers , but refused to comment on what transpired . the ex-ministers declined to speak with the newspaper .
in the past polish officials have consistently rejected media claims that warsaw allowed the cia to run a secret prison for captured islamic radicals .
polish top aide denies knowledge of memo but on friday , a top advisor to prime minister donald tusk did confirm that prosecutors were investigating the allegations , although he denied any knowledge of the secret memorandum .
" i am not familiar with such a note and i do n't think prime minister donald tusk is either , " said tusk 's aide slawomir nowak in an interview with poland 's tok fm radio .
" but the premier asked the justice minister to clarify this matter and the country 's prosecutor 's office is investigating the potential existence of the cia prison . "
back in 2005 , the washington post broke the story that cia prisons existed in europe .
close cooperation between us and polish secret services bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a top aide to poland 's tusk denied knowledge of secret memo " there definitely was cooperation between polish and american secret services , " a source close to the us intelligence agency told news agency reuters .
" but whether there was torture at the base , hopefully we will learn about that soon . "
rumors circulated in the us and foreign media that the base was operational between 2002 and 2005 at a time when poland was governed by the left-leaning governments of leszek miller and marek belka and then a rightist administration under kazimierz marcinkiewicz .
all three former leaders have denied any knowledge of such a prison or base , and tusk 's center-right government has until now also played down speculation of its existence .
" i hope this will not be confirmed , " nowak said to reuters .
" it would not only have serious consequences inside the country but would also take a very serious toll on the international scene .
this has to be investigated very carefully , without emotions . "

" the question of who bears guilt and responsibility is not the priority when people are suffering , have lost their possessions and are forced to flee , " he said .
" but i have also said that in a second phase , in which we will define our medium and long-term relations with the conflicting parties , the issue of who bears what part of the responsibility for the escalation to the point of a military conflict will play a role .
" this can not be cleared up overnight and probably never completely , " the foreign minister told the newspaper .
he acknowledged the conflict had had an impact on relations between the eu and russia and would have long-term repercussions for the west 's foreign policy , but called for ties to be improved .

" i advise both sides to open themselves to an independent investigation , " steinmeier said .

" i see no lack of institutions , for example in the framework of the un or the osce that could run the probe , he said .
" but until now , there has above all been unwillingness on both sides to take part in such an investigation . "
the osce said thursday it had dispatched a first round of military observers in a buffer zone between russian and georgian troops .
the observers were on patrol near the separatist province of south ossetia in georgia " for the first time since the outbreak of hostilities in georgia last month , " the organization for security and co-operation in europe said in a statement on its web site .

russia 's foreign ministry on thursday said the subject of sending military observers and police to the buffer zone was discussed by deputy russian foreign minister vladimir titov and us ambassador to moscow john beyrle in moscow .
meanwhile , us vice president dick cheney during a visit to georgia on thursday accused russia of an " illegitimate " invasion aimed at redrawing the map of georgia and said the crisis had damaged russia 's international reputation .

" the question of who bears guilt and responsibility is not the priority when people are suffering , have lost their possessions and are forced to flee , " he said .
" but i have also said that in a second phase , in which we will define our medium and long-term relations with the conflicting parties , the issue of who bears what part of the responsibility for the escalation to the point of a military conflict will play a role .
" this can not be cleared up overnight and probably never completely , " the foreign minister told the newspaper .
he acknowledged the conflict had had an impact on relations between the eu and russia and would have long-term repercussions for the west 's foreign policy , but called for ties to be improved .
" a return to the patterns of the cold war is not an attractive alternative to the laborious undertaking of returning to an ordered way of doing business , " he said .

" pakistan 's territorial integrity has to be respected , " jung said after meeting with pakistani prime minister yousaf raza gillani .
the us attack took place on wednesday this week in pakistan 's south waziristan tribal region .
it killed at least 20 people including women and children , pakistani officials say , and was the first known foreign ground assault in pakistan against a taliban haven since us forces invaded afghanistan in 2001 .
pakistan has strongly condemned the us raid and this week the government in islamabad summoned the us ambassador to protest the unusually bold raid .
the raid appeared to indicate that the united states was forging ahead with a tougher strategy to curb the growing numbers of taliban fighters crossing from pakistan to attack american and nato soldiers fighting in afghanistan .
security woes at pakistani-afghan border bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung , left , with the pakistani army chief , general tariq majid the german defense minister who travelled to islamabad on friday discussed security in the lawless tribal areas with his pakistani counterpart ahmad muktar .
us and afghan officials say pakistan 's remote and mountainous tribal region bordering afghanistan has become a harbor for al-qaeda and taliban militants to stage attacks since the fall of the taliban regime at the end of 2001 .
the deteriorating security situation in the rugged and increasingly porous border region has led to a rise in attacks against nato forces in afghanistan recently .
top american military commanders have warned pakistan that they would start attacking taliban havens inside pakistan ’ s tribal areas if the increased infiltration by taliban fighters into afghanistan did not stop .
jung 's meeting with muktar stressed the need for closer collaboration between western forces and pakistan in the border region .
the pakistani minister assured jung his country was deeply committed to the fight against terrorism .
muktar said pakistan has committed 100,000 soldiers to patrol the volatile border region , but that the coalition forces needed to respect pakistan 's sovereignty and avoid killing innocent civilians in the partnership against terror .
reputation of international troops at risk jung had been in afghanistan earlier in the week on an unannounced visit to support german troops anxious about the increasing risk of taliban attacks . tension has been high among the german contingent amid an upsurge of attacks from booby traps and ambushes .
last week a german soldier was killed when a remote-controlled bomb went off near an armoured vehicle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a service for the german soldier killed in afghanistan last week german troops were also responsible for civilian deaths last week when three afghans were killed after both german and afghan troops opened fire on a vehicle that had failed to stop at a checkpoint even after warning shots had been fired .
the german army has paid compensation to relatives of a woman and two children shot dead last week at a checkpoint manned by its soldiers in northern afghanistan , german daily newspaper die welt reported this week .
a defence ministry spokesperson confirmed the report this week saying defence minister jung had arranged the compensation during the visit to afghanistan to pay his respects to the relatives .
it was one of a recent string of incidents that experts say are damaging the reputation of the almost 70,000 international troops as well as the afghan government , which need the backing of the local population if they want to beat a taliban-led insurgency .
even though most german soldiers that are part of the nato-led international force in are stationed in the relatively calm north , 26 troops have died in afghanistan since the start of the mission in 2002 . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" pakistan 's territorial integrity has to be respected , " jung said after meeting with pakistani prime minister yousaf raza gillani .
the us attack took place on wednesday this week in pakistan 's south waziristan tribal region .
it killed at least 20 people including women and children , pakistani officials say , and was the first known foreign ground assault in pakistan against a taliban haven since us forces invaded afghanistan in 2001 .
pakistan has strongly condemned the us raid and this week the government in islamabad summoned the us ambassador to protest the unusually bold raid .
the raid appeared to indicate that the united states was forging ahead with a tougher strategy to curb the growing numbers of taliban fighters crossing from pakistan to attack american and nato soldiers fighting in afghanistan .
security woes at pakistani-afghan border bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung , left , with the pakistani army chief , general tariq majid the german defense minister who travelled to islamabad on friday discussed security in the lawless tribal areas with his pakistani counterpart ahmad muktar .
us and afghan officials say pakistan 's remote and mountainous tribal region bordering afghanistan has become a harbor for al-qaeda and taliban militants to stage attacks since the fall of the taliban regime at the end of 2001 .
the deteriorating security situation in the rugged and increasingly porous border region has led to a rise in attacks against nato forces in afghanistan recently .
top american military commanders have warned pakistan that they would start attacking taliban havens inside pakistan ’ s tribal areas if the increased infiltration by taliban fighters into afghanistan did not stop .
jung 's meeting with muktar stressed the need for closer collaboration between western forces and pakistan in the border region .
the pakistani minister assured jung his country was deeply committed to the fight against terrorism .
muktar said pakistan has committed 100,000 soldiers to patrol the volatile border region , but that the coalition forces needed to respect pakistan 's sovereignty and avoid killing innocent civilians in the partnership against terror .
reputation of international troops at risk jung had been in afghanistan earlier in the week on an unannounced visit to support german troops anxious about the increasing risk of taliban attacks . tension has been high among the german contingent amid an upsurge of attacks from booby traps and ambushes .
last week a german soldier was killed when a remote-controlled bomb went off near an armoured vehicle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a service for the german soldier killed in afghanistan last week german troops were also responsible for civilian deaths last week when three afghans were killed after both german and afghan troops opened fire on a vehicle that had failed to stop at a checkpoint even after warning shots had been fired .
the german army has paid compensation to relatives of a woman and two children shot dead last week at a checkpoint manned by its soldiers in northern afghanistan , german daily newspaper die welt reported this week .
a defence ministry spokesperson confirmed the report this week saying defence minister jung had arranged the compensation during the visit to afghanistan to pay his respects to the relatives .
it was one of a recent string of incidents that experts say are damaging the reputation of the almost 70,000 international troops as well as the afghan government , which need the backing of the local population if they want to beat a taliban-led insurgency .
even though most german soldiers that are part of the nato-led international force in are stationed in the relatively calm north , 26 troops have died in afghanistan since the start of the mission in 2002 . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

5 , comes just days after an emergency eu summit on georgia and ahead of crucial talks next week between the french and russian presidents on the georgia crisis . it also coincides with us vice-president dick cheney 's visit to georgia and ukraine , widely seen to signal that washington has not turned its back on former soviet allies following the conflict in georgia . the five-day war between georgia and russia last month has sparked turmoil in the caucasus and heightened tensions between russia and the west .
russia sent tanks and troops into georgian territory on aug .
8 , a day after a georgian offensive to retake rebel south ossetia .
it has since withdrawn some forces but left others inside georgian territory . though the eu has stopped short of imposing sanctions on russia for its military push and occupation of georgian territory , it has frozen talks with moscow on a new strategic partnership pact until all russian forces withdraw from georgia . wide-ranging talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to cuts its reliance on russian gas by creating alternative routes but the informal talks in the french city of avignon wo n't just focus on the eu 's fraught relations with russia .
officials say they are likely to take in issues including energy security and relations with states such as moldova , ukraine and belarus . " the eu considers that it is more necessary than ever to support regional cooperation and step up its relations with its eastern neighbors , " eu leaders concluded at the emergency summit on monday - a meeting held in response to the russian-georgian war . the foreign ministers of the eu 's 27 member states meet informally every six months to discuss broad policy issues without the pressure to reach formal decisions . friday 's meeting is to " review the whole range of the eu 's relationship " with russia and georgia in order to see where it could " reinforce " its current policies , sources in the french government , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , told the dpa news agency . eu hopes to push democratic reforms the talks are also likely to focus on how the eu can promote democratic reforms and reconciliation in parts of the former ussr where russia and the west are competing openly for influence . diplomats said the meeting could include talks on how to handle belarus , where the authoritarian regime of president alexander lukashenko in the summer released the country 's last political prisoners in what was seen in brussels as a step towards greater freedom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe hopes to promote democracy in former soviet states ukraine also looks set to feature prominently ahead of an eu-ukraine summit scheduled for tuesday . the ministers are also likely to discuss how the eu can use its relations with moscow 's former satellites to boost its own energy security by creating supply routes which do not go through russia , officials in brussels said . that follows a call from eu leaders monday that " recent events illustrate the need for europe to intensify its efforts with regard to the security of energy supplies . " however , the ministers are not expected to propose a sudden leap towards membership for countries such as georgia and ukraine , officials said . rather , they are likely to discuss how they can improve their use of current diplomatic agreements , partnerships and financial incentives to tighten their links with their eastern neighbors without giving up on their long-standing calls for reform . they are also expected to discuss eu relations with the united states and the eu 's role in the middle east peace process . ministers are also to discuss an eu observer mission to monitor the ceasefire in georgia . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in their coverage of the republican national convention in st. paul , european papers agreed that the star turn was alaska governor and vice presidential candidate sarah palin . " barack obama speaks to the urban middle classes , " wrote berlin 's daily tageszeitung .
" sarah palin represents the opinions of small town and rural america .
they have long been waiting for a charismatic representative .
their disgust at career politicians has been growing in recent years .
sarah palin comes across as a rebel , taking on the establishment .
unexpectedly , that makes her a threat to barack obama . "
the neue osnabruecker zeitung was not convinced .
" sarah palin gave a sterling performance at the convention , " it wrote .
" but too much should not be read into that .
at this point , too many strange and surprising details about the governor of alaska have emerged .
it seems that mccain 's people failed to vet her adequately ; especially given they were filling the most important position in a presidential candidate 's team .
this negligence is part of the problem .
might mccain continue shooting from the hip in the white house ?
to many voters , it 's an alarming prospect . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccain tends to shoot from the hip britain 's daily the guardian was equally unimpressed : " mccain , the self-styled maverick who has so often angered his own party by bucking the party line , was given a five-minute standing ovation at the start of his 50-minute speech and again at the end … .
but , a poor orator who has made few - if any - memorable speeches in the past , he failed to match either the rhetoric of obama in denver last week or even the feisty , sarcastic delivery of his own running mate , sarah palin .
some of the loudest cheers of the night were when palin , the new darling of the republican party , joined him at the end .
although the organizers said the theme of the day was " peace , " the tone of videos shown earlier in the night as well as in his speech and those of others was heavily militaristic . "
from vienna , the kurier described the nomination of sarah palin as evidence of the polarization of us society .
" the crisis in which the country found itself in recent years did nothing to unite it , whatever obama says .
on the contrary , it deepened divisions .
bush did not win elections thanks to moderates , but because he managed to mobilize the country 's right-wing .
with her angry narrow-mindedness , gun-toting palin has given these people back their pride , even with her weaknesses .
like bush when he first came to office , she appears human - especially to those americans who are made nervous by obama 's professional speeches , open-mindedness and skin color - racism does not disappear simply because one denies it exists . "
in france , the center-left daily le monde also focused as much on palin as mccain .
" in recent months it looked as though it would be the moderate republicans who decided the vote for mccain , " it wrote .
" but his choice of sarah palin as running mate is an attempt to win over the right wing of the party .
he is keen to take a stand against the harvard-educated elites , as supposedly embodied by his democratic rival barack obama .
one would have expected him to distance himself from the very unpopular george w. bush , but the convention in minneapolis reflected the current administration 's politics .

in their coverage of the republican national convention in st. paul , european papers agreed that the star turn was alaska governor and vice presidential candidate sarah palin . " barack obama speaks to the urban middle classes , " wrote berlin 's daily tageszeitung .
" sarah palin represents the opinions of small town and rural america .
they have long been waiting for a charismatic representative .
their disgust at career politicians has been growing in recent years .
sarah palin comes across as a rebel , taking on the establishment .
unexpectedly , that makes her a threat to barack obama . "
the neue osnabruecker zeitung was not convinced .
" sarah palin gave a sterling performance at the convention , " it wrote .
" but too much should not be read into that .
at this point , too many strange and surprising details about the governor of alaska have emerged .
it seems that mccain 's people failed to vet her adequately ; especially given they were filling the most important position in a presidential candidate 's team .
this negligence is part of the problem .
might mccain continue shooting from the hip in the white house ?
to many voters , it 's an alarming prospect . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccain tends to shoot from the hip britain 's daily the guardian was equally unimpressed : " mccain , the self-styled maverick who has so often angered his own party by bucking the party line , was given a five-minute standing ovation at the start of his 50-minute speech and again at the end … .
but , a poor orator who has made few - if any - memorable speeches in the past , he failed to match either the rhetoric of obama in denver last week or even the feisty , sarcastic delivery of his own running mate , sarah palin .
some of the loudest cheers of the night were when palin , the new darling of the republican party , joined him at the end .
although the organizers said the theme of the day was " peace , " the tone of videos shown earlier in the night as well as in his speech and those of others was heavily militaristic . "
from vienna , the kurier described the nomination of sarah palin as evidence of the polarization of us society .
" the crisis in which the country found itself in recent years did nothing to unite it , whatever obama says .
on the contrary , it deepened divisions .
bush did not win elections thanks to moderates , but because he managed to mobilize the country 's right-wing .
with her angry narrow-mindedness , gun-toting palin has given these people back their pride , even with her weaknesses .
like bush when he first came to office , she appears human - especially to those americans who are made nervous by obama 's professional speeches , open-mindedness and skin color - racism does not disappear simply because one denies it exists . "
in france , the center-left daily le monde also focused as much on palin as mccain .
" in recent months it looked as though it would be the moderate republicans who decided the vote for mccain , " it wrote .
" but his choice of sarah palin as running mate is an attempt to win over the right wing of the party .
he is keen to take a stand against the harvard-educated elites , as supposedly embodied by his democratic rival barack obama .
one would have expected him to distance himself from the very unpopular george w. bush , but the convention in minneapolis reflected the current administration 's politics .
mccain is indeed what the obama camp would paint him : a natural heir to bush . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

5 , comes just days after an emergency eu summit on georgia and ahead of crucial talks next week between the french and russian presidents on the georgia crisis . it also coincides with us vice-president dick cheney 's visit to georgia and ukraine , widely seen to signal that washington has not turned its back on former soviet allies following the conflict in georgia . the five-day war between georgia and russia last month has sparked turmoil in the caucasus and heightened tensions between russia and the west .
russia sent tanks and troops into georgian territory on aug .
8 , a day after a georgian offensive to retake rebel south ossetia .
it has since withdrawn some forces but left others inside georgian territory . though the eu has stopped short of imposing sanctions on russia for its military push and occupation of georgian territory , it has frozen talks with moscow on a new strategic partnership pact until all russian forces withdraw from georgia . wide-ranging talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to cuts its reliance on russian gas by creating alternative routes but the informal talks in the french city of avignon wo n't just focus on the eu 's fraught relations with russia .
officials say they are likely to take in issues including energy security and relations with states such as moldova , ukraine and belarus . " the eu considers that it is more necessary than ever to support regional cooperation and step up its relations with its eastern neighbors , " eu leaders concluded at the emergency summit on monday - a meeting held in response to the russian-georgian war . the foreign ministers of the eu 's 27 member states meet informally every six months to discuss broad policy issues without the pressure to reach formal decisions . friday 's meeting is to " review the whole range of the eu 's relationship " with russia and georgia in order to see where it could " reinforce " its current policies , sources in the french government , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , told the dpa news agency . eu hopes to push democratic reforms the talks are also likely to focus on how the eu can promote democratic reforms and reconciliation in parts of the former ussr where russia and the west are competing openly for influence . diplomats said the meeting could include talks on how to handle belarus , where the authoritarian regime of president alexander lukashenko in the summer released the country 's last political prisoners in what was seen in brussels as a step towards greater freedom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe hopes to promote democracy in former soviet states ukraine also looks set to feature prominently ahead of an eu-ukraine summit scheduled for tuesday . the ministers are also likely to discuss how the eu can use its relations with moscow 's former satellites to boost its own energy security by creating supply routes which do not go through russia , officials in brussels said . that follows a call from eu leaders monday that " recent events illustrate the need for europe to intensify its efforts with regard to the security of energy supplies . " however , the ministers are not expected to propose a sudden leap towards membership for countries such as georgia and ukraine , officials said . rather , they are likely to discuss how they can improve their use of current diplomatic agreements , partnerships and financial incentives to tighten their links with their eastern neighbors without giving up on their long-standing calls for reform . they are also expected to discuss eu relations with the united states and the eu 's role in the middle east peace process . ministers are also to discuss an eu observer mission to monitor the ceasefire in georgia . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" pakistan 's territorial integrity has to be respected , " jung said after meeting with pakistani prime minister yousaf raza gillani .
the us attack took place on wednesday this week in pakistan 's south waziristan tribal region .
it killed at least 20 people including women and children , pakistani officials say , and was the first known foreign ground assault in pakistan against a taliban haven since us forces invaded afghanistan in 2001 .
pakistan has strongly condemned the us raid and this week the government in islamabad summoned the us ambassador to protest the unusually bold raid .
the raid appeared to indicate that the united states was forging ahead with a tougher strategy to curb the growing numbers of taliban fighters crossing from pakistan to attack american and nato soldiers fighting in afghanistan .
security woes at pakistani-afghan border bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung , left , with the pakistani army chief , general tariq majid the german defense minister who travelled to islamabad on friday discussed security in the lawless tribal areas with his pakistani counterpart ahmad muktar .
us and afghan officials say pakistan 's remote and mountainous tribal region bordering afghanistan has become a harbor for al-qaeda and taliban militants to stage attacks since the fall of the taliban regime at the end of 2001 .
the deteriorating security situation in the rugged and increasingly porous border region has led to a rise in attacks against nato forces in afghanistan recently .
top american military commanders have warned pakistan that they would start attacking taliban havens inside pakistan ’ s tribal areas if the increased infiltration by taliban fighters into afghanistan did not stop .
jung 's meeting with muktar stressed the need for closer collaboration between western forces and pakistan in the border region .
the pakistani minister assured jung his country was deeply committed to the fight against terrorism .
muktar said pakistan has committed 100,000 soldiers to patrol the volatile border region , but that the coalition forces needed to respect pakistan 's sovereignty and avoid killing innocent civilians in the partnership against terror .
reputation of international troops at risk jung had been in afghanistan earlier in the week on an unannounced visit to support german troops anxious about the increasing risk of taliban attacks . tension has been high among the german contingent amid an upsurge of attacks from booby traps and ambushes .
last week a german soldier was killed when a remote-controlled bomb went off near an armoured vehicle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a service for the german soldier killed in afghanistan last week german troops were also responsible for civilian deaths last week when three afghans were killed after both german and afghan troops opened fire on a vehicle that had failed to stop at a checkpoint even after warning shots had been fired .
the german army has paid compensation to relatives of a woman and two children shot dead last week at a checkpoint manned by its soldiers in northern afghanistan , german daily newspaper die welt reported this week .
a defence ministry spokesperson confirmed the report this week saying defence minister jung had arranged the compensation during the visit to afghanistan to pay his respects to the relatives .
it was one of a recent string of incidents that experts say are damaging the reputation of the almost 70,000 international troops as well as the afghan government , which need the backing of the local population if they want to beat a taliban-led insurgency .
even though most german soldiers that are part of the nato-led international force in are stationed in the relatively calm north , 26 troops have died in afghanistan since the start of the mission in 2002 . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the warsaw newspaper quoted sources saying that they had seen the document but did not explicitly say that the prison served as a holding center for al-qaeda terrorist suspects as has been alleged in the american media .
the gazeta reported that according to the document the secret prison was set up after the us and poland signed an accord in 2002 to combat terrorism .
cia prison allegations surfaced in 2005 polish prosecutors had been investigating long-running allegations of a secret cia jail to interrogate top al-qaeda operatives near szymany in northeast poland .

the warsaw newspaper quoted sources saying that they had seen the document but did not explicitly say that the prison served as a holding center for al-qaeda terrorist suspects as has been alleged in the american media .
the gazeta reported that according to the document the secret prison was set up after the us and poland signed an accord in 2002 to combat terrorism .
cia prison allegations surfaced in 2005 polish prosecutors had been investigating long-running allegations of a secret cia jail to interrogate top al-qaeda operatives near szymany in northeast poland .
in 2006 , the head of the secret services had presented the two-page document to two ministers from the then ruling conservative law and justice party and poland 's chief prosecutor janusz kaczmarek at the time , according to gazeta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top officials declined to speak to the polish newspaper kaczmarek confirmed the meeting with the ministers , but refused to comment on what transpired . the ex-ministers declined to speak with the newspaper .
in the past polish officials have consistently rejected media claims that warsaw allowed the cia to run a secret prison for captured islamic radicals .
polish top aide denies knowledge of memo but on friday , a top advisor to prime minister donald tusk did confirm that prosecutors were investigating the allegations , although he denied any knowledge of the secret memorandum .
" i am not familiar with such a note and i do n't think prime minister donald tusk is either , " said tusk 's aide slawomir nowak in an interview with poland 's tok fm radio .
" but the premier asked the justice minister to clarify this matter and the country 's prosecutor 's office is investigating the potential existence of the cia prison . "
back in 2005 , the washington post broke the story that cia prisons existed in europe .
close cooperation between us and polish secret services bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a top aide to poland 's tusk denied knowledge of secret memo " there definitely was cooperation between polish and american secret services , " a source close to the us intelligence agency told news agency reuters .
" but whether there was torture at the base , hopefully we will learn about that soon . "
rumors circulated in the us and foreign media that the base was operational between 2002 and 2005 at a time when poland was governed by the left-leaning governments of leszek miller and marek belka and then a rightist administration under kazimierz marcinkiewicz .
all three former leaders have denied any knowledge of such a prison or base , and tusk 's center-right government has until now also played down speculation of its existence .
" i hope this will not be confirmed , " nowak said to reuters .
" it would not only have serious consequences inside the country but would also take a very serious toll on the international scene .
this has to be investigated very carefully , without emotions . "

the state-owned energoinvest invited firms and investors to send non-binding letters of intent within a month .
so far , unnamed british , canadian and malaysian companies have expressed interest in drilling oil fields that may contain more than 100 million barrels .
decades ago , energoinvest along with former british and us partners had already identified five potential sites worth exploring , but the project was disrupted due to the 1992-95 bosnian war .
some 1,000 tons of crude were already pumped out in 1991 .
record crude prices have now prompted the bosnian government to revive oil and gas exploration . pipeline through the balkans in neighboring serbia , lawmakers are discussing a large scale energy project with russia , which envisages a pan-european pipeline running through the balkans .
a multi-billion dollar contract was signed between belgrade and moscow in january , but it must be ratified in the serbian parliament in order to be fully implemented .
serbia 's deputy prime minister bozidar djelic has said that the huge contract will " turn serbia into an important player on the energy map of europe . "
pro-western serbian officials have criticized the deal however , since it includes selling serbia 's state monopoly on oil at the bargain basement price of only 400 million euros . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the carmaker is to supply 100 cars powered by lithium-ion batteries .
the cars will mostly be from its smart car models and will have a range of about 100 kilometres from a single charge .
they can not be recharged from an ordinary power socket .
rwe is to set up 500 special charging sites -lrb- supply points -rrb- at owners ' homes , workplaces and in car parks and shopping centres .
owners will be automatically billed for recharging , similar to the way they pay mobile phone bills .
biggest in the world the berlin scheme is the second electric car test project initiated by daimler , after electric smart cars started a trial as fleet vehicles for the police and other services in london last year .
dubbed “ e-mobility berlin , ” the scheme will be the largest of its kind in the world and is set to start by 2010 , the two companies said in a statement .
“ the initiative embraces all components of efficient use of battery-powered vehicles – from modern , innovative drive technology to customer-friendly infrastructure , ” the statement said .
at the launch of the project , chancellor angela merkel , who is a physicist , was gently critical , saying , " one hundred cars is not that many for 500 supply points . "
but she also forecast that electric cars " will prevail sooner than people think . "
other critics said it will take six hours connected to the electricity network to fully recharge a lithium-ion car battery , though two hours is enough to achieve two thirds of a recharge .
sustainable travel ?
the cars can not make long out-of-town journeys because of their limited range .
but the german government is supporting the scheme because of its contribution to sustainable travel , the companies said .
“ our mobility concept sets up an integrated solution that combines everyday electric cars and a charging system built to suit them , ” said daimler head dieter zetsche .

" the question of who bears guilt and responsibility is not the priority when people are suffering , have lost their possessions and are forced to flee , " he said .
" but i have also said that in a second phase , in which we will define our medium and long-term relations with the conflicting parties , the issue of who bears what part of the responsibility for the escalation to the point of a military conflict will play a role .
" this can not be cleared up overnight and probably never completely , " the foreign minister told the newspaper .
he acknowledged the conflict had had an impact on relations between the eu and russia and would have long-term repercussions for the west 's foreign policy , but called for ties to be improved .
" a return to the patterns of the cold war is not an attractive alternative to the laborious undertaking of returning to an ordered way of doing business , " he said .

but steinmeier urged both countries to support the work of an independent team of investigators with military expertise .
" i advise both sides to open themselves to an independent investigation , " steinmeier said .
" i see no lack of institutions , for example in the framework of the un or the osce that could run the probe , he said .
" but until now , there has above all been unwillingness on both sides to take part in such an investigation . "
the osce said thursday it had dispatched a first round of military observers in a buffer zone between russian and georgian troops .
the observers were on patrol near the separatist province of south ossetia in georgia " for the first time since the outbreak of hostilities in georgia last month , " the organization for security and co-operation in europe said in a statement on its web site .
conditions from russia russia has said it will only pull troops out of the buffer zone once international controls , including military observers and police , are in place in the area and once georgia signs a non-aggression pact .
russia 's foreign ministry on thursday said the subject of sending military observers and police to the buffer zone was discussed by deputy russian foreign minister vladimir titov and us ambassador to moscow john beyrle in moscow .
meanwhile , us vice president dick cheney during a visit to georgia on thursday accused russia of an " illegitimate " invasion aimed at redrawing the map of georgia and said the crisis had damaged russia 's international reputation .
" russia 's actions have cast grave doubt on russia 's intentions and on its reliability as an international partner , not just in georgia but across this region and indeed across the international system , " cheney said .
us supports nato membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us is a staunch ally of georgia he also assured georgian president mikheil saakashvili of washington 's commitment to extending the nato alliance to georgia .
russia 's move strengthened the need to bring the former soviet republic and other countries into the nato alliance , the white house had said thursday .
" the desire to bring these new countries , these new democracies , and these countries that want to live in freedom and help defend each other , is even strengthened by the past month 's activities , " spokeswoman dana perino said .
russia strongly objects to continued nato expansion and the alliance 's announcement at an april summit that it intends to invite georgia and ukraine , another former soviet state , to join .

" pakistan 's territorial integrity has to be respected , " jung said after meeting with pakistani prime minister yousaf raza gillani .
the us attack took place on wednesday this week in pakistan 's south waziristan tribal region .
it killed at least 20 people including women and children , pakistani officials say , and was the first known foreign ground assault in pakistan against a taliban haven since us forces invaded afghanistan in 2001 .
pakistan has strongly condemned the us raid and this week the government in islamabad summoned the us ambassador to protest the unusually bold raid .
the raid appeared to indicate that the united states was forging ahead with a tougher strategy to curb the growing numbers of taliban fighters crossing from pakistan to attack american and nato soldiers fighting in afghanistan .
security woes at pakistani-afghan border bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung , left , with the pakistani army chief , general tariq majid the german defense minister who travelled to islamabad on friday discussed security in the lawless tribal areas with his pakistani counterpart ahmad muktar .
us and afghan officials say pakistan 's remote and mountainous tribal region bordering afghanistan has become a harbor for al-qaeda and taliban militants to stage attacks since the fall of the taliban regime at the end of 2001 .
the deteriorating security situation in the rugged and increasingly porous border region has led to a rise in attacks against nato forces in afghanistan recently .
top american military commanders have warned pakistan that they would start attacking taliban havens inside pakistan ’ s tribal areas if the increased infiltration by taliban fighters into afghanistan did not stop .
jung 's meeting with muktar stressed the need for closer collaboration between western forces and pakistan in the border region .
the pakistani minister assured jung his country was deeply committed to the fight against terrorism .
muktar said pakistan has committed 100,000 soldiers to patrol the volatile border region , but that the coalition forces needed to respect pakistan 's sovereignty and avoid killing innocent civilians in the partnership against terror .
reputation of international troops at risk jung had been in afghanistan earlier in the week on an unannounced visit to support german troops anxious about the increasing risk of taliban attacks . tension has been high among the german contingent amid an upsurge of attacks from booby traps and ambushes .
last week a german soldier was killed when a remote-controlled bomb went off near an armoured vehicle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a service for the german soldier killed in afghanistan last week german troops were also responsible for civilian deaths last week when three afghans were killed after both german and afghan troops opened fire on a vehicle that had failed to stop at a checkpoint even after warning shots had been fired .
the german army has paid compensation to relatives of a woman and two children shot dead last week at a checkpoint manned by its soldiers in northern afghanistan , german daily newspaper die welt reported this week .
a defence ministry spokesperson confirmed the report this week saying defence minister jung had arranged the compensation during the visit to afghanistan to pay his respects to the relatives .
it was one of a recent string of incidents that experts say are damaging the reputation of the almost 70,000 international troops as well as the afghan government , which need the backing of the local population if they want to beat a taliban-led insurgency .
even though most german soldiers that are part of the nato-led international force in are stationed in the relatively calm north , 26 troops have died in afghanistan since the start of the mission in 2002 . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

tensions mount over georgian war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time for yushchenko and tymoshenko to kiss and make up ?
tymoshenko and yushchenko have been feuding in recent weeks over ukraine 's ties to russia .
yushchenko 's office had accused the prime minister of failing to support georgia when russian troops invaded the georgian enclave of south ossetia early last month .
meanwhile , tymoshenko has denied reports that she has tilted towards moscow and is about to form a new coalition with the pro-russian opposition .
however , she has not openly criticized russia over the georgia crisis .
their feud culminated in the president 's parliamentary allies walking out of the alliance on tuesday and with yushchenko threatening to dissolve parliament and call for an election if a new government is not formed within 30 days .
it would be the third election in as many years in ukraine , where yushchenko swept to power in a 2004 " orange revolution " with the promise of greater integration with the west .
cheney 's visit to the country comes as european officials suggest ukraine could be the next flashpoint for tensions between russia and the west following the war in georgia .
speaking friday in kyiv , the vice president said that the us had a " deep and abiding interest " in ukraine ’ s security .
cheney added that ukrainians should be able to live " without the threat of tyranny , economic blackmail and military invasion or intimidation . "
ukraine has applied to join the nato alliance as well as the european union , a move that has been supported by the bush administration but one which has angered moscow , which considers ukraine to be within its sphere of influence .

in light of the caucasus conflict , yushchenko has said that he sees nato membership as essential in order to protect ukraine 's territorial integrity .
" ukrainians have the right to choose whether they wish to join nato , and nato has a right to invite ukraine to join the alliance when we believe they are ready and that the time is right , " said cheney , adding that " no outside country has a veto . "
in addition to addressing ukraine 's future with the alliance , the vice president 's visit is also aimed at demonstrating us support for georgia and securing allies like ukraine against russia .
during his time in tbilisi on thursday , cheney slammed russia 's actions against georgia , calling its military invasion an " illegitimate act that undermined its credibility . "
he also reiterated the us ' support for georgian membership in nato .

urging ukraine 's leader to unite , the vice president implied that russia was behind the country 's difficulties .
" we believe in the right of men and women to live without the threat of tyranny , economic blackmail or military invasion or intimidation , " said cheney , referring to russia 's recent military intervention in georgia .

tensions mount over georgian war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time for yushchenko and tymoshenko to kiss and make up ?
tymoshenko and yushchenko have been feuding in recent weeks over ukraine 's ties to russia .
yushchenko 's office had accused the prime minister of failing to support georgia when russian troops invaded the georgian enclave of south ossetia early last month .
meanwhile , tymoshenko has denied reports that she has tilted towards moscow and is about to form a new coalition with the pro-russian opposition .
however , she has not openly criticized russia over the georgia crisis .
their feud culminated in the president 's parliamentary allies walking out of the alliance on tuesday and with yushchenko threatening to dissolve parliament and call for an election if a new government is not formed within 30 days .
it would be the third election in as many years in ukraine , where yushchenko swept to power in a 2004 " orange revolution " with the promise of greater integration with the west .
cheney 's visit to the country comes as european officials suggest ukraine could be the next flashpoint for tensions between russia and the west following the war in georgia .

cheney added that ukrainians should be able to live " without the threat of tyranny , economic blackmail and military invasion or intimidation . "

5 .
" the question of who bears guilt and responsibility is not the priority when people are suffering , have lost their possessions and are forced to flee , " he said .
" but i have also said that in a second phase , in which we will define our medium and long-term relations with the conflicting parties , the issue of who bears what part of the responsibility for the escalation to the point of a military conflict will play a role .
" this can not be cleared up overnight and probably never completely , " the foreign minister told the newspaper .
he acknowledged the conflict had had an impact on relations between the eu and russia and would have long-term repercussions for the west 's foreign policy , but called for ties to be improved .
" a return to the patterns of the cold war is not an attractive alternative to the laborious undertaking of returning to an ordered way of doing business , " he said .
first military observers in georgia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier meets other eu foreign ministers friday neither georgia nor russia has backed an inquiry into last month 's five-day violent conflict .
but steinmeier urged both countries to support the work of an independent team of investigators with military expertise .
" i advise both sides to open themselves to an independent investigation , " steinmeier said .
" i see no lack of institutions , for example in the framework of the un or the osce that could run the probe , he said .
" but until now , there has above all been unwillingness on both sides to take part in such an investigation . "
the osce said thursday it had dispatched a first round of military observers in a buffer zone between russian and georgian troops .
the observers were on patrol near the separatist province of south ossetia in georgia " for the first time since the outbreak of hostilities in georgia last month , " the organization for security and co-operation in europe said in a statement on its web site .
conditions from russia russia has said it will only pull troops out of the buffer zone once international controls , including military observers and police , are in place in the area and once georgia signs a non-aggression pact .
russia 's foreign ministry on thursday said the subject of sending military observers and police to the buffer zone was discussed by deputy russian foreign minister vladimir titov and us ambassador to moscow john beyrle in moscow .
meanwhile , us vice president dick cheney during a visit to georgia on thursday accused russia of an " illegitimate " invasion aimed at redrawing the map of georgia and said the crisis had damaged russia 's international reputation .
" russia 's actions have cast grave doubt on russia 's intentions and on its reliability as an international partner , not just in georgia but across this region and indeed across the international system , " cheney said .
us supports nato membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us is a staunch ally of georgia he also assured georgian president mikheil saakashvili of washington 's commitment to extending the nato alliance to georgia .
russia 's move strengthened the need to bring the former soviet republic and other countries into the nato alliance , the white house had said thursday .
" the desire to bring these new countries , these new democracies , and these countries that want to live in freedom and help defend each other , is even strengthened by the past month 's activities , " spokeswoman dana perino said .
russia strongly objects to continued nato expansion and the alliance 's announcement at an april summit that it intends to invite georgia and ukraine , another former soviet state , to join .
" our support of georgia 's entry into nato started long before any of these hostilities began , " perino said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" pakistan 's territorial integrity has to be respected , " jung said after meeting with pakistani prime minister yousaf raza gillani .
the us attack took place on wednesday this week in pakistan 's south waziristan tribal region .
it killed at least 20 people including women and children , pakistani officials say , and was the first known foreign ground assault in pakistan against a taliban haven since us forces invaded afghanistan in 2001 .
pakistan has strongly condemned the us raid and this week the government in islamabad summoned the us ambassador to protest the unusually bold raid .
the raid appeared to indicate that the united states was forging ahead with a tougher strategy to curb the growing numbers of taliban fighters crossing from pakistan to attack american and nato soldiers fighting in afghanistan .
security woes at pakistani-afghan border bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung , left , with the pakistani army chief , general tariq majid the german defense minister who travelled to islamabad on friday discussed security in the lawless tribal areas with his pakistani counterpart ahmad muktar .
us and afghan officials say pakistan 's remote and mountainous tribal region bordering afghanistan has become a harbor for al-qaeda and taliban militants to stage attacks since the fall of the taliban regime at the end of 2001 .
the deteriorating security situation in the rugged and increasingly porous border region has led to a rise in attacks against nato forces in afghanistan recently .
top american military commanders have warned pakistan that they would start attacking taliban havens inside pakistan ’ s tribal areas if the increased infiltration by taliban fighters into afghanistan did not stop .
jung 's meeting with muktar stressed the need for closer collaboration between western forces and pakistan in the border region .
the pakistani minister assured jung his country was deeply committed to the fight against terrorism .
muktar said pakistan has committed 100,000 soldiers to patrol the volatile border region , but that the coalition forces needed to respect pakistan 's sovereignty and avoid killing innocent civilians in the partnership against terror .
reputation of international troops at risk jung had been in afghanistan earlier in the week on an unannounced visit to support german troops anxious about the increasing risk of taliban attacks . tension has been high among the german contingent amid an upsurge of attacks from booby traps and ambushes .
last week a german soldier was killed when a remote-controlled bomb went off near an armoured vehicle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a service for the german soldier killed in afghanistan last week german troops were also responsible for civilian deaths last week when three afghans were killed after both german and afghan troops opened fire on a vehicle that had failed to stop at a checkpoint even after warning shots had been fired .
the german army has paid compensation to relatives of a woman and two children shot dead last week at a checkpoint manned by its soldiers in northern afghanistan , german daily newspaper die welt reported this week .
a defence ministry spokesperson confirmed the report this week saying defence minister jung had arranged the compensation during the visit to afghanistan to pay his respects to the relatives .
it was one of a recent string of incidents that experts say are damaging the reputation of the almost 70,000 international troops as well as the afghan government , which need the backing of the local population if they want to beat a taliban-led insurgency .
even though most german soldiers that are part of the nato-led international force in are stationed in the relatively calm north , 26 troops have died in afghanistan since the start of the mission in 2002 . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the us attack took place on wednesday this week in pakistan 's south waziristan tribal region .
it killed at least 20 people including women and children , pakistani officials say , and was the first known foreign ground assault in pakistan against a taliban haven since us forces invaded afghanistan in 2001 .
pakistan has strongly condemned the us raid and this week the government in islamabad summoned the us ambassador to protest the unusually bold raid .
the raid appeared to indicate that the united states was forging ahead with a tougher strategy to curb the growing numbers of taliban fighters crossing from pakistan to attack american and nato soldiers fighting in afghanistan .
security woes at pakistani-afghan border bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung , left , with the pakistani army chief , general tariq majid the german defense minister who travelled to islamabad on friday discussed security in the lawless tribal areas with his pakistani counterpart ahmad muktar .
us and afghan officials say pakistan 's remote and mountainous tribal region bordering afghanistan has become a harbor for al-qaeda and taliban militants to stage attacks since the fall of the taliban regime at the end of 2001 .
the deteriorating security situation in the rugged and increasingly porous border region has led to a rise in attacks against nato forces in afghanistan recently .
top american military commanders have warned pakistan that they would start attacking taliban havens inside pakistan ’ s tribal areas if the increased infiltration by taliban fighters into afghanistan did not stop .
jung 's meeting with muktar stressed the need for closer collaboration between western forces and pakistan in the border region .
the pakistani minister assured jung his country was deeply committed to the fight against terrorism .
muktar said pakistan has committed 100,000 soldiers to patrol the volatile border region , but that the coalition forces needed to respect pakistan 's sovereignty and avoid killing innocent civilians in the partnership against terror .
reputation of international troops at risk jung had been in afghanistan earlier in the week on an unannounced visit to support german troops anxious about the increasing risk of taliban attacks . tension has been high among the german contingent amid an upsurge of attacks from booby traps and ambushes .
last week a german soldier was killed when a remote-controlled bomb went off near an armoured vehicle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a service for the german soldier killed in afghanistan last week german troops were also responsible for civilian deaths last week when three afghans were killed after both german and afghan troops opened fire on a vehicle that had failed to stop at a checkpoint even after warning shots had been fired .
the german army has paid compensation to relatives of a woman and two children shot dead last week at a checkpoint manned by its soldiers in northern afghanistan , german daily newspaper die welt reported this week .
a defence ministry spokesperson confirmed the report this week saying defence minister jung had arranged the compensation during the visit to afghanistan to pay his respects to the relatives .
it was one of a recent string of incidents that experts say are damaging the reputation of the almost 70,000 international troops as well as the afghan government , which need the backing of the local population if they want to beat a taliban-led insurgency .
even though most german soldiers that are part of the nato-led international force in are stationed in the relatively calm north , 26 troops have died in afghanistan since the start of the mission in 2002 . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in their coverage of the republican national convention in st. paul , european papers agreed that the star turn was alaska governor and vice presidential candidate sarah palin . " barack obama speaks to the urban middle classes , " wrote berlin 's daily tageszeitung .
" sarah palin represents the opinions of small town and rural america .
they have long been waiting for a charismatic representative .
their disgust at career politicians has been growing in recent years .
sarah palin comes across as a rebel , taking on the establishment .
unexpectedly , that makes her a threat to barack obama . "
the neue osnabruecker zeitung was not convinced .
" sarah palin gave a sterling performance at the convention , " it wrote .
" but too much should not be read into that .
at this point , too many strange and surprising details about the governor of alaska have emerged .
it seems that mccain 's people failed to vet her adequately ; especially given they were filling the most important position in a presidential candidate 's team .
this negligence is part of the problem .
might mccain continue shooting from the hip in the white house ?
to many voters , it 's an alarming prospect . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccain tends to shoot from the hip britain 's daily the guardian was equally unimpressed : " mccain , the self-styled maverick who has so often angered his own party by bucking the party line , was given a five-minute standing ovation at the start of his 50-minute speech and again at the end … .
but , a poor orator who has made few - if any - memorable speeches in the past , he failed to match either the rhetoric of obama in denver last week or even the feisty , sarcastic delivery of his own running mate , sarah palin .
some of the loudest cheers of the night were when palin , the new darling of the republican party , joined him at the end .
although the organizers said the theme of the day was " peace , " the tone of videos shown earlier in the night as well as in his speech and those of others was heavily militaristic . "
from vienna , the kurier described the nomination of sarah palin as evidence of the polarization of us society .
" the crisis in which the country found itself in recent years did nothing to unite it , whatever obama says .
on the contrary , it deepened divisions .
bush did not win elections thanks to moderates , but because he managed to mobilize the country 's right-wing .
with her angry narrow-mindedness , gun-toting palin has given these people back their pride , even with her weaknesses .
like bush when he first came to office , she appears human - especially to those americans who are made nervous by obama 's professional speeches , open-mindedness and skin color - racism does not disappear simply because one denies it exists . "
in france , the center-left daily le monde also focused as much on palin as mccain .
" in recent months it looked as though it would be the moderate republicans who decided the vote for mccain , " it wrote .
" but his choice of sarah palin as running mate is an attempt to win over the right wing of the party .
he is keen to take a stand against the harvard-educated elites , as supposedly embodied by his democratic rival barack obama .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 05.09.2008 secret memo confirms existence of cia prison , polish paper says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the memo says that a secret prison was set up after the us and poland signed a 2002 accord a polish newspaper has reported that a top secret memo confirms the existence of a secret cia prison in poland , a claim rejected by the polish government . polish prosecutors have obtained a top secret memorandum from either late 2005 or early 2006 showing that a cia prison existed in poland earlier in the decade , according to respected polish daily gazeta wyborcza .
the warsaw newspaper quoted sources saying that they had seen the document but did not explicitly say that the prison served as a holding center for al-qaeda terrorist suspects as has been alleged in the american media .
the gazeta reported that according to the document the secret prison was set up after the us and poland signed an accord in 2002 to combat terrorism .
cia prison allegations surfaced in 2005 polish prosecutors had been investigating long-running allegations of a secret cia jail to interrogate top al-qaeda operatives near szymany in northeast poland .
in 2006 , the head of the secret services had presented the two-page document to two ministers from the then ruling conservative law and justice party and poland 's chief prosecutor janusz kaczmarek at the time , according to gazeta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top officials declined to speak to the polish newspaper kaczmarek confirmed the meeting with the ministers , but refused to comment on what transpired . the ex-ministers declined to speak with the newspaper .
in the past polish officials have consistently rejected media claims that warsaw allowed the cia to run a secret prison for captured islamic radicals .
polish top aide denies knowledge of memo but on friday , a top advisor to prime minister donald tusk did confirm that prosecutors were investigating the allegations , although he denied any knowledge of the secret memorandum .
" i am not familiar with such a note and i do n't think prime minister donald tusk is either , " said tusk 's aide slawomir nowak in an interview with poland 's tok fm radio .
" but the premier asked the justice minister to clarify this matter and the country 's prosecutor 's office is investigating the potential existence of the cia prison . "
back in 2005 , the washington post broke the story that cia prisons existed in europe .
close cooperation between us and polish secret services bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a top aide to poland 's tusk denied knowledge of secret memo " there definitely was cooperation between polish and american secret services , " a source close to the us intelligence agency told news agency reuters .
" but whether there was torture at the base , hopefully we will learn about that soon . "
rumors circulated in the us and foreign media that the base was operational between 2002 and 2005 at a time when poland was governed by the left-leaning governments of leszek miller and marek belka and then a rightist administration under kazimierz marcinkiewicz .
all three former leaders have denied any knowledge of such a prison or base , and tusk 's center-right government has until now also played down speculation of its existence .
" i hope this will not be confirmed , " nowak said to reuters .

the warsaw newspaper quoted sources saying that they had seen the document but did not explicitly say that the prison served as a holding center for al-qaeda terrorist suspects as has been alleged in the american media .
the gazeta reported that according to the document the secret prison was set up after the us and poland signed an accord in 2002 to combat terrorism .
cia prison allegations surfaced in 2005 polish prosecutors had been investigating long-running allegations of a secret cia jail to interrogate top al-qaeda operatives near szymany in northeast poland .
in 2006 , the head of the secret services had presented the two-page document to two ministers from the then ruling conservative law and justice party and poland 's chief prosecutor janusz kaczmarek at the time , according to gazeta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top officials declined to speak to the polish newspaper kaczmarek confirmed the meeting with the ministers , but refused to comment on what transpired . the ex-ministers declined to speak with the newspaper .
in the past polish officials have consistently rejected media claims that warsaw allowed the cia to run a secret prison for captured islamic radicals .
polish top aide denies knowledge of memo but on friday , a top advisor to prime minister donald tusk did confirm that prosecutors were investigating the allegations , although he denied any knowledge of the secret memorandum .
" i am not familiar with such a note and i do n't think prime minister donald tusk is either , " said tusk 's aide slawomir nowak in an interview with poland 's tok fm radio .
" but the premier asked the justice minister to clarify this matter and the country 's prosecutor 's office is investigating the potential existence of the cia prison . "
back in 2005 , the washington post broke the story that cia prisons existed in europe .
close cooperation between us and polish secret services bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a top aide to poland 's tusk denied knowledge of secret memo " there definitely was cooperation between polish and american secret services , " a source close to the us intelligence agency told news agency reuters .
" but whether there was torture at the base , hopefully we will learn about that soon . "
rumors circulated in the us and foreign media that the base was operational between 2002 and 2005 at a time when poland was governed by the left-leaning governments of leszek miller and marek belka and then a rightist administration under kazimierz marcinkiewicz .
all three former leaders have denied any knowledge of such a prison or base , and tusk 's center-right government has until now also played down speculation of its existence .
" i hope this will not be confirmed , " nowak said to reuters .
" it would not only have serious consequences inside the country but would also take a very serious toll on the international scene .
this has to be investigated very carefully , without emotions . "

5 , comes just days after an emergency eu summit on georgia and ahead of crucial talks next week between the french and russian presidents on the georgia crisis . it also coincides with us vice-president dick cheney 's visit to georgia and ukraine , widely seen to signal that washington has not turned its back on former soviet allies following the conflict in georgia . the five-day war between georgia and russia last month has sparked turmoil in the caucasus and heightened tensions between russia and the west .
russia sent tanks and troops into georgian territory on aug .
8 , a day after a georgian offensive to retake rebel south ossetia .
it has since withdrawn some forces but left others inside georgian territory . though the eu has stopped short of imposing sanctions on russia for its military push and occupation of georgian territory , it has frozen talks with moscow on a new strategic partnership pact until all russian forces withdraw from georgia . wide-ranging talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to cuts its reliance on russian gas by creating alternative routes but the informal talks in the french city of avignon wo n't just focus on the eu 's fraught relations with russia .
officials say they are likely to take in issues including energy security and relations with states such as moldova , ukraine and belarus . " the eu considers that it is more necessary than ever to support regional cooperation and step up its relations with its eastern neighbors , " eu leaders concluded at the emergency summit on monday - a meeting held in response to the russian-georgian war . the foreign ministers of the eu 's 27 member states meet informally every six months to discuss broad policy issues without the pressure to reach formal decisions . friday 's meeting is to " review the whole range of the eu 's relationship " with russia and georgia in order to see where it could " reinforce " its current policies , sources in the french government , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , told the dpa news agency . eu hopes to push democratic reforms the talks are also likely to focus on how the eu can promote democratic reforms and reconciliation in parts of the former ussr where russia and the west are competing openly for influence . diplomats said the meeting could include talks on how to handle belarus , where the authoritarian regime of president alexander lukashenko in the summer released the country 's last political prisoners in what was seen in brussels as a step towards greater freedom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe hopes to promote democracy in former soviet states ukraine also looks set to feature prominently ahead of an eu-ukraine summit scheduled for tuesday . the ministers are also likely to discuss how the eu can use its relations with moscow 's former satellites to boost its own energy security by creating supply routes which do not go through russia , officials in brussels said . that follows a call from eu leaders monday that " recent events illustrate the need for europe to intensify its efforts with regard to the security of energy supplies . " however , the ministers are not expected to propose a sudden leap towards membership for countries such as georgia and ukraine , officials said . rather , they are likely to discuss how they can improve their use of current diplomatic agreements , partnerships and financial incentives to tighten their links with their eastern neighbors without giving up on their long-standing calls for reform . they are also expected to discuss eu relations with the united states and the eu 's role in the middle east peace process . ministers are also to discuss an eu observer mission to monitor the ceasefire in georgia . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in their coverage of the republican national convention in st. paul , european papers agreed that the star turn was alaska governor and vice presidential candidate sarah palin . " barack obama speaks to the urban middle classes , " wrote berlin 's daily tageszeitung .
" sarah palin represents the opinions of small town and rural america .
they have long been waiting for a charismatic representative .
their disgust at career politicians has been growing in recent years .
sarah palin comes across as a rebel , taking on the establishment .
unexpectedly , that makes her a threat to barack obama . "
the neue osnabruecker zeitung was not convinced .
" sarah palin gave a sterling performance at the convention , " it wrote .
" but too much should not be read into that .
at this point , too many strange and surprising details about the governor of alaska have emerged .
it seems that mccain 's people failed to vet her adequately ; especially given they were filling the most important position in a presidential candidate 's team .
this negligence is part of the problem .
might mccain continue shooting from the hip in the white house ?
to many voters , it 's an alarming prospect . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccain tends to shoot from the hip britain 's daily the guardian was equally unimpressed : " mccain , the self-styled maverick who has so often angered his own party by bucking the party line , was given a five-minute standing ovation at the start of his 50-minute speech and again at the end … .
but , a poor orator who has made few - if any - memorable speeches in the past , he failed to match either the rhetoric of obama in denver last week or even the feisty , sarcastic delivery of his own running mate , sarah palin .
some of the loudest cheers of the night were when palin , the new darling of the republican party , joined him at the end .
although the organizers said the theme of the day was " peace , " the tone of videos shown earlier in the night as well as in his speech and those of others was heavily militaristic . "
from vienna , the kurier described the nomination of sarah palin as evidence of the polarization of us society .
" the crisis in which the country found itself in recent years did nothing to unite it , whatever obama says .
on the contrary , it deepened divisions .
bush did not win elections thanks to moderates , but because he managed to mobilize the country 's right-wing .
with her angry narrow-mindedness , gun-toting palin has given these people back their pride , even with her weaknesses .
like bush when he first came to office , she appears human - especially to those americans who are made nervous by obama 's professional speeches , open-mindedness and skin color - racism does not disappear simply because one denies it exists . "
in france , the center-left daily le monde also focused as much on palin as mccain .
" in recent months it looked as though it would be the moderate republicans who decided the vote for mccain , " it wrote .
" but his choice of sarah palin as running mate is an attempt to win over the right wing of the party .
he is keen to take a stand against the harvard-educated elites , as supposedly embodied by his democratic rival barack obama .
one would have expected him to distance himself from the very unpopular george w. bush , but the convention in minneapolis reflected the current administration 's politics .
mccain is indeed what the obama camp would paint him : a natural heir to bush . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

talks ran on twice as long as expected on friday , sept .
5 , as cheney met separately with president viktor yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko amid a domestic political conflict .
urging ukraine 's leader to unite , the vice president implied that russia was behind the country 's difficulties .
" we believe in the right of men and women to live without the threat of tyranny , economic blackmail or military invasion or intimidation , " said cheney , referring to russia 's recent military intervention in georgia .
" ukraine 's best hope to overcome these threats is to be united - united domestically first and foremost and united with other democracies , " he added .
tensions mount over georgian war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time for yushchenko and tymoshenko to kiss and make up ?
tymoshenko and yushchenko have been feuding in recent weeks over ukraine 's ties to russia .
yushchenko 's office had accused the prime minister of failing to support georgia when russian troops invaded the georgian enclave of south ossetia early last month .
meanwhile , tymoshenko has denied reports that she has tilted towards moscow and is about to form a new coalition with the pro-russian opposition .
however , she has not openly criticized russia over the georgia crisis .
their feud culminated in the president 's parliamentary allies walking out of the alliance on tuesday and with yushchenko threatening to dissolve parliament and call for an election if a new government is not formed within 30 days .
it would be the third election in as many years in ukraine , where yushchenko swept to power in a 2004 " orange revolution " with the promise of greater integration with the west .
cheney 's visit to the country comes as european officials suggest ukraine could be the next flashpoint for tensions between russia and the west following the war in georgia .
speaking friday in kyiv , the vice president said that the us had a " deep and abiding interest " in ukraine ’ s security .
cheney added that ukrainians should be able to live " without the threat of tyranny , economic blackmail and military invasion or intimidation . "
ukraine has applied to join the nato alliance as well as the european union , a move that has been supported by the bush administration but one which has angered moscow , which considers ukraine to be within its sphere of influence .
caught between east and west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with tough times in its past , ukraine has the bush administration 's support in joining nato with ukraine 's coalition now divided , political leaders have voiced concern that the kremlin might try to capitalize on the nation 's persistent political instability .
in light of the caucasus conflict , yushchenko has said that he sees nato membership as essential in order to protect ukraine 's territorial integrity .
" ukrainians have the right to choose whether they wish to join nato , and nato has a right to invite ukraine to join the alliance when we believe they are ready and that the time is right , " said cheney , adding that " no outside country has a veto . "
in addition to addressing ukraine 's future with the alliance , the vice president 's visit is also aimed at demonstrating us support for georgia and securing allies like ukraine against russia .
during his time in tbilisi on thursday , cheney slammed russia 's actions against georgia , calling its military invasion an " illegitimate act that undermined its credibility . "
he also reiterated the us ' support for georgian membership in nato .
while in ukraine , cheney is also slated to visit the holodomor memorial to the country 's famine victims before continuing on to italy in the afternoon . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , she has not openly criticized russia over the georgia crisis .
their feud culminated in the president 's parliamentary allies walking out of the alliance on tuesday and with yushchenko threatening to dissolve parliament and call for an election if a new government is not formed within 30 days .
it would be the third election in as many years in ukraine , where yushchenko swept to power in a 2004 " orange revolution " with the promise of greater integration with the west .
cheney 's visit to the country comes as european officials suggest ukraine could be the next flashpoint for tensions between russia and the west following the war in georgia .
speaking friday in kyiv , the vice president said that the us had a " deep and abiding interest " in ukraine ’ s security .
cheney added that ukrainians should be able to live " without the threat of tyranny , economic blackmail and military invasion or intimidation . "
ukraine has applied to join the nato alliance as well as the european union , a move that has been supported by the bush administration but one which has angered moscow , which considers ukraine to be within its sphere of influence .
caught between east and west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with tough times in its past , ukraine has the bush administration 's support in joining nato with ukraine 's coalition now divided , political leaders have voiced concern that the kremlin might try to capitalize on the nation 's persistent political instability .
in light of the caucasus conflict , yushchenko has said that he sees nato membership as essential in order to protect ukraine 's territorial integrity .
" ukrainians have the right to choose whether they wish to join nato , and nato has a right to invite ukraine to join the alliance when we believe they are ready and that the time is right , " said cheney , adding that " no outside country has a veto . "
in addition to addressing ukraine 's future with the alliance , the vice president 's visit is also aimed at demonstrating us support for georgia and securing allies like ukraine against russia .
during his time in tbilisi on thursday , cheney slammed russia 's actions against georgia , calling its military invasion an " illegitimate act that undermined its credibility . "
he also reiterated the us ' support for georgian membership in nato .
while in ukraine , cheney is also slated to visit the holodomor memorial to the country 's famine victims before continuing on to italy in the afternoon . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" pakistan 's territorial integrity has to be respected , " jung said after meeting with pakistani prime minister yousaf raza gillani .
the us attack took place on wednesday this week in pakistan 's south waziristan tribal region .
it killed at least 20 people including women and children , pakistani officials say , and was the first known foreign ground assault in pakistan against a taliban haven since us forces invaded afghanistan in 2001 .
pakistan has strongly condemned the us raid and this week the government in islamabad summoned the us ambassador to protest the unusually bold raid .
the raid appeared to indicate that the united states was forging ahead with a tougher strategy to curb the growing numbers of taliban fighters crossing from pakistan to attack american and nato soldiers fighting in afghanistan .

us and afghan officials say pakistan 's remote and mountainous tribal region bordering afghanistan has become a harbor for al-qaeda and taliban militants to stage attacks since the fall of the taliban regime at the end of 2001 .
the deteriorating security situation in the rugged and increasingly porous border region has led to a rise in attacks against nato forces in afghanistan recently .
top american military commanders have warned pakistan that they would start attacking taliban havens inside pakistan ’ s tribal areas if the increased infiltration by taliban fighters into afghanistan did not stop .
jung 's meeting with muktar stressed the need for closer collaboration between western forces and pakistan in the border region .
the pakistani minister assured jung his country was deeply committed to the fight against terrorism .
muktar said pakistan has committed 100,000 soldiers to patrol the volatile border region , but that the coalition forces needed to respect pakistan 's sovereignty and avoid killing innocent civilians in the partnership against terror .
reputation of international troops at risk jung had been in afghanistan earlier in the week on an unannounced visit to support german troops anxious about the increasing risk of taliban attacks . tension has been high among the german contingent amid an upsurge of attacks from booby traps and ambushes .
last week a german soldier was killed when a remote-controlled bomb went off near an armoured vehicle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a service for the german soldier killed in afghanistan last week german troops were also responsible for civilian deaths last week when three afghans were killed after both german and afghan troops opened fire on a vehicle that had failed to stop at a checkpoint even after warning shots had been fired .
the german army has paid compensation to relatives of a woman and two children shot dead last week at a checkpoint manned by its soldiers in northern afghanistan , german daily newspaper die welt reported this week .
a defence ministry spokesperson confirmed the report this week saying defence minister jung had arranged the compensation during the visit to afghanistan to pay his respects to the relatives .
it was one of a recent string of incidents that experts say are damaging the reputation of the almost 70,000 international troops as well as the afghan government , which need the backing of the local population if they want to beat a taliban-led insurgency .
even though most german soldiers that are part of the nato-led international force in are stationed in the relatively calm north , 26 troops have died in afghanistan since the start of the mission in 2002 . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

urging ukraine 's leader to unite , the vice president implied that russia was behind the country 's difficulties .
" we believe in the right of men and women to live without the threat of tyranny , economic blackmail or military invasion or intimidation , " said cheney , referring to russia 's recent military intervention in georgia .

tensions mount over georgian war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time for yushchenko and tymoshenko to kiss and make up ?
tymoshenko and yushchenko have been feuding in recent weeks over ukraine 's ties to russia .
yushchenko 's office had accused the prime minister of failing to support georgia when russian troops invaded the georgian enclave of south ossetia early last month .
meanwhile , tymoshenko has denied reports that she has tilted towards moscow and is about to form a new coalition with the pro-russian opposition .
however , she has not openly criticized russia over the georgia crisis .
their feud culminated in the president 's parliamentary allies walking out of the alliance on tuesday and with yushchenko threatening to dissolve parliament and call for an election if a new government is not formed within 30 days .
it would be the third election in as many years in ukraine , where yushchenko swept to power in a 2004 " orange revolution " with the promise of greater integration with the west .
cheney 's visit to the country comes as european officials suggest ukraine could be the next flashpoint for tensions between russia and the west following the war in georgia .

cheney added that ukrainians should be able to live " without the threat of tyranny , economic blackmail and military invasion or intimidation . "
ukraine has applied to join the nato alliance as well as the european union , a move that has been supported by the bush administration but one which has angered moscow , which considers ukraine to be within its sphere of influence .
caught between east and west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with tough times in its past , ukraine has the bush administration 's support in joining nato with ukraine 's coalition now divided , political leaders have voiced concern that the kremlin might try to capitalize on the nation 's persistent political instability .
in light of the caucasus conflict , yushchenko has said that he sees nato membership as essential in order to protect ukraine 's territorial integrity .
" ukrainians have the right to choose whether they wish to join nato , and nato has a right to invite ukraine to join the alliance when we believe they are ready and that the time is right , " said cheney , adding that " no outside country has a veto . "
in addition to addressing ukraine 's future with the alliance , the vice president 's visit is also aimed at demonstrating us support for georgia and securing allies like ukraine against russia .
during his time in tbilisi on thursday , cheney slammed russia 's actions against georgia , calling its military invasion an " illegitimate act that undermined its credibility . "

5 .
" the question of who bears guilt and responsibility is not the priority when people are suffering , have lost their possessions and are forced to flee , " he said .
" but i have also said that in a second phase , in which we will define our medium and long-term relations with the conflicting parties , the issue of who bears what part of the responsibility for the escalation to the point of a military conflict will play a role .
" this can not be cleared up overnight and probably never completely , " the foreign minister told the newspaper .
he acknowledged the conflict had had an impact on relations between the eu and russia and would have long-term repercussions for the west 's foreign policy , but called for ties to be improved .
" a return to the patterns of the cold war is not an attractive alternative to the laborious undertaking of returning to an ordered way of doing business , " he said .
first military observers in georgia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier meets other eu foreign ministers friday neither georgia nor russia has backed an inquiry into last month 's five-day violent conflict .
but steinmeier urged both countries to support the work of an independent team of investigators with military expertise .
" i advise both sides to open themselves to an independent investigation , " steinmeier said .
" i see no lack of institutions , for example in the framework of the un or the osce that could run the probe , he said .
" but until now , there has above all been unwillingness on both sides to take part in such an investigation . "
the osce said thursday it had dispatched a first round of military observers in a buffer zone between russian and georgian troops .
the observers were on patrol near the separatist province of south ossetia in georgia " for the first time since the outbreak of hostilities in georgia last month , " the organization for security and co-operation in europe said in a statement on its web site .
conditions from russia russia has said it will only pull troops out of the buffer zone once international controls , including military observers and police , are in place in the area and once georgia signs a non-aggression pact .
russia 's foreign ministry on thursday said the subject of sending military observers and police to the buffer zone was discussed by deputy russian foreign minister vladimir titov and us ambassador to moscow john beyrle in moscow .
meanwhile , us vice president dick cheney during a visit to georgia on thursday accused russia of an " illegitimate " invasion aimed at redrawing the map of georgia and said the crisis had damaged russia 's international reputation .
" russia 's actions have cast grave doubt on russia 's intentions and on its reliability as an international partner , not just in georgia but across this region and indeed across the international system , " cheney said .
us supports nato membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us is a staunch ally of georgia he also assured georgian president mikheil saakashvili of washington 's commitment to extending the nato alliance to georgia .
russia 's move strengthened the need to bring the former soviet republic and other countries into the nato alliance , the white house had said thursday .
" the desire to bring these new countries , these new democracies , and these countries that want to live in freedom and help defend each other , is even strengthened by the past month 's activities , " spokeswoman dana perino said .
russia strongly objects to continued nato expansion and the alliance 's announcement at an april summit that it intends to invite georgia and ukraine , another former soviet state , to join .
" our support of georgia 's entry into nato started long before any of these hostilities began , " perino said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the state-owned energoinvest invited firms and investors to send non-binding letters of intent within a month .
so far , unnamed british , canadian and malaysian companies have expressed interest in drilling oil fields that may contain more than 100 million barrels .
decades ago , energoinvest along with former british and us partners had already identified five potential sites worth exploring , but the project was disrupted due to the 1992-95 bosnian war .
some 1,000 tons of crude were already pumped out in 1991 .
record crude prices have now prompted the bosnian government to revive oil and gas exploration . pipeline through the balkans in neighboring serbia , lawmakers are discussing a large scale energy project with russia , which envisages a pan-european pipeline running through the balkans .
a multi-billion dollar contract was signed between belgrade and moscow in january , but it must be ratified in the serbian parliament in order to be fully implemented .
serbia 's deputy prime minister bozidar djelic has said that the huge contract will " turn serbia into an important player on the energy map of europe . "
pro-western serbian officials have criticized the deal however , since it includes selling serbia 's state monopoly on oil at the bargain basement price of only 400 million euros . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" pakistan 's territorial integrity has to be respected , " jung said after meeting with pakistani prime minister yousaf raza gillani .
the us attack took place on wednesday this week in pakistan 's south waziristan tribal region .
it killed at least 20 people including women and children , pakistani officials say , and was the first known foreign ground assault in pakistan against a taliban haven since us forces invaded afghanistan in 2001 .
pakistan has strongly condemned the us raid and this week the government in islamabad summoned the us ambassador to protest the unusually bold raid .
the raid appeared to indicate that the united states was forging ahead with a tougher strategy to curb the growing numbers of taliban fighters crossing from pakistan to attack american and nato soldiers fighting in afghanistan .

us and afghan officials say pakistan 's remote and mountainous tribal region bordering afghanistan has become a harbor for al-qaeda and taliban militants to stage attacks since the fall of the taliban regime at the end of 2001 .
the deteriorating security situation in the rugged and increasingly porous border region has led to a rise in attacks against nato forces in afghanistan recently .
top american military commanders have warned pakistan that they would start attacking taliban havens inside pakistan ’ s tribal areas if the increased infiltration by taliban fighters into afghanistan did not stop .
jung 's meeting with muktar stressed the need for closer collaboration between western forces and pakistan in the border region .
the pakistani minister assured jung his country was deeply committed to the fight against terrorism .
muktar said pakistan has committed 100,000 soldiers to patrol the volatile border region , but that the coalition forces needed to respect pakistan 's sovereignty and avoid killing innocent civilians in the partnership against terror .
reputation of international troops at risk jung had been in afghanistan earlier in the week on an unannounced visit to support german troops anxious about the increasing risk of taliban attacks . tension has been high among the german contingent amid an upsurge of attacks from booby traps and ambushes .
last week a german soldier was killed when a remote-controlled bomb went off near an armoured vehicle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a service for the german soldier killed in afghanistan last week german troops were also responsible for civilian deaths last week when three afghans were killed after both german and afghan troops opened fire on a vehicle that had failed to stop at a checkpoint even after warning shots had been fired .
the german army has paid compensation to relatives of a woman and two children shot dead last week at a checkpoint manned by its soldiers in northern afghanistan , german daily newspaper die welt reported this week .
a defence ministry spokesperson confirmed the report this week saying defence minister jung had arranged the compensation during the visit to afghanistan to pay his respects to the relatives .
it was one of a recent string of incidents that experts say are damaging the reputation of the almost 70,000 international troops as well as the afghan government , which need the backing of the local population if they want to beat a taliban-led insurgency .

talks ran on twice as long as expected on friday , sept .
5 , as cheney met separately with president viktor yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko amid a domestic political conflict .
urging ukraine 's leader to unite , the vice president implied that russia was behind the country 's difficulties .
" we believe in the right of men and women to live without the threat of tyranny , economic blackmail or military invasion or intimidation , " said cheney , referring to russia 's recent military intervention in georgia .
" ukraine 's best hope to overcome these threats is to be united - united domestically first and foremost and united with other democracies , " he added .
tensions mount over georgian war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time for yushchenko and tymoshenko to kiss and make up ?
tymoshenko and yushchenko have been feuding in recent weeks over ukraine 's ties to russia .
yushchenko 's office had accused the prime minister of failing to support georgia when russian troops invaded the georgian enclave of south ossetia early last month .
meanwhile , tymoshenko has denied reports that she has tilted towards moscow and is about to form a new coalition with the pro-russian opposition .
however , she has not openly criticized russia over the georgia crisis .
their feud culminated in the president 's parliamentary allies walking out of the alliance on tuesday and with yushchenko threatening to dissolve parliament and call for an election if a new government is not formed within 30 days .
it would be the third election in as many years in ukraine , where yushchenko swept to power in a 2004 " orange revolution " with the promise of greater integration with the west .
cheney 's visit to the country comes as european officials suggest ukraine could be the next flashpoint for tensions between russia and the west following the war in georgia .
speaking friday in kyiv , the vice president said that the us had a " deep and abiding interest " in ukraine ’ s security .
cheney added that ukrainians should be able to live " without the threat of tyranny , economic blackmail and military invasion or intimidation . "
ukraine has applied to join the nato alliance as well as the european union , a move that has been supported by the bush administration but one which has angered moscow , which considers ukraine to be within its sphere of influence .
caught between east and west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with tough times in its past , ukraine has the bush administration 's support in joining nato with ukraine 's coalition now divided , political leaders have voiced concern that the kremlin might try to capitalize on the nation 's persistent political instability .
in light of the caucasus conflict , yushchenko has said that he sees nato membership as essential in order to protect ukraine 's territorial integrity .
" ukrainians have the right to choose whether they wish to join nato , and nato has a right to invite ukraine to join the alliance when we believe they are ready and that the time is right , " said cheney , adding that " no outside country has a veto . "
in addition to addressing ukraine 's future with the alliance , the vice president 's visit is also aimed at demonstrating us support for georgia and securing allies like ukraine against russia .
during his time in tbilisi on thursday , cheney slammed russia 's actions against georgia , calling its military invasion an " illegitimate act that undermined its credibility . "
he also reiterated the us ' support for georgian membership in nato .
while in ukraine , cheney is also slated to visit the holodomor memorial to the country 's famine victims before continuing on to italy in the afternoon . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

5 .
" the question of who bears guilt and responsibility is not the priority when people are suffering , have lost their possessions and are forced to flee , " he said .
" but i have also said that in a second phase , in which we will define our medium and long-term relations with the conflicting parties , the issue of who bears what part of the responsibility for the escalation to the point of a military conflict will play a role .
" this can not be cleared up overnight and probably never completely , " the foreign minister told the newspaper .
he acknowledged the conflict had had an impact on relations between the eu and russia and would have long-term repercussions for the west 's foreign policy , but called for ties to be improved .
" a return to the patterns of the cold war is not an attractive alternative to the laborious undertaking of returning to an ordered way of doing business , " he said .
first military observers in georgia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier meets other eu foreign ministers friday neither georgia nor russia has backed an inquiry into last month 's five-day violent conflict .
but steinmeier urged both countries to support the work of an independent team of investigators with military expertise .
" i advise both sides to open themselves to an independent investigation , " steinmeier said .
" i see no lack of institutions , for example in the framework of the un or the osce that could run the probe , he said .
" but until now , there has above all been unwillingness on both sides to take part in such an investigation . "
the osce said thursday it had dispatched a first round of military observers in a buffer zone between russian and georgian troops .
the observers were on patrol near the separatist province of south ossetia in georgia " for the first time since the outbreak of hostilities in georgia last month , " the organization for security and co-operation in europe said in a statement on its web site .
conditions from russia russia has said it will only pull troops out of the buffer zone once international controls , including military observers and police , are in place in the area and once georgia signs a non-aggression pact .
russia 's foreign ministry on thursday said the subject of sending military observers and police to the buffer zone was discussed by deputy russian foreign minister vladimir titov and us ambassador to moscow john beyrle in moscow .
meanwhile , us vice president dick cheney during a visit to georgia on thursday accused russia of an " illegitimate " invasion aimed at redrawing the map of georgia and said the crisis had damaged russia 's international reputation .
" russia 's actions have cast grave doubt on russia 's intentions and on its reliability as an international partner , not just in georgia but across this region and indeed across the international system , " cheney said .

russia 's move strengthened the need to bring the former soviet republic and other countries into the nato alliance , the white house had said thursday .
" the desire to bring these new countries , these new democracies , and these countries that want to live in freedom and help defend each other , is even strengthened by the past month 's activities , " spokeswoman dana perino said .
russia strongly objects to continued nato expansion and the alliance 's announcement at an april summit that it intends to invite georgia and ukraine , another former soviet state , to join .
" our support of georgia 's entry into nato started long before any of these hostilities began , " perino said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

5 , comes just days after an emergency eu summit on georgia and ahead of crucial talks next week between the french and russian presidents on the georgia crisis . it also coincides with us vice-president dick cheney 's visit to georgia and ukraine , widely seen to signal that washington has not turned its back on former soviet allies following the conflict in georgia . the five-day war between georgia and russia last month has sparked turmoil in the caucasus and heightened tensions between russia and the west .
russia sent tanks and troops into georgian territory on aug .
8 , a day after a georgian offensive to retake rebel south ossetia .
it has since withdrawn some forces but left others inside georgian territory . though the eu has stopped short of imposing sanctions on russia for its military push and occupation of georgian territory , it has frozen talks with moscow on a new strategic partnership pact until all russian forces withdraw from georgia . wide-ranging talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to cuts its reliance on russian gas by creating alternative routes but the informal talks in the french city of avignon wo n't just focus on the eu 's fraught relations with russia .
officials say they are likely to take in issues including energy security and relations with states such as moldova , ukraine and belarus . " the eu considers that it is more necessary than ever to support regional cooperation and step up its relations with its eastern neighbors , " eu leaders concluded at the emergency summit on monday - a meeting held in response to the russian-georgian war . the foreign ministers of the eu 's 27 member states meet informally every six months to discuss broad policy issues without the pressure to reach formal decisions . friday 's meeting is to " review the whole range of the eu 's relationship " with russia and georgia in order to see where it could " reinforce " its current policies , sources in the french government , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , told the dpa news agency . eu hopes to push democratic reforms the talks are also likely to focus on how the eu can promote democratic reforms and reconciliation in parts of the former ussr where russia and the west are competing openly for influence . diplomats said the meeting could include talks on how to handle belarus , where the authoritarian regime of president alexander lukashenko in the summer released the country 's last political prisoners in what was seen in brussels as a step towards greater freedom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe hopes to promote democracy in former soviet states ukraine also looks set to feature prominently ahead of an eu-ukraine summit scheduled for tuesday . the ministers are also likely to discuss how the eu can use its relations with moscow 's former satellites to boost its own energy security by creating supply routes which do not go through russia , officials in brussels said . that follows a call from eu leaders monday that " recent events illustrate the need for europe to intensify its efforts with regard to the security of energy supplies . " however , the ministers are not expected to propose a sudden leap towards membership for countries such as georgia and ukraine , officials said . rather , they are likely to discuss how they can improve their use of current diplomatic agreements , partnerships and financial incentives to tighten their links with their eastern neighbors without giving up on their long-standing calls for reform . they are also expected to discuss eu relations with the united states and the eu 's role in the middle east peace process . ministers are also to discuss an eu observer mission to monitor the ceasefire in georgia . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the warsaw newspaper quoted sources saying that they had seen the document but did not explicitly say that the prison served as a holding center for al-qaeda terrorist suspects as has been alleged in the american media .
the gazeta reported that according to the document the secret prison was set up after the us and poland signed an accord in 2002 to combat terrorism .
cia prison allegations surfaced in 2005 polish prosecutors had been investigating long-running allegations of a secret cia jail to interrogate top al-qaeda operatives near szymany in northeast poland .
in 2006 , the head of the secret services had presented the two-page document to two ministers from the then ruling conservative law and justice party and poland 's chief prosecutor janusz kaczmarek at the time , according to gazeta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top officials declined to speak to the polish newspaper kaczmarek confirmed the meeting with the ministers , but refused to comment on what transpired . the ex-ministers declined to speak with the newspaper .
in the past polish officials have consistently rejected media claims that warsaw allowed the cia to run a secret prison for captured islamic radicals .
polish top aide denies knowledge of memo but on friday , a top advisor to prime minister donald tusk did confirm that prosecutors were investigating the allegations , although he denied any knowledge of the secret memorandum .
" i am not familiar with such a note and i do n't think prime minister donald tusk is either , " said tusk 's aide slawomir nowak in an interview with poland 's tok fm radio .
" but the premier asked the justice minister to clarify this matter and the country 's prosecutor 's office is investigating the potential existence of the cia prison . "
back in 2005 , the washington post broke the story that cia prisons existed in europe .
close cooperation between us and polish secret services bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a top aide to poland 's tusk denied knowledge of secret memo " there definitely was cooperation between polish and american secret services , " a source close to the us intelligence agency told news agency reuters .
" but whether there was torture at the base , hopefully we will learn about that soon . "
rumors circulated in the us and foreign media that the base was operational between 2002 and 2005 at a time when poland was governed by the left-leaning governments of leszek miller and marek belka and then a rightist administration under kazimierz marcinkiewicz .
all three former leaders have denied any knowledge of such a prison or base , and tusk 's center-right government has until now also played down speculation of its existence .
" i hope this will not be confirmed , " nowak said to reuters .
" it would not only have serious consequences inside the country but would also take a very serious toll on the international scene .
this has to be investigated very carefully , without emotions . "
since the washington post story emerged , separate reports by the council of europe , the european parliament and the european commission have confirmed the existence of cia prisons in poland and romania . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the question of who bears guilt and responsibility is not the priority when people are suffering , have lost their possessions and are forced to flee , " he said .
" but i have also said that in a second phase , in which we will define our medium and long-term relations with the conflicting parties , the issue of who bears what part of the responsibility for the escalation to the point of a military conflict will play a role .
" this can not be cleared up overnight and probably never completely , " the foreign minister told the newspaper .
he acknowledged the conflict had had an impact on relations between the eu and russia and would have long-term repercussions for the west 's foreign policy , but called for ties to be improved .
" a return to the patterns of the cold war is not an attractive alternative to the laborious undertaking of returning to an ordered way of doing business , " he said .
first military observers in georgia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier meets other eu foreign ministers friday neither georgia nor russia has backed an inquiry into last month 's five-day violent conflict .
but steinmeier urged both countries to support the work of an independent team of investigators with military expertise .
" i advise both sides to open themselves to an independent investigation , " steinmeier said .
" i see no lack of institutions , for example in the framework of the un or the osce that could run the probe , he said .
" but until now , there has above all been unwillingness on both sides to take part in such an investigation . "
the osce said thursday it had dispatched a first round of military observers in a buffer zone between russian and georgian troops .
the observers were on patrol near the separatist province of south ossetia in georgia " for the first time since the outbreak of hostilities in georgia last month , " the organization for security and co-operation in europe said in a statement on its web site .
conditions from russia russia has said it will only pull troops out of the buffer zone once international controls , including military observers and police , are in place in the area and once georgia signs a non-aggression pact .
russia 's foreign ministry on thursday said the subject of sending military observers and police to the buffer zone was discussed by deputy russian foreign minister vladimir titov and us ambassador to moscow john beyrle in moscow .
meanwhile , us vice president dick cheney during a visit to georgia on thursday accused russia of an " illegitimate " invasion aimed at redrawing the map of georgia and said the crisis had damaged russia 's international reputation .
" russia 's actions have cast grave doubt on russia 's intentions and on its reliability as an international partner , not just in georgia but across this region and indeed across the international system , " cheney said .
us supports nato membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us is a staunch ally of georgia he also assured georgian president mikheil saakashvili of washington 's commitment to extending the nato alliance to georgia .
russia 's move strengthened the need to bring the former soviet republic and other countries into the nato alliance , the white house had said thursday .
" the desire to bring these new countries , these new democracies , and these countries that want to live in freedom and help defend each other , is even strengthened by the past month 's activities , " spokeswoman dana perino said .
russia strongly objects to continued nato expansion and the alliance 's announcement at an april summit that it intends to invite georgia and ukraine , another former soviet state , to join .
" our support of georgia 's entry into nato started long before any of these hostilities began , " perino said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

“ the initiative embraces all components of efficient use of battery-powered vehicles – from modern , innovative drive technology to customer-friendly infrastructure , ” the statement said .

in their coverage of the republican national convention in st. paul , european papers agreed that the star turn was alaska governor and vice presidential candidate sarah palin . " barack obama speaks to the urban middle classes , " wrote berlin 's daily tageszeitung .
" sarah palin represents the opinions of small town and rural america .
they have long been waiting for a charismatic representative .
their disgust at career politicians has been growing in recent years .
sarah palin comes across as a rebel , taking on the establishment .
unexpectedly , that makes her a threat to barack obama . "
the neue osnabruecker zeitung was not convinced .
" sarah palin gave a sterling performance at the convention , " it wrote .
" but too much should not be read into that .
at this point , too many strange and surprising details about the governor of alaska have emerged .
it seems that mccain 's people failed to vet her adequately ; especially given they were filling the most important position in a presidential candidate 's team .
this negligence is part of the problem .
might mccain continue shooting from the hip in the white house ?
to many voters , it 's an alarming prospect . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccain tends to shoot from the hip britain 's daily the guardian was equally unimpressed : " mccain , the self-styled maverick who has so often angered his own party by bucking the party line , was given a five-minute standing ovation at the start of his 50-minute speech and again at the end … .
but , a poor orator who has made few - if any - memorable speeches in the past , he failed to match either the rhetoric of obama in denver last week or even the feisty , sarcastic delivery of his own running mate , sarah palin .
some of the loudest cheers of the night were when palin , the new darling of the republican party , joined him at the end .
although the organizers said the theme of the day was " peace , " the tone of videos shown earlier in the night as well as in his speech and those of others was heavily militaristic . "
from vienna , the kurier described the nomination of sarah palin as evidence of the polarization of us society .
" the crisis in which the country found itself in recent years did nothing to unite it , whatever obama says .
on the contrary , it deepened divisions .
bush did not win elections thanks to moderates , but because he managed to mobilize the country 's right-wing .
with her angry narrow-mindedness , gun-toting palin has given these people back their pride , even with her weaknesses .
like bush when he first came to office , she appears human - especially to those americans who are made nervous by obama 's professional speeches , open-mindedness and skin color - racism does not disappear simply because one denies it exists . "
in france , the center-left daily le monde also focused as much on palin as mccain .
" in recent months it looked as though it would be the moderate republicans who decided the vote for mccain , " it wrote .
" but his choice of sarah palin as running mate is an attempt to win over the right wing of the party .
he is keen to take a stand against the harvard-educated elites , as supposedly embodied by his democratic rival barack obama .
one would have expected him to distance himself from the very unpopular george w. bush , but the convention in minneapolis reflected the current administration 's politics .
mccain is indeed what the obama camp would paint him : a natural heir to bush . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the warsaw newspaper quoted sources saying that they had seen the document but did not explicitly say that the prison served as a holding center for al-qaeda terrorist suspects as has been alleged in the american media .
the gazeta reported that according to the document the secret prison was set up after the us and poland signed an accord in 2002 to combat terrorism .
cia prison allegations surfaced in 2005 polish prosecutors had been investigating long-running allegations of a secret cia jail to interrogate top al-qaeda operatives near szymany in northeast poland .
in 2006 , the head of the secret services had presented the two-page document to two ministers from the then ruling conservative law and justice party and poland 's chief prosecutor janusz kaczmarek at the time , according to gazeta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top officials declined to speak to the polish newspaper kaczmarek confirmed the meeting with the ministers , but refused to comment on what transpired . the ex-ministers declined to speak with the newspaper .
in the past polish officials have consistently rejected media claims that warsaw allowed the cia to run a secret prison for captured islamic radicals .
polish top aide denies knowledge of memo but on friday , a top advisor to prime minister donald tusk did confirm that prosecutors were investigating the allegations , although he denied any knowledge of the secret memorandum .
" i am not familiar with such a note and i do n't think prime minister donald tusk is either , " said tusk 's aide slawomir nowak in an interview with poland 's tok fm radio .
" but the premier asked the justice minister to clarify this matter and the country 's prosecutor 's office is investigating the potential existence of the cia prison . "
back in 2005 , the washington post broke the story that cia prisons existed in europe .
close cooperation between us and polish secret services bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a top aide to poland 's tusk denied knowledge of secret memo " there definitely was cooperation between polish and american secret services , " a source close to the us intelligence agency told news agency reuters .
" but whether there was torture at the base , hopefully we will learn about that soon . "
rumors circulated in the us and foreign media that the base was operational between 2002 and 2005 at a time when poland was governed by the left-leaning governments of leszek miller and marek belka and then a rightist administration under kazimierz marcinkiewicz .
all three former leaders have denied any knowledge of such a prison or base , and tusk 's center-right government has until now also played down speculation of its existence .
" i hope this will not be confirmed , " nowak said to reuters .
" it would not only have serious consequences inside the country but would also take a very serious toll on the international scene .
this has to be investigated very carefully , without emotions . "
since the washington post story emerged , separate reports by the council of europe , the european parliament and the european commission have confirmed the existence of cia prisons in poland and romania . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the warsaw newspaper quoted sources saying that they had seen the document but did not explicitly say that the prison served as a holding center for al-qaeda terrorist suspects as has been alleged in the american media .
the gazeta reported that according to the document the secret prison was set up after the us and poland signed an accord in 2002 to combat terrorism .
cia prison allegations surfaced in 2005 polish prosecutors had been investigating long-running allegations of a secret cia jail to interrogate top al-qaeda operatives near szymany in northeast poland .
in 2006 , the head of the secret services had presented the two-page document to two ministers from the then ruling conservative law and justice party and poland 's chief prosecutor janusz kaczmarek at the time , according to gazeta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top officials declined to speak to the polish newspaper kaczmarek confirmed the meeting with the ministers , but refused to comment on what transpired . the ex-ministers declined to speak with the newspaper .
in the past polish officials have consistently rejected media claims that warsaw allowed the cia to run a secret prison for captured islamic radicals .
polish top aide denies knowledge of memo but on friday , a top advisor to prime minister donald tusk did confirm that prosecutors were investigating the allegations , although he denied any knowledge of the secret memorandum .
" i am not familiar with such a note and i do n't think prime minister donald tusk is either , " said tusk 's aide slawomir nowak in an interview with poland 's tok fm radio .
" but the premier asked the justice minister to clarify this matter and the country 's prosecutor 's office is investigating the potential existence of the cia prison . "
back in 2005 , the washington post broke the story that cia prisons existed in europe .
close cooperation between us and polish secret services bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a top aide to poland 's tusk denied knowledge of secret memo " there definitely was cooperation between polish and american secret services , " a source close to the us intelligence agency told news agency reuters .
" but whether there was torture at the base , hopefully we will learn about that soon . "
rumors circulated in the us and foreign media that the base was operational between 2002 and 2005 at a time when poland was governed by the left-leaning governments of leszek miller and marek belka and then a rightist administration under kazimierz marcinkiewicz .
all three former leaders have denied any knowledge of such a prison or base , and tusk 's center-right government has until now also played down speculation of its existence .
" i hope this will not be confirmed , " nowak said to reuters .
" it would not only have serious consequences inside the country but would also take a very serious toll on the international scene .
this has to be investigated very carefully , without emotions . "
since the washington post story emerged , separate reports by the council of europe , the european parliament and the european commission have confirmed the existence of cia prisons in poland and romania . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

talks ran on twice as long as expected on friday , sept .
5 , as cheney met separately with president viktor yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko amid a domestic political conflict .
urging ukraine 's leader to unite , the vice president implied that russia was behind the country 's difficulties .
" we believe in the right of men and women to live without the threat of tyranny , economic blackmail or military invasion or intimidation , " said cheney , referring to russia 's recent military intervention in georgia .
" ukraine 's best hope to overcome these threats is to be united - united domestically first and foremost and united with other democracies , " he added .
tensions mount over georgian war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time for yushchenko and tymoshenko to kiss and make up ?
tymoshenko and yushchenko have been feuding in recent weeks over ukraine 's ties to russia .
yushchenko 's office had accused the prime minister of failing to support georgia when russian troops invaded the georgian enclave of south ossetia early last month .
meanwhile , tymoshenko has denied reports that she has tilted towards moscow and is about to form a new coalition with the pro-russian opposition .
however , she has not openly criticized russia over the georgia crisis .
their feud culminated in the president 's parliamentary allies walking out of the alliance on tuesday and with yushchenko threatening to dissolve parliament and call for an election if a new government is not formed within 30 days .
it would be the third election in as many years in ukraine , where yushchenko swept to power in a 2004 " orange revolution " with the promise of greater integration with the west .
cheney 's visit to the country comes as european officials suggest ukraine could be the next flashpoint for tensions between russia and the west following the war in georgia .
speaking friday in kyiv , the vice president said that the us had a " deep and abiding interest " in ukraine ’ s security .
cheney added that ukrainians should be able to live " without the threat of tyranny , economic blackmail and military invasion or intimidation . "
ukraine has applied to join the nato alliance as well as the european union , a move that has been supported by the bush administration but one which has angered moscow , which considers ukraine to be within its sphere of influence .
caught between east and west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with tough times in its past , ukraine has the bush administration 's support in joining nato with ukraine 's coalition now divided , political leaders have voiced concern that the kremlin might try to capitalize on the nation 's persistent political instability .
in light of the caucasus conflict , yushchenko has said that he sees nato membership as essential in order to protect ukraine 's territorial integrity .
" ukrainians have the right to choose whether they wish to join nato , and nato has a right to invite ukraine to join the alliance when we believe they are ready and that the time is right , " said cheney , adding that " no outside country has a veto . "
in addition to addressing ukraine 's future with the alliance , the vice president 's visit is also aimed at demonstrating us support for georgia and securing allies like ukraine against russia .
during his time in tbilisi on thursday , cheney slammed russia 's actions against georgia , calling its military invasion an " illegitimate act that undermined its credibility . "
he also reiterated the us ' support for georgian membership in nato .

the warsaw newspaper quoted sources saying that they had seen the document but did not explicitly say that the prison served as a holding center for al-qaeda terrorist suspects as has been alleged in the american media .
the gazeta reported that according to the document the secret prison was set up after the us and poland signed an accord in 2002 to combat terrorism .
cia prison allegations surfaced in 2005 polish prosecutors had been investigating long-running allegations of a secret cia jail to interrogate top al-qaeda operatives near szymany in northeast poland .
in 2006 , the head of the secret services had presented the two-page document to two ministers from the then ruling conservative law and justice party and poland 's chief prosecutor janusz kaczmarek at the time , according to gazeta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top officials declined to speak to the polish newspaper kaczmarek confirmed the meeting with the ministers , but refused to comment on what transpired . the ex-ministers declined to speak with the newspaper .
in the past polish officials have consistently rejected media claims that warsaw allowed the cia to run a secret prison for captured islamic radicals .
polish top aide denies knowledge of memo but on friday , a top advisor to prime minister donald tusk did confirm that prosecutors were investigating the allegations , although he denied any knowledge of the secret memorandum .
" i am not familiar with such a note and i do n't think prime minister donald tusk is either , " said tusk 's aide slawomir nowak in an interview with poland 's tok fm radio .
" but the premier asked the justice minister to clarify this matter and the country 's prosecutor 's office is investigating the potential existence of the cia prison . "
back in 2005 , the washington post broke the story that cia prisons existed in europe .
close cooperation between us and polish secret services bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a top aide to poland 's tusk denied knowledge of secret memo " there definitely was cooperation between polish and american secret services , " a source close to the us intelligence agency told news agency reuters .
" but whether there was torture at the base , hopefully we will learn about that soon . "
rumors circulated in the us and foreign media that the base was operational between 2002 and 2005 at a time when poland was governed by the left-leaning governments of leszek miller and marek belka and then a rightist administration under kazimierz marcinkiewicz .
all three former leaders have denied any knowledge of such a prison or base , and tusk 's center-right government has until now also played down speculation of its existence .
" i hope this will not be confirmed , " nowak said to reuters .
" it would not only have serious consequences inside the country but would also take a very serious toll on the international scene .
this has to be investigated very carefully , without emotions . "
since the washington post story emerged , separate reports by the council of europe , the european parliament and the european commission have confirmed the existence of cia prisons in poland and romania . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in their coverage of the republican national convention in st. paul , european papers agreed that the star turn was alaska governor and vice presidential candidate sarah palin . " barack obama speaks to the urban middle classes , " wrote berlin 's daily tageszeitung .
" sarah palin represents the opinions of small town and rural america .
they have long been waiting for a charismatic representative .
their disgust at career politicians has been growing in recent years .
sarah palin comes across as a rebel , taking on the establishment .
unexpectedly , that makes her a threat to barack obama . "
the neue osnabruecker zeitung was not convinced .
" sarah palin gave a sterling performance at the convention , " it wrote .
" but too much should not be read into that .
at this point , too many strange and surprising details about the governor of alaska have emerged .
it seems that mccain 's people failed to vet her adequately ; especially given they were filling the most important position in a presidential candidate 's team .
this negligence is part of the problem .
might mccain continue shooting from the hip in the white house ?

but , a poor orator who has made few - if any - memorable speeches in the past , he failed to match either the rhetoric of obama in denver last week or even the feisty , sarcastic delivery of his own running mate , sarah palin .
some of the loudest cheers of the night were when palin , the new darling of the republican party , joined him at the end .
although the organizers said the theme of the day was " peace , " the tone of videos shown earlier in the night as well as in his speech and those of others was heavily militaristic . "
from vienna , the kurier described the nomination of sarah palin as evidence of the polarization of us society .
" the crisis in which the country found itself in recent years did nothing to unite it , whatever obama says .
on the contrary , it deepened divisions .
bush did not win elections thanks to moderates , but because he managed to mobilize the country 's right-wing .
with her angry narrow-mindedness , gun-toting palin has given these people back their pride , even with her weaknesses .
like bush when he first came to office , she appears human - especially to those americans who are made nervous by obama 's professional speeches , open-mindedness and skin color - racism does not disappear simply because one denies it exists . "
in france , the center-left daily le monde also focused as much on palin as mccain .
" in recent months it looked as though it would be the moderate republicans who decided the vote for mccain , " it wrote .
" but his choice of sarah palin as running mate is an attempt to win over the right wing of the party .

the warsaw newspaper quoted sources saying that they had seen the document but did not explicitly say that the prison served as a holding center for al-qaeda terrorist suspects as has been alleged in the american media .
the gazeta reported that according to the document the secret prison was set up after the us and poland signed an accord in 2002 to combat terrorism .
cia prison allegations surfaced in 2005 polish prosecutors had been investigating long-running allegations of a secret cia jail to interrogate top al-qaeda operatives near szymany in northeast poland .
in 2006 , the head of the secret services had presented the two-page document to two ministers from the then ruling conservative law and justice party and poland 's chief prosecutor janusz kaczmarek at the time , according to gazeta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top officials declined to speak to the polish newspaper kaczmarek confirmed the meeting with the ministers , but refused to comment on what transpired . the ex-ministers declined to speak with the newspaper .
in the past polish officials have consistently rejected media claims that warsaw allowed the cia to run a secret prison for captured islamic radicals .
polish top aide denies knowledge of memo but on friday , a top advisor to prime minister donald tusk did confirm that prosecutors were investigating the allegations , although he denied any knowledge of the secret memorandum .
" i am not familiar with such a note and i do n't think prime minister donald tusk is either , " said tusk 's aide slawomir nowak in an interview with poland 's tok fm radio .
" but the premier asked the justice minister to clarify this matter and the country 's prosecutor 's office is investigating the potential existence of the cia prison . "
back in 2005 , the washington post broke the story that cia prisons existed in europe .
close cooperation between us and polish secret services bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a top aide to poland 's tusk denied knowledge of secret memo " there definitely was cooperation between polish and american secret services , " a source close to the us intelligence agency told news agency reuters .
" but whether there was torture at the base , hopefully we will learn about that soon . "
rumors circulated in the us and foreign media that the base was operational between 2002 and 2005 at a time when poland was governed by the left-leaning governments of leszek miller and marek belka and then a rightist administration under kazimierz marcinkiewicz .
all three former leaders have denied any knowledge of such a prison or base , and tusk 's center-right government has until now also played down speculation of its existence .
" i hope this will not be confirmed , " nowak said to reuters .
" it would not only have serious consequences inside the country but would also take a very serious toll on the international scene .
this has to be investigated very carefully , without emotions . "
since the washington post story emerged , separate reports by the council of europe , the european parliament and the european commission have confirmed the existence of cia prisons in poland and romania . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the state-owned energoinvest invited firms and investors to send non-binding letters of intent within a month .
so far , unnamed british , canadian and malaysian companies have expressed interest in drilling oil fields that may contain more than 100 million barrels .
decades ago , energoinvest along with former british and us partners had already identified five potential sites worth exploring , but the project was disrupted due to the 1992-95 bosnian war .
some 1,000 tons of crude were already pumped out in 1991 .
record crude prices have now prompted the bosnian government to revive oil and gas exploration . pipeline through the balkans in neighboring serbia , lawmakers are discussing a large scale energy project with russia , which envisages a pan-european pipeline running through the balkans .
a multi-billion dollar contract was signed between belgrade and moscow in january , but it must be ratified in the serbian parliament in order to be fully implemented .
serbia 's deputy prime minister bozidar djelic has said that the huge contract will " turn serbia into an important player on the energy map of europe . "
pro-western serbian officials have criticized the deal however , since it includes selling serbia 's state monopoly on oil at the bargain basement price of only 400 million euros . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

5 .
" the question of who bears guilt and responsibility is not the priority when people are suffering , have lost their possessions and are forced to flee , " he said .
" but i have also said that in a second phase , in which we will define our medium and long-term relations with the conflicting parties , the issue of who bears what part of the responsibility for the escalation to the point of a military conflict will play a role .
" this can not be cleared up overnight and probably never completely , " the foreign minister told the newspaper .
he acknowledged the conflict had had an impact on relations between the eu and russia and would have long-term repercussions for the west 's foreign policy , but called for ties to be improved .
" a return to the patterns of the cold war is not an attractive alternative to the laborious undertaking of returning to an ordered way of doing business , " he said .
first military observers in georgia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier meets other eu foreign ministers friday neither georgia nor russia has backed an inquiry into last month 's five-day violent conflict .
but steinmeier urged both countries to support the work of an independent team of investigators with military expertise .
" i advise both sides to open themselves to an independent investigation , " steinmeier said .
" i see no lack of institutions , for example in the framework of the un or the osce that could run the probe , he said .
" but until now , there has above all been unwillingness on both sides to take part in such an investigation . "
the osce said thursday it had dispatched a first round of military observers in a buffer zone between russian and georgian troops .
the observers were on patrol near the separatist province of south ossetia in georgia " for the first time since the outbreak of hostilities in georgia last month , " the organization for security and co-operation in europe said in a statement on its web site .
conditions from russia russia has said it will only pull troops out of the buffer zone once international controls , including military observers and police , are in place in the area and once georgia signs a non-aggression pact .
russia 's foreign ministry on thursday said the subject of sending military observers and police to the buffer zone was discussed by deputy russian foreign minister vladimir titov and us ambassador to moscow john beyrle in moscow .
meanwhile , us vice president dick cheney during a visit to georgia on thursday accused russia of an " illegitimate " invasion aimed at redrawing the map of georgia and said the crisis had damaged russia 's international reputation .
" russia 's actions have cast grave doubt on russia 's intentions and on its reliability as an international partner , not just in georgia but across this region and indeed across the international system , " cheney said .
us supports nato membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us is a staunch ally of georgia he also assured georgian president mikheil saakashvili of washington 's commitment to extending the nato alliance to georgia .
russia 's move strengthened the need to bring the former soviet republic and other countries into the nato alliance , the white house had said thursday .
" the desire to bring these new countries , these new democracies , and these countries that want to live in freedom and help defend each other , is even strengthened by the past month 's activities , " spokeswoman dana perino said .
russia strongly objects to continued nato expansion and the alliance 's announcement at an april summit that it intends to invite georgia and ukraine , another former soviet state , to join .
" our support of georgia 's entry into nato started long before any of these hostilities began , " perino said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the state-owned energoinvest invited firms and investors to send non-binding letters of intent within a month .
so far , unnamed british , canadian and malaysian companies have expressed interest in drilling oil fields that may contain more than 100 million barrels .
decades ago , energoinvest along with former british and us partners had already identified five potential sites worth exploring , but the project was disrupted due to the 1992-95 bosnian war .
some 1,000 tons of crude were already pumped out in 1991 .
record crude prices have now prompted the bosnian government to revive oil and gas exploration . pipeline through the balkans in neighboring serbia , lawmakers are discussing a large scale energy project with russia , which envisages a pan-european pipeline running through the balkans .
a multi-billion dollar contract was signed between belgrade and moscow in january , but it must be ratified in the serbian parliament in order to be fully implemented .
serbia 's deputy prime minister bozidar djelic has said that the huge contract will " turn serbia into an important player on the energy map of europe . "
pro-western serbian officials have criticized the deal however , since it includes selling serbia 's state monopoly on oil at the bargain basement price of only 400 million euros . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

talks ran on twice as long as expected on friday , sept .
5 , as cheney met separately with president viktor yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko amid a domestic political conflict .
urging ukraine 's leader to unite , the vice president implied that russia was behind the country 's difficulties .
" we believe in the right of men and women to live without the threat of tyranny , economic blackmail or military invasion or intimidation , " said cheney , referring to russia 's recent military intervention in georgia .
" ukraine 's best hope to overcome these threats is to be united - united domestically first and foremost and united with other democracies , " he added .
tensions mount over georgian war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time for yushchenko and tymoshenko to kiss and make up ?
tymoshenko and yushchenko have been feuding in recent weeks over ukraine 's ties to russia .
yushchenko 's office had accused the prime minister of failing to support georgia when russian troops invaded the georgian enclave of south ossetia early last month .
meanwhile , tymoshenko has denied reports that she has tilted towards moscow and is about to form a new coalition with the pro-russian opposition .
however , she has not openly criticized russia over the georgia crisis .
their feud culminated in the president 's parliamentary allies walking out of the alliance on tuesday and with yushchenko threatening to dissolve parliament and call for an election if a new government is not formed within 30 days .
it would be the third election in as many years in ukraine , where yushchenko swept to power in a 2004 " orange revolution " with the promise of greater integration with the west .
cheney 's visit to the country comes as european officials suggest ukraine could be the next flashpoint for tensions between russia and the west following the war in georgia .
speaking friday in kyiv , the vice president said that the us had a " deep and abiding interest " in ukraine ’ s security .
cheney added that ukrainians should be able to live " without the threat of tyranny , economic blackmail and military invasion or intimidation . "
ukraine has applied to join the nato alliance as well as the european union , a move that has been supported by the bush administration but one which has angered moscow , which considers ukraine to be within its sphere of influence .
caught between east and west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with tough times in its past , ukraine has the bush administration 's support in joining nato with ukraine 's coalition now divided , political leaders have voiced concern that the kremlin might try to capitalize on the nation 's persistent political instability .
in light of the caucasus conflict , yushchenko has said that he sees nato membership as essential in order to protect ukraine 's territorial integrity .
" ukrainians have the right to choose whether they wish to join nato , and nato has a right to invite ukraine to join the alliance when we believe they are ready and that the time is right , " said cheney , adding that " no outside country has a veto . "
in addition to addressing ukraine 's future with the alliance , the vice president 's visit is also aimed at demonstrating us support for georgia and securing allies like ukraine against russia .
during his time in tbilisi on thursday , cheney slammed russia 's actions against georgia , calling its military invasion an " illegitimate act that undermined its credibility . "
he also reiterated the us ' support for georgian membership in nato .
while in ukraine , cheney is also slated to visit the holodomor memorial to the country 's famine victims before continuing on to italy in the afternoon . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

talks ran on twice as long as expected on friday , sept .
5 , as cheney met separately with president viktor yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko amid a domestic political conflict .
urging ukraine 's leader to unite , the vice president implied that russia was behind the country 's difficulties .
" we believe in the right of men and women to live without the threat of tyranny , economic blackmail or military invasion or intimidation , " said cheney , referring to russia 's recent military intervention in georgia .
" ukraine 's best hope to overcome these threats is to be united - united domestically first and foremost and united with other democracies , " he added .
tensions mount over georgian war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time for yushchenko and tymoshenko to kiss and make up ?
tymoshenko and yushchenko have been feuding in recent weeks over ukraine 's ties to russia .
yushchenko 's office had accused the prime minister of failing to support georgia when russian troops invaded the georgian enclave of south ossetia early last month .
meanwhile , tymoshenko has denied reports that she has tilted towards moscow and is about to form a new coalition with the pro-russian opposition .
however , she has not openly criticized russia over the georgia crisis .
their feud culminated in the president 's parliamentary allies walking out of the alliance on tuesday and with yushchenko threatening to dissolve parliament and call for an election if a new government is not formed within 30 days .
it would be the third election in as many years in ukraine , where yushchenko swept to power in a 2004 " orange revolution " with the promise of greater integration with the west .
cheney 's visit to the country comes as european officials suggest ukraine could be the next flashpoint for tensions between russia and the west following the war in georgia .
speaking friday in kyiv , the vice president said that the us had a " deep and abiding interest " in ukraine ’ s security .
cheney added that ukrainians should be able to live " without the threat of tyranny , economic blackmail and military invasion or intimidation . "
ukraine has applied to join the nato alliance as well as the european union , a move that has been supported by the bush administration but one which has angered moscow , which considers ukraine to be within its sphere of influence .
caught between east and west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with tough times in its past , ukraine has the bush administration 's support in joining nato with ukraine 's coalition now divided , political leaders have voiced concern that the kremlin might try to capitalize on the nation 's persistent political instability .
in light of the caucasus conflict , yushchenko has said that he sees nato membership as essential in order to protect ukraine 's territorial integrity .
" ukrainians have the right to choose whether they wish to join nato , and nato has a right to invite ukraine to join the alliance when we believe they are ready and that the time is right , " said cheney , adding that " no outside country has a veto . "
in addition to addressing ukraine 's future with the alliance , the vice president 's visit is also aimed at demonstrating us support for georgia and securing allies like ukraine against russia .
during his time in tbilisi on thursday , cheney slammed russia 's actions against georgia , calling its military invasion an " illegitimate act that undermined its credibility . "
he also reiterated the us ' support for georgian membership in nato .
while in ukraine , cheney is also slated to visit the holodomor memorial to the country 's famine victims before continuing on to italy in the afternoon . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" pakistan 's territorial integrity has to be respected , " jung said after meeting with pakistani prime minister yousaf raza gillani .
the us attack took place on wednesday this week in pakistan 's south waziristan tribal region .
it killed at least 20 people including women and children , pakistani officials say , and was the first known foreign ground assault in pakistan against a taliban haven since us forces invaded afghanistan in 2001 .
pakistan has strongly condemned the us raid and this week the government in islamabad summoned the us ambassador to protest the unusually bold raid .
the raid appeared to indicate that the united states was forging ahead with a tougher strategy to curb the growing numbers of taliban fighters crossing from pakistan to attack american and nato soldiers fighting in afghanistan .
security woes at pakistani-afghan border bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung , left , with the pakistani army chief , general tariq majid the german defense minister who travelled to islamabad on friday discussed security in the lawless tribal areas with his pakistani counterpart ahmad muktar .
us and afghan officials say pakistan 's remote and mountainous tribal region bordering afghanistan has become a harbor for al-qaeda and taliban militants to stage attacks since the fall of the taliban regime at the end of 2001 .
the deteriorating security situation in the rugged and increasingly porous border region has led to a rise in attacks against nato forces in afghanistan recently .
top american military commanders have warned pakistan that they would start attacking taliban havens inside pakistan ’ s tribal areas if the increased infiltration by taliban fighters into afghanistan did not stop .
jung 's meeting with muktar stressed the need for closer collaboration between western forces and pakistan in the border region .
the pakistani minister assured jung his country was deeply committed to the fight against terrorism .
muktar said pakistan has committed 100,000 soldiers to patrol the volatile border region , but that the coalition forces needed to respect pakistan 's sovereignty and avoid killing innocent civilians in the partnership against terror .
reputation of international troops at risk jung had been in afghanistan earlier in the week on an unannounced visit to support german troops anxious about the increasing risk of taliban attacks . tension has been high among the german contingent amid an upsurge of attacks from booby traps and ambushes .
last week a german soldier was killed when a remote-controlled bomb went off near an armoured vehicle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a service for the german soldier killed in afghanistan last week german troops were also responsible for civilian deaths last week when three afghans were killed after both german and afghan troops opened fire on a vehicle that had failed to stop at a checkpoint even after warning shots had been fired .
the german army has paid compensation to relatives of a woman and two children shot dead last week at a checkpoint manned by its soldiers in northern afghanistan , german daily newspaper die welt reported this week .
a defence ministry spokesperson confirmed the report this week saying defence minister jung had arranged the compensation during the visit to afghanistan to pay his respects to the relatives .
it was one of a recent string of incidents that experts say are damaging the reputation of the almost 70,000 international troops as well as the afghan government , which need the backing of the local population if they want to beat a taliban-led insurgency .
even though most german soldiers that are part of the nato-led international force in are stationed in the relatively calm north , 26 troops have died in afghanistan since the start of the mission in 2002 . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this can not be cleared up overnight and probably never completely , " the foreign minister told the newspaper .
he acknowledged the conflict had had an impact on relations between the eu and russia and would have long-term repercussions for the west 's foreign policy , but called for ties to be improved .

" the question of who bears guilt and responsibility is not the priority when people are suffering , have lost their possessions and are forced to flee , " he said .
" but i have also said that in a second phase , in which we will define our medium and long-term relations with the conflicting parties , the issue of who bears what part of the responsibility for the escalation to the point of a military conflict will play a role .
" this can not be cleared up overnight and probably never completely , " the foreign minister told the newspaper .
he acknowledged the conflict had had an impact on relations between the eu and russia and would have long-term repercussions for the west 's foreign policy , but called for ties to be improved .

russia 's foreign ministry on thursday said the subject of sending military observers and police to the buffer zone was discussed by deputy russian foreign minister vladimir titov and us ambassador to moscow john beyrle in moscow .
meanwhile , us vice president dick cheney during a visit to georgia on thursday accused russia of an " illegitimate " invasion aimed at redrawing the map of georgia and said the crisis had damaged russia 's international reputation .

in their coverage of the republican national convention in st. paul , european papers agreed that the star turn was alaska governor and vice presidential candidate sarah palin . " barack obama speaks to the urban middle classes , " wrote berlin 's daily tageszeitung .
" sarah palin represents the opinions of small town and rural america .
they have long been waiting for a charismatic representative .
their disgust at career politicians has been growing in recent years .
sarah palin comes across as a rebel , taking on the establishment .
unexpectedly , that makes her a threat to barack obama . "
the neue osnabruecker zeitung was not convinced .
" sarah palin gave a sterling performance at the convention , " it wrote .
" but too much should not be read into that .
at this point , too many strange and surprising details about the governor of alaska have emerged .
it seems that mccain 's people failed to vet her adequately ; especially given they were filling the most important position in a presidential candidate 's team .
this negligence is part of the problem .
might mccain continue shooting from the hip in the white house ?
to many voters , it 's an alarming prospect . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccain tends to shoot from the hip britain 's daily the guardian was equally unimpressed : " mccain , the self-styled maverick who has so often angered his own party by bucking the party line , was given a five-minute standing ovation at the start of his 50-minute speech and again at the end … .
but , a poor orator who has made few - if any - memorable speeches in the past , he failed to match either the rhetoric of obama in denver last week or even the feisty , sarcastic delivery of his own running mate , sarah palin .
some of the loudest cheers of the night were when palin , the new darling of the republican party , joined him at the end .
although the organizers said the theme of the day was " peace , " the tone of videos shown earlier in the night as well as in his speech and those of others was heavily militaristic . "
from vienna , the kurier described the nomination of sarah palin as evidence of the polarization of us society .
" the crisis in which the country found itself in recent years did nothing to unite it , whatever obama says .
on the contrary , it deepened divisions .
bush did not win elections thanks to moderates , but because he managed to mobilize the country 's right-wing .
with her angry narrow-mindedness , gun-toting palin has given these people back their pride , even with her weaknesses .
like bush when he first came to office , she appears human - especially to those americans who are made nervous by obama 's professional speeches , open-mindedness and skin color - racism does not disappear simply because one denies it exists . "
in france , the center-left daily le monde also focused as much on palin as mccain .
" in recent months it looked as though it would be the moderate republicans who decided the vote for mccain , " it wrote .
" but his choice of sarah palin as running mate is an attempt to win over the right wing of the party .
he is keen to take a stand against the harvard-educated elites , as supposedly embodied by his democratic rival barack obama .
one would have expected him to distance himself from the very unpopular george w. bush , but the convention in minneapolis reflected the current administration 's politics .
mccain is indeed what the obama camp would paint him : a natural heir to bush . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" pakistan 's territorial integrity has to be respected , " jung said after meeting with pakistani prime minister yousaf raza gillani .
the us attack took place on wednesday this week in pakistan 's south waziristan tribal region .
it killed at least 20 people including women and children , pakistani officials say , and was the first known foreign ground assault in pakistan against a taliban haven since us forces invaded afghanistan in 2001 .
pakistan has strongly condemned the us raid and this week the government in islamabad summoned the us ambassador to protest the unusually bold raid .
the raid appeared to indicate that the united states was forging ahead with a tougher strategy to curb the growing numbers of taliban fighters crossing from pakistan to attack american and nato soldiers fighting in afghanistan .
security woes at pakistani-afghan border bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung , left , with the pakistani army chief , general tariq majid the german defense minister who travelled to islamabad on friday discussed security in the lawless tribal areas with his pakistani counterpart ahmad muktar .
us and afghan officials say pakistan 's remote and mountainous tribal region bordering afghanistan has become a harbor for al-qaeda and taliban militants to stage attacks since the fall of the taliban regime at the end of 2001 .
the deteriorating security situation in the rugged and increasingly porous border region has led to a rise in attacks against nato forces in afghanistan recently .
top american military commanders have warned pakistan that they would start attacking taliban havens inside pakistan ’ s tribal areas if the increased infiltration by taliban fighters into afghanistan did not stop .
jung 's meeting with muktar stressed the need for closer collaboration between western forces and pakistan in the border region .
the pakistani minister assured jung his country was deeply committed to the fight against terrorism .
muktar said pakistan has committed 100,000 soldiers to patrol the volatile border region , but that the coalition forces needed to respect pakistan 's sovereignty and avoid killing innocent civilians in the partnership against terror .
reputation of international troops at risk jung had been in afghanistan earlier in the week on an unannounced visit to support german troops anxious about the increasing risk of taliban attacks . tension has been high among the german contingent amid an upsurge of attacks from booby traps and ambushes .
last week a german soldier was killed when a remote-controlled bomb went off near an armoured vehicle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a service for the german soldier killed in afghanistan last week german troops were also responsible for civilian deaths last week when three afghans were killed after both german and afghan troops opened fire on a vehicle that had failed to stop at a checkpoint even after warning shots had been fired .
the german army has paid compensation to relatives of a woman and two children shot dead last week at a checkpoint manned by its soldiers in northern afghanistan , german daily newspaper die welt reported this week .
a defence ministry spokesperson confirmed the report this week saying defence minister jung had arranged the compensation during the visit to afghanistan to pay his respects to the relatives .
it was one of a recent string of incidents that experts say are damaging the reputation of the almost 70,000 international troops as well as the afghan government , which need the backing of the local population if they want to beat a taliban-led insurgency .
even though most german soldiers that are part of the nato-led international force in are stationed in the relatively calm north , 26 troops have died in afghanistan since the start of the mission in 2002 . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" pakistan 's territorial integrity has to be respected , " jung said after meeting with pakistani prime minister yousaf raza gillani .
the us attack took place on wednesday this week in pakistan 's south waziristan tribal region .
it killed at least 20 people including women and children , pakistani officials say , and was the first known foreign ground assault in pakistan against a taliban haven since us forces invaded afghanistan in 2001 .
pakistan has strongly condemned the us raid and this week the government in islamabad summoned the us ambassador to protest the unusually bold raid .
the raid appeared to indicate that the united states was forging ahead with a tougher strategy to curb the growing numbers of taliban fighters crossing from pakistan to attack american and nato soldiers fighting in afghanistan .
security woes at pakistani-afghan border bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung , left , with the pakistani army chief , general tariq majid the german defense minister who travelled to islamabad on friday discussed security in the lawless tribal areas with his pakistani counterpart ahmad muktar .
us and afghan officials say pakistan 's remote and mountainous tribal region bordering afghanistan has become a harbor for al-qaeda and taliban militants to stage attacks since the fall of the taliban regime at the end of 2001 .
the deteriorating security situation in the rugged and increasingly porous border region has led to a rise in attacks against nato forces in afghanistan recently .
top american military commanders have warned pakistan that they would start attacking taliban havens inside pakistan ’ s tribal areas if the increased infiltration by taliban fighters into afghanistan did not stop .
jung 's meeting with muktar stressed the need for closer collaboration between western forces and pakistan in the border region .
the pakistani minister assured jung his country was deeply committed to the fight against terrorism .
muktar said pakistan has committed 100,000 soldiers to patrol the volatile border region , but that the coalition forces needed to respect pakistan 's sovereignty and avoid killing innocent civilians in the partnership against terror .
reputation of international troops at risk jung had been in afghanistan earlier in the week on an unannounced visit to support german troops anxious about the increasing risk of taliban attacks . tension has been high among the german contingent amid an upsurge of attacks from booby traps and ambushes .
last week a german soldier was killed when a remote-controlled bomb went off near an armoured vehicle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a service for the german soldier killed in afghanistan last week german troops were also responsible for civilian deaths last week when three afghans were killed after both german and afghan troops opened fire on a vehicle that had failed to stop at a checkpoint even after warning shots had been fired .
the german army has paid compensation to relatives of a woman and two children shot dead last week at a checkpoint manned by its soldiers in northern afghanistan , german daily newspaper die welt reported this week .
a defence ministry spokesperson confirmed the report this week saying defence minister jung had arranged the compensation during the visit to afghanistan to pay his respects to the relatives .
it was one of a recent string of incidents that experts say are damaging the reputation of the almost 70,000 international troops as well as the afghan government , which need the backing of the local population if they want to beat a taliban-led insurgency .
even though most german soldiers that are part of the nato-led international force in are stationed in the relatively calm north , 26 troops have died in afghanistan since the start of the mission in 2002 . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the state-owned energoinvest invited firms and investors to send non-binding letters of intent within a month .
so far , unnamed british , canadian and malaysian companies have expressed interest in drilling oil fields that may contain more than 100 million barrels .
decades ago , energoinvest along with former british and us partners had already identified five potential sites worth exploring , but the project was disrupted due to the 1992-95 bosnian war .
some 1,000 tons of crude were already pumped out in 1991 .

in their coverage of the republican national convention in st. paul , european papers agreed that the star turn was alaska governor and vice presidential candidate sarah palin . " barack obama speaks to the urban middle classes , " wrote berlin 's daily tageszeitung .
" sarah palin represents the opinions of small town and rural america .
they have long been waiting for a charismatic representative .
their disgust at career politicians has been growing in recent years .
sarah palin comes across as a rebel , taking on the establishment .
unexpectedly , that makes her a threat to barack obama . "
the neue osnabruecker zeitung was not convinced .
" sarah palin gave a sterling performance at the convention , " it wrote .
" but too much should not be read into that .
at this point , too many strange and surprising details about the governor of alaska have emerged .
it seems that mccain 's people failed to vet her adequately ; especially given they were filling the most important position in a presidential candidate 's team .
this negligence is part of the problem .
might mccain continue shooting from the hip in the white house ?
to many voters , it 's an alarming prospect . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccain tends to shoot from the hip britain 's daily the guardian was equally unimpressed : " mccain , the self-styled maverick who has so often angered his own party by bucking the party line , was given a five-minute standing ovation at the start of his 50-minute speech and again at the end … .
but , a poor orator who has made few - if any - memorable speeches in the past , he failed to match either the rhetoric of obama in denver last week or even the feisty , sarcastic delivery of his own running mate , sarah palin .
some of the loudest cheers of the night were when palin , the new darling of the republican party , joined him at the end .
although the organizers said the theme of the day was " peace , " the tone of videos shown earlier in the night as well as in his speech and those of others was heavily militaristic . "
from vienna , the kurier described the nomination of sarah palin as evidence of the polarization of us society .
" the crisis in which the country found itself in recent years did nothing to unite it , whatever obama says .
on the contrary , it deepened divisions .
bush did not win elections thanks to moderates , but because he managed to mobilize the country 's right-wing .
with her angry narrow-mindedness , gun-toting palin has given these people back their pride , even with her weaknesses .
like bush when he first came to office , she appears human - especially to those americans who are made nervous by obama 's professional speeches , open-mindedness and skin color - racism does not disappear simply because one denies it exists . "
in france , the center-left daily le monde also focused as much on palin as mccain .
" in recent months it looked as though it would be the moderate republicans who decided the vote for mccain , " it wrote .
" but his choice of sarah palin as running mate is an attempt to win over the right wing of the party .
he is keen to take a stand against the harvard-educated elites , as supposedly embodied by his democratic rival barack obama .
one would have expected him to distance himself from the very unpopular george w. bush , but the convention in minneapolis reflected the current administration 's politics .
mccain is indeed what the obama camp would paint him : a natural heir to bush . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the carmaker is to supply 100 cars powered by lithium-ion batteries .
the cars will mostly be from its smart car models and will have a range of about 100 kilometres from a single charge .
they can not be recharged from an ordinary power socket .
rwe is to set up 500 special charging sites -lrb- supply points -rrb- at owners ' homes , workplaces and in car parks and shopping centres .
owners will be automatically billed for recharging , similar to the way they pay mobile phone bills .
biggest in the world the berlin scheme is the second electric car test project initiated by daimler , after electric smart cars started a trial as fleet vehicles for the police and other services in london last year .
dubbed “ e-mobility berlin , ” the scheme will be the largest of its kind in the world and is set to start by 2010 , the two companies said in a statement .
“ the initiative embraces all components of efficient use of battery-powered vehicles – from modern , innovative drive technology to customer-friendly infrastructure , ” the statement said .
at the launch of the project , chancellor angela merkel , who is a physicist , was gently critical , saying , " one hundred cars is not that many for 500 supply points . "
but she also forecast that electric cars " will prevail sooner than people think . "
other critics said it will take six hours connected to the electricity network to fully recharge a lithium-ion car battery , though two hours is enough to achieve two thirds of a recharge .
sustainable travel ?
the cars can not make long out-of-town journeys because of their limited range .
but the german government is supporting the scheme because of its contribution to sustainable travel , the companies said .
“ our mobility concept sets up an integrated solution that combines everyday electric cars and a charging system built to suit them , ” said daimler head dieter zetsche .

the warsaw newspaper quoted sources saying that they had seen the document but did not explicitly say that the prison served as a holding center for al-qaeda terrorist suspects as has been alleged in the american media .
the gazeta reported that according to the document the secret prison was set up after the us and poland signed an accord in 2002 to combat terrorism .
cia prison allegations surfaced in 2005 polish prosecutors had been investigating long-running allegations of a secret cia jail to interrogate top al-qaeda operatives near szymany in northeast poland .
in 2006 , the head of the secret services had presented the two-page document to two ministers from the then ruling conservative law and justice party and poland 's chief prosecutor janusz kaczmarek at the time , according to gazeta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top officials declined to speak to the polish newspaper kaczmarek confirmed the meeting with the ministers , but refused to comment on what transpired . the ex-ministers declined to speak with the newspaper .
in the past polish officials have consistently rejected media claims that warsaw allowed the cia to run a secret prison for captured islamic radicals .
polish top aide denies knowledge of memo but on friday , a top advisor to prime minister donald tusk did confirm that prosecutors were investigating the allegations , although he denied any knowledge of the secret memorandum .
" i am not familiar with such a note and i do n't think prime minister donald tusk is either , " said tusk 's aide slawomir nowak in an interview with poland 's tok fm radio .

the warsaw newspaper quoted sources saying that they had seen the document but did not explicitly say that the prison served as a holding center for al-qaeda terrorist suspects as has been alleged in the american media .
the gazeta reported that according to the document the secret prison was set up after the us and poland signed an accord in 2002 to combat terrorism .
cia prison allegations surfaced in 2005 polish prosecutors had been investigating long-running allegations of a secret cia jail to interrogate top al-qaeda operatives near szymany in northeast poland .
in 2006 , the head of the secret services had presented the two-page document to two ministers from the then ruling conservative law and justice party and poland 's chief prosecutor janusz kaczmarek at the time , according to gazeta .

polish top aide denies knowledge of memo but on friday , a top advisor to prime minister donald tusk did confirm that prosecutors were investigating the allegations , although he denied any knowledge of the secret memorandum .
" i am not familiar with such a note and i do n't think prime minister donald tusk is either , " said tusk 's aide slawomir nowak in an interview with poland 's tok fm radio .

the state-owned energoinvest invited firms and investors to send non-binding letters of intent within a month .
so far , unnamed british , canadian and malaysian companies have expressed interest in drilling oil fields that may contain more than 100 million barrels .

" pakistan 's territorial integrity has to be respected , " jung said after meeting with pakistani prime minister yousaf raza gillani .
the us attack took place on wednesday this week in pakistan 's south waziristan tribal region .
it killed at least 20 people including women and children , pakistani officials say , and was the first known foreign ground assault in pakistan against a taliban haven since us forces invaded afghanistan in 2001 .
pakistan has strongly condemned the us raid and this week the government in islamabad summoned the us ambassador to protest the unusually bold raid .
the raid appeared to indicate that the united states was forging ahead with a tougher strategy to curb the growing numbers of taliban fighters crossing from pakistan to attack american and nato soldiers fighting in afghanistan .
security woes at pakistani-afghan border bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung , left , with the pakistani army chief , general tariq majid the german defense minister who travelled to islamabad on friday discussed security in the lawless tribal areas with his pakistani counterpart ahmad muktar .
us and afghan officials say pakistan 's remote and mountainous tribal region bordering afghanistan has become a harbor for al-qaeda and taliban militants to stage attacks since the fall of the taliban regime at the end of 2001 .
the deteriorating security situation in the rugged and increasingly porous border region has led to a rise in attacks against nato forces in afghanistan recently .
top american military commanders have warned pakistan that they would start attacking taliban havens inside pakistan ’ s tribal areas if the increased infiltration by taliban fighters into afghanistan did not stop .
jung 's meeting with muktar stressed the need for closer collaboration between western forces and pakistan in the border region .
the pakistani minister assured jung his country was deeply committed to the fight against terrorism .
muktar said pakistan has committed 100,000 soldiers to patrol the volatile border region , but that the coalition forces needed to respect pakistan 's sovereignty and avoid killing innocent civilians in the partnership against terror .
reputation of international troops at risk jung had been in afghanistan earlier in the week on an unannounced visit to support german troops anxious about the increasing risk of taliban attacks . tension has been high among the german contingent amid an upsurge of attacks from booby traps and ambushes .
last week a german soldier was killed when a remote-controlled bomb went off near an armoured vehicle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a service for the german soldier killed in afghanistan last week german troops were also responsible for civilian deaths last week when three afghans were killed after both german and afghan troops opened fire on a vehicle that had failed to stop at a checkpoint even after warning shots had been fired .
the german army has paid compensation to relatives of a woman and two children shot dead last week at a checkpoint manned by its soldiers in northern afghanistan , german daily newspaper die welt reported this week .
a defence ministry spokesperson confirmed the report this week saying defence minister jung had arranged the compensation during the visit to afghanistan to pay his respects to the relatives .
it was one of a recent string of incidents that experts say are damaging the reputation of the almost 70,000 international troops as well as the afghan government , which need the backing of the local population if they want to beat a taliban-led insurgency .
even though most german soldiers that are part of the nato-led international force in are stationed in the relatively calm north , 26 troops have died in afghanistan since the start of the mission in 2002 . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

talks ran on twice as long as expected on friday , sept .
5 , as cheney met separately with president viktor yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko amid a domestic political conflict .
urging ukraine 's leader to unite , the vice president implied that russia was behind the country 's difficulties .
" we believe in the right of men and women to live without the threat of tyranny , economic blackmail or military invasion or intimidation , " said cheney , referring to russia 's recent military intervention in georgia .
" ukraine 's best hope to overcome these threats is to be united - united domestically first and foremost and united with other democracies , " he added .
tensions mount over georgian war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time for yushchenko and tymoshenko to kiss and make up ?
tymoshenko and yushchenko have been feuding in recent weeks over ukraine 's ties to russia .
yushchenko 's office had accused the prime minister of failing to support georgia when russian troops invaded the georgian enclave of south ossetia early last month .
meanwhile , tymoshenko has denied reports that she has tilted towards moscow and is about to form a new coalition with the pro-russian opposition .
however , she has not openly criticized russia over the georgia crisis .
their feud culminated in the president 's parliamentary allies walking out of the alliance on tuesday and with yushchenko threatening to dissolve parliament and call for an election if a new government is not formed within 30 days .
it would be the third election in as many years in ukraine , where yushchenko swept to power in a 2004 " orange revolution " with the promise of greater integration with the west .
cheney 's visit to the country comes as european officials suggest ukraine could be the next flashpoint for tensions between russia and the west following the war in georgia .
speaking friday in kyiv , the vice president said that the us had a " deep and abiding interest " in ukraine ’ s security .
cheney added that ukrainians should be able to live " without the threat of tyranny , economic blackmail and military invasion or intimidation . "
ukraine has applied to join the nato alliance as well as the european union , a move that has been supported by the bush administration but one which has angered moscow , which considers ukraine to be within its sphere of influence .
caught between east and west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with tough times in its past , ukraine has the bush administration 's support in joining nato with ukraine 's coalition now divided , political leaders have voiced concern that the kremlin might try to capitalize on the nation 's persistent political instability .
in light of the caucasus conflict , yushchenko has said that he sees nato membership as essential in order to protect ukraine 's territorial integrity .
" ukrainians have the right to choose whether they wish to join nato , and nato has a right to invite ukraine to join the alliance when we believe they are ready and that the time is right , " said cheney , adding that " no outside country has a veto . "
in addition to addressing ukraine 's future with the alliance , the vice president 's visit is also aimed at demonstrating us support for georgia and securing allies like ukraine against russia .
during his time in tbilisi on thursday , cheney slammed russia 's actions against georgia , calling its military invasion an " illegitimate act that undermined its credibility . "
he also reiterated the us ' support for georgian membership in nato .
while in ukraine , cheney is also slated to visit the holodomor memorial to the country 's famine victims before continuing on to italy in the afternoon . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" pakistan 's territorial integrity has to be respected , " jung said after meeting with pakistani prime minister yousaf raza gillani .
the us attack took place on wednesday this week in pakistan 's south waziristan tribal region .
it killed at least 20 people including women and children , pakistani officials say , and was the first known foreign ground assault in pakistan against a taliban haven since us forces invaded afghanistan in 2001 .
pakistan has strongly condemned the us raid and this week the government in islamabad summoned the us ambassador to protest the unusually bold raid .
the raid appeared to indicate that the united states was forging ahead with a tougher strategy to curb the growing numbers of taliban fighters crossing from pakistan to attack american and nato soldiers fighting in afghanistan .
security woes at pakistani-afghan border bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung , left , with the pakistani army chief , general tariq majid the german defense minister who travelled to islamabad on friday discussed security in the lawless tribal areas with his pakistani counterpart ahmad muktar .
us and afghan officials say pakistan 's remote and mountainous tribal region bordering afghanistan has become a harbor for al-qaeda and taliban militants to stage attacks since the fall of the taliban regime at the end of 2001 .
the deteriorating security situation in the rugged and increasingly porous border region has led to a rise in attacks against nato forces in afghanistan recently .
top american military commanders have warned pakistan that they would start attacking taliban havens inside pakistan ’ s tribal areas if the increased infiltration by taliban fighters into afghanistan did not stop .
jung 's meeting with muktar stressed the need for closer collaboration between western forces and pakistan in the border region .
the pakistani minister assured jung his country was deeply committed to the fight against terrorism .
muktar said pakistan has committed 100,000 soldiers to patrol the volatile border region , but that the coalition forces needed to respect pakistan 's sovereignty and avoid killing innocent civilians in the partnership against terror .
reputation of international troops at risk jung had been in afghanistan earlier in the week on an unannounced visit to support german troops anxious about the increasing risk of taliban attacks . tension has been high among the german contingent amid an upsurge of attacks from booby traps and ambushes .
last week a german soldier was killed when a remote-controlled bomb went off near an armoured vehicle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a service for the german soldier killed in afghanistan last week german troops were also responsible for civilian deaths last week when three afghans were killed after both german and afghan troops opened fire on a vehicle that had failed to stop at a checkpoint even after warning shots had been fired .
the german army has paid compensation to relatives of a woman and two children shot dead last week at a checkpoint manned by its soldiers in northern afghanistan , german daily newspaper die welt reported this week .
a defence ministry spokesperson confirmed the report this week saying defence minister jung had arranged the compensation during the visit to afghanistan to pay his respects to the relatives .
it was one of a recent string of incidents that experts say are damaging the reputation of the almost 70,000 international troops as well as the afghan government , which need the backing of the local population if they want to beat a taliban-led insurgency .
even though most german soldiers that are part of the nato-led international force in are stationed in the relatively calm north , 26 troops have died in afghanistan since the start of the mission in 2002 . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

5 , comes just days after an emergency eu summit on georgia and ahead of crucial talks next week between the french and russian presidents on the georgia crisis . it also coincides with us vice-president dick cheney 's visit to georgia and ukraine , widely seen to signal that washington has not turned its back on former soviet allies following the conflict in georgia . the five-day war between georgia and russia last month has sparked turmoil in the caucasus and heightened tensions between russia and the west .
russia sent tanks and troops into georgian territory on aug .
8 , a day after a georgian offensive to retake rebel south ossetia .
it has since withdrawn some forces but left others inside georgian territory . though the eu has stopped short of imposing sanctions on russia for its military push and occupation of georgian territory , it has frozen talks with moscow on a new strategic partnership pact until all russian forces withdraw from georgia . wide-ranging talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to cuts its reliance on russian gas by creating alternative routes but the informal talks in the french city of avignon wo n't just focus on the eu 's fraught relations with russia .

5 .
" the question of who bears guilt and responsibility is not the priority when people are suffering , have lost their possessions and are forced to flee , " he said .
" but i have also said that in a second phase , in which we will define our medium and long-term relations with the conflicting parties , the issue of who bears what part of the responsibility for the escalation to the point of a military conflict will play a role .
" this can not be cleared up overnight and probably never completely , " the foreign minister told the newspaper .
he acknowledged the conflict had had an impact on relations between the eu and russia and would have long-term repercussions for the west 's foreign policy , but called for ties to be improved .
" a return to the patterns of the cold war is not an attractive alternative to the laborious undertaking of returning to an ordered way of doing business , " he said .
first military observers in georgia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier meets other eu foreign ministers friday neither georgia nor russia has backed an inquiry into last month 's five-day violent conflict .
but steinmeier urged both countries to support the work of an independent team of investigators with military expertise .
" i advise both sides to open themselves to an independent investigation , " steinmeier said .
" i see no lack of institutions , for example in the framework of the un or the osce that could run the probe , he said .
" but until now , there has above all been unwillingness on both sides to take part in such an investigation . "
the osce said thursday it had dispatched a first round of military observers in a buffer zone between russian and georgian troops .
the observers were on patrol near the separatist province of south ossetia in georgia " for the first time since the outbreak of hostilities in georgia last month , " the organization for security and co-operation in europe said in a statement on its web site .
conditions from russia russia has said it will only pull troops out of the buffer zone once international controls , including military observers and police , are in place in the area and once georgia signs a non-aggression pact .
russia 's foreign ministry on thursday said the subject of sending military observers and police to the buffer zone was discussed by deputy russian foreign minister vladimir titov and us ambassador to moscow john beyrle in moscow .
meanwhile , us vice president dick cheney during a visit to georgia on thursday accused russia of an " illegitimate " invasion aimed at redrawing the map of georgia and said the crisis had damaged russia 's international reputation .
" russia 's actions have cast grave doubt on russia 's intentions and on its reliability as an international partner , not just in georgia but across this region and indeed across the international system , " cheney said .
us supports nato membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us is a staunch ally of georgia he also assured georgian president mikheil saakashvili of washington 's commitment to extending the nato alliance to georgia .
russia 's move strengthened the need to bring the former soviet republic and other countries into the nato alliance , the white house had said thursday .
" the desire to bring these new countries , these new democracies , and these countries that want to live in freedom and help defend each other , is even strengthened by the past month 's activities , " spokeswoman dana perino said .
russia strongly objects to continued nato expansion and the alliance 's announcement at an april summit that it intends to invite georgia and ukraine , another former soviet state , to join .
" our support of georgia 's entry into nato started long before any of these hostilities began , " perino said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

talks ran on twice as long as expected on friday , sept .

urging ukraine 's leader to unite , the vice president implied that russia was behind the country 's difficulties .
" we believe in the right of men and women to live without the threat of tyranny , economic blackmail or military invasion or intimidation , " said cheney , referring to russia 's recent military intervention in georgia .
" ukraine 's best hope to overcome these threats is to be united - united domestically first and foremost and united with other democracies , " he added .
tensions mount over georgian war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time for yushchenko and tymoshenko to kiss and make up ?
tymoshenko and yushchenko have been feuding in recent weeks over ukraine 's ties to russia .
yushchenko 's office had accused the prime minister of failing to support georgia when russian troops invaded the georgian enclave of south ossetia early last month .
meanwhile , tymoshenko has denied reports that she has tilted towards moscow and is about to form a new coalition with the pro-russian opposition .
however , she has not openly criticized russia over the georgia crisis .
their feud culminated in the president 's parliamentary allies walking out of the alliance on tuesday and with yushchenko threatening to dissolve parliament and call for an election if a new government is not formed within 30 days .
it would be the third election in as many years in ukraine , where yushchenko swept to power in a 2004 " orange revolution " with the promise of greater integration with the west .
cheney 's visit to the country comes as european officials suggest ukraine could be the next flashpoint for tensions between russia and the west following the war in georgia .
speaking friday in kyiv , the vice president said that the us had a " deep and abiding interest " in ukraine ’ s security .
cheney added that ukrainians should be able to live " without the threat of tyranny , economic blackmail and military invasion or intimidation . "
ukraine has applied to join the nato alliance as well as the european union , a move that has been supported by the bush administration but one which has angered moscow , which considers ukraine to be within its sphere of influence .

in light of the caucasus conflict , yushchenko has said that he sees nato membership as essential in order to protect ukraine 's territorial integrity .
" ukrainians have the right to choose whether they wish to join nato , and nato has a right to invite ukraine to join the alliance when we believe they are ready and that the time is right , " said cheney , adding that " no outside country has a veto . "
in addition to addressing ukraine 's future with the alliance , the vice president 's visit is also aimed at demonstrating us support for georgia and securing allies like ukraine against russia .
during his time in tbilisi on thursday , cheney slammed russia 's actions against georgia , calling its military invasion an " illegitimate act that undermined its credibility . "
he also reiterated the us ' support for georgian membership in nato .

urging ukraine 's leader to unite , the vice president implied that russia was behind the country 's difficulties .
" we believe in the right of men and women to live without the threat of tyranny , economic blackmail or military invasion or intimidation , " said cheney , referring to russia 's recent military intervention in georgia .

tensions mount over georgian war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time for yushchenko and tymoshenko to kiss and make up ?
tymoshenko and yushchenko have been feuding in recent weeks over ukraine 's ties to russia .
yushchenko 's office had accused the prime minister of failing to support georgia when russian troops invaded the georgian enclave of south ossetia early last month .
meanwhile , tymoshenko has denied reports that she has tilted towards moscow and is about to form a new coalition with the pro-russian opposition .
however , she has not openly criticized russia over the georgia crisis .
their feud culminated in the president 's parliamentary allies walking out of the alliance on tuesday and with yushchenko threatening to dissolve parliament and call for an election if a new government is not formed within 30 days .
it would be the third election in as many years in ukraine , where yushchenko swept to power in a 2004 " orange revolution " with the promise of greater integration with the west .
cheney 's visit to the country comes as european officials suggest ukraine could be the next flashpoint for tensions between russia and the west following the war in georgia .
speaking friday in kyiv , the vice president said that the us had a " deep and abiding interest " in ukraine ’ s security .
cheney added that ukrainians should be able to live " without the threat of tyranny , economic blackmail and military invasion or intimidation . "
ukraine has applied to join the nato alliance as well as the european union , a move that has been supported by the bush administration but one which has angered moscow , which considers ukraine to be within its sphere of influence .
caught between east and west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with tough times in its past , ukraine has the bush administration 's support in joining nato with ukraine 's coalition now divided , political leaders have voiced concern that the kremlin might try to capitalize on the nation 's persistent political instability .
in light of the caucasus conflict , yushchenko has said that he sees nato membership as essential in order to protect ukraine 's territorial integrity .
" ukrainians have the right to choose whether they wish to join nato , and nato has a right to invite ukraine to join the alliance when we believe they are ready and that the time is right , " said cheney , adding that " no outside country has a veto . "
in addition to addressing ukraine 's future with the alliance , the vice president 's visit is also aimed at demonstrating us support for georgia and securing allies like ukraine against russia .
during his time in tbilisi on thursday , cheney slammed russia 's actions against georgia , calling its military invasion an " illegitimate act that undermined its credibility . "
he also reiterated the us ' support for georgian membership in nato .

tymoshenko and yushchenko have been feuding in recent weeks over ukraine 's ties to russia .
yushchenko 's office had accused the prime minister of failing to support georgia when russian troops invaded the georgian enclave of south ossetia early last month .
meanwhile , tymoshenko has denied reports that she has tilted towards moscow and is about to form a new coalition with the pro-russian opposition .
however , she has not openly criticized russia over the georgia crisis .
their feud culminated in the president 's parliamentary allies walking out of the alliance on tuesday and with yushchenko threatening to dissolve parliament and call for an election if a new government is not formed within 30 days .
it would be the third election in as many years in ukraine , where yushchenko swept to power in a 2004 " orange revolution " with the promise of greater integration with the west .
cheney 's visit to the country comes as european officials suggest ukraine could be the next flashpoint for tensions between russia and the west following the war in georgia .
speaking friday in kyiv , the vice president said that the us had a " deep and abiding interest " in ukraine ’ s security .
cheney added that ukrainians should be able to live " without the threat of tyranny , economic blackmail and military invasion or intimidation . "
ukraine has applied to join the nato alliance as well as the european union , a move that has been supported by the bush administration but one which has angered moscow , which considers ukraine to be within its sphere of influence .
caught between east and west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with tough times in its past , ukraine has the bush administration 's support in joining nato with ukraine 's coalition now divided , political leaders have voiced concern that the kremlin might try to capitalize on the nation 's persistent political instability .
in light of the caucasus conflict , yushchenko has said that he sees nato membership as essential in order to protect ukraine 's territorial integrity .
" ukrainians have the right to choose whether they wish to join nato , and nato has a right to invite ukraine to join the alliance when we believe they are ready and that the time is right , " said cheney , adding that " no outside country has a veto . "
in addition to addressing ukraine 's future with the alliance , the vice president 's visit is also aimed at demonstrating us support for georgia and securing allies like ukraine against russia .
during his time in tbilisi on thursday , cheney slammed russia 's actions against georgia , calling its military invasion an " illegitimate act that undermined its credibility . "
he also reiterated the us ' support for georgian membership in nato .
while in ukraine , cheney is also slated to visit the holodomor memorial to the country 's famine victims before continuing on to italy in the afternoon . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

5 , comes just days after an emergency eu summit on georgia and ahead of crucial talks next week between the french and russian presidents on the georgia crisis . it also coincides with us vice-president dick cheney 's visit to georgia and ukraine , widely seen to signal that washington has not turned its back on former soviet allies following the conflict in georgia . the five-day war between georgia and russia last month has sparked turmoil in the caucasus and heightened tensions between russia and the west .
russia sent tanks and troops into georgian territory on aug .
8 , a day after a georgian offensive to retake rebel south ossetia .
it has since withdrawn some forces but left others inside georgian territory . though the eu has stopped short of imposing sanctions on russia for its military push and occupation of georgian territory , it has frozen talks with moscow on a new strategic partnership pact until all russian forces withdraw from georgia . wide-ranging talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to cuts its reliance on russian gas by creating alternative routes but the informal talks in the french city of avignon wo n't just focus on the eu 's fraught relations with russia .
officials say they are likely to take in issues including energy security and relations with states such as moldova , ukraine and belarus . " the eu considers that it is more necessary than ever to support regional cooperation and step up its relations with its eastern neighbors , " eu leaders concluded at the emergency summit on monday - a meeting held in response to the russian-georgian war . the foreign ministers of the eu 's 27 member states meet informally every six months to discuss broad policy issues without the pressure to reach formal decisions . friday 's meeting is to " review the whole range of the eu 's relationship " with russia and georgia in order to see where it could " reinforce " its current policies , sources in the french government , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , told the dpa news agency . eu hopes to push democratic reforms the talks are also likely to focus on how the eu can promote democratic reforms and reconciliation in parts of the former ussr where russia and the west are competing openly for influence . diplomats said the meeting could include talks on how to handle belarus , where the authoritarian regime of president alexander lukashenko in the summer released the country 's last political prisoners in what was seen in brussels as a step towards greater freedom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe hopes to promote democracy in former soviet states ukraine also looks set to feature prominently ahead of an eu-ukraine summit scheduled for tuesday . the ministers are also likely to discuss how the eu can use its relations with moscow 's former satellites to boost its own energy security by creating supply routes which do not go through russia , officials in brussels said . that follows a call from eu leaders monday that " recent events illustrate the need for europe to intensify its efforts with regard to the security of energy supplies . " however , the ministers are not expected to propose a sudden leap towards membership for countries such as georgia and ukraine , officials said . rather , they are likely to discuss how they can improve their use of current diplomatic agreements , partnerships and financial incentives to tighten their links with their eastern neighbors without giving up on their long-standing calls for reform . they are also expected to discuss eu relations with the united states and the eu 's role in the middle east peace process . ministers are also to discuss an eu observer mission to monitor the ceasefire in georgia . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

5 .
" the question of who bears guilt and responsibility is not the priority when people are suffering , have lost their possessions and are forced to flee , " he said .
" but i have also said that in a second phase , in which we will define our medium and long-term relations with the conflicting parties , the issue of who bears what part of the responsibility for the escalation to the point of a military conflict will play a role .
" this can not be cleared up overnight and probably never completely , " the foreign minister told the newspaper .
he acknowledged the conflict had had an impact on relations between the eu and russia and would have long-term repercussions for the west 's foreign policy , but called for ties to be improved .
" a return to the patterns of the cold war is not an attractive alternative to the laborious undertaking of returning to an ordered way of doing business , " he said .
first military observers in georgia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier meets other eu foreign ministers friday neither georgia nor russia has backed an inquiry into last month 's five-day violent conflict .
but steinmeier urged both countries to support the work of an independent team of investigators with military expertise .
" i advise both sides to open themselves to an independent investigation , " steinmeier said .
" i see no lack of institutions , for example in the framework of the un or the osce that could run the probe , he said .
" but until now , there has above all been unwillingness on both sides to take part in such an investigation . "
the osce said thursday it had dispatched a first round of military observers in a buffer zone between russian and georgian troops .
the observers were on patrol near the separatist province of south ossetia in georgia " for the first time since the outbreak of hostilities in georgia last month , " the organization for security and co-operation in europe said in a statement on its web site .
conditions from russia russia has said it will only pull troops out of the buffer zone once international controls , including military observers and police , are in place in the area and once georgia signs a non-aggression pact .
russia 's foreign ministry on thursday said the subject of sending military observers and police to the buffer zone was discussed by deputy russian foreign minister vladimir titov and us ambassador to moscow john beyrle in moscow .
meanwhile , us vice president dick cheney during a visit to georgia on thursday accused russia of an " illegitimate " invasion aimed at redrawing the map of georgia and said the crisis had damaged russia 's international reputation .
" russia 's actions have cast grave doubt on russia 's intentions and on its reliability as an international partner , not just in georgia but across this region and indeed across the international system , " cheney said .
us supports nato membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us is a staunch ally of georgia he also assured georgian president mikheil saakashvili of washington 's commitment to extending the nato alliance to georgia .
russia 's move strengthened the need to bring the former soviet republic and other countries into the nato alliance , the white house had said thursday .
" the desire to bring these new countries , these new democracies , and these countries that want to live in freedom and help defend each other , is even strengthened by the past month 's activities , " spokeswoman dana perino said .
russia strongly objects to continued nato expansion and the alliance 's announcement at an april summit that it intends to invite georgia and ukraine , another former soviet state , to join .
" our support of georgia 's entry into nato started long before any of these hostilities began , " perino said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

5 , comes just days after an emergency eu summit on georgia and ahead of crucial talks next week between the french and russian presidents on the georgia crisis . it also coincides with us vice-president dick cheney 's visit to georgia and ukraine , widely seen to signal that washington has not turned its back on former soviet allies following the conflict in georgia . the five-day war between georgia and russia last month has sparked turmoil in the caucasus and heightened tensions between russia and the west .
russia sent tanks and troops into georgian territory on aug .
8 , a day after a georgian offensive to retake rebel south ossetia .
it has since withdrawn some forces but left others inside georgian territory . though the eu has stopped short of imposing sanctions on russia for its military push and occupation of georgian territory , it has frozen talks with moscow on a new strategic partnership pact until all russian forces withdraw from georgia . wide-ranging talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to cuts its reliance on russian gas by creating alternative routes but the informal talks in the french city of avignon wo n't just focus on the eu 's fraught relations with russia .
officials say they are likely to take in issues including energy security and relations with states such as moldova , ukraine and belarus . " the eu considers that it is more necessary than ever to support regional cooperation and step up its relations with its eastern neighbors , " eu leaders concluded at the emergency summit on monday - a meeting held in response to the russian-georgian war . the foreign ministers of the eu 's 27 member states meet informally every six months to discuss broad policy issues without the pressure to reach formal decisions . friday 's meeting is to " review the whole range of the eu 's relationship " with russia and georgia in order to see where it could " reinforce " its current policies , sources in the french government , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , told the dpa news agency . eu hopes to push democratic reforms the talks are also likely to focus on how the eu can promote democratic reforms and reconciliation in parts of the former ussr where russia and the west are competing openly for influence . diplomats said the meeting could include talks on how to handle belarus , where the authoritarian regime of president alexander lukashenko in the summer released the country 's last political prisoners in what was seen in brussels as a step towards greater freedom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe hopes to promote democracy in former soviet states ukraine also looks set to feature prominently ahead of an eu-ukraine summit scheduled for tuesday . the ministers are also likely to discuss how the eu can use its relations with moscow 's former satellites to boost its own energy security by creating supply routes which do not go through russia , officials in brussels said . that follows a call from eu leaders monday that " recent events illustrate the need for europe to intensify its efforts with regard to the security of energy supplies . " however , the ministers are not expected to propose a sudden leap towards membership for countries such as georgia and ukraine , officials said . rather , they are likely to discuss how they can improve their use of current diplomatic agreements , partnerships and financial incentives to tighten their links with their eastern neighbors without giving up on their long-standing calls for reform . they are also expected to discuss eu relations with the united states and the eu 's role in the middle east peace process . ministers are also to discuss an eu observer mission to monitor the ceasefire in georgia . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in their coverage of the republican national convention in st. paul , european papers agreed that the star turn was alaska governor and vice presidential candidate sarah palin . " barack obama speaks to the urban middle classes , " wrote berlin 's daily tageszeitung .
" sarah palin represents the opinions of small town and rural america .
they have long been waiting for a charismatic representative .
their disgust at career politicians has been growing in recent years .
sarah palin comes across as a rebel , taking on the establishment .
unexpectedly , that makes her a threat to barack obama . "
the neue osnabruecker zeitung was not convinced .
" sarah palin gave a sterling performance at the convention , " it wrote .
" but too much should not be read into that .
at this point , too many strange and surprising details about the governor of alaska have emerged .
it seems that mccain 's people failed to vet her adequately ; especially given they were filling the most important position in a presidential candidate 's team .
this negligence is part of the problem .
might mccain continue shooting from the hip in the white house ?
to many voters , it 's an alarming prospect . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccain tends to shoot from the hip britain 's daily the guardian was equally unimpressed : " mccain , the self-styled maverick who has so often angered his own party by bucking the party line , was given a five-minute standing ovation at the start of his 50-minute speech and again at the end … .
but , a poor orator who has made few - if any - memorable speeches in the past , he failed to match either the rhetoric of obama in denver last week or even the feisty , sarcastic delivery of his own running mate , sarah palin .
some of the loudest cheers of the night were when palin , the new darling of the republican party , joined him at the end .
although the organizers said the theme of the day was " peace , " the tone of videos shown earlier in the night as well as in his speech and those of others was heavily militaristic . "
from vienna , the kurier described the nomination of sarah palin as evidence of the polarization of us society .
" the crisis in which the country found itself in recent years did nothing to unite it , whatever obama says .
on the contrary , it deepened divisions .
bush did not win elections thanks to moderates , but because he managed to mobilize the country 's right-wing .
with her angry narrow-mindedness , gun-toting palin has given these people back their pride , even with her weaknesses .
like bush when he first came to office , she appears human - especially to those americans who are made nervous by obama 's professional speeches , open-mindedness and skin color - racism does not disappear simply because one denies it exists . "
in france , the center-left daily le monde also focused as much on palin as mccain .
" in recent months it looked as though it would be the moderate republicans who decided the vote for mccain , " it wrote .
" but his choice of sarah palin as running mate is an attempt to win over the right wing of the party .
he is keen to take a stand against the harvard-educated elites , as supposedly embodied by his democratic rival barack obama .

in their coverage of the republican national convention in st. paul , european papers agreed that the star turn was alaska governor and vice presidential candidate sarah palin . " barack obama speaks to the urban middle classes , " wrote berlin 's daily tageszeitung .
" sarah palin represents the opinions of small town and rural america .
they have long been waiting for a charismatic representative .
their disgust at career politicians has been growing in recent years .
sarah palin comes across as a rebel , taking on the establishment .
unexpectedly , that makes her a threat to barack obama . "
the neue osnabruecker zeitung was not convinced .
" sarah palin gave a sterling performance at the convention , " it wrote .
" but too much should not be read into that .
at this point , too many strange and surprising details about the governor of alaska have emerged .
it seems that mccain 's people failed to vet her adequately ; especially given they were filling the most important position in a presidential candidate 's team .
this negligence is part of the problem .
might mccain continue shooting from the hip in the white house ?
to many voters , it 's an alarming prospect . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccain tends to shoot from the hip britain 's daily the guardian was equally unimpressed : " mccain , the self-styled maverick who has so often angered his own party by bucking the party line , was given a five-minute standing ovation at the start of his 50-minute speech and again at the end … .
but , a poor orator who has made few - if any - memorable speeches in the past , he failed to match either the rhetoric of obama in denver last week or even the feisty , sarcastic delivery of his own running mate , sarah palin .
some of the loudest cheers of the night were when palin , the new darling of the republican party , joined him at the end .
although the organizers said the theme of the day was " peace , " the tone of videos shown earlier in the night as well as in his speech and those of others was heavily militaristic . "
from vienna , the kurier described the nomination of sarah palin as evidence of the polarization of us society .
" the crisis in which the country found itself in recent years did nothing to unite it , whatever obama says .
on the contrary , it deepened divisions .
bush did not win elections thanks to moderates , but because he managed to mobilize the country 's right-wing .
with her angry narrow-mindedness , gun-toting palin has given these people back their pride , even with her weaknesses .
like bush when he first came to office , she appears human - especially to those americans who are made nervous by obama 's professional speeches , open-mindedness and skin color - racism does not disappear simply because one denies it exists . "
in france , the center-left daily le monde also focused as much on palin as mccain .
" in recent months it looked as though it would be the moderate republicans who decided the vote for mccain , " it wrote .
" but his choice of sarah palin as running mate is an attempt to win over the right wing of the party .
he is keen to take a stand against the harvard-educated elites , as supposedly embodied by his democratic rival barack obama .
one would have expected him to distance himself from the very unpopular george w. bush , but the convention in minneapolis reflected the current administration 's politics .

5 , comes just days after an emergency eu summit on georgia and ahead of crucial talks next week between the french and russian presidents on the georgia crisis . it also coincides with us vice-president dick cheney 's visit to georgia and ukraine , widely seen to signal that washington has not turned its back on former soviet allies following the conflict in georgia . the five-day war between georgia and russia last month has sparked turmoil in the caucasus and heightened tensions between russia and the west .
russia sent tanks and troops into georgian territory on aug .
8 , a day after a georgian offensive to retake rebel south ossetia .
it has since withdrawn some forces but left others inside georgian territory . though the eu has stopped short of imposing sanctions on russia for its military push and occupation of georgian territory , it has frozen talks with moscow on a new strategic partnership pact until all russian forces withdraw from georgia . wide-ranging talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to cuts its reliance on russian gas by creating alternative routes but the informal talks in the french city of avignon wo n't just focus on the eu 's fraught relations with russia .
officials say they are likely to take in issues including energy security and relations with states such as moldova , ukraine and belarus . " the eu considers that it is more necessary than ever to support regional cooperation and step up its relations with its eastern neighbors , " eu leaders concluded at the emergency summit on monday - a meeting held in response to the russian-georgian war . the foreign ministers of the eu 's 27 member states meet informally every six months to discuss broad policy issues without the pressure to reach formal decisions . friday 's meeting is to " review the whole range of the eu 's relationship " with russia and georgia in order to see where it could " reinforce " its current policies , sources in the french government , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , told the dpa news agency . eu hopes to push democratic reforms the talks are also likely to focus on how the eu can promote democratic reforms and reconciliation in parts of the former ussr where russia and the west are competing openly for influence . diplomats said the meeting could include talks on how to handle belarus , where the authoritarian regime of president alexander lukashenko in the summer released the country 's last political prisoners in what was seen in brussels as a step towards greater freedom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe hopes to promote democracy in former soviet states ukraine also looks set to feature prominently ahead of an eu-ukraine summit scheduled for tuesday . the ministers are also likely to discuss how the eu can use its relations with moscow 's former satellites to boost its own energy security by creating supply routes which do not go through russia , officials in brussels said . that follows a call from eu leaders monday that " recent events illustrate the need for europe to intensify its efforts with regard to the security of energy supplies . " however , the ministers are not expected to propose a sudden leap towards membership for countries such as georgia and ukraine , officials said . rather , they are likely to discuss how they can improve their use of current diplomatic agreements , partnerships and financial incentives to tighten their links with their eastern neighbors without giving up on their long-standing calls for reform . they are also expected to discuss eu relations with the united states and the eu 's role in the middle east peace process . ministers are also to discuss an eu observer mission to monitor the ceasefire in georgia . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the eu considers that it is more necessary than ever to support regional cooperation and step up its relations with its eastern neighbors , " eu leaders concluded at the emergency summit on monday - a meeting held in response to the russian-georgian war . the foreign ministers of the eu 's 27 member states meet informally every six months to discuss broad policy issues without the pressure to reach formal decisions . friday 's meeting is to " review the whole range of the eu 's relationship " with russia and georgia in order to see where it could " reinforce " its current policies , sources in the french government , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , told the dpa news agency . eu hopes to push democratic reforms the talks are also likely to focus on how the eu can promote democratic reforms and reconciliation in parts of the former ussr where russia and the west are competing openly for influence . diplomats said the meeting could include talks on how to handle belarus , where the authoritarian regime of president alexander lukashenko in the summer released the country 's last political prisoners in what was seen in brussels as a step towards greater freedom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe hopes to promote democracy in former soviet states ukraine also looks set to feature prominently ahead of an eu-ukraine summit scheduled for tuesday . the ministers are also likely to discuss how the eu can use its relations with moscow 's former satellites to boost its own energy security by creating supply routes which do not go through russia , officials in brussels said . that follows a call from eu leaders monday that " recent events illustrate the need for europe to intensify its efforts with regard to the security of energy supplies . " however , the ministers are not expected to propose a sudden leap towards membership for countries such as georgia and ukraine , officials said . rather , they are likely to discuss how they can improve their use of current diplomatic agreements , partnerships and financial incentives to tighten their links with their eastern neighbors without giving up on their long-standing calls for reform . they are also expected to discuss eu relations with the united states and the eu 's role in the middle east peace process . ministers are also to discuss an eu observer mission to monitor the ceasefire in georgia . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" pakistan 's territorial integrity has to be respected , " jung said after meeting with pakistani prime minister yousaf raza gillani .
the us attack took place on wednesday this week in pakistan 's south waziristan tribal region .
it killed at least 20 people including women and children , pakistani officials say , and was the first known foreign ground assault in pakistan against a taliban haven since us forces invaded afghanistan in 2001 .
pakistan has strongly condemned the us raid and this week the government in islamabad summoned the us ambassador to protest the unusually bold raid .
the raid appeared to indicate that the united states was forging ahead with a tougher strategy to curb the growing numbers of taliban fighters crossing from pakistan to attack american and nato soldiers fighting in afghanistan .
security woes at pakistani-afghan border bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung , left , with the pakistani army chief , general tariq majid the german defense minister who travelled to islamabad on friday discussed security in the lawless tribal areas with his pakistani counterpart ahmad muktar .
us and afghan officials say pakistan 's remote and mountainous tribal region bordering afghanistan has become a harbor for al-qaeda and taliban militants to stage attacks since the fall of the taliban regime at the end of 2001 .
the deteriorating security situation in the rugged and increasingly porous border region has led to a rise in attacks against nato forces in afghanistan recently .
top american military commanders have warned pakistan that they would start attacking taliban havens inside pakistan ’ s tribal areas if the increased infiltration by taliban fighters into afghanistan did not stop .
jung 's meeting with muktar stressed the need for closer collaboration between western forces and pakistan in the border region .
the pakistani minister assured jung his country was deeply committed to the fight against terrorism .
muktar said pakistan has committed 100,000 soldiers to patrol the volatile border region , but that the coalition forces needed to respect pakistan 's sovereignty and avoid killing innocent civilians in the partnership against terror .
reputation of international troops at risk jung had been in afghanistan earlier in the week on an unannounced visit to support german troops anxious about the increasing risk of taliban attacks . tension has been high among the german contingent amid an upsurge of attacks from booby traps and ambushes .
last week a german soldier was killed when a remote-controlled bomb went off near an armoured vehicle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a service for the german soldier killed in afghanistan last week german troops were also responsible for civilian deaths last week when three afghans were killed after both german and afghan troops opened fire on a vehicle that had failed to stop at a checkpoint even after warning shots had been fired .
the german army has paid compensation to relatives of a woman and two children shot dead last week at a checkpoint manned by its soldiers in northern afghanistan , german daily newspaper die welt reported this week .
a defence ministry spokesperson confirmed the report this week saying defence minister jung had arranged the compensation during the visit to afghanistan to pay his respects to the relatives .
it was one of a recent string of incidents that experts say are damaging the reputation of the almost 70,000 international troops as well as the afghan government , which need the backing of the local population if they want to beat a taliban-led insurgency .
even though most german soldiers that are part of the nato-led international force in are stationed in the relatively calm north , 26 troops have died in afghanistan since the start of the mission in 2002 . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

5 .
" the question of who bears guilt and responsibility is not the priority when people are suffering , have lost their possessions and are forced to flee , " he said .
" but i have also said that in a second phase , in which we will define our medium and long-term relations with the conflicting parties , the issue of who bears what part of the responsibility for the escalation to the point of a military conflict will play a role .
" this can not be cleared up overnight and probably never completely , " the foreign minister told the newspaper .
he acknowledged the conflict had had an impact on relations between the eu and russia and would have long-term repercussions for the west 's foreign policy , but called for ties to be improved .
" a return to the patterns of the cold war is not an attractive alternative to the laborious undertaking of returning to an ordered way of doing business , " he said .
first military observers in georgia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier meets other eu foreign ministers friday neither georgia nor russia has backed an inquiry into last month 's five-day violent conflict .
but steinmeier urged both countries to support the work of an independent team of investigators with military expertise .
" i advise both sides to open themselves to an independent investigation , " steinmeier said .
" i see no lack of institutions , for example in the framework of the un or the osce that could run the probe , he said .
" but until now , there has above all been unwillingness on both sides to take part in such an investigation . "
the osce said thursday it had dispatched a first round of military observers in a buffer zone between russian and georgian troops .
the observers were on patrol near the separatist province of south ossetia in georgia " for the first time since the outbreak of hostilities in georgia last month , " the organization for security and co-operation in europe said in a statement on its web site .
conditions from russia russia has said it will only pull troops out of the buffer zone once international controls , including military observers and police , are in place in the area and once georgia signs a non-aggression pact .
russia 's foreign ministry on thursday said the subject of sending military observers and police to the buffer zone was discussed by deputy russian foreign minister vladimir titov and us ambassador to moscow john beyrle in moscow .
meanwhile , us vice president dick cheney during a visit to georgia on thursday accused russia of an " illegitimate " invasion aimed at redrawing the map of georgia and said the crisis had damaged russia 's international reputation .
" russia 's actions have cast grave doubt on russia 's intentions and on its reliability as an international partner , not just in georgia but across this region and indeed across the international system , " cheney said .
us supports nato membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us is a staunch ally of georgia he also assured georgian president mikheil saakashvili of washington 's commitment to extending the nato alliance to georgia .
russia 's move strengthened the need to bring the former soviet republic and other countries into the nato alliance , the white house had said thursday .
" the desire to bring these new countries , these new democracies , and these countries that want to live in freedom and help defend each other , is even strengthened by the past month 's activities , " spokeswoman dana perino said .
russia strongly objects to continued nato expansion and the alliance 's announcement at an april summit that it intends to invite georgia and ukraine , another former soviet state , to join .
" our support of georgia 's entry into nato started long before any of these hostilities began , " perino said . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" pakistan 's territorial integrity has to be respected , " jung said after meeting with pakistani prime minister yousaf raza gillani .
the us attack took place on wednesday this week in pakistan 's south waziristan tribal region .
it killed at least 20 people including women and children , pakistani officials say , and was the first known foreign ground assault in pakistan against a taliban haven since us forces invaded afghanistan in 2001 .
pakistan has strongly condemned the us raid and this week the government in islamabad summoned the us ambassador to protest the unusually bold raid .
the raid appeared to indicate that the united states was forging ahead with a tougher strategy to curb the growing numbers of taliban fighters crossing from pakistan to attack american and nato soldiers fighting in afghanistan .

the warsaw newspaper quoted sources saying that they had seen the document but did not explicitly say that the prison served as a holding center for al-qaeda terrorist suspects as has been alleged in the american media .
the gazeta reported that according to the document the secret prison was set up after the us and poland signed an accord in 2002 to combat terrorism .
cia prison allegations surfaced in 2005 polish prosecutors had been investigating long-running allegations of a secret cia jail to interrogate top al-qaeda operatives near szymany in northeast poland .
in 2006 , the head of the secret services had presented the two-page document to two ministers from the then ruling conservative law and justice party and poland 's chief prosecutor janusz kaczmarek at the time , according to gazeta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top officials declined to speak to the polish newspaper kaczmarek confirmed the meeting with the ministers , but refused to comment on what transpired . the ex-ministers declined to speak with the newspaper .
in the past polish officials have consistently rejected media claims that warsaw allowed the cia to run a secret prison for captured islamic radicals .

" the question of who bears guilt and responsibility is not the priority when people are suffering , have lost their possessions and are forced to flee , " he said .
" but i have also said that in a second phase , in which we will define our medium and long-term relations with the conflicting parties , the issue of who bears what part of the responsibility for the escalation to the point of a military conflict will play a role .
" this can not be cleared up overnight and probably never completely , " the foreign minister told the newspaper .
he acknowledged the conflict had had an impact on relations between the eu and russia and would have long-term repercussions for the west 's foreign policy , but called for ties to be improved .

" the question of who bears guilt and responsibility is not the priority when people are suffering , have lost their possessions and are forced to flee , " he said .
" but i have also said that in a second phase , in which we will define our medium and long-term relations with the conflicting parties , the issue of who bears what part of the responsibility for the escalation to the point of a military conflict will play a role .
" this can not be cleared up overnight and probably never completely , " the foreign minister told the newspaper .
he acknowledged the conflict had had an impact on relations between the eu and russia and would have long-term repercussions for the west 's foreign policy , but called for ties to be improved .
" a return to the patterns of the cold war is not an attractive alternative to the laborious undertaking of returning to an ordered way of doing business , " he said .
first military observers in georgia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier meets other eu foreign ministers friday neither georgia nor russia has backed an inquiry into last month 's five-day violent conflict .
but steinmeier urged both countries to support the work of an independent team of investigators with military expertise .
" i advise both sides to open themselves to an independent investigation , " steinmeier said .
" i see no lack of institutions , for example in the framework of the un or the osce that could run the probe , he said .
" but until now , there has above all been unwillingness on both sides to take part in such an investigation . "
the osce said thursday it had dispatched a first round of military observers in a buffer zone between russian and georgian troops .
the observers were on patrol near the separatist province of south ossetia in georgia " for the first time since the outbreak of hostilities in georgia last month , " the organization for security and co-operation in europe said in a statement on its web site .
conditions from russia russia has said it will only pull troops out of the buffer zone once international controls , including military observers and police , are in place in the area and once georgia signs a non-aggression pact .
russia 's foreign ministry on thursday said the subject of sending military observers and police to the buffer zone was discussed by deputy russian foreign minister vladimir titov and us ambassador to moscow john beyrle in moscow .
meanwhile , us vice president dick cheney during a visit to georgia on thursday accused russia of an " illegitimate " invasion aimed at redrawing the map of georgia and said the crisis had damaged russia 's international reputation .
" russia 's actions have cast grave doubt on russia 's intentions and on its reliability as an international partner , not just in georgia but across this region and indeed across the international system , " cheney said .
us supports nato membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us is a staunch ally of georgia he also assured georgian president mikheil saakashvili of washington 's commitment to extending the nato alliance to georgia .
russia 's move strengthened the need to bring the former soviet republic and other countries into the nato alliance , the white house had said thursday .
" the desire to bring these new countries , these new democracies , and these countries that want to live in freedom and help defend each other , is even strengthened by the past month 's activities , " spokeswoman dana perino said .
russia strongly objects to continued nato expansion and the alliance 's announcement at an april summit that it intends to invite georgia and ukraine , another former soviet state , to join .

the warsaw newspaper quoted sources saying that they had seen the document but did not explicitly say that the prison served as a holding center for al-qaeda terrorist suspects as has been alleged in the american media .
the gazeta reported that according to the document the secret prison was set up after the us and poland signed an accord in 2002 to combat terrorism .
cia prison allegations surfaced in 2005 polish prosecutors had been investigating long-running allegations of a secret cia jail to interrogate top al-qaeda operatives near szymany in northeast poland .
in 2006 , the head of the secret services had presented the two-page document to two ministers from the then ruling conservative law and justice party and poland 's chief prosecutor janusz kaczmarek at the time , according to gazeta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top officials declined to speak to the polish newspaper kaczmarek confirmed the meeting with the ministers , but refused to comment on what transpired . the ex-ministers declined to speak with the newspaper .
in the past polish officials have consistently rejected media claims that warsaw allowed the cia to run a secret prison for captured islamic radicals .
polish top aide denies knowledge of memo but on friday , a top advisor to prime minister donald tusk did confirm that prosecutors were investigating the allegations , although he denied any knowledge of the secret memorandum .
" i am not familiar with such a note and i do n't think prime minister donald tusk is either , " said tusk 's aide slawomir nowak in an interview with poland 's tok fm radio .
" but the premier asked the justice minister to clarify this matter and the country 's prosecutor 's office is investigating the potential existence of the cia prison . "
back in 2005 , the washington post broke the story that cia prisons existed in europe .
close cooperation between us and polish secret services bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a top aide to poland 's tusk denied knowledge of secret memo " there definitely was cooperation between polish and american secret services , " a source close to the us intelligence agency told news agency reuters .
" but whether there was torture at the base , hopefully we will learn about that soon . "
rumors circulated in the us and foreign media that the base was operational between 2002 and 2005 at a time when poland was governed by the left-leaning governments of leszek miller and marek belka and then a rightist administration under kazimierz marcinkiewicz .
all three former leaders have denied any knowledge of such a prison or base , and tusk 's center-right government has until now also played down speculation of its existence .
" i hope this will not be confirmed , " nowak said to reuters .
" it would not only have serious consequences inside the country but would also take a very serious toll on the international scene .
this has to be investigated very carefully , without emotions . "

" pakistan 's territorial integrity has to be respected , " jung said after meeting with pakistani prime minister yousaf raza gillani .
the us attack took place on wednesday this week in pakistan 's south waziristan tribal region .
it killed at least 20 people including women and children , pakistani officials say , and was the first known foreign ground assault in pakistan against a taliban haven since us forces invaded afghanistan in 2001 .
pakistan has strongly condemned the us raid and this week the government in islamabad summoned the us ambassador to protest the unusually bold raid .
the raid appeared to indicate that the united states was forging ahead with a tougher strategy to curb the growing numbers of taliban fighters crossing from pakistan to attack american and nato soldiers fighting in afghanistan .
security woes at pakistani-afghan border bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung , left , with the pakistani army chief , general tariq majid the german defense minister who travelled to islamabad on friday discussed security in the lawless tribal areas with his pakistani counterpart ahmad muktar .
us and afghan officials say pakistan 's remote and mountainous tribal region bordering afghanistan has become a harbor for al-qaeda and taliban militants to stage attacks since the fall of the taliban regime at the end of 2001 .
the deteriorating security situation in the rugged and increasingly porous border region has led to a rise in attacks against nato forces in afghanistan recently .
top american military commanders have warned pakistan that they would start attacking taliban havens inside pakistan ’ s tribal areas if the increased infiltration by taliban fighters into afghanistan did not stop .
jung 's meeting with muktar stressed the need for closer collaboration between western forces and pakistan in the border region .
the pakistani minister assured jung his country was deeply committed to the fight against terrorism .
muktar said pakistan has committed 100,000 soldiers to patrol the volatile border region , but that the coalition forces needed to respect pakistan 's sovereignty and avoid killing innocent civilians in the partnership against terror .
reputation of international troops at risk jung had been in afghanistan earlier in the week on an unannounced visit to support german troops anxious about the increasing risk of taliban attacks . tension has been high among the german contingent amid an upsurge of attacks from booby traps and ambushes .
last week a german soldier was killed when a remote-controlled bomb went off near an armoured vehicle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a service for the german soldier killed in afghanistan last week german troops were also responsible for civilian deaths last week when three afghans were killed after both german and afghan troops opened fire on a vehicle that had failed to stop at a checkpoint even after warning shots had been fired .
the german army has paid compensation to relatives of a woman and two children shot dead last week at a checkpoint manned by its soldiers in northern afghanistan , german daily newspaper die welt reported this week .
a defence ministry spokesperson confirmed the report this week saying defence minister jung had arranged the compensation during the visit to afghanistan to pay his respects to the relatives .
it was one of a recent string of incidents that experts say are damaging the reputation of the almost 70,000 international troops as well as the afghan government , which need the backing of the local population if they want to beat a taliban-led insurgency .
even though most german soldiers that are part of the nato-led international force in are stationed in the relatively calm north , 26 troops have died in afghanistan since the start of the mission in 2002 . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

talks ran on twice as long as expected on friday , sept .
5 , as cheney met separately with president viktor yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko amid a domestic political conflict .
urging ukraine 's leader to unite , the vice president implied that russia was behind the country 's difficulties .
" we believe in the right of men and women to live without the threat of tyranny , economic blackmail or military invasion or intimidation , " said cheney , referring to russia 's recent military intervention in georgia .
" ukraine 's best hope to overcome these threats is to be united - united domestically first and foremost and united with other democracies , " he added .
tensions mount over georgian war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time for yushchenko and tymoshenko to kiss and make up ?
tymoshenko and yushchenko have been feuding in recent weeks over ukraine 's ties to russia .
yushchenko 's office had accused the prime minister of failing to support georgia when russian troops invaded the georgian enclave of south ossetia early last month .
meanwhile , tymoshenko has denied reports that she has tilted towards moscow and is about to form a new coalition with the pro-russian opposition .
however , she has not openly criticized russia over the georgia crisis .
their feud culminated in the president 's parliamentary allies walking out of the alliance on tuesday and with yushchenko threatening to dissolve parliament and call for an election if a new government is not formed within 30 days .
it would be the third election in as many years in ukraine , where yushchenko swept to power in a 2004 " orange revolution " with the promise of greater integration with the west .
cheney 's visit to the country comes as european officials suggest ukraine could be the next flashpoint for tensions between russia and the west following the war in georgia .
speaking friday in kyiv , the vice president said that the us had a " deep and abiding interest " in ukraine ’ s security .
cheney added that ukrainians should be able to live " without the threat of tyranny , economic blackmail and military invasion or intimidation . "
ukraine has applied to join the nato alliance as well as the european union , a move that has been supported by the bush administration but one which has angered moscow , which considers ukraine to be within its sphere of influence .
caught between east and west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with tough times in its past , ukraine has the bush administration 's support in joining nato with ukraine 's coalition now divided , political leaders have voiced concern that the kremlin might try to capitalize on the nation 's persistent political instability .
in light of the caucasus conflict , yushchenko has said that he sees nato membership as essential in order to protect ukraine 's territorial integrity .
" ukrainians have the right to choose whether they wish to join nato , and nato has a right to invite ukraine to join the alliance when we believe they are ready and that the time is right , " said cheney , adding that " no outside country has a veto . "
in addition to addressing ukraine 's future with the alliance , the vice president 's visit is also aimed at demonstrating us support for georgia and securing allies like ukraine against russia .
during his time in tbilisi on thursday , cheney slammed russia 's actions against georgia , calling its military invasion an " illegitimate act that undermined its credibility . "
he also reiterated the us ' support for georgian membership in nato .
while in ukraine , cheney is also slated to visit the holodomor memorial to the country 's famine victims before continuing on to italy in the afternoon . dw staff -lrb- ls -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" pakistan 's territorial integrity has to be respected , " jung said after meeting with pakistani prime minister yousaf raza gillani .
the us attack took place on wednesday this week in pakistan 's south waziristan tribal region .
it killed at least 20 people including women and children , pakistani officials say , and was the first known foreign ground assault in pakistan against a taliban haven since us forces invaded afghanistan in 2001 .
pakistan has strongly condemned the us raid and this week the government in islamabad summoned the us ambassador to protest the unusually bold raid .
the raid appeared to indicate that the united states was forging ahead with a tougher strategy to curb the growing numbers of taliban fighters crossing from pakistan to attack american and nato soldiers fighting in afghanistan .
security woes at pakistani-afghan border bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung , left , with the pakistani army chief , general tariq majid the german defense minister who travelled to islamabad on friday discussed security in the lawless tribal areas with his pakistani counterpart ahmad muktar .
us and afghan officials say pakistan 's remote and mountainous tribal region bordering afghanistan has become a harbor for al-qaeda and taliban militants to stage attacks since the fall of the taliban regime at the end of 2001 .
the deteriorating security situation in the rugged and increasingly porous border region has led to a rise in attacks against nato forces in afghanistan recently .
top american military commanders have warned pakistan that they would start attacking taliban havens inside pakistan ’ s tribal areas if the increased infiltration by taliban fighters into afghanistan did not stop .
jung 's meeting with muktar stressed the need for closer collaboration between western forces and pakistan in the border region .
the pakistani minister assured jung his country was deeply committed to the fight against terrorism .
muktar said pakistan has committed 100,000 soldiers to patrol the volatile border region , but that the coalition forces needed to respect pakistan 's sovereignty and avoid killing innocent civilians in the partnership against terror .
reputation of international troops at risk jung had been in afghanistan earlier in the week on an unannounced visit to support german troops anxious about the increasing risk of taliban attacks . tension has been high among the german contingent amid an upsurge of attacks from booby traps and ambushes .
last week a german soldier was killed when a remote-controlled bomb went off near an armoured vehicle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a service for the german soldier killed in afghanistan last week german troops were also responsible for civilian deaths last week when three afghans were killed after both german and afghan troops opened fire on a vehicle that had failed to stop at a checkpoint even after warning shots had been fired .
the german army has paid compensation to relatives of a woman and two children shot dead last week at a checkpoint manned by its soldiers in northern afghanistan , german daily newspaper die welt reported this week .
a defence ministry spokesperson confirmed the report this week saying defence minister jung had arranged the compensation during the visit to afghanistan to pay his respects to the relatives .
it was one of a recent string of incidents that experts say are damaging the reputation of the almost 70,000 international troops as well as the afghan government , which need the backing of the local population if they want to beat a taliban-led insurgency .
even though most german soldiers that are part of the nato-led international force in are stationed in the relatively calm north , 26 troops have died in afghanistan since the start of the mission in 2002 . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

talks ran on twice as long as expected on friday , sept .
5 , as cheney met separately with president viktor yushchenko and prime minister yulia tymoshenko amid a domestic political conflict .
urging ukraine 's leader to unite , the vice president implied that russia was behind the country 's difficulties .
" we believe in the right of men and women to live without the threat of tyranny , economic blackmail or military invasion or intimidation , " said cheney , referring to russia 's recent military intervention in georgia .
" ukraine 's best hope to overcome these threats is to be united - united domestically first and foremost and united with other democracies , " he added .
tensions mount over georgian war bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time for yushchenko and tymoshenko to kiss and make up ?
tymoshenko and yushchenko have been feuding in recent weeks over ukraine 's ties to russia .
yushchenko 's office had accused the prime minister of failing to support georgia when russian troops invaded the georgian enclave of south ossetia early last month .
meanwhile , tymoshenko has denied reports that she has tilted towards moscow and is about to form a new coalition with the pro-russian opposition .
however , she has not openly criticized russia over the georgia crisis .
their feud culminated in the president 's parliamentary allies walking out of the alliance on tuesday and with yushchenko threatening to dissolve parliament and call for an election if a new government is not formed within 30 days .
it would be the third election in as many years in ukraine , where yushchenko swept to power in a 2004 " orange revolution " with the promise of greater integration with the west .
cheney 's visit to the country comes as european officials suggest ukraine could be the next flashpoint for tensions between russia and the west following the war in georgia .
speaking friday in kyiv , the vice president said that the us had a " deep and abiding interest " in ukraine ’ s security .
cheney added that ukrainians should be able to live " without the threat of tyranny , economic blackmail and military invasion or intimidation . "

in their coverage of the republican national convention in st. paul , european papers agreed that the star turn was alaska governor and vice presidential candidate sarah palin . " barack obama speaks to the urban middle classes , " wrote berlin 's daily tageszeitung .
" sarah palin represents the opinions of small town and rural america .
they have long been waiting for a charismatic representative .
their disgust at career politicians has been growing in recent years .
sarah palin comes across as a rebel , taking on the establishment .
unexpectedly , that makes her a threat to barack obama . "
the neue osnabruecker zeitung was not convinced .
" sarah palin gave a sterling performance at the convention , " it wrote .
" but too much should not be read into that .
at this point , too many strange and surprising details about the governor of alaska have emerged .
it seems that mccain 's people failed to vet her adequately ; especially given they were filling the most important position in a presidential candidate 's team .
this negligence is part of the problem .
might mccain continue shooting from the hip in the white house ?
to many voters , it 's an alarming prospect . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mccain tends to shoot from the hip britain 's daily the guardian was equally unimpressed : " mccain , the self-styled maverick who has so often angered his own party by bucking the party line , was given a five-minute standing ovation at the start of his 50-minute speech and again at the end … .
but , a poor orator who has made few - if any - memorable speeches in the past , he failed to match either the rhetoric of obama in denver last week or even the feisty , sarcastic delivery of his own running mate , sarah palin .
some of the loudest cheers of the night were when palin , the new darling of the republican party , joined him at the end .
although the organizers said the theme of the day was " peace , " the tone of videos shown earlier in the night as well as in his speech and those of others was heavily militaristic . "
from vienna , the kurier described the nomination of sarah palin as evidence of the polarization of us society .
" the crisis in which the country found itself in recent years did nothing to unite it , whatever obama says .
on the contrary , it deepened divisions .
bush did not win elections thanks to moderates , but because he managed to mobilize the country 's right-wing .
with her angry narrow-mindedness , gun-toting palin has given these people back their pride , even with her weaknesses .
like bush when he first came to office , she appears human - especially to those americans who are made nervous by obama 's professional speeches , open-mindedness and skin color - racism does not disappear simply because one denies it exists . "
in france , the center-left daily le monde also focused as much on palin as mccain .
" in recent months it looked as though it would be the moderate republicans who decided the vote for mccain , " it wrote .
" but his choice of sarah palin as running mate is an attempt to win over the right wing of the party .
he is keen to take a stand against the harvard-educated elites , as supposedly embodied by his democratic rival barack obama .

but , a poor orator who has made few - if any - memorable speeches in the past , he failed to match either the rhetoric of obama in denver last week or even the feisty , sarcastic delivery of his own running mate , sarah palin .
some of the loudest cheers of the night were when palin , the new darling of the republican party , joined him at the end .
although the organizers said the theme of the day was " peace , " the tone of videos shown earlier in the night as well as in his speech and those of others was heavily militaristic . "
from vienna , the kurier described the nomination of sarah palin as evidence of the polarization of us society .
" the crisis in which the country found itself in recent years did nothing to unite it , whatever obama says .
on the contrary , it deepened divisions .
bush did not win elections thanks to moderates , but because he managed to mobilize the country 's right-wing .
with her angry narrow-mindedness , gun-toting palin has given these people back their pride , even with her weaknesses .
like bush when he first came to office , she appears human - especially to those americans who are made nervous by obama 's professional speeches , open-mindedness and skin color - racism does not disappear simply because one denies it exists . "
in france , the center-left daily le monde also focused as much on palin as mccain .
" in recent months it looked as though it would be the moderate republicans who decided the vote for mccain , " it wrote .
" but his choice of sarah palin as running mate is an attempt to win over the right wing of the party .
he is keen to take a stand against the harvard-educated elites , as supposedly embodied by his democratic rival barack obama .
one would have expected him to distance himself from the very unpopular george w. bush , but the convention in minneapolis reflected the current administration 's politics .
mccain is indeed what the obama camp would paint him : a natural heir to bush . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the warsaw newspaper quoted sources saying that they had seen the document but did not explicitly say that the prison served as a holding center for al-qaeda terrorist suspects as has been alleged in the american media .
the gazeta reported that according to the document the secret prison was set up after the us and poland signed an accord in 2002 to combat terrorism .
cia prison allegations surfaced in 2005 polish prosecutors had been investigating long-running allegations of a secret cia jail to interrogate top al-qaeda operatives near szymany in northeast poland .
in 2006 , the head of the secret services had presented the two-page document to two ministers from the then ruling conservative law and justice party and poland 's chief prosecutor janusz kaczmarek at the time , according to gazeta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top officials declined to speak to the polish newspaper kaczmarek confirmed the meeting with the ministers , but refused to comment on what transpired . the ex-ministers declined to speak with the newspaper .
in the past polish officials have consistently rejected media claims that warsaw allowed the cia to run a secret prison for captured islamic radicals .
polish top aide denies knowledge of memo but on friday , a top advisor to prime minister donald tusk did confirm that prosecutors were investigating the allegations , although he denied any knowledge of the secret memorandum .
" i am not familiar with such a note and i do n't think prime minister donald tusk is either , " said tusk 's aide slawomir nowak in an interview with poland 's tok fm radio .
" but the premier asked the justice minister to clarify this matter and the country 's prosecutor 's office is investigating the potential existence of the cia prison . "
back in 2005 , the washington post broke the story that cia prisons existed in europe .
close cooperation between us and polish secret services bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a top aide to poland 's tusk denied knowledge of secret memo " there definitely was cooperation between polish and american secret services , " a source close to the us intelligence agency told news agency reuters .
" but whether there was torture at the base , hopefully we will learn about that soon . "
rumors circulated in the us and foreign media that the base was operational between 2002 and 2005 at a time when poland was governed by the left-leaning governments of leszek miller and marek belka and then a rightist administration under kazimierz marcinkiewicz .
all three former leaders have denied any knowledge of such a prison or base , and tusk 's center-right government has until now also played down speculation of its existence .
" i hope this will not be confirmed , " nowak said to reuters .
" it would not only have serious consequences inside the country but would also take a very serious toll on the international scene .
this has to be investigated very carefully , without emotions . "

5 , comes just days after an emergency eu summit on georgia and ahead of crucial talks next week between the french and russian presidents on the georgia crisis . it also coincides with us vice-president dick cheney 's visit to georgia and ukraine , widely seen to signal that washington has not turned its back on former soviet allies following the conflict in georgia . the five-day war between georgia and russia last month has sparked turmoil in the caucasus and heightened tensions between russia and the west .
russia sent tanks and troops into georgian territory on aug .
8 , a day after a georgian offensive to retake rebel south ossetia .
it has since withdrawn some forces but left others inside georgian territory . though the eu has stopped short of imposing sanctions on russia for its military push and occupation of georgian territory , it has frozen talks with moscow on a new strategic partnership pact until all russian forces withdraw from georgia . wide-ranging talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu wants to cuts its reliance on russian gas by creating alternative routes but the informal talks in the french city of avignon wo n't just focus on the eu 's fraught relations with russia .
officials say they are likely to take in issues including energy security and relations with states such as moldova , ukraine and belarus . " the eu considers that it is more necessary than ever to support regional cooperation and step up its relations with its eastern neighbors , " eu leaders concluded at the emergency summit on monday - a meeting held in response to the russian-georgian war . the foreign ministers of the eu 's 27 member states meet informally every six months to discuss broad policy issues without the pressure to reach formal decisions . friday 's meeting is to " review the whole range of the eu 's relationship " with russia and georgia in order to see where it could " reinforce " its current policies , sources in the french government , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , told the dpa news agency . eu hopes to push democratic reforms the talks are also likely to focus on how the eu can promote democratic reforms and reconciliation in parts of the former ussr where russia and the west are competing openly for influence . diplomats said the meeting could include talks on how to handle belarus , where the authoritarian regime of president alexander lukashenko in the summer released the country 's last political prisoners in what was seen in brussels as a step towards greater freedom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe hopes to promote democracy in former soviet states ukraine also looks set to feature prominently ahead of an eu-ukraine summit scheduled for tuesday . the ministers are also likely to discuss how the eu can use its relations with moscow 's former satellites to boost its own energy security by creating supply routes which do not go through russia , officials in brussels said . that follows a call from eu leaders monday that " recent events illustrate the need for europe to intensify its efforts with regard to the security of energy supplies . " however , the ministers are not expected to propose a sudden leap towards membership for countries such as georgia and ukraine , officials said . rather , they are likely to discuss how they can improve their use of current diplomatic agreements , partnerships and financial incentives to tighten their links with their eastern neighbors without giving up on their long-standing calls for reform . they are also expected to discuss eu relations with the united states and the eu 's role in the middle east peace process . ministers are also to discuss an eu observer mission to monitor the ceasefire in georgia . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

so far , unnamed british , canadian and malaysian companies have expressed interest in drilling oil fields that may contain more than 100 million barrels .
decades ago , energoinvest along with former british and us partners had already identified five potential sites worth exploring , but the project was disrupted due to the 1992-95 bosnian war .

" the question of who bears guilt and responsibility is not the priority when people are suffering , have lost their possessions and are forced to flee , " he said .
" but i have also said that in a second phase , in which we will define our medium and long-term relations with the conflicting parties , the issue of who bears what part of the responsibility for the escalation to the point of a military conflict will play a role .
" this can not be cleared up overnight and probably never completely , " the foreign minister told the newspaper .
he acknowledged the conflict had had an impact on relations between the eu and russia and would have long-term repercussions for the west 's foreign policy , but called for ties to be improved .

" i advise both sides to open themselves to an independent investigation , " steinmeier said .
" i see no lack of institutions , for example in the framework of the un or the osce that could run the probe , he said .
" but until now , there has above all been unwillingness on both sides to take part in such an investigation . "
the osce said thursday it had dispatched a first round of military observers in a buffer zone between russian and georgian troops .

meanwhile , us vice president dick cheney during a visit to georgia on thursday accused russia of an " illegitimate " invasion aimed at redrawing the map of georgia and said the crisis had damaged russia 's international reputation .

the warsaw newspaper quoted sources saying that they had seen the document but did not explicitly say that the prison served as a holding center for al-qaeda terrorist suspects as has been alleged in the american media .
the gazeta reported that according to the document the secret prison was set up after the us and poland signed an accord in 2002 to combat terrorism .
cia prison allegations surfaced in 2005 polish prosecutors had been investigating long-running allegations of a secret cia jail to interrogate top al-qaeda operatives near szymany in northeast poland .
in 2006 , the head of the secret services had presented the two-page document to two ministers from the then ruling conservative law and justice party and poland 's chief prosecutor janusz kaczmarek at the time , according to gazeta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top officials declined to speak to the polish newspaper kaczmarek confirmed the meeting with the ministers , but refused to comment on what transpired . the ex-ministers declined to speak with the newspaper .
in the past polish officials have consistently rejected media claims that warsaw allowed the cia to run a secret prison for captured islamic radicals .
polish top aide denies knowledge of memo but on friday , a top advisor to prime minister donald tusk did confirm that prosecutors were investigating the allegations , although he denied any knowledge of the secret memorandum .
" i am not familiar with such a note and i do n't think prime minister donald tusk is either , " said tusk 's aide slawomir nowak in an interview with poland 's tok fm radio .
" but the premier asked the justice minister to clarify this matter and the country 's prosecutor 's office is investigating the potential existence of the cia prison . "
back in 2005 , the washington post broke the story that cia prisons existed in europe .
close cooperation between us and polish secret services bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a top aide to poland 's tusk denied knowledge of secret memo " there definitely was cooperation between polish and american secret services , " a source close to the us intelligence agency told news agency reuters .
" but whether there was torture at the base , hopefully we will learn about that soon . "
rumors circulated in the us and foreign media that the base was operational between 2002 and 2005 at a time when poland was governed by the left-leaning governments of leszek miller and marek belka and then a rightist administration under kazimierz marcinkiewicz .
all three former leaders have denied any knowledge of such a prison or base , and tusk 's center-right government has until now also played down speculation of its existence .
" i hope this will not be confirmed , " nowak said to reuters .

the state-owned energoinvest invited firms and investors to send non-binding letters of intent within a month .
so far , unnamed british , canadian and malaysian companies have expressed interest in drilling oil fields that may contain more than 100 million barrels .
decades ago , energoinvest along with former british and us partners had already identified five potential sites worth exploring , but the project was disrupted due to the 1992-95 bosnian war .
some 1,000 tons of crude were already pumped out in 1991 .
record crude prices have now prompted the bosnian government to revive oil and gas exploration . pipeline through the balkans in neighboring serbia , lawmakers are discussing a large scale energy project with russia , which envisages a pan-european pipeline running through the balkans .
a multi-billion dollar contract was signed between belgrade and moscow in january , but it must be ratified in the serbian parliament in order to be fully implemented .
serbia 's deputy prime minister bozidar djelic has said that the huge contract will " turn serbia into an important player on the energy map of europe . "
pro-western serbian officials have criticized the deal however , since it includes selling serbia 's state monopoly on oil at the bargain basement price of only 400 million euros . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" pakistan 's territorial integrity has to be respected , " jung said after meeting with pakistani prime minister yousaf raza gillani .
the us attack took place on wednesday this week in pakistan 's south waziristan tribal region .
it killed at least 20 people including women and children , pakistani officials say , and was the first known foreign ground assault in pakistan against a taliban haven since us forces invaded afghanistan in 2001 .
pakistan has strongly condemned the us raid and this week the government in islamabad summoned the us ambassador to protest the unusually bold raid .
the raid appeared to indicate that the united states was forging ahead with a tougher strategy to curb the growing numbers of taliban fighters crossing from pakistan to attack american and nato soldiers fighting in afghanistan .
security woes at pakistani-afghan border bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung , left , with the pakistani army chief , general tariq majid the german defense minister who travelled to islamabad on friday discussed security in the lawless tribal areas with his pakistani counterpart ahmad muktar .
us and afghan officials say pakistan 's remote and mountainous tribal region bordering afghanistan has become a harbor for al-qaeda and taliban militants to stage attacks since the fall of the taliban regime at the end of 2001 .
the deteriorating security situation in the rugged and increasingly porous border region has led to a rise in attacks against nato forces in afghanistan recently .
top american military commanders have warned pakistan that they would start attacking taliban havens inside pakistan ’ s tribal areas if the increased infiltration by taliban fighters into afghanistan did not stop .
jung 's meeting with muktar stressed the need for closer collaboration between western forces and pakistan in the border region .
the pakistani minister assured jung his country was deeply committed to the fight against terrorism .
muktar said pakistan has committed 100,000 soldiers to patrol the volatile border region , but that the coalition forces needed to respect pakistan 's sovereignty and avoid killing innocent civilians in the partnership against terror .
reputation of international troops at risk jung had been in afghanistan earlier in the week on an unannounced visit to support german troops anxious about the increasing risk of taliban attacks . tension has been high among the german contingent amid an upsurge of attacks from booby traps and ambushes .
last week a german soldier was killed when a remote-controlled bomb went off near an armoured vehicle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a service for the german soldier killed in afghanistan last week german troops were also responsible for civilian deaths last week when three afghans were killed after both german and afghan troops opened fire on a vehicle that had failed to stop at a checkpoint even after warning shots had been fired .
the german army has paid compensation to relatives of a woman and two children shot dead last week at a checkpoint manned by its soldiers in northern afghanistan , german daily newspaper die welt reported this week .
a defence ministry spokesperson confirmed the report this week saying defence minister jung had arranged the compensation during the visit to afghanistan to pay his respects to the relatives .
it was one of a recent string of incidents that experts say are damaging the reputation of the almost 70,000 international troops as well as the afghan government , which need the backing of the local population if they want to beat a taliban-led insurgency .
even though most german soldiers that are part of the nato-led international force in are stationed in the relatively calm north , 26 troops have died in afghanistan since the start of the mission in 2002 . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the warsaw newspaper quoted sources saying that they had seen the document but did not explicitly say that the prison served as a holding center for al-qaeda terrorist suspects as has been alleged in the american media .
the gazeta reported that according to the document the secret prison was set up after the us and poland signed an accord in 2002 to combat terrorism .
cia prison allegations surfaced in 2005 polish prosecutors had been investigating long-running allegations of a secret cia jail to interrogate top al-qaeda operatives near szymany in northeast poland .
in 2006 , the head of the secret services had presented the two-page document to two ministers from the then ruling conservative law and justice party and poland 's chief prosecutor janusz kaczmarek at the time , according to gazeta .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top officials declined to speak to the polish newspaper kaczmarek confirmed the meeting with the ministers , but refused to comment on what transpired . the ex-ministers declined to speak with the newspaper .
in the past polish officials have consistently rejected media claims that warsaw allowed the cia to run a secret prison for captured islamic radicals .
polish top aide denies knowledge of memo but on friday , a top advisor to prime minister donald tusk did confirm that prosecutors were investigating the allegations , although he denied any knowledge of the secret memorandum .
" i am not familiar with such a note and i do n't think prime minister donald tusk is either , " said tusk 's aide slawomir nowak in an interview with poland 's tok fm radio .
" but the premier asked the justice minister to clarify this matter and the country 's prosecutor 's office is investigating the potential existence of the cia prison . "
back in 2005 , the washington post broke the story that cia prisons existed in europe .
close cooperation between us and polish secret services bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a top aide to poland 's tusk denied knowledge of secret memo " there definitely was cooperation between polish and american secret services , " a source close to the us intelligence agency told news agency reuters .
" but whether there was torture at the base , hopefully we will learn about that soon . "
rumors circulated in the us and foreign media that the base was operational between 2002 and 2005 at a time when poland was governed by the left-leaning governments of leszek miller and marek belka and then a rightist administration under kazimierz marcinkiewicz .
all three former leaders have denied any knowledge of such a prison or base , and tusk 's center-right government has until now also played down speculation of its existence .
" i hope this will not be confirmed , " nowak said to reuters .
" it would not only have serious consequences inside the country but would also take a very serious toll on the international scene .
this has to be investigated very carefully , without emotions . "

advertisement john mccain 's speech to the republican convention senator john mccain has addressed the republican national convention in st paul , minnesota , promising " change is coming " as he accepted the party 's candidacy for the white house .
below is the full text of his speech , as prepared for delivery .
thank you all very much .
tonight , i have a privilege given few americans - the privilege of accepting our party 's nomination for president of the united states .
and i accept it with gratitude , humility and confidence .
in my life , no success has come without a good fight , and this nomination was n't any different .
that 's a tribute to the candidates who opposed me and their supporters .
they 're leaders of great ability , who love our country , and wished to lead it to better days .
their support is an honour i wo n't forget .
tag cloud this tag cloud displays words in proportion to their frequency the word count is based on the text as prepared for delivery family life i 'm grateful to the president for leading us in those dark days following the worst attack on american soil in our history , and keeping us safe from another attack many thought was inevitable - and to the first lady , laura bush , a model of grace and kindness in public and in private .
and i 'm grateful to the 41st president and his bride of 63 years , and for their outstanding example of honourable service to our country .
as always , i 'm indebted to my wife , cindy , and my seven children .
we 'll go at it over the next two months ... that 's the nature of these contests , and there are big differences between us the pleasures of family life can seem like a brief holiday from the crowded calendar of our nation 's business .
but i have treasured them all the more , and ca n't imagine a life without the happiness you give me .
cindy said a lot of nice things about me tonight .
but , in truth , she 's more my inspiration than i am hers .
her concern for those less blessed than we are - victims of land mines , children born in poverty and with birth defects - shows the measure of her humanity .
i know she will make a great first lady .
created equal when i was growing up , my father was often at sea , and the job of raising my brother , sister and me would fall to my mother alone .
roberta mccain gave us her love of life , her deep interest in the world , her strength , and her belief we are all meant to use our opportunities to make ourselves useful to our country .
i would n't be here tonight but for the strength of her character .
my heartfelt thanks to all of you , who helped me win this nomination , and stood by me when the odds were long .
i wo n't let you down .
to americans who have yet to decide who to vote for , thank you for your consideration and the opportunity to win your trust .
i intend to earn it .
finally , a word to senator obama and his supporters .
we 'll go at it over the next two months .
that 's the nature of these contests , and there are big differences between us .
but you have my respect and admiration .
despite our differences , much more unites us than divides us .
we are fellow americans , an association that means more to me than any other .
we 're dedicated to the proposition that all people are created equal and endowed by our creator with inalienable rights .
no country ever had a greater cause than that , and i would n't be an american worthy of the name if i did n't honour senator obama and his supporters for their achievement .
on your side but let there be no doubt , my friends , we 're going to win this election .
and after we 've won , we 're going to reach out our hand to any willing patriot , make this government start working for you again , and get this country back on the road to prosperity and peace .
these are tough times for many of you .
you 're worried about keeping your job or finding a new one , and are struggling to put food on the table and stay in your home .
i 'd rather lose an election than see my country lose a war all you ever asked of government is to stand on your side , not in your way .
and that 's just what i intend to do - stand on your side and fight for your future .
and i 've found just the right partner to help me shake up washington , governor sarah palin of alaska .
she has executive experience and a real record of accomplishment .
she 's tackled tough problems like energy independence and corruption .
she 's balanced a budget , cut taxes , and taken on the special interests .
she 's reached across the aisle and asked republicans , democrats and independents to serve in her administration .
she 's the mother of five children .
she 's helped run a small business , worked with her hands and knows what it 's like to worry about mortgage payments and health care and the cost of gasoline and groceries .
she knows where she comes from and she knows who she works for .
she stands up for what 's right , and she does n't let anyone tell her to sit down .
i 'm very proud to have introduced our next vice president to the country .
but i ca n't wait until i introduce her to washington .
and let me offer an advance warning to the old , big spending , do nothing , me first , country second washington crowd - change is coming .
maverick i 'm not in the habit of breaking promises to my country and neither is governor palin .
and when we tell you we 're going to change washington , and stop leaving our country 's problems for some unluckier generation to fix , you can count on it .
we lost the trust of the american people when some republicans gave in to the temptations of corruption we 've got a record of doing just that , and the strength , experience , judgment and backbone to keep our word to you .
you know , i 've been called a maverick - someone who marches to the beat of his own drum .
sometimes it 's meant as a compliment and sometimes it 's not .
what it really means is i understand who i work for .
i do n't work for a party .
i do n't work for a special interest .
i do n't work for myself .
i work for you .
i 've fought corruption , and it did n't matter if the culprits were democrats or republicans .
they violated their public trust , and had to be held accountable .
i 've fought big spenders in both parties , who waste your money on things you neither need nor want , while you struggle to buy groceries , fill your gas tank and make your mortgage payment .
i 've fought to get million dollar checks out of our elections .
i 've fought lobbyists who stole from indian tribes .
i fought crooked deals in the pentagon .
i fought tobacco companies and trial lawyers , drug companies and union bosses .
i fought for the right strategy and more troops in iraq , when it was n't a popular thing to do .
and when the pundits said my campaign was finished , i said i 'd rather lose an election than see my country lose a war .
lost trust thanks to the leadership of a brilliant general , david petraeus , and the brave men and women he has the honour to command , that strategy succeeded and rescued us from a defeat that would have demoralized our military , risked a wider war and threatened the security of all americans .
i do n't mind a good fight .
for reasons known only to god , i 've had quite a few tough ones in my life .
but i learned an important lesson along the way .
in the end , it matters less that you can fight .
what you fight for is the real test .
i fight for americans .
i fight for you .
i fight for bill and sue nebe from farmington hills , michigan , who lost their real estate investments in the bad housing market .
bill got a temporary job after he was out of work for seven months .
sue works three jobs to help pay the bills .
i fight for jake and toni wimmer of franklin county , pennsylvania .
jake works on a loading dock ; coaches little league , and raises money for the mentally and physically disabled .
toni is a schoolteacher , working toward her master 's degree .
they have two sons , the youngest , luke , has been diagnosed with autism .
my health care plan will make it easier for more americans to find and keep good health care insurance their lives should matter to the people they elect to office .
they matter to me .
i fight for the family of matthew stanley of wolfboro , new hampshire , who died serving our country in iraq .
i wear his bracelet and think of him every day .
i intend to honour their sacrifice by making sure the country their son loved so well and never returned to , remains safe from its enemies .
i fight to restore the pride and principles of our party .
we were elected to change washington , and we let washington change us .
we lost the trust of the american people when some republicans gave in to the temptations of corruption .
we lost their trust when rather than reform government , both parties made it bigger .
we lost their trust when instead of freeing ourselves from a dangerous dependence on foreign oil , both parties and senator obama passed another corporate welfare bill for oil companies .
we lost their trust , when we valued our power over our principles .
we 're going to change that .
we 're going to recover the people 's trust by standing up again for the values americans admire .
the party of lincoln , roosevelt and reagan is going to get back to basics .
tax cuts we believe everyone has something to contribute and deserves the opportunity to reach their god-given potential from the boy whose descendents arrived on the mayflower to the latina daughter of migrant workers .
we 're all god 's children and we 're all americans .
we believe in low taxes , spending discipline and open markets .
we believe in rewarding hard work and risk takers and letting people keep the fruits of their labour .
we believe in a strong defence , work , faith , service , a culture of life , personal responsibility , the rule of law , and judges who dispense justice impartially and do n't legislate from the bench .
we believe in the values of families , neighbourhoods and communities .
we believe in a government that unleashes the creativity and initiative of americans - government that does n't make your choices for you , but works to make sure you have more choices to make for yourself .
education is the civil rights issue of this century i will keep taxes low and cut them where i can .
my opponent will raise them .
i will open new markets to our goods and services .
my opponent will close them .
i will cut government spending .
he will increase it .
my tax cuts will create jobs .
his tax increases will eliminate them .
my health care plan will make it easier for more americans to find and keep good health care insurance .
his plan will force small businesses to cut jobs , reduce wages , and force families into a government run health care system where a bureaucrat stands between you and your doctor .
keeping taxes low helps small businesses grow and create new jobs .
cutting the second highest business tax rate in the world will help american companies compete and keep jobs from moving overseas .
doubling the child tax exemption from $ 3500 to $ 7000 will improve the lives of millions of american families .
reducing government spending and getting rid of failed programs will let you keep more of your own money to save , spend and invest as you see fit .
opening new markets and preparing workers to compete in the world economy is essential to our future prosperity .
education choice i know some of you have been left behind in the changing economy and it often seems your government has n't even noticed .
government assistance for unemployed workers was designed for the economy of the 1950s .
that 's going to change on my watch .
we are going to stop sending $ 700bn a year to countries that do n't like us very much my opponent promises to bring back old jobs by wishing away the global economy .
we 're going to help workers who 've lost a job that wo n't come back , find a new one that wo n't go away .
we will prepare them for the jobs of today .
we will use our community colleges to help train people for new opportunities in their communities .
for workers in industries that have been hard hit , we 'll help make up part of the difference in wages between their old job and a temporary , lower paid one while they receive retraining that will help them find secure new employment at a decent wage .
education is the civil rights issue of this century .
equal access to public education has been gained .
but what is the value of access to a failing school ?
we need to shake up failed school bureaucracies with competition , empower parents with choice , remove barriers to qualified instructors , attract and reward good teachers , and help bad teachers find another line of work .
when a public school fails to meet its obligations to students , parents deserve a choice in the education of their children .
and i intend to give it to them .
some may choose a better public school .
some may choose a private one .
many will choose a charter school .
but they will have that choice and their children will have that opportunity .
senator obama wants our schools to answer to unions and entrenched bureaucracies .
i want schools to answer to parents and students .
and when i 'm president , they will .
energy independence my fellow americans , when i 'm president , we 're going to embark on the most ambitious national project in decades .
we are going to stop sending $ 700bn a year to countries that do n't like us very much .
we will attack the problem on every front .
we will produce more energy at home .
we will drill new wells offshore , and we 'll drill them now .
we ca n't turn a blind eye to aggression and international lawlessness that threatens the peace and stability of the world we will build more nuclear power plants .
we will develop clean coal technology .
we will increase the use of wind , tide , solar and natural gas .
we will encourage the development and use of flex fuel , hybrid and electric automobiles .
senator obama thinks we can achieve energy independence without more drilling and without more nuclear power .
but americans know better than that .
we must use all resources and develop all technologies necessary to rescue our economy from the damage caused by rising oil prices and to restore the health of our planet .
it 's an ambitious plan , but americans are ambitious by nature , and we have faced greater challenges .
it 's time for us to show the world again how americans lead .
this great national cause will create millions of new jobs , many in industries that will be the engine of our future prosperity - jobs that will be there when your children enter the workforce .
dangerous world today , the prospect of a better world remains within our reach .
but we must see the threats to peace and liberty in our time clearly and face them , as americans before us did , with confidence , wisdom and resolve .
we have dealt a serious blow to al qaeda in recent years .
but they are not defeated , and they 'll strike us again if they can .
iran remains the chief state sponsor of terrorism and on the path to acquiring nuclear weapons .
i 'm running for president to keep the country i love safe russia 's leaders , rich with oil wealth and corrupt with power , have rejected democratic ideals and the obligations of a responsible power .
they invaded a small , democratic neighbour to gain more control over the world 's oil supply , intimidate other neighbours , and further their ambitions of reassembling the russian empire .
and the brave people of georgia need our solidarity and prayers .
as president i will work to establish good relations with russia so we need not fear a return of the cold war .
but we ca n't turn a blind eye to aggression and international lawlessness that threatens the peace and stability of the world and the security of the american people .
we face many threats in this dangerous world , but i 'm not afraid of them .
i 'm prepared for them .
i know how the military works , what it can do , what it can do better , and what it should not do .
i know how the world works .
i know the good and the evil in it .
i know how to work with leaders who share our dreams of a freer , safer and more prosperous world , and how to stand up to those who do n't .
i know how to secure the peace .
enduring peace when i was five years old , a car pulled up in front of our house .
a navy officer rolled down the window , and shouted at my father that the japanese had bombed pearl harbour .
i rarely saw my father again for four years .
my grandfather came home from that same war exhausted from the burdens he had borne , and died the next day .
in vietnam , where i formed the closest friendships of my life , some of those friends never came home with me .
i hate war .
it is terrible beyond imagination .
i 'm running for president to keep the country i love safe , and prevent other families from risking their loved ones in war as my family has .
i will draw on all my experience with the world and its leaders , and all the tools at our disposal - diplomatic , economic , military and the power of our ideals - to build the foundations for a stable and enduring peace .
i 've been an imperfect servant of my country for many years ... but i have been her servant first , last and always in america , we change things that need to be changed .
each generation makes its contribution to our greatness .
the work that is ours to do is plainly before us .
we do n't need to search for it .
we need to change the way government does almost everything : from the way we protect our security to the way we compete in the world economy , from the way we respond to disasters to the way we fuel our transportation network , from the way we train our workers to the way we educate our children .
all these functions of government were designed before the rise of the global economy , the information technology revolution and the end of the cold war .
we have to catch up to history , and we have to change the way we do business in washington .
the constant partisan rancour that stops us from solving these problems is n't a cause , it 's a symptom .
it 's what happens when people go to washington to work for themselves and not you .
again and again , i 've worked with members of both parties to fix problems that need to be fixed .
that 's how i will govern as president .
i will reach out my hand to anyone to help me get this country moving again .
i have that record and the scars to prove it .
senator obama does not .
company of heroes instead of rejecting good ideas because we did n't think of them first , let 's use the best ideas from both sides .
instead of fighting over who gets the credit , let 's try sharing it .
this amazing country can do anything we put our minds to .
i will ask democrats and independents to serve with me .
and my administration will set a new standard for transparency and accountability .
we 're going to finally start getting things done for the people who are counting on us , and i wo n't care who gets the credit .
i 've been an imperfect servant of my country for many years .
but i have been her servant first , last and always .
and i 've never lived a day , in good times or bad , that i did n't thank god for the privilege .
long ago , something unusual happened to me that taught me the most valuable lesson of my life .
i was blessed by misfortune .
i always liked to strut a little after i 'd been roughed up to show the other guys i was tough enough to take it i mean that sincerely .
i was blessed because i served in the company of heroes , and i witnessed a thousand acts of courage , compassion and love .
on an october morning , in the gulf of tonkin , i prepared for my 23rd mission over north vietnam .
i had n't any worry i would n't come back safe and sound .
i thought i was tougher than anyone .
i was pretty independent then , too .
i liked to bend a few rules , and pick a few fights for the fun of it .
but i did it for my own pleasure , my own pride .
i did n't think there was a cause more important than me .
then i found myself falling toward the middle of a small lake in the city of hanoi , with two broken arms , a broken leg , and an angry crowd waiting to greet me .
i was dumped in a dark cell , and left to die .
i did n't feel so tough anymore .
when they discovered my father was an admiral , they took me to a hospital .
they could n't set my bones properly , so they just slapped a cast on me .
when i did n't get better , and was down to about a hundred pounds , they put me in a cell with two other americans .
i could n't do anything .
i could n't even feed myself .
they did it for me .
i was beginning to learn the limits of my selfish independence .
those men saved my life .
my country saved me i was in solitary confinement when my captors offered to release me .
i knew why .
if i went home , they would use it as propaganda to demoralize my fellow prisoners .
our code said we could only go home in the order of our capture , and there were men who had been shot down before me .
i thought about it , though .
i was n't in great shape , and i missed everything about america .
but i turned it down .
a lot of prisoners had it worse than i did .
i 'd been mistreated before , but not as badly as others .
i always liked to strut a little after i 'd been roughed up to show the other guys i was tough enough to take it .
but after i turned down their offer , they worked me over harder than they ever had before .
for a long time .
and they broke me .
nothing brings greater happiness in life than to serve a cause greater than yourself when they brought me back to my cell , i was hurt and ashamed , and i did n't know how i could face my fellow prisoners .
the good man in the cell next door , my friend , bob craner , saved me .
through taps on a wall he told me i had fought as hard as i could .
no man can always stand alone .
and then he told me to get back up and fight again for our country and for the men i had the honour to serve with .
because every day they fought for me .
i fell in love with my country when i was a prisoner in someone else 's .
i loved it not just for the many comforts of life here .
i loved it for its decency , for its faith in the wisdom , justice and goodness of its people .
i loved it because it was not just a place , but an idea , a cause worth fighting for .
i was never the same again .
i was n't my own man anymore .
i was my country 's .
i 'm not running for president because i think i 'm blessed with such personal greatness that history has anointed me to save our country in its hour of need .
my country saved me .
my country saved me , and i can not forget it .
and i will fight for her for as long as i draw breath , so help me god .
greater cause if you find faults with our country , make it a better one .
if you 're disappointed with the mistakes of government , join its ranks and work to correct them .
enlist in our armed forces .
become a teacher .
enter the ministry .
run for public office .
feed a hungry child .
teach an illiterate adult to read .
comfort the afflicted .
defend the rights of the oppressed .
our country will be the better , and you will be the happier .
because nothing brings greater happiness in life than to serve a cause greater than yourself .
i 'm going to fight for my cause every day as your president .
i 'm going to fight to make sure every american has every reason to thank god , as i thank him : that i 'm an american , a proud citizen of the greatest country on earth , and with hard work , strong faith and a little courage , great things are always within our reach .
fight with me .
fight with me .
fight for what 's right for our country .
fight for the ideals and character of a free people .
fight for our children 's future .
fight for justice and opportunity for all .
stand up to defend our country from its enemies .
stand up for each other ; for beautiful , blessed , bountiful america .
stand up , stand up , stand up and fight .
nothing is inevitable here .
we 're americans , and we never give up .
we never quit .
we never hide from history .
we make history .
thank you , and god bless you .

and when we tell you we 're going to change washington , and stop leaving our country 's problems for some unluckier generation to fix , you can count on it .
we lost the trust of the american people when some republicans gave in to the temptations of corruption we 've got a record of doing just that , and the strength , experience , judgment and backbone to keep our word to you .
you know , i 've been called a maverick - someone who marches to the beat of his own drum .
sometimes it 's meant as a compliment and sometimes it 's not .
what it really means is i understand who i work for .
i do n't work for a party .
i do n't work for a special interest .
i do n't work for myself .
i work for you .
i 've fought corruption , and it did n't matter if the culprits were democrats or republicans .
they violated their public trust , and had to be held accountable .
i 've fought big spenders in both parties , who waste your money on things you neither need nor want , while you struggle to buy groceries , fill your gas tank and make your mortgage payment .
i 've fought to get million dollar checks out of our elections .
i 've fought lobbyists who stole from indian tribes .
i fought crooked deals in the pentagon .
i fought tobacco companies and trial lawyers , drug companies and union bosses .
i fought for the right strategy and more troops in iraq , when it was n't a popular thing to do .
and when the pundits said my campaign was finished , i said i 'd rather lose an election than see my country lose a war .
lost trust thanks to the leadership of a brilliant general , david petraeus , and the brave men and women he has the honour to command , that strategy succeeded and rescued us from a defeat that would have demoralized our military , risked a wider war and threatened the security of all americans .
i do n't mind a good fight .
for reasons known only to god , i 've had quite a few tough ones in my life .
but i learned an important lesson along the way .
in the end , it matters less that you can fight .
what you fight for is the real test .
i fight for americans .
i fight for you .
i fight for bill and sue nebe from farmington hills , michigan , who lost their real estate investments in the bad housing market .
bill got a temporary job after he was out of work for seven months .
sue works three jobs to help pay the bills .
i fight for jake and toni wimmer of franklin county , pennsylvania .
jake works on a loading dock ; coaches little league , and raises money for the mentally and physically disabled .
toni is a schoolteacher , working toward her master 's degree .
they have two sons , the youngest , luke , has been diagnosed with autism .
my health care plan will make it easier for more americans to find and keep good health care insurance their lives should matter to the people they elect to office .
they matter to me .
i fight for the family of matthew stanley of wolfboro , new hampshire , who died serving our country in iraq .
i wear his bracelet and think of him every day .
i intend to honour their sacrifice by making sure the country their son loved so well and never returned to , remains safe from its enemies .
i fight to restore the pride and principles of our party .
we were elected to change washington , and we let washington change us .
we lost the trust of the american people when some republicans gave in to the temptations of corruption .
we lost their trust when rather than reform government , both parties made it bigger .
we lost their trust when instead of freeing ourselves from a dangerous dependence on foreign oil , both parties and senator obama passed another corporate welfare bill for oil companies .
we lost their trust , when we valued our power over our principles .
we 're going to change that .
we 're going to recover the people 's trust by standing up again for the values americans admire .
the party of lincoln , roosevelt and reagan is going to get back to basics .
tax cuts we believe everyone has something to contribute and deserves the opportunity to reach their god-given potential from the boy whose descendents arrived on the mayflower to the latina daughter of migrant workers .
we 're all god 's children and we 're all americans .
we believe in low taxes , spending discipline and open markets .
we believe in rewarding hard work and risk takers and letting people keep the fruits of their labour .
we believe in a strong defence , work , faith , service , a culture of life , personal responsibility , the rule of law , and judges who dispense justice impartially and do n't legislate from the bench .
we believe in the values of families , neighbourhoods and communities .
we believe in a government that unleashes the creativity and initiative of americans - government that does n't make your choices for you , but works to make sure you have more choices to make for yourself .
education is the civil rights issue of this century i will keep taxes low and cut them where i can .
my opponent will raise them .
i will open new markets to our goods and services .
my opponent will close them .
i will cut government spending .
he will increase it .
my tax cuts will create jobs .
his tax increases will eliminate them .
my health care plan will make it easier for more americans to find and keep good health care insurance .
his plan will force small businesses to cut jobs , reduce wages , and force families into a government run health care system where a bureaucrat stands between you and your doctor .
keeping taxes low helps small businesses grow and create new jobs .
cutting the second highest business tax rate in the world will help american companies compete and keep jobs from moving overseas .
doubling the child tax exemption from $ 3500 to $ 7000 will improve the lives of millions of american families .
reducing government spending and getting rid of failed programs will let you keep more of your own money to save , spend and invest as you see fit .
opening new markets and preparing workers to compete in the world economy is essential to our future prosperity .
education choice i know some of you have been left behind in the changing economy and it often seems your government has n't even noticed .
government assistance for unemployed workers was designed for the economy of the 1950s .
that 's going to change on my watch .
we are going to stop sending $ 700bn a year to countries that do n't like us very much my opponent promises to bring back old jobs by wishing away the global economy .
we 're going to help workers who 've lost a job that wo n't come back , find a new one that wo n't go away .
we will prepare them for the jobs of today .
we will use our community colleges to help train people for new opportunities in their communities .
for workers in industries that have been hard hit , we 'll help make up part of the difference in wages between their old job and a temporary , lower paid one while they receive retraining that will help them find secure new employment at a decent wage .
education is the civil rights issue of this century .
equal access to public education has been gained .
but what is the value of access to a failing school ?
we need to shake up failed school bureaucracies with competition , empower parents with choice , remove barriers to qualified instructors , attract and reward good teachers , and help bad teachers find another line of work .
when a public school fails to meet its obligations to students , parents deserve a choice in the education of their children .
and i intend to give it to them .
some may choose a better public school .
some may choose a private one .
many will choose a charter school .
but they will have that choice and their children will have that opportunity .
senator obama wants our schools to answer to unions and entrenched bureaucracies .
i want schools to answer to parents and students .
and when i 'm president , they will .
energy independence my fellow americans , when i 'm president , we 're going to embark on the most ambitious national project in decades .
we are going to stop sending $ 700bn a year to countries that do n't like us very much .
we will attack the problem on every front .
we will produce more energy at home .
we will drill new wells offshore , and we 'll drill them now .
we ca n't turn a blind eye to aggression and international lawlessness that threatens the peace and stability of the world we will build more nuclear power plants .
we will develop clean coal technology .
we will increase the use of wind , tide , solar and natural gas .
we will encourage the development and use of flex fuel , hybrid and electric automobiles .
senator obama thinks we can achieve energy independence without more drilling and without more nuclear power .
but americans know better than that .
we must use all resources and develop all technologies necessary to rescue our economy from the damage caused by rising oil prices and to restore the health of our planet .
it 's an ambitious plan , but americans are ambitious by nature , and we have faced greater challenges .
it 's time for us to show the world again how americans lead .
this great national cause will create millions of new jobs , many in industries that will be the engine of our future prosperity - jobs that will be there when your children enter the workforce .
dangerous world today , the prospect of a better world remains within our reach .
but we must see the threats to peace and liberty in our time clearly and face them , as americans before us did , with confidence , wisdom and resolve .
we have dealt a serious blow to al qaeda in recent years .
but they are not defeated , and they 'll strike us again if they can .
iran remains the chief state sponsor of terrorism and on the path to acquiring nuclear weapons .
i 'm running for president to keep the country i love safe russia 's leaders , rich with oil wealth and corrupt with power , have rejected democratic ideals and the obligations of a responsible power .
they invaded a small , democratic neighbour to gain more control over the world 's oil supply , intimidate other neighbours , and further their ambitions of reassembling the russian empire .
and the brave people of georgia need our solidarity and prayers .
as president i will work to establish good relations with russia so we need not fear a return of the cold war .
but we ca n't turn a blind eye to aggression and international lawlessness that threatens the peace and stability of the world and the security of the american people .
we face many threats in this dangerous world , but i 'm not afraid of them .
i 'm prepared for them .
i know how the military works , what it can do , what it can do better , and what it should not do .
i know how the world works .
i know the good and the evil in it .
i know how to work with leaders who share our dreams of a freer , safer and more prosperous world , and how to stand up to those who do n't .
i know how to secure the peace .
enduring peace when i was five years old , a car pulled up in front of our house .
a navy officer rolled down the window , and shouted at my father that the japanese had bombed pearl harbour .
i rarely saw my father again for four years .
my grandfather came home from that same war exhausted from the burdens he had borne , and died the next day .
in vietnam , where i formed the closest friendships of my life , some of those friends never came home with me .
i hate war .
it is terrible beyond imagination .
i 'm running for president to keep the country i love safe , and prevent other families from risking their loved ones in war as my family has .
i will draw on all my experience with the world and its leaders , and all the tools at our disposal - diplomatic , economic , military and the power of our ideals - to build the foundations for a stable and enduring peace .
i 've been an imperfect servant of my country for many years ... but i have been her servant first , last and always in america , we change things that need to be changed .
each generation makes its contribution to our greatness .
the work that is ours to do is plainly before us .
we do n't need to search for it .
we need to change the way government does almost everything : from the way we protect our security to the way we compete in the world economy , from the way we respond to disasters to the way we fuel our transportation network , from the way we train our workers to the way we educate our children .
all these functions of government were designed before the rise of the global economy , the information technology revolution and the end of the cold war .
we have to catch up to history , and we have to change the way we do business in washington .
the constant partisan rancour that stops us from solving these problems is n't a cause , it 's a symptom .
it 's what happens when people go to washington to work for themselves and not you .
again and again , i 've worked with members of both parties to fix problems that need to be fixed .
that 's how i will govern as president .
i will reach out my hand to anyone to help me get this country moving again .
i have that record and the scars to prove it .
senator obama does not .
company of heroes instead of rejecting good ideas because we did n't think of them first , let 's use the best ideas from both sides .
instead of fighting over who gets the credit , let 's try sharing it .
this amazing country can do anything we put our minds to .
i will ask democrats and independents to serve with me .
and my administration will set a new standard for transparency and accountability .
we 're going to finally start getting things done for the people who are counting on us , and i wo n't care who gets the credit .
i 've been an imperfect servant of my country for many years .
but i have been her servant first , last and always .
and i 've never lived a day , in good times or bad , that i did n't thank god for the privilege .
long ago , something unusual happened to me that taught me the most valuable lesson of my life .
i was blessed by misfortune .
i always liked to strut a little after i 'd been roughed up to show the other guys i was tough enough to take it i mean that sincerely .
i was blessed because i served in the company of heroes , and i witnessed a thousand acts of courage , compassion and love .
on an october morning , in the gulf of tonkin , i prepared for my 23rd mission over north vietnam .
i had n't any worry i would n't come back safe and sound .
i thought i was tougher than anyone .
i was pretty independent then , too .
i liked to bend a few rules , and pick a few fights for the fun of it .
but i did it for my own pleasure , my own pride .
i did n't think there was a cause more important than me .
then i found myself falling toward the middle of a small lake in the city of hanoi , with two broken arms , a broken leg , and an angry crowd waiting to greet me .
i was dumped in a dark cell , and left to die .
i did n't feel so tough anymore .
when they discovered my father was an admiral , they took me to a hospital .
they could n't set my bones properly , so they just slapped a cast on me .
when i did n't get better , and was down to about a hundred pounds , they put me in a cell with two other americans .
i could n't do anything .
i could n't even feed myself .
they did it for me .
i was beginning to learn the limits of my selfish independence .
those men saved my life .
my country saved me i was in solitary confinement when my captors offered to release me .
i knew why .
if i went home , they would use it as propaganda to demoralize my fellow prisoners .
our code said we could only go home in the order of our capture , and there were men who had been shot down before me .
i thought about it , though .
i was n't in great shape , and i missed everything about america .
but i turned it down .
a lot of prisoners had it worse than i did .
i 'd been mistreated before , but not as badly as others .
i always liked to strut a little after i 'd been roughed up to show the other guys i was tough enough to take it .
but after i turned down their offer , they worked me over harder than they ever had before .
for a long time .
and they broke me .
nothing brings greater happiness in life than to serve a cause greater than yourself when they brought me back to my cell , i was hurt and ashamed , and i did n't know how i could face my fellow prisoners .
the good man in the cell next door , my friend , bob craner , saved me .
through taps on a wall he told me i had fought as hard as i could .
no man can always stand alone .
and then he told me to get back up and fight again for our country and for the men i had the honour to serve with .
because every day they fought for me .
i fell in love with my country when i was a prisoner in someone else 's .
i loved it not just for the many comforts of life here .
i loved it for its decency , for its faith in the wisdom , justice and goodness of its people .
i loved it because it was not just a place , but an idea , a cause worth fighting for .
i was never the same again .
i was n't my own man anymore .
i was my country 's .
i 'm not running for president because i think i 'm blessed with such personal greatness that history has anointed me to save our country in its hour of need .
my country saved me .
my country saved me , and i can not forget it .
and i will fight for her for as long as i draw breath , so help me god .
greater cause if you find faults with our country , make it a better one .
if you 're disappointed with the mistakes of government , join its ranks and work to correct them .
enlist in our armed forces .
become a teacher .
enter the ministry .
run for public office .
feed a hungry child .
teach an illiterate adult to read .
comfort the afflicted .
defend the rights of the oppressed .
our country will be the better , and you will be the happier .
because nothing brings greater happiness in life than to serve a cause greater than yourself .
i 'm going to fight for my cause every day as your president .
i 'm going to fight to make sure every american has every reason to thank god , as i thank him : that i 'm an american , a proud citizen of the greatest country on earth , and with hard work , strong faith and a little courage , great things are always within our reach .
fight with me .
fight with me .
fight for what 's right for our country .
fight for the ideals and character of a free people .
fight for our children 's future .
fight for justice and opportunity for all .
stand up to defend our country from its enemies .
stand up for each other ; for beautiful , blessed , bountiful america .
stand up , stand up , stand up and fight .
nothing is inevitable here .
we 're americans , and we never give up .
we never quit .
we never hide from history .
we make history .
thank you , and god bless you .

advertisement john mccain 's speech to the republican convention senator john mccain has addressed the republican national convention in st paul , minnesota , promising " change is coming " as he accepted the party 's candidacy for the white house .
below is the full text of his speech , as prepared for delivery .
thank you all very much .
tonight , i have a privilege given few americans - the privilege of accepting our party 's nomination for president of the united states .
and i accept it with gratitude , humility and confidence .
in my life , no success has come without a good fight , and this nomination was n't any different .
that 's a tribute to the candidates who opposed me and their supporters .
they 're leaders of great ability , who love our country , and wished to lead it to better days .
their support is an honour i wo n't forget .
tag cloud this tag cloud displays words in proportion to their frequency the word count is based on the text as prepared for delivery family life i 'm grateful to the president for leading us in those dark days following the worst attack on american soil in our history , and keeping us safe from another attack many thought was inevitable - and to the first lady , laura bush , a model of grace and kindness in public and in private .
and i 'm grateful to the 41st president and his bride of 63 years , and for their outstanding example of honourable service to our country .
as always , i 'm indebted to my wife , cindy , and my seven children .
we 'll go at it over the next two months ... that 's the nature of these contests , and there are big differences between us the pleasures of family life can seem like a brief holiday from the crowded calendar of our nation 's business .
but i have treasured them all the more , and ca n't imagine a life without the happiness you give me .
cindy said a lot of nice things about me tonight .
but , in truth , she 's more my inspiration than i am hers .
her concern for those less blessed than we are - victims of land mines , children born in poverty and with birth defects - shows the measure of her humanity .
i know she will make a great first lady .
created equal when i was growing up , my father was often at sea , and the job of raising my brother , sister and me would fall to my mother alone .
roberta mccain gave us her love of life , her deep interest in the world , her strength , and her belief we are all meant to use our opportunities to make ourselves useful to our country .
i would n't be here tonight but for the strength of her character .
my heartfelt thanks to all of you , who helped me win this nomination , and stood by me when the odds were long .
i wo n't let you down .
to americans who have yet to decide who to vote for , thank you for your consideration and the opportunity to win your trust .
i intend to earn it .
finally , a word to senator obama and his supporters .
we 'll go at it over the next two months .
that 's the nature of these contests , and there are big differences between us .
but you have my respect and admiration .
despite our differences , much more unites us than divides us .
we are fellow americans , an association that means more to me than any other .
we 're dedicated to the proposition that all people are created equal and endowed by our creator with inalienable rights .
no country ever had a greater cause than that , and i would n't be an american worthy of the name if i did n't honour senator obama and his supporters for their achievement .
on your side but let there be no doubt , my friends , we 're going to win this election .
and after we 've won , we 're going to reach out our hand to any willing patriot , make this government start working for you again , and get this country back on the road to prosperity and peace .
these are tough times for many of you .
you 're worried about keeping your job or finding a new one , and are struggling to put food on the table and stay in your home .
i 'd rather lose an election than see my country lose a war all you ever asked of government is to stand on your side , not in your way .
and that 's just what i intend to do - stand on your side and fight for your future .
and i 've found just the right partner to help me shake up washington , governor sarah palin of alaska .
she has executive experience and a real record of accomplishment .
she 's tackled tough problems like energy independence and corruption .
she 's balanced a budget , cut taxes , and taken on the special interests .
she 's reached across the aisle and asked republicans , democrats and independents to serve in her administration .
she 's the mother of five children .
she 's helped run a small business , worked with her hands and knows what it 's like to worry about mortgage payments and health care and the cost of gasoline and groceries .
she knows where she comes from and she knows who she works for .
she stands up for what 's right , and she does n't let anyone tell her to sit down .
i 'm very proud to have introduced our next vice president to the country .
but i ca n't wait until i introduce her to washington .
and let me offer an advance warning to the old , big spending , do nothing , me first , country second washington crowd - change is coming .
maverick i 'm not in the habit of breaking promises to my country and neither is governor palin .
and when we tell you we 're going to change washington , and stop leaving our country 's problems for some unluckier generation to fix , you can count on it .
we lost the trust of the american people when some republicans gave in to the temptations of corruption we 've got a record of doing just that , and the strength , experience , judgment and backbone to keep our word to you .
you know , i 've been called a maverick - someone who marches to the beat of his own drum .
sometimes it 's meant as a compliment and sometimes it 's not .
what it really means is i understand who i work for .
i do n't work for a party .
i do n't work for a special interest .
i do n't work for myself .
i work for you .
i 've fought corruption , and it did n't matter if the culprits were democrats or republicans .
they violated their public trust , and had to be held accountable .
i 've fought big spenders in both parties , who waste your money on things you neither need nor want , while you struggle to buy groceries , fill your gas tank and make your mortgage payment .
i 've fought to get million dollar checks out of our elections .
i 've fought lobbyists who stole from indian tribes .
i fought crooked deals in the pentagon .
i fought tobacco companies and trial lawyers , drug companies and union bosses .
i fought for the right strategy and more troops in iraq , when it was n't a popular thing to do .
and when the pundits said my campaign was finished , i said i 'd rather lose an election than see my country lose a war .
lost trust thanks to the leadership of a brilliant general , david petraeus , and the brave men and women he has the honour to command , that strategy succeeded and rescued us from a defeat that would have demoralized our military , risked a wider war and threatened the security of all americans .
i do n't mind a good fight .
for reasons known only to god , i 've had quite a few tough ones in my life .
but i learned an important lesson along the way .
in the end , it matters less that you can fight .
what you fight for is the real test .
i fight for americans .
i fight for you .
i fight for bill and sue nebe from farmington hills , michigan , who lost their real estate investments in the bad housing market .
bill got a temporary job after he was out of work for seven months .
sue works three jobs to help pay the bills .
i fight for jake and toni wimmer of franklin county , pennsylvania .
jake works on a loading dock ; coaches little league , and raises money for the mentally and physically disabled .
toni is a schoolteacher , working toward her master 's degree .
they have two sons , the youngest , luke , has been diagnosed with autism .
my health care plan will make it easier for more americans to find and keep good health care insurance their lives should matter to the people they elect to office .
they matter to me .
i fight for the family of matthew stanley of wolfboro , new hampshire , who died serving our country in iraq .
i wear his bracelet and think of him every day .
i intend to honour their sacrifice by making sure the country their son loved so well and never returned to , remains safe from its enemies .
i fight to restore the pride and principles of our party .
we were elected to change washington , and we let washington change us .
we lost the trust of the american people when some republicans gave in to the temptations of corruption .
we lost their trust when rather than reform government , both parties made it bigger .
we lost their trust when instead of freeing ourselves from a dangerous dependence on foreign oil , both parties and senator obama passed another corporate welfare bill for oil companies .
we lost their trust , when we valued our power over our principles .
we 're going to change that .
we 're going to recover the people 's trust by standing up again for the values americans admire .
the party of lincoln , roosevelt and reagan is going to get back to basics .
tax cuts we believe everyone has something to contribute and deserves the opportunity to reach their god-given potential from the boy whose descendents arrived on the mayflower to the latina daughter of migrant workers .
we 're all god 's children and we 're all americans .
we believe in low taxes , spending discipline and open markets .
we believe in rewarding hard work and risk takers and letting people keep the fruits of their labour .
we believe in a strong defence , work , faith , service , a culture of life , personal responsibility , the rule of law , and judges who dispense justice impartially and do n't legislate from the bench .
we believe in the values of families , neighbourhoods and communities .
we believe in a government that unleashes the creativity and initiative of americans - government that does n't make your choices for you , but works to make sure you have more choices to make for yourself .
education is the civil rights issue of this century i will keep taxes low and cut them where i can .
my opponent will raise them .
i will open new markets to our goods and services .
my opponent will close them .
i will cut government spending .
he will increase it .
my tax cuts will create jobs .
his tax increases will eliminate them .
my health care plan will make it easier for more americans to find and keep good health care insurance .
his plan will force small businesses to cut jobs , reduce wages , and force families into a government run health care system where a bureaucrat stands between you and your doctor .
keeping taxes low helps small businesses grow and create new jobs .
cutting the second highest business tax rate in the world will help american companies compete and keep jobs from moving overseas .
doubling the child tax exemption from $ 3500 to $ 7000 will improve the lives of millions of american families .
reducing government spending and getting rid of failed programs will let you keep more of your own money to save , spend and invest as you see fit .
opening new markets and preparing workers to compete in the world economy is essential to our future prosperity .
education choice i know some of you have been left behind in the changing economy and it often seems your government has n't even noticed .
government assistance for unemployed workers was designed for the economy of the 1950s .
that 's going to change on my watch .
we are going to stop sending $ 700bn a year to countries that do n't like us very much my opponent promises to bring back old jobs by wishing away the global economy .
we 're going to help workers who 've lost a job that wo n't come back , find a new one that wo n't go away .
we will prepare them for the jobs of today .
we will use our community colleges to help train people for new opportunities in their communities .
for workers in industries that have been hard hit , we 'll help make up part of the difference in wages between their old job and a temporary , lower paid one while they receive retraining that will help them find secure new employment at a decent wage .
education is the civil rights issue of this century .
equal access to public education has been gained .
but what is the value of access to a failing school ?
we need to shake up failed school bureaucracies with competition , empower parents with choice , remove barriers to qualified instructors , attract and reward good teachers , and help bad teachers find another line of work .
when a public school fails to meet its obligations to students , parents deserve a choice in the education of their children .
and i intend to give it to them .
some may choose a better public school .
some may choose a private one .
many will choose a charter school .
but they will have that choice and their children will have that opportunity .
senator obama wants our schools to answer to unions and entrenched bureaucracies .
i want schools to answer to parents and students .
and when i 'm president , they will .
energy independence my fellow americans , when i 'm president , we 're going to embark on the most ambitious national project in decades .
we are going to stop sending $ 700bn a year to countries that do n't like us very much .
we will attack the problem on every front .
we will produce more energy at home .
we will drill new wells offshore , and we 'll drill them now .
we ca n't turn a blind eye to aggression and international lawlessness that threatens the peace and stability of the world we will build more nuclear power plants .
we will develop clean coal technology .
we will increase the use of wind , tide , solar and natural gas .
we will encourage the development and use of flex fuel , hybrid and electric automobiles .
senator obama thinks we can achieve energy independence without more drilling and without more nuclear power .
but americans know better than that .
we must use all resources and develop all technologies necessary to rescue our economy from the damage caused by rising oil prices and to restore the health of our planet .
it 's an ambitious plan , but americans are ambitious by nature , and we have faced greater challenges .
it 's time for us to show the world again how americans lead .
this great national cause will create millions of new jobs , many in industries that will be the engine of our future prosperity - jobs that will be there when your children enter the workforce .
dangerous world today , the prospect of a better world remains within our reach .
but we must see the threats to peace and liberty in our time clearly and face them , as americans before us did , with confidence , wisdom and resolve .
we have dealt a serious blow to al qaeda in recent years .
but they are not defeated , and they 'll strike us again if they can .
iran remains the chief state sponsor of terrorism and on the path to acquiring nuclear weapons .
i 'm running for president to keep the country i love safe russia 's leaders , rich with oil wealth and corrupt with power , have rejected democratic ideals and the obligations of a responsible power .
they invaded a small , democratic neighbour to gain more control over the world 's oil supply , intimidate other neighbours , and further their ambitions of reassembling the russian empire .
and the brave people of georgia need our solidarity and prayers .
as president i will work to establish good relations with russia so we need not fear a return of the cold war .
but we ca n't turn a blind eye to aggression and international lawlessness that threatens the peace and stability of the world and the security of the american people .
we face many threats in this dangerous world , but i 'm not afraid of them .
i 'm prepared for them .
i know how the military works , what it can do , what it can do better , and what it should not do .
i know how the world works .
i know the good and the evil in it .
i know how to work with leaders who share our dreams of a freer , safer and more prosperous world , and how to stand up to those who do n't .
i know how to secure the peace .
enduring peace when i was five years old , a car pulled up in front of our house .
a navy officer rolled down the window , and shouted at my father that the japanese had bombed pearl harbour .
i rarely saw my father again for four years .
my grandfather came home from that same war exhausted from the burdens he had borne , and died the next day .
in vietnam , where i formed the closest friendships of my life , some of those friends never came home with me .
i hate war .
it is terrible beyond imagination .
i 'm running for president to keep the country i love safe , and prevent other families from risking their loved ones in war as my family has .
i will draw on all my experience with the world and its leaders , and all the tools at our disposal - diplomatic , economic , military and the power of our ideals - to build the foundations for a stable and enduring peace .
i 've been an imperfect servant of my country for many years ... but i have been her servant first , last and always in america , we change things that need to be changed .
each generation makes its contribution to our greatness .
the work that is ours to do is plainly before us .
we do n't need to search for it .
we need to change the way government does almost everything : from the way we protect our security to the way we compete in the world economy , from the way we respond to disasters to the way we fuel our transportation network , from the way we train our workers to the way we educate our children .
all these functions of government were designed before the rise of the global economy , the information technology revolution and the end of the cold war .
we have to catch up to history , and we have to change the way we do business in washington .
the constant partisan rancour that stops us from solving these problems is n't a cause , it 's a symptom .
it 's what happens when people go to washington to work for themselves and not you .
again and again , i 've worked with members of both parties to fix problems that need to be fixed .
that 's how i will govern as president .
i will reach out my hand to anyone to help me get this country moving again .
i have that record and the scars to prove it .
senator obama does not .
company of heroes instead of rejecting good ideas because we did n't think of them first , let 's use the best ideas from both sides .
instead of fighting over who gets the credit , let 's try sharing it .
this amazing country can do anything we put our minds to .
i will ask democrats and independents to serve with me .
and my administration will set a new standard for transparency and accountability .
we 're going to finally start getting things done for the people who are counting on us , and i wo n't care who gets the credit .
i 've been an imperfect servant of my country for many years .
but i have been her servant first , last and always .
and i 've never lived a day , in good times or bad , that i did n't thank god for the privilege .
long ago , something unusual happened to me that taught me the most valuable lesson of my life .
i was blessed by misfortune .
i always liked to strut a little after i 'd been roughed up to show the other guys i was tough enough to take it i mean that sincerely .
i was blessed because i served in the company of heroes , and i witnessed a thousand acts of courage , compassion and love .
on an october morning , in the gulf of tonkin , i prepared for my 23rd mission over north vietnam .
i had n't any worry i would n't come back safe and sound .
i thought i was tougher than anyone .
i was pretty independent then , too .
i liked to bend a few rules , and pick a few fights for the fun of it .
but i did it for my own pleasure , my own pride .
i did n't think there was a cause more important than me .
then i found myself falling toward the middle of a small lake in the city of hanoi , with two broken arms , a broken leg , and an angry crowd waiting to greet me .
i was dumped in a dark cell , and left to die .
i did n't feel so tough anymore .
when they discovered my father was an admiral , they took me to a hospital .
they could n't set my bones properly , so they just slapped a cast on me .
when i did n't get better , and was down to about a hundred pounds , they put me in a cell with two other americans .
i could n't do anything .
i could n't even feed myself .
they did it for me .
i was beginning to learn the limits of my selfish independence .
those men saved my life .
my country saved me i was in solitary confinement when my captors offered to release me .
i knew why .
if i went home , they would use it as propaganda to demoralize my fellow prisoners .
our code said we could only go home in the order of our capture , and there were men who had been shot down before me .
i thought about it , though .
i was n't in great shape , and i missed everything about america .
but i turned it down .
a lot of prisoners had it worse than i did .
i 'd been mistreated before , but not as badly as others .
i always liked to strut a little after i 'd been roughed up to show the other guys i was tough enough to take it .
but after i turned down their offer , they worked me over harder than they ever had before .
for a long time .
and they broke me .
nothing brings greater happiness in life than to serve a cause greater than yourself when they brought me back to my cell , i was hurt and ashamed , and i did n't know how i could face my fellow prisoners .
the good man in the cell next door , my friend , bob craner , saved me .
through taps on a wall he told me i had fought as hard as i could .
no man can always stand alone .
and then he told me to get back up and fight again for our country and for the men i had the honour to serve with .
because every day they fought for me .
i fell in love with my country when i was a prisoner in someone else 's .
i loved it not just for the many comforts of life here .
i loved it for its decency , for its faith in the wisdom , justice and goodness of its people .
i loved it because it was not just a place , but an idea , a cause worth fighting for .
i was never the same again .
i was n't my own man anymore .
i was my country 's .
i 'm not running for president because i think i 'm blessed with such personal greatness that history has anointed me to save our country in its hour of need .
my country saved me .
my country saved me , and i can not forget it .
and i will fight for her for as long as i draw breath , so help me god .
greater cause if you find faults with our country , make it a better one .
if you 're disappointed with the mistakes of government , join its ranks and work to correct them .
enlist in our armed forces .
become a teacher .
enter the ministry .
run for public office .
feed a hungry child .
teach an illiterate adult to read .
comfort the afflicted .
defend the rights of the oppressed .
our country will be the better , and you will be the happier .
because nothing brings greater happiness in life than to serve a cause greater than yourself .
i 'm going to fight for my cause every day as your president .
i 'm going to fight to make sure every american has every reason to thank god , as i thank him : that i 'm an american , a proud citizen of the greatest country on earth , and with hard work , strong faith and a little courage , great things are always within our reach .
fight with me .
fight with me .
fight for what 's right for our country .
fight for the ideals and character of a free people .
fight for our children 's future .
fight for justice and opportunity for all .
stand up to defend our country from its enemies .
stand up for each other ; for beautiful , blessed , bountiful america .
stand up , stand up , stand up and fight .
nothing is inevitable here .
we 're americans , and we never give up .
we never quit .
we never hide from history .
we make history .
thank you , and god bless you .

advertisement john mccain 's speech to the republican convention senator john mccain has addressed the republican national convention in st paul , minnesota , promising " change is coming " as he accepted the party 's candidacy for the white house .
below is the full text of his speech , as prepared for delivery .
thank you all very much .
tonight , i have a privilege given few americans - the privilege of accepting our party 's nomination for president of the united states .
and i accept it with gratitude , humility and confidence .
in my life , no success has come without a good fight , and this nomination was n't any different .
that 's a tribute to the candidates who opposed me and their supporters .
they 're leaders of great ability , who love our country , and wished to lead it to better days .
their support is an honour i wo n't forget .
tag cloud this tag cloud displays words in proportion to their frequency the word count is based on the text as prepared for delivery family life i 'm grateful to the president for leading us in those dark days following the worst attack on american soil in our history , and keeping us safe from another attack many thought was inevitable - and to the first lady , laura bush , a model of grace and kindness in public and in private .
and i 'm grateful to the 41st president and his bride of 63 years , and for their outstanding example of honourable service to our country .
as always , i 'm indebted to my wife , cindy , and my seven children .
we 'll go at it over the next two months ... that 's the nature of these contests , and there are big differences between us the pleasures of family life can seem like a brief holiday from the crowded calendar of our nation 's business .
but i have treasured them all the more , and ca n't imagine a life without the happiness you give me .
cindy said a lot of nice things about me tonight .
but , in truth , she 's more my inspiration than i am hers .
her concern for those less blessed than we are - victims of land mines , children born in poverty and with birth defects - shows the measure of her humanity .
i know she will make a great first lady .
created equal when i was growing up , my father was often at sea , and the job of raising my brother , sister and me would fall to my mother alone .
roberta mccain gave us her love of life , her deep interest in the world , her strength , and her belief we are all meant to use our opportunities to make ourselves useful to our country .
i would n't be here tonight but for the strength of her character .
my heartfelt thanks to all of you , who helped me win this nomination , and stood by me when the odds were long .
i wo n't let you down .
to americans who have yet to decide who to vote for , thank you for your consideration and the opportunity to win your trust .
i intend to earn it .
finally , a word to senator obama and his supporters .
we 'll go at it over the next two months .
that 's the nature of these contests , and there are big differences between us .
but you have my respect and admiration .
despite our differences , much more unites us than divides us .
we are fellow americans , an association that means more to me than any other .
we 're dedicated to the proposition that all people are created equal and endowed by our creator with inalienable rights .
no country ever had a greater cause than that , and i would n't be an american worthy of the name if i did n't honour senator obama and his supporters for their achievement .
on your side but let there be no doubt , my friends , we 're going to win this election .
and after we 've won , we 're going to reach out our hand to any willing patriot , make this government start working for you again , and get this country back on the road to prosperity and peace .
these are tough times for many of you .
you 're worried about keeping your job or finding a new one , and are struggling to put food on the table and stay in your home .
i 'd rather lose an election than see my country lose a war all you ever asked of government is to stand on your side , not in your way .
and that 's just what i intend to do - stand on your side and fight for your future .
and i 've found just the right partner to help me shake up washington , governor sarah palin of alaska .
she has executive experience and a real record of accomplishment .
she 's tackled tough problems like energy independence and corruption .
she 's balanced a budget , cut taxes , and taken on the special interests .
she 's reached across the aisle and asked republicans , democrats and independents to serve in her administration .
she 's the mother of five children .
she 's helped run a small business , worked with her hands and knows what it 's like to worry about mortgage payments and health care and the cost of gasoline and groceries .
she knows where she comes from and she knows who she works for .
she stands up for what 's right , and she does n't let anyone tell her to sit down .
i 'm very proud to have introduced our next vice president to the country .
but i ca n't wait until i introduce her to washington .
and let me offer an advance warning to the old , big spending , do nothing , me first , country second washington crowd - change is coming .
maverick i 'm not in the habit of breaking promises to my country and neither is governor palin .
and when we tell you we 're going to change washington , and stop leaving our country 's problems for some unluckier generation to fix , you can count on it .
we lost the trust of the american people when some republicans gave in to the temptations of corruption we 've got a record of doing just that , and the strength , experience , judgment and backbone to keep our word to you .
you know , i 've been called a maverick - someone who marches to the beat of his own drum .
sometimes it 's meant as a compliment and sometimes it 's not .
what it really means is i understand who i work for .
i do n't work for a party .
i do n't work for a special interest .
i do n't work for myself .
i work for you .
i 've fought corruption , and it did n't matter if the culprits were democrats or republicans .
they violated their public trust , and had to be held accountable .
i 've fought big spenders in both parties , who waste your money on things you neither need nor want , while you struggle to buy groceries , fill your gas tank and make your mortgage payment .
i 've fought to get million dollar checks out of our elections .
i 've fought lobbyists who stole from indian tribes .
i fought crooked deals in the pentagon .
i fought tobacco companies and trial lawyers , drug companies and union bosses .
i fought for the right strategy and more troops in iraq , when it was n't a popular thing to do .
and when the pundits said my campaign was finished , i said i 'd rather lose an election than see my country lose a war .
lost trust thanks to the leadership of a brilliant general , david petraeus , and the brave men and women he has the honour to command , that strategy succeeded and rescued us from a defeat that would have demoralized our military , risked a wider war and threatened the security of all americans .
i do n't mind a good fight .
for reasons known only to god , i 've had quite a few tough ones in my life .
but i learned an important lesson along the way .
in the end , it matters less that you can fight .
what you fight for is the real test .
i fight for americans .
i fight for you .
i fight for bill and sue nebe from farmington hills , michigan , who lost their real estate investments in the bad housing market .
bill got a temporary job after he was out of work for seven months .
sue works three jobs to help pay the bills .
i fight for jake and toni wimmer of franklin county , pennsylvania .
jake works on a loading dock ; coaches little league , and raises money for the mentally and physically disabled .
toni is a schoolteacher , working toward her master 's degree .
they have two sons , the youngest , luke , has been diagnosed with autism .
my health care plan will make it easier for more americans to find and keep good health care insurance their lives should matter to the people they elect to office .
they matter to me .
i fight for the family of matthew stanley of wolfboro , new hampshire , who died serving our country in iraq .
i wear his bracelet and think of him every day .
i intend to honour their sacrifice by making sure the country their son loved so well and never returned to , remains safe from its enemies .
i fight to restore the pride and principles of our party .
we were elected to change washington , and we let washington change us .
we lost the trust of the american people when some republicans gave in to the temptations of corruption .
we lost their trust when rather than reform government , both parties made it bigger .
we lost their trust when instead of freeing ourselves from a dangerous dependence on foreign oil , both parties and senator obama passed another corporate welfare bill for oil companies .
we lost their trust , when we valued our power over our principles .
we 're going to change that .
we 're going to recover the people 's trust by standing up again for the values americans admire .
the party of lincoln , roosevelt and reagan is going to get back to basics .
tax cuts we believe everyone has something to contribute and deserves the opportunity to reach their god-given potential from the boy whose descendents arrived on the mayflower to the latina daughter of migrant workers .
we 're all god 's children and we 're all americans .
we believe in low taxes , spending discipline and open markets .
we believe in rewarding hard work and risk takers and letting people keep the fruits of their labour .
we believe in a strong defence , work , faith , service , a culture of life , personal responsibility , the rule of law , and judges who dispense justice impartially and do n't legislate from the bench .
we believe in the values of families , neighbourhoods and communities .
we believe in a government that unleashes the creativity and initiative of americans - government that does n't make your choices for you , but works to make sure you have more choices to make for yourself .
education is the civil rights issue of this century i will keep taxes low and cut them where i can .
my opponent will raise them .
i will open new markets to our goods and services .
my opponent will close them .
i will cut government spending .
he will increase it .
my tax cuts will create jobs .
his tax increases will eliminate them .
my health care plan will make it easier for more americans to find and keep good health care insurance .
his plan will force small businesses to cut jobs , reduce wages , and force families into a government run health care system where a bureaucrat stands between you and your doctor .
keeping taxes low helps small businesses grow and create new jobs .
cutting the second highest business tax rate in the world will help american companies compete and keep jobs from moving overseas .
doubling the child tax exemption from $ 3500 to $ 7000 will improve the lives of millions of american families .
reducing government spending and getting rid of failed programs will let you keep more of your own money to save , spend and invest as you see fit .
opening new markets and preparing workers to compete in the world economy is essential to our future prosperity .
education choice i know some of you have been left behind in the changing economy and it often seems your government has n't even noticed .
government assistance for unemployed workers was designed for the economy of the 1950s .
that 's going to change on my watch .
we are going to stop sending $ 700bn a year to countries that do n't like us very much my opponent promises to bring back old jobs by wishing away the global economy .
we 're going to help workers who 've lost a job that wo n't come back , find a new one that wo n't go away .
we will prepare them for the jobs of today .
we will use our community colleges to help train people for new opportunities in their communities .
for workers in industries that have been hard hit , we 'll help make up part of the difference in wages between their old job and a temporary , lower paid one while they receive retraining that will help them find secure new employment at a decent wage .
education is the civil rights issue of this century .
equal access to public education has been gained .
but what is the value of access to a failing school ?
we need to shake up failed school bureaucracies with competition , empower parents with choice , remove barriers to qualified instructors , attract and reward good teachers , and help bad teachers find another line of work .
when a public school fails to meet its obligations to students , parents deserve a choice in the education of their children .
and i intend to give it to them .
some may choose a better public school .
some may choose a private one .
many will choose a charter school .
but they will have that choice and their children will have that opportunity .
senator obama wants our schools to answer to unions and entrenched bureaucracies .
i want schools to answer to parents and students .
and when i 'm president , they will .
energy independence my fellow americans , when i 'm president , we 're going to embark on the most ambitious national project in decades .
we are going to stop sending $ 700bn a year to countries that do n't like us very much .
we will attack the problem on every front .
we will produce more energy at home .
we will drill new wells offshore , and we 'll drill them now .
we ca n't turn a blind eye to aggression and international lawlessness that threatens the peace and stability of the world we will build more nuclear power plants .
we will develop clean coal technology .
we will increase the use of wind , tide , solar and natural gas .
we will encourage the development and use of flex fuel , hybrid and electric automobiles .
senator obama thinks we can achieve energy independence without more drilling and without more nuclear power .
but americans know better than that .
we must use all resources and develop all technologies necessary to rescue our economy from the damage caused by rising oil prices and to restore the health of our planet .
it 's an ambitious plan , but americans are ambitious by nature , and we have faced greater challenges .
it 's time for us to show the world again how americans lead .
this great national cause will create millions of new jobs , many in industries that will be the engine of our future prosperity - jobs that will be there when your children enter the workforce .
dangerous world today , the prospect of a better world remains within our reach .
but we must see the threats to peace and liberty in our time clearly and face them , as americans before us did , with confidence , wisdom and resolve .
we have dealt a serious blow to al qaeda in recent years .
but they are not defeated , and they 'll strike us again if they can .
iran remains the chief state sponsor of terrorism and on the path to acquiring nuclear weapons .
i 'm running for president to keep the country i love safe russia 's leaders , rich with oil wealth and corrupt with power , have rejected democratic ideals and the obligations of a responsible power .
they invaded a small , democratic neighbour to gain more control over the world 's oil supply , intimidate other neighbours , and further their ambitions of reassembling the russian empire .

we face many threats in this dangerous world , but i 'm not afraid of them .
i 'm prepared for them .
i know how the military works , what it can do , what it can do better , and what it should not do .
i know how the world works .
i know the good and the evil in it .
i know how to work with leaders who share our dreams of a freer , safer and more prosperous world , and how to stand up to those who do n't .
i know how to secure the peace .

we need to change the way government does almost everything : from the way we protect our security to the way we compete in the world economy , from the way we respond to disasters to the way we fuel our transportation network , from the way we train our workers to the way we educate our children .

on an october morning , in the gulf of tonkin , i prepared for my 23rd mission over north vietnam .
i had n't any worry i would n't come back safe and sound .
i thought i was tougher than anyone .
i was pretty independent then , too .
i liked to bend a few rules , and pick a few fights for the fun of it .
but i did it for my own pleasure , my own pride .
i did n't think there was a cause more important than me .
then i found myself falling toward the middle of a small lake in the city of hanoi , with two broken arms , a broken leg , and an angry crowd waiting to greet me .
i was dumped in a dark cell , and left to die .
i did n't feel so tough anymore .
when they discovered my father was an admiral , they took me to a hospital .
they could n't set my bones properly , so they just slapped a cast on me .
when i did n't get better , and was down to about a hundred pounds , they put me in a cell with two other americans .

i thought about it , though .
i was n't in great shape , and i missed everything about america .

a lot of prisoners had it worse than i did .
i 'd been mistreated before , but not as badly as others .

advertisement john mccain 's speech to the republican convention senator john mccain has addressed the republican national convention in st paul , minnesota , promising " change is coming " as he accepted the party 's candidacy for the white house .
below is the full text of his speech , as prepared for delivery .
thank you all very much .
tonight , i have a privilege given few americans - the privilege of accepting our party 's nomination for president of the united states .
and i accept it with gratitude , humility and confidence .
in my life , no success has come without a good fight , and this nomination was n't any different .
that 's a tribute to the candidates who opposed me and their supporters .
they 're leaders of great ability , who love our country , and wished to lead it to better days .
their support is an honour i wo n't forget .
tag cloud this tag cloud displays words in proportion to their frequency the word count is based on the text as prepared for delivery family life i 'm grateful to the president for leading us in those dark days following the worst attack on american soil in our history , and keeping us safe from another attack many thought was inevitable - and to the first lady , laura bush , a model of grace and kindness in public and in private .
and i 'm grateful to the 41st president and his bride of 63 years , and for their outstanding example of honourable service to our country .
as always , i 'm indebted to my wife , cindy , and my seven children .
we 'll go at it over the next two months ... that 's the nature of these contests , and there are big differences between us the pleasures of family life can seem like a brief holiday from the crowded calendar of our nation 's business .
but i have treasured them all the more , and ca n't imagine a life without the happiness you give me .
cindy said a lot of nice things about me tonight .
but , in truth , she 's more my inspiration than i am hers .
her concern for those less blessed than we are - victims of land mines , children born in poverty and with birth defects - shows the measure of her humanity .
i know she will make a great first lady .
created equal when i was growing up , my father was often at sea , and the job of raising my brother , sister and me would fall to my mother alone .
roberta mccain gave us her love of life , her deep interest in the world , her strength , and her belief we are all meant to use our opportunities to make ourselves useful to our country .
i would n't be here tonight but for the strength of her character .
my heartfelt thanks to all of you , who helped me win this nomination , and stood by me when the odds were long .
i wo n't let you down .
to americans who have yet to decide who to vote for , thank you for your consideration and the opportunity to win your trust .
i intend to earn it .
finally , a word to senator obama and his supporters .
we 'll go at it over the next two months .
that 's the nature of these contests , and there are big differences between us .
but you have my respect and admiration .
despite our differences , much more unites us than divides us .
we are fellow americans , an association that means more to me than any other .
we 're dedicated to the proposition that all people are created equal and endowed by our creator with inalienable rights .
no country ever had a greater cause than that , and i would n't be an american worthy of the name if i did n't honour senator obama and his supporters for their achievement .
on your side but let there be no doubt , my friends , we 're going to win this election .
and after we 've won , we 're going to reach out our hand to any willing patriot , make this government start working for you again , and get this country back on the road to prosperity and peace .
these are tough times for many of you .
you 're worried about keeping your job or finding a new one , and are struggling to put food on the table and stay in your home .
i 'd rather lose an election than see my country lose a war all you ever asked of government is to stand on your side , not in your way .
and that 's just what i intend to do - stand on your side and fight for your future .
and i 've found just the right partner to help me shake up washington , governor sarah palin of alaska .
she has executive experience and a real record of accomplishment .
she 's tackled tough problems like energy independence and corruption .
she 's balanced a budget , cut taxes , and taken on the special interests .
she 's reached across the aisle and asked republicans , democrats and independents to serve in her administration .
she 's the mother of five children .
she 's helped run a small business , worked with her hands and knows what it 's like to worry about mortgage payments and health care and the cost of gasoline and groceries .
she knows where she comes from and she knows who she works for .
she stands up for what 's right , and she does n't let anyone tell her to sit down .
i 'm very proud to have introduced our next vice president to the country .
but i ca n't wait until i introduce her to washington .
and let me offer an advance warning to the old , big spending , do nothing , me first , country second washington crowd - change is coming .
maverick i 'm not in the habit of breaking promises to my country and neither is governor palin .
and when we tell you we 're going to change washington , and stop leaving our country 's problems for some unluckier generation to fix , you can count on it .
we lost the trust of the american people when some republicans gave in to the temptations of corruption we 've got a record of doing just that , and the strength , experience , judgment and backbone to keep our word to you .
you know , i 've been called a maverick - someone who marches to the beat of his own drum .
sometimes it 's meant as a compliment and sometimes it 's not .
what it really means is i understand who i work for .
i do n't work for a party .
i do n't work for a special interest .
i do n't work for myself .
i work for you .
i 've fought corruption , and it did n't matter if the culprits were democrats or republicans .
they violated their public trust , and had to be held accountable .
i 've fought big spenders in both parties , who waste your money on things you neither need nor want , while you struggle to buy groceries , fill your gas tank and make your mortgage payment .
i 've fought to get million dollar checks out of our elections .
i 've fought lobbyists who stole from indian tribes .
i fought crooked deals in the pentagon .
i fought tobacco companies and trial lawyers , drug companies and union bosses .
i fought for the right strategy and more troops in iraq , when it was n't a popular thing to do .
and when the pundits said my campaign was finished , i said i 'd rather lose an election than see my country lose a war .
lost trust thanks to the leadership of a brilliant general , david petraeus , and the brave men and women he has the honour to command , that strategy succeeded and rescued us from a defeat that would have demoralized our military , risked a wider war and threatened the security of all americans .
i do n't mind a good fight .
for reasons known only to god , i 've had quite a few tough ones in my life .
but i learned an important lesson along the way .
in the end , it matters less that you can fight .
what you fight for is the real test .
i fight for americans .
i fight for you .
i fight for bill and sue nebe from farmington hills , michigan , who lost their real estate investments in the bad housing market .
bill got a temporary job after he was out of work for seven months .
sue works three jobs to help pay the bills .
i fight for jake and toni wimmer of franklin county , pennsylvania .
jake works on a loading dock ; coaches little league , and raises money for the mentally and physically disabled .
toni is a schoolteacher , working toward her master 's degree .
they have two sons , the youngest , luke , has been diagnosed with autism .
my health care plan will make it easier for more americans to find and keep good health care insurance their lives should matter to the people they elect to office .
they matter to me .
i fight for the family of matthew stanley of wolfboro , new hampshire , who died serving our country in iraq .
i wear his bracelet and think of him every day .
i intend to honour their sacrifice by making sure the country their son loved so well and never returned to , remains safe from its enemies .
i fight to restore the pride and principles of our party .
we were elected to change washington , and we let washington change us .
we lost the trust of the american people when some republicans gave in to the temptations of corruption .
we lost their trust when rather than reform government , both parties made it bigger .
we lost their trust when instead of freeing ourselves from a dangerous dependence on foreign oil , both parties and senator obama passed another corporate welfare bill for oil companies .
we lost their trust , when we valued our power over our principles .
we 're going to change that .
we 're going to recover the people 's trust by standing up again for the values americans admire .
the party of lincoln , roosevelt and reagan is going to get back to basics .
tax cuts we believe everyone has something to contribute and deserves the opportunity to reach their god-given potential from the boy whose descendents arrived on the mayflower to the latina daughter of migrant workers .
we 're all god 's children and we 're all americans .
we believe in low taxes , spending discipline and open markets .
we believe in rewarding hard work and risk takers and letting people keep the fruits of their labour .
we believe in a strong defence , work , faith , service , a culture of life , personal responsibility , the rule of law , and judges who dispense justice impartially and do n't legislate from the bench .
we believe in the values of families , neighbourhoods and communities .
we believe in a government that unleashes the creativity and initiative of americans - government that does n't make your choices for you , but works to make sure you have more choices to make for yourself .
education is the civil rights issue of this century i will keep taxes low and cut them where i can .
my opponent will raise them .
i will open new markets to our goods and services .
my opponent will close them .
i will cut government spending .
he will increase it .
my tax cuts will create jobs .
his tax increases will eliminate them .
my health care plan will make it easier for more americans to find and keep good health care insurance .
his plan will force small businesses to cut jobs , reduce wages , and force families into a government run health care system where a bureaucrat stands between you and your doctor .
keeping taxes low helps small businesses grow and create new jobs .
cutting the second highest business tax rate in the world will help american companies compete and keep jobs from moving overseas .
doubling the child tax exemption from $ 3500 to $ 7000 will improve the lives of millions of american families .
reducing government spending and getting rid of failed programs will let you keep more of your own money to save , spend and invest as you see fit .
opening new markets and preparing workers to compete in the world economy is essential to our future prosperity .
education choice i know some of you have been left behind in the changing economy and it often seems your government has n't even noticed .
government assistance for unemployed workers was designed for the economy of the 1950s .
that 's going to change on my watch .
we are going to stop sending $ 700bn a year to countries that do n't like us very much my opponent promises to bring back old jobs by wishing away the global economy .
we 're going to help workers who 've lost a job that wo n't come back , find a new one that wo n't go away .
we will prepare them for the jobs of today .
we will use our community colleges to help train people for new opportunities in their communities .
for workers in industries that have been hard hit , we 'll help make up part of the difference in wages between their old job and a temporary , lower paid one while they receive retraining that will help them find secure new employment at a decent wage .
education is the civil rights issue of this century .
equal access to public education has been gained .
but what is the value of access to a failing school ?
we need to shake up failed school bureaucracies with competition , empower parents with choice , remove barriers to qualified instructors , attract and reward good teachers , and help bad teachers find another line of work .
when a public school fails to meet its obligations to students , parents deserve a choice in the education of their children .
and i intend to give it to them .
some may choose a better public school .
some may choose a private one .
many will choose a charter school .
but they will have that choice and their children will have that opportunity .
senator obama wants our schools to answer to unions and entrenched bureaucracies .
i want schools to answer to parents and students .
and when i 'm president , they will .
energy independence my fellow americans , when i 'm president , we 're going to embark on the most ambitious national project in decades .
we are going to stop sending $ 700bn a year to countries that do n't like us very much .
we will attack the problem on every front .
we will produce more energy at home .
we will drill new wells offshore , and we 'll drill them now .
we ca n't turn a blind eye to aggression and international lawlessness that threatens the peace and stability of the world we will build more nuclear power plants .
we will develop clean coal technology .
we will increase the use of wind , tide , solar and natural gas .
we will encourage the development and use of flex fuel , hybrid and electric automobiles .
senator obama thinks we can achieve energy independence without more drilling and without more nuclear power .
but americans know better than that .
we must use all resources and develop all technologies necessary to rescue our economy from the damage caused by rising oil prices and to restore the health of our planet .
it 's an ambitious plan , but americans are ambitious by nature , and we have faced greater challenges .
it 's time for us to show the world again how americans lead .
this great national cause will create millions of new jobs , many in industries that will be the engine of our future prosperity - jobs that will be there when your children enter the workforce .
dangerous world today , the prospect of a better world remains within our reach .
but we must see the threats to peace and liberty in our time clearly and face them , as americans before us did , with confidence , wisdom and resolve .
we have dealt a serious blow to al qaeda in recent years .
but they are not defeated , and they 'll strike us again if they can .
iran remains the chief state sponsor of terrorism and on the path to acquiring nuclear weapons .
i 'm running for president to keep the country i love safe russia 's leaders , rich with oil wealth and corrupt with power , have rejected democratic ideals and the obligations of a responsible power .
they invaded a small , democratic neighbour to gain more control over the world 's oil supply , intimidate other neighbours , and further their ambitions of reassembling the russian empire .
and the brave people of georgia need our solidarity and prayers .
as president i will work to establish good relations with russia so we need not fear a return of the cold war .
but we ca n't turn a blind eye to aggression and international lawlessness that threatens the peace and stability of the world and the security of the american people .
we face many threats in this dangerous world , but i 'm not afraid of them .
i 'm prepared for them .
i know how the military works , what it can do , what it can do better , and what it should not do .
i know how the world works .
i know the good and the evil in it .
i know how to work with leaders who share our dreams of a freer , safer and more prosperous world , and how to stand up to those who do n't .
i know how to secure the peace .
enduring peace when i was five years old , a car pulled up in front of our house .
a navy officer rolled down the window , and shouted at my father that the japanese had bombed pearl harbour .
i rarely saw my father again for four years .
my grandfather came home from that same war exhausted from the burdens he had borne , and died the next day .
in vietnam , where i formed the closest friendships of my life , some of those friends never came home with me .
i hate war .
it is terrible beyond imagination .
i 'm running for president to keep the country i love safe , and prevent other families from risking their loved ones in war as my family has .
i will draw on all my experience with the world and its leaders , and all the tools at our disposal - diplomatic , economic , military and the power of our ideals - to build the foundations for a stable and enduring peace .
i 've been an imperfect servant of my country for many years ... but i have been her servant first , last and always in america , we change things that need to be changed .
each generation makes its contribution to our greatness .
the work that is ours to do is plainly before us .
we do n't need to search for it .
we need to change the way government does almost everything : from the way we protect our security to the way we compete in the world economy , from the way we respond to disasters to the way we fuel our transportation network , from the way we train our workers to the way we educate our children .
all these functions of government were designed before the rise of the global economy , the information technology revolution and the end of the cold war .
we have to catch up to history , and we have to change the way we do business in washington .
the constant partisan rancour that stops us from solving these problems is n't a cause , it 's a symptom .
it 's what happens when people go to washington to work for themselves and not you .
again and again , i 've worked with members of both parties to fix problems that need to be fixed .
that 's how i will govern as president .
i will reach out my hand to anyone to help me get this country moving again .
i have that record and the scars to prove it .

i 've been an imperfect servant of my country for many years .

below is the full text of his speech , as prepared for delivery .
thank you all very much .
tonight , i have a privilege given few americans - the privilege of accepting our party 's nomination for president of the united states .
and i accept it with gratitude , humility and confidence .
in my life , no success has come without a good fight , and this nomination was n't any different .
that 's a tribute to the candidates who opposed me and their supporters .
they 're leaders of great ability , who love our country , and wished to lead it to better days .
their support is an honour i wo n't forget .
tag cloud this tag cloud displays words in proportion to their frequency the word count is based on the text as prepared for delivery family life i 'm grateful to the president for leading us in those dark days following the worst attack on american soil in our history , and keeping us safe from another attack many thought was inevitable - and to the first lady , laura bush , a model of grace and kindness in public and in private .
and i 'm grateful to the 41st president and his bride of 63 years , and for their outstanding example of honourable service to our country .
as always , i 'm indebted to my wife , cindy , and my seven children . "
we 'll go at it over the next two months ... that 's the nature of these contests , and there are big differences between us " the pleasures of family life can seem like a brief holiday from the crowded calendar of our nation 's business .
but i have treasured them all the more , and ca n't imagine a life without the happiness you give me .
cindy said a lot of nice things about me tonight .
but , in truth , she 's more my inspiration than i am hers .
her concern for those less blessed than we are - victims of land mines , children born in poverty and with birth defects - shows the measure of her humanity .
i know she will make a great first lady .
created equal when i was growing up , my father was often at sea , and the job of raising my brother , sister and me would fall to my mother alone .
roberta mccain gave us her love of life , her deep interest in the world , her strength , and her belief we are all meant to use our opportunities to make ourselves useful to our country .
i would n't be here tonight but for the strength of her character .
my heartfelt thanks to all of you , who helped me win this nomination , and stood by me when the odds were long .
i wo n't let you down .
to americans who have yet to decide who to vote for , thank you for your consideration and the opportunity to win your trust .
i intend to earn it .
finally , a word to senator obama and his supporters .
we 'll go at it over the next two months .
that 's the nature of these contests , and there are big differences between us .
but you have my respect and admiration .
despite our differences , much more unites us than divides us .
we are fellow americans , an association that means more to me than any other .
we 're dedicated to the proposition that all people are created equal and endowed by our creator with inalienable rights .
no country ever had a greater cause than that , and i would n't be an american worthy of the name if i did n't honour senator obama and his supporters for their achievement .
on your side but let there be no doubt , my friends , we 're going to win this election .
and after we 've won , we 're going to reach out our hand to any willing patriot , make this government start working for you again , and get this country back on the road to prosperity and peace .
these are tough times for many of you .
you 're worried about keeping your job or finding a new one , and are struggling to put food on the table and stay in your home . "
i 'd rather lose an election than see my country lose a war " all you ever asked of government is to stand on your side , not in your way .
and that 's just what i intend to do - stand on your side and fight for your future .
and i 've found just the right partner to help me shake up washington , governor sarah palin of alaska .
she has executive experience and a real record of accomplishment .
she 's tackled tough problems like energy independence and corruption .
she 's balanced a budget , cut taxes , and taken on the special interests .
she 's reached across the aisle and asked republicans , democrats and independents to serve in her administration .
she 's the mother of five children .
she 's helped run a small business , worked with her hands and knows what it 's like to worry about mortgage payments and health care and the cost of gasoline and groceries .
she knows where she comes from and she knows who she works for .
she stands up for what 's right , and she does n't let anyone tell her to sit down .
i 'm very proud to have introduced our next vice president to the country .
but i ca n't wait until i introduce her to washington .
and let me offer an advance warning to the old , big spending , do nothing , me first , country second washington crowd - change is coming .
maverick i 'm not in the habit of breaking promises to my country and neither is governor palin .
and when we tell you we 're going to change washington , and stop leaving our country 's problems for some unluckier generation to fix , you can count on it . "
we lost the trust of the american people when some republicans gave in to the temptations of corruption " we 've got a record of doing just that , and the strength , experience , judgment and backbone to keep our word to you .
you know , i 've been called a maverick - someone who marches to the beat of his own drum .
sometimes it 's meant as a compliment and sometimes it 's not .
what it really means is i understand who i work for .
i do n't work for a party .
i do n't work for a special interest .
i do n't work for myself .
i work for you .
i 've fought corruption , and it did n't matter if the culprits were democrats or republicans .
they violated their public trust , and had to be held accountable .
i 've fought big spenders in both parties , who waste your money on things you neither need nor want , while you struggle to buy groceries , fill your gas tank and make your mortgage payment .
i 've fought to get million dollar checks out of our elections .
i 've fought lobbyists who stole from indian tribes .
i fought crooked deals in the pentagon .
i fought tobacco companies and trial lawyers , drug companies and union bosses .
i fought for the right strategy and more troops in iraq , when it was n't a popular thing to do .
and when the pundits said my campaign was finished , i said i 'd rather lose an election than see my country lose a war .
lost trust thanks to the leadership of a brilliant general , david petraeus , and the brave men and women he has the honour to command , that strategy succeeded and rescued us from a defeat that would have demoralized our military , risked a wider war and threatened the security of all americans .
i do n't mind a good fight .
for reasons known only to god , i 've had quite a few tough ones in my life .
but i learned an important lesson along the way .
in the end , it matters less that you can fight .
what you fight for is the real test .
i fight for americans .
i fight for you .
i fight for bill and sue nebe from farmington hills , michigan , who lost their real estate investments in the bad housing market .
bill got a temporary job after he was out of work for seven months .
sue works three jobs to help pay the bills .
i fight for jake and toni wimmer of franklin county , pennsylvania .
jake works on a loading dock ; coaches little league , and raises money for the mentally and physically disabled .
toni is a schoolteacher , working toward her master 's degree .
they have two sons , the youngest , luke , has been diagnosed with autism . "
my health care plan will make it easier for more americans to find and keep good health care insurance " their lives should matter to the people they elect to office .
they matter to me .
i fight for the family of matthew stanley of wolfboro , new hampshire , who died serving our country in iraq .
i wear his bracelet and think of him every day .
i intend to honour their sacrifice by making sure the country their son loved so well and never returned to , remains safe from its enemies .
i fight to restore the pride and principles of our party .
we were elected to change washington , and we let washington change us .
we lost the trust of the american people when some republicans gave in to the temptations of corruption .
we lost their trust when rather than reform government , both parties made it bigger .
we lost their trust when instead of freeing ourselves from a dangerous dependence on foreign oil , both parties and senator obama passed another corporate welfare bill for oil companies .
we lost their trust , when we valued our power over our principles .
we 're going to change that .
we 're going to recover the people 's trust by standing up again for the values americans admire .
the party of lincoln , roosevelt and reagan is going to get back to basics .
tax cuts we believe everyone has something to contribute and deserves the opportunity to reach their god-given potential from the boy whose descendents arrived on the mayflower to the latina daughter of migrant workers .
we 're all god 's children and we 're all americans .
we believe in low taxes , spending discipline and open markets .
we believe in rewarding hard work and risk takers and letting people keep the fruits of their labour .
we believe in a strong defence , work , faith , service , a culture of life , personal responsibility , the rule of law , and judges who dispense justice impartially and do n't legislate from the bench .
we believe in the values of families , neighbourhoods and communities .
we believe in a government that unleashes the creativity and initiative of americans - government that does n't make your choices for you , but works to make sure you have more choices to make for yourself . "
education is the civil rights issue of this century " i will keep taxes low and cut them where i can .
my opponent will raise them .
i will open new markets to our goods and services .
my opponent will close them .
i will cut government spending .
he will increase it .
my tax cuts will create jobs .
his tax increases will eliminate them .
my health care plan will make it easier for more americans to find and keep good health care insurance .
his plan will force small businesses to cut jobs , reduce wages , and force families into a government run health care system where a bureaucrat stands between you and your doctor .
keeping taxes low helps small businesses grow and create new jobs .
cutting the second highest business tax rate in the world will help american companies compete and keep jobs from moving overseas .
doubling the child tax exemption from $ 3500 to $ 7000 will improve the lives of millions of american families .
reducing government spending and getting rid of failed programs will let you keep more of your own money to save , spend and invest as you see fit .
opening new markets and preparing workers to compete in the world economy is essential to our future prosperity .
education choice i know some of you have been left behind in the changing economy and it often seems your government has n't even noticed .
government assistance for unemployed workers was designed for the economy of the 1950s .
that 's going to change on my watch . "
we are going to stop sending $ 700bn a year to countries that do n't like us very much " my opponent promises to bring back old jobs by wishing away the global economy .
we 're going to help workers who 've lost a job that wo n't come back , find a new one that wo n't go away .
we will prepare them for the jobs of today .
we will use our community colleges to help train people for new opportunities in their communities .
for workers in industries that have been hard hit , we 'll help make up part of the difference in wages between their old job and a temporary , lower paid one while they receive retraining that will help them find secure new employment at a decent wage .
education is the civil rights issue of this century .
equal access to public education has been gained .
but what is the value of access to a failing school ?
we need to shake up failed school bureaucracies with competition , empower parents with choice , remove barriers to qualified instructors , attract and reward good teachers , and help bad teachers find another line of work .
when a public school fails to meet its obligations to students , parents deserve a choice in the education of their children .
and i intend to give it to them .
some may choose a better public school .
some may choose a private one .
many will choose a charter school .
but they will have that choice and their children will have that opportunity .
senator obama wants our schools to answer to unions and entrenched bureaucracies .
i want schools to answer to parents and students .
and when i 'm president , they will .
energy independence my fellow americans , when i 'm president , we 're going to embark on the most ambitious national project in decades .
we are going to stop sending $ 700bn a year to countries that do n't like us very much .
we will attack the problem on every front .
we will produce more energy at home .
we will drill new wells offshore , and we 'll drill them now . "
we ca n't turn a blind eye to aggression and international lawlessness that threatens the peace and stability of the world " we will build more nuclear power plants .
we will develop clean coal technology .
we will increase the use of wind , tide , solar and natural gas .
we will encourage the development and use of flex fuel , hybrid and electric automobiles .
senator obama thinks we can achieve energy independence without more drilling and without more nuclear power .
but americans know better than that .
we must use all resources and develop all technologies necessary to rescue our economy from the damage caused by rising oil prices and to restore the health of our planet .
it 's an ambitious plan , but americans are ambitious by nature , and we have faced greater challenges .
it 's time for us to show the world again how americans lead .
this great national cause will create millions of new jobs , many in industries that will be the engine of our future prosperity - jobs that will be there when your children enter the workforce .
dangerous world today , the prospect of a better world remains within our reach .
but we must see the threats to peace and liberty in our time clearly and face them , as americans before us did , with confidence , wisdom and resolve .
we have dealt a serious blow to al qaeda in recent years .
but they are not defeated , and they 'll strike us again if they can .
iran remains the chief state sponsor of terrorism and on the path to acquiring nuclear weapons . "
i 'm running for president to keep the country i love safe " russia 's leaders , rich with oil wealth and corrupt with power , have rejected democratic ideals and the obligations of a responsible power .
they invaded a small , democratic neighbour to gain more control over the world 's oil supply , intimidate other neighbours , and further their ambitions of reassembling the russian empire .
and the brave people of georgia need our solidarity and prayers .
as president i will work to establish good relations with russia so we need not fear a return of the cold war .
but we ca n't turn a blind eye to aggression and international lawlessness that threatens the peace and stability of the world and the security of the american people .
we face many threats in this dangerous world , but i 'm not afraid of them .
i 'm prepared for them .
i know how the military works , what it can do , what it can do better , and what it should not do .
i know how the world works .
i know the good and the evil in it .
i know how to work with leaders who share our dreams of a freer , safer and more prosperous world , and how to stand up to those who do n't .
i know how to secure the peace .
enduring peace when i was five years old , a car pulled up in front of our house .
a navy officer rolled down the window , and shouted at my father that the japanese had bombed pearl harbour .
i rarely saw my father again for four years .
my grandfather came home from that same war exhausted from the burdens he had borne , and died the next day .
in vietnam , where i formed the closest friendships of my life , some of those friends never came home with me .
i hate war .
it is terrible beyond imagination .
i 'm running for president to keep the country i love safe , and prevent other families from risking their loved ones in war as my family has .
i will draw on all my experience with the world and its leaders , and all the tools at our disposal - diplomatic , economic , military and the power of our ideals - to build the foundations for a stable and enduring peace . "
i 've been an imperfect servant of my country for many years ... but i have been her servant first , last and always " in america , we change things that need to be changed .
each generation makes its contribution to our greatness .
the work that is ours to do is plainly before us .
we do n't need to search for it .
we need to change the way government does almost everything : from the way we protect our security to the way we compete in the world economy , from the way we respond to disasters to the way we fuel our transportation network , from the way we train our workers to the way we educate our children .
all these functions of government were designed before the rise of the global economy , the information technology revolution and the end of the cold war .
we have to catch up to history , and we have to change the way we do business in washington .
the constant partisan rancour that stops us from solving these problems is n't a cause , it 's a symptom .
it 's what happens when people go to washington to work for themselves and not you .
again and again , i 've worked with members of both parties to fix problems that need to be fixed .
that 's how i will govern as president .
i will reach out my hand to anyone to help me get this country moving again .
i have that record and the scars to prove it .
senator obama does not .
company of heroes instead of rejecting good ideas because we did n't think of them first , let 's use the best ideas from both sides .
instead of fighting over who gets the credit , let 's try sharing it .
this amazing country can do anything we put our minds to .
i will ask democrats and independents to serve with me .
and my administration will set a new standard for transparency and accountability .
we 're going to finally start getting things done for the people who are counting on us , and i wo n't care who gets the credit .
i 've been an imperfect servant of my country for many years .
but i have been her servant first , last and always .
and i 've never lived a day , in good times or bad , that i did n't thank god for the privilege .
long ago , something unusual happened to me that taught me the most valuable lesson of my life .
i was blessed by misfortune . "
i always liked to strut a little after i 'd been roughed up to show the other guys i was tough enough to take it " i mean that sincerely .
i was blessed because i served in the company of heroes , and i witnessed a thousand acts of courage , compassion and love .
on an october morning , in the gulf of tonkin , i prepared for my 23rd mission over north vietnam .
i had n't any worry i would n't come back safe and sound .
i thought i was tougher than anyone .
i was pretty independent then , too .
i liked to bend a few rules , and pick a few fights for the fun of it .
but i did it for my own pleasure , my own pride .
i did n't think there was a cause more important than me .
then i found myself falling toward the middle of a small lake in the city of hanoi , with two broken arms , a broken leg , and an angry crowd waiting to greet me .
i was dumped in a dark cell , and left to die .
i did n't feel so tough anymore .
when they discovered my father was an admiral , they took me to a hospital .
they could n't set my bones properly , so they just slapped a cast on me .
when i did n't get better , and was down to about a hundred pounds , they put me in a cell with two other americans .
i could n't do anything .
i could n't even feed myself .
they did it for me .
i was beginning to learn the limits of my selfish independence .
those men saved my life .
my country saved me i was in solitary confinement when my captors offered to release me .
i knew why .
if i went home , they would use it as propaganda to demoralize my fellow prisoners .
our code said we could only go home in the order of our capture , and there were men who had been shot down before me .
i thought about it , though .
i was n't in great shape , and i missed everything about america .
but i turned it down .
a lot of prisoners had it worse than i did .
i 'd been mistreated before , but not as badly as others .
i always liked to strut a little after i 'd been roughed up to show the other guys i was tough enough to take it .
but after i turned down their offer , they worked me over harder than they ever had before .
for a long time .
and they broke me . "
nothing brings greater happiness in life than to serve a cause greater than yourself " when they brought me back to my cell , i was hurt and ashamed , and i did n't know how i could face my fellow prisoners .
the good man in the cell next door , my friend , bob craner , saved me .
through taps on a wall he told me i had fought as hard as i could .
no man can always stand alone .
and then he told me to get back up and fight again for our country and for the men i had the honour to serve with .
because every day they fought for me .
i fell in love with my country when i was a prisoner in someone else 's .
i loved it not just for the many comforts of life here .
i loved it for its decency , for its faith in the wisdom , justice and goodness of its people .
i loved it because it was not just a place , but an idea , a cause worth fighting for .
i was never the same again .
i was n't my own man anymore .
i was my country 's .
i 'm not running for president because i think i 'm blessed with such personal greatness that history has anointed me to save our country in its hour of need .
my country saved me .
my country saved me , and i can not forget it .
and i will fight for her for as long as i draw breath , so help me god .
greater cause if you find faults with our country , make it a better one .
if you 're disappointed with the mistakes of government , join its ranks and work to correct them .
enlist in our armed forces .
become a teacher .
enter the ministry .
run for public office .
feed a hungry child .
teach an illiterate adult to read .
comfort the afflicted .
defend the rights of the oppressed .
our country will be the better , and you will be the happier .
because nothing brings greater happiness in life than to serve a cause greater than yourself .
i 'm going to fight for my cause every day as your president .
i 'm going to fight to make sure every american has every reason to thank god , as i thank him : that i 'm an american , a proud citizen of the greatest country on earth , and with hard work , strong faith and a little courage , great things are always within our reach .
fight with me .
fight with me .
fight for what 's right for our country .
fight for the ideals and character of a free people .
fight for our children 's future .
fight for justice and opportunity for all .
stand up to defend our country from its enemies .
stand up for each other ; for beautiful , blessed , bountiful america .
stand up , stand up , stand up and fight .
nothing is inevitable here .
we 're americans , and we never give up .
we never quit .
we never hide from history .
we make history .
thank you , and god bless you .

he vowed to bring change to government , restore the people 's trust in the party and to fight for a better nation .
praising his running mate sarah palin , he said she was the right person to help him bring change to washington .
the arizona senator said he respected democratic rival barack obama and would seek a bipartisan approach to politics .
presenting himself once again as a maverick , he pledged to fight corruption , whether democratic or republican , and make sure that he worked for the good of the american people .
" let me offer an advance warning to the old , big spending , do nothing , me first , country second washington crowd : change is coming , " mr mccain told the crowds in st paul , minnesota . "
again and again , i 've worked with members of both parties to fix problems that need to be fixed " john mccain analysis : mccain weathers storms in pictures : convention - day four republican voters ' views us election polltracker in a criticism of his own party , he said he would " fight to restore the pride and principles " of the party , damaged after some republicans gave in to " the temptations of corruption " .
" we 're going to recover the people 's trust by standing up again for the values americans admire , " he said .
" the party of lincoln , roosevelt and reagan is going to get back to basics . "
mr mccain then turned to attacking the democrats over taxes and spending , saying they would seek to raise taxes whereas he would keep them low and cut them where possible .
going into some policy specifics , he pledged create new jobs , improve education and to reduce a " dangerous dependence on foreign oil " by producing more energy at home , including by drilling new offshore oil wells .
mr mccain promised to take a bipartisan approach to resolving the nation 's problems , saying : " again and again , i 've worked with members of both parties to fix problems that need to be fixed .
mccain 's most-used words full text of mccain speech us media mixed over speech " that 's how i will govern as president .
i will reach out my hand to anyone to help me get this country moving again .
" i have that record and the scars to prove it .
barack obama does not . "
after speaking of the five years he spent as a prisoner of war in vietnam and how that experience had inspired his love of his country , he called on his fellow americans to fight with him to make it a better one .
" stand up , stand up , stand up and fight .
nothing is inevitable here .
we 're americans and we never give up .
we never quit .
we never hide from history .
we make history . "
the almost hour-long speech , which ended in the traditional shower of confetti and red , white and blue balloons , brought to a close the party 's four-day event .
' tested and true ' the bbc 's adam brookes in st paul says mr mccain 's speech was measured and entirely lacking in the sarcasm and vitriol which have been levelled at mr obama over the past couple of nights .
he said he hated war and would use all america 's tools - diplomatic , military and economic - to build what he called a stable and enduring peace , as well as shaking up washington and including democrats and independents in a mccain administration .
it was all a rather different tone to the republican politics of the past eight years , and to many of the other speakers at this republican convention , our correspondent says .
there was very little of president george w bush in this speech , our correspondent adds , as mr mccain tries to show that he is his own man and can signify a break with the bush years .
mr mccain 's wife , cindy , in her speech praised her husband 's family values , strength of character , war service and leadership .
" if americans want straight talk and the plain truth , they should take a good close look at john mccain ... a man tested and true , who 's never wavered in his devotion to our country , " she said , after arriving on stage flanked by their seven children .
her speech followed the convention 's formal nomination of mrs palin - the republican party 's first female vice-presidential candidate .
mrs palin becomes only the second woman , the first being democrat geraldine ferraro in 1984 , to run for the us vice-presidency .
' integrity and courage ' speaking ahead of mr mccain 's address , senior republicans praised his courage and leadership . "
i have to say , from my vantage point next to the dc delegation , my overall impression was that the audience in the hall were disappointed " bbc north america editor justin webb read justin 's thoughts in full minnesota governor tim pawlenty , at one point hotly tipped to be mr mccain 's running mate choice , described the arizona senator 's life as " a testimony to service , duty , courage and common sense " .
" in this time , we do n't need a president who can just read a poll or momentarily thrill a crowd .
we do n't need rhetoric or empty promises , " he said .
" we need a president who has the integrity and courage to make the tough choices so america will be stronger and safer . "

advertisement john mccain asked delegates to ' fight for what is right for the country ' john mccain has accepted the republican party 's candidacy for the white house in a speech to cheering supporters at the party 's national convention .
he vowed to bring change to government , restore the people 's trust in the party and to fight for a better nation .
praising his running mate sarah palin , he said she was the right person to help him bring change to washington .
the arizona senator said he respected democratic rival barack obama and would seek a bipartisan approach to politics .
presenting himself once again as a maverick , he pledged to fight corruption , whether democratic or republican , and make sure that he worked for the good of the american people .
" let me offer an advance warning to the old , big spending , do nothing , me first , country second washington crowd : change is coming , " mr mccain told the crowds in st paul , minnesota .
again and again , i 've worked with members of both parties to fix problems that need to be fixed john mccain analysis : mccain weathers storms in pictures : convention - day four republican voters ' views us election polltracker in a criticism of his own party , he said he would " fight to restore the pride and principles " of the party , damaged after some republicans gave in to " the temptations of corruption " .
" we 're going to recover the people 's trust by standing up again for the values americans admire , " he said .
" the party of lincoln , roosevelt and reagan is going to get back to basics . "
mr mccain then turned to attacking the democrats over taxes and spending , saying they would seek to raise taxes whereas he would keep them low and cut them where possible .
going into some policy specifics , he pledged create new jobs , improve education and to reduce a " dangerous dependence on foreign oil " by producing more energy at home , including by drilling new offshore oil wells .

i will reach out my hand to anyone to help me get this country moving again .
" i have that record and the scars to prove it .
barack obama does not . "
after speaking of the five years he spent as a prisoner of war in vietnam and how that experience had inspired his love of his country , he called on his fellow americans to fight with him to make it a better one .
" stand up , stand up , stand up and fight .
nothing is inevitable here .
we 're americans and we never give up .
we never quit .
we never hide from history .
we make history . "
the almost hour-long speech , which ended in the traditional shower of confetti and red , white and blue balloons , brought to a close the party 's four-day event .
' tested and true ' the bbc 's adam brookes in st paul says mr mccain 's speech was measured and entirely lacking in the sarcasm and vitriol which have been levelled at mr obama over the past couple of nights .
he said he hated war and would use all america 's tools - diplomatic , military and economic - to build what he called a stable and enduring peace , as well as shaking up washington and including democrats and independents in a mccain administration .
mrs mccain praised her husband as a great father and devoted american it was all a rather different tone to the republican politics of the past eight years , and to many of the other speakers at this republican convention , our correspondent says .
there was very little of president george w bush in this speech , our correspondent adds , as mr mccain tries to show that he is his own man and can signify a break with the bush years .
mr mccain 's wife , cindy , in her speech praised her husband 's family values , strength of character , war service and leadership .
" if americans want straight talk and the plain truth , they should take a good close look at john mccain ... a man tested and true , who 's never wavered in his devotion to our country , " she said , after arriving on stage flanked by their seven children .
her speech followed the convention 's formal nomination of mrs palin - the republican party 's first female vice-presidential candidate .
mrs palin becomes only the second woman , the first being democrat geraldine ferraro in 1984 , to run for the us vice-presidency .
' integrity and courage ' speaking ahead of mr mccain 's address , senior republicans praised his courage and leadership .
i have to say , from my vantage point next to the dc delegation , my overall impression was that the audience in the hall were disappointed bbc north america editor justin webb read justin 's thoughts in full minnesota governor tim pawlenty , at one point hotly tipped to be mr mccain 's running mate choice , described the arizona senator 's life as " a testimony to service , duty , courage and common sense " .
" in this time , we do n't need a president who can just read a poll or momentarily thrill a crowd .
we do n't need rhetoric or empty promises , " he said .
" we need a president who has the integrity and courage to make the tough choices so america will be stronger and safer . "

the almost hour-long speech , which ended in the traditional shower of confetti and red , white and blue balloons , brought to a close the party 's four-day event .
' tested and true ' the bbc 's adam brookes in st paul says mr mccain 's speech was measured and entirely lacking in the sarcasm and vitriol which have been levelled at mr obama over the past couple of nights .
he said he hated war and would use all america 's tools - diplomatic , military and economic - to build what he called a stable and enduring peace , as well as shaking up washington and including democrats and independents in a mccain administration .
mrs mccain praised her husband as a great father and devoted american it was all a rather different tone to the republican politics of the past eight years , and to many of the other speakers at this republican convention , our correspondent says .

mr mccain 's wife , cindy , in her speech praised her husband 's family values , strength of character , war service and leadership .
" if americans want straight talk and the plain truth , they should take a good close look at john mccain ... a man tested and true , who 's never wavered in his devotion to our country , " she said , after arriving on stage flanked by their seven children .
her speech followed the convention 's formal nomination of mrs palin - the republican party 's first female vice-presidential candidate .
mrs palin becomes only the second woman , the first being democrat geraldine ferraro in 1984 , to run for the us vice-presidency .

day three : wednesday 3 september day two : tuesday 2 september day one : monday 1 september mike bayham : big mac brings it home 4 september : 2340 local time -lrb- 0440 gmt -rrb- so it was n't the stuff that made people weep , inspire epiphanies or intense feeling of euphoria leading to a change of underpants .
but mccain 's acceptance speech adequately did the job .
in his deferential way , mccain paid his respects to barack obama 's historic presidential run while also pointing out the differences between himself and his democratic opponent in policy and preparation for what is the world 's most important job .
here were the talking points : obama will raise your taxes , mccain will cut them .
obama will socialise health care ; mccain will seek a solution to protects quality while increasing access .
obama will grow the federal government ; mccain will cut it , vowing to take on democrats , special interests and his own party .
obama refuses to find a practical solution for bringing down the cost of energy in the short term ; mccain supports more drilling and the construction of new nuclear power plants .
obama is not prepared to effectively deal with hostile countries and his soft touch with their leaders will compromise american interests ; mccain will stand tough while doing everything possible to avoid war , something he said his experience in vietnam taught him to hate .
and he could n't help working in a bit of his trademark salty wit , taking a jab at the messianic aura that has propelled the obama campaign throughout the primaries and motivated 200,000 germans to ecstatically chant his name in front of berlin 's victory column .
the crowd received mccain 's message well , solidifying the republican base that had only grudgingly accepted his candidacy and charged them up for what will be a hard fought campaign against a candidate with a tremendous financial advantage -lrb- obama , unlike mccain , is refusing matching funds thus allowing him to spend in the general election without federal limits -rrb- .
mccain 's speech helped bring the party together , something obama is still struggling to accomplish with more than a few hillary voters still spurning the democratic nominee 's overtures .
the next great milestone in the campaign will be the first presidential debate later in september .
it is something mccain looks forward to and he proposed holding more than the traditional three , something obama , who is great at talking to friendly audiences but somewhat of a deer in headlights when fending against the on-site slings of opponents .
that time will be filled with generous salvos of paid campaign advertising as the democrats claw and fight to regain the advantage after a week dominated by hurricane gustav and the gop convention .
often on the campaign trail , mccain ticked off a list of failed arizona presidential candidates -lrb- barry goldwater , mo udall , bruce babbitt -rrb- and joked that arizona was the one state in the union where parents did n't tell their children they could grow up to be president .
with the polls starting to reflect the convention bounce the gop has been hoping for and counting on this entire year , mccain might have helped his cause of ending the 48th state 's losing streak in presidential elections .
max deveson : smitten delegates 4 september : 2300 local time -lrb- 0400 gmt -rrb- dodging balloons , as the epic sound of journey 's " do n't stop believin " ' echoes through a rapidly-emptying arena , i chat to the delegates .
" john was good , but sarah was better , " says greg smith of west virginia .
" sarah 's my number one , " says ladonna from georgia , clad entirely in denim with sparkly-rimmed glasses .
" i 'm gonna take a leave of absence from work and follow her on the campaign trail . "
jenniffer -lrb- no , that 's not a typo -rrb- and jessalyn from california rated john mccain 's speech just as highly as his running-mate 's , saying that the arizona senator " did n't have as much to prove as sarah palin .
he was quietly confident , while she was just confident . "
so - plenty of loyalty to their party 's nominee on display , but the delegates all seem genuinely smitten by sarah palin .
as the music stops , and all that remains is the sound of balloons bursting and cheerful chatter , i ca n't help thinking that this convention will be remembered not for john mccain 's acceptance speech but for the debut of a woman who - barring some massive scandal - will be on the national stage for many years to come .
mike bayham : convention street theatre 1900 local time -lrb- 0000 gmt -rrb- not all of the political action takes place within the very secure confines of the convention centre .
there are late-night parties , cocktail soirees and , of course , protests that at times take on the appearance of full-scale riots .
there have been reports that protestors have stepped up their haranguing of delegates beyond taunts , chants and shouts , in which some have been sprayed with bleach and one was injured when a brick was thrown at the vehicle she was riding in .
prior to going to the final night of the convention , i decided to sample some of the characters hanging around on the other side of the double-metal mesh barrier separating the delegates from the rabble-rousers .
one of the first groups i encountered was code pink , one of the most vocal and controversial groups against the war in iraq that is n't any happier with barack obama than they are with john mccain .
a dozen or so women gathered outside of the msnbc set-up , the base camp for the protesters , singing songs against the war and its advocates .
not all of the protests had as many people .
just down the block there was perhaps the loneliest protestor , an individual whom i had met in new hampshire back in 2004 .
he was advocating a draft of hillary clinton for the democratic nomination for president .
bob , a native of florida , said he is now supporting mccain and would have even done so had obama picked the new york senator as his running mate , claiming that the eloquent illinois politician would be bad for israel .
the long-time hillary advocate was not the only pro-mccain protestor on hand .
a group of egyptian coptic christians had gathered to protest the persecution of arab christians throughout the muslim world , singling out egypt in particular .
a group of ardent pro-life , anti-gay marriage advocates had assembled near the gates of the xcel center to demonstrate as well .
those interviewed were unanimous in their support of mccain , primarily for his selection of alaska governor sarah palin .
at all entrances to the convention centre were supporters of former presidential candidate and republican texas congressman ron paul .
as it is too late for the favourite of those opposed to the " new world order " and for a near total " hands-off " approach by the federal government , i asked why they were still quite literally carrying the flag .
the paulistas justified their activities by claiming that their support for paul represent their support for the issues he champions and though there is a strong libertarian streak in paul 's message , almost all of them said they would support constitutional party candidate chuck baldwin and not bob barr , the candidate of the libertarian party .
there was another protestor carrying a 9/11 conspiracy banner who claimed that the truth of the terrorist attack had not been totally exposed , alleging that the us government masterminded the attack .
after asking if he had received any harassment from the government for so publicly and vociferously promulgating his belief in a grandiose government conspiracy , he admitted he had not received any trouble .
max deveson : taking on the media 1730 local time -lrb- 2230 gmt -rrb- if you were watching the convention last night , you might have been fooled into thinking that the republicans are running against a new party called " the media " , rather than their traditional foes , the democrats .
rudy giuliani informed delegates that " the citizens of the united states get to decide our next president - not the media " .
later on , sarah palin said " if you 're not a member in good standing of the washington elite , then some in the media consider a candidate unqualified " .
and she had a " newsflash " for " all those reporters and commentators " , namely : " i 'm not going to washington to seek their good opinion - i 'm going to washington to serve the people of this country . "
as cnn political correspondent candy crowley told me last night , this tactic has a long pedigree .
the question is - will it work ?
will journalists be cowed by the accusations of bias and , literally , give the republicans and sarah palin a good press ?
if the rave reviews her speech received are anything to go by , then yes .
but there is plenty of grumbling within the press corps about the republicans ' attempts to close down journalistic inquiries about mrs palin , as this article from joe klein demonstrates .

and if and when mrs palin agrees to sit down to a one-on-one interview , she is likely to be asked some tough questions .
she will be asked why she now claims to have been an opponent of the famous " bridge to nowhere " when her previous support for it is a matter of public record .

mike 's intensity shows what makes party conventions the superbowl of politics .
our diarists mike bayham is a republican delegate from the state of louisiana .
he is chairman of the new orleans young republicans and has served on the louisiana republican state committee since 1996 .
he 's pledged to back john mccain for the party 's presidential nomination , though he personally supported mike huckabee in the primaries .
" i guess you could call me a reagan conservative , " he says .

the gop is known for being too stuffy - i think it needs to be a big tent . "
at the age of 34 , this is already mike 's fourth convention .
" on the floor of the convention , if you are a delegate , you are officially on the same par as congressmen , governors and wealthy power brokers .
among the people i have met at previous conventions are a future president -lrb- george w. bush in 1996 -rrb- , arnold schwarzenegger and rudy giuliani , " he says .
" i ca n't imagine any other country having a political event like this . "

but mccain 's acceptance speech adequately did the job .
in his deferential way , mccain paid his respects to barack obama 's historic presidential run while also pointing out the differences between himself and his democratic opponent in policy and preparation for what is the world 's most important job .
here were the talking points : obama will raise your taxes , mccain will cut them .
obama will socialise health care ; mccain will seek a solution to protects quality while increasing access .
obama will grow the federal government ; mccain will cut it , vowing to take on democrats , special interests and his own party .
obama refuses to find a practical solution for bringing down the cost of energy in the short term ; mccain supports more drilling and the construction of new nuclear power plants .
obama is not prepared to effectively deal with hostile countries and his soft touch with their leaders will compromise american interests ; mccain will stand tough while doing everything possible to avoid war , something he said his experience in vietnam taught him to hate .
and he could n't help working in a bit of his trademark salty wit , taking a jab at the messianic aura that has propelled the obama campaign throughout the primaries and motivated 200,000 germans to ecstatically chant his name in front of berlin 's victory column .
the crowd received mccain 's message well , solidifying the republican base that had only grudgingly accepted his candidacy and charged them up for what will be a hard fought campaign against a candidate with a tremendous financial advantage -lrb- obama , unlike mccain , is refusing matching funds thus allowing him to spend in the general election without federal limits -rrb- .
mccain 's speech helped bring the party together , something obama is still struggling to accomplish with more than a few hillary voters still spurning the democratic nominee 's overtures .
the next great milestone in the campaign will be the first presidential debate later in september .
it is something mccain looks forward to and he proposed holding more than the traditional three , something obama , who is great at talking to friendly audiences but somewhat of a deer in headlights when fending against the on-site slings of opponents .
that time will be filled with generous salvos of paid campaign advertising as the democrats claw and fight to regain the advantage after a week dominated by hurricane gustav and the gop convention .
often on the campaign trail , mccain ticked off a list of failed arizona presidential candidates -lrb- barry goldwater , mo udall , bruce babbitt -rrb- and joked that arizona was the one state in the union where parents did n't tell their children they could grow up to be president .
with the polls starting to reflect the convention bounce the gop has been hoping for and counting on this entire year , mccain might have helped his cause of ending the 48th state 's losing streak in presidential elections .
max deveson : smitten delegates 4 september : 2300 local time -lrb- 0400 gmt -rrb- dodging balloons , as the epic sound of journey 's " do n't stop believin " ' echoes through a rapidly-emptying arena , i chat to the delegates .
" john was good , but sarah was better , " says greg smith of west virginia .
" sarah 's my number one , " says ladonna from georgia , clad entirely in denim with sparkly-rimmed glasses .
" i 'm gonna take a leave of absence from work and follow her on the campaign trail . "
jenniffer -lrb- no , that 's not a typo -rrb- and jessalyn from california rated john mccain 's speech just as highly as his running-mate 's , saying that the arizona senator " did n't have as much to prove as sarah palin .
he was quietly confident , while she was just confident . "
so - plenty of loyalty to their party 's nominee on display , but the delegates all seem genuinely smitten by sarah palin .
as the music stops , and all that remains is the sound of balloons bursting and cheerful chatter , i ca n't help thinking that this convention will be remembered not for john mccain 's acceptance speech but for the debut of a woman who - barring some massive scandal - will be on the national stage for many years to come .
mike bayham : convention street theatre 1900 local time -lrb- 0000 gmt -rrb- not all of the political action takes place within the very secure confines of the convention centre .
there are late-night parties , cocktail soirees and , of course , protests that at times take on the appearance of full-scale riots .
there have been reports that protestors have stepped up their haranguing of delegates beyond taunts , chants and shouts , in which some have been sprayed with bleach and one was injured when a brick was thrown at the vehicle she was riding in .
prior to going to the final night of the convention , i decided to sample some of the characters hanging around on the other side of the double-metal mesh barrier separating the delegates from the rabble-rousers .
one of the first groups i encountered was code pink , one of the most vocal and controversial groups against the war in iraq that is n't any happier with barack obama than they are with john mccain .
a dozen or so women gathered outside of the msnbc set-up , the base camp for the protesters , singing songs against the war and its advocates .
not all of the protests had as many people .
just down the block there was perhaps the loneliest protestor , an individual whom i had met in new hampshire back in 2004 .
he was advocating a draft of hillary clinton for the democratic nomination for president .
bob , a native of florida , said he is now supporting mccain and would have even done so had obama picked the new york senator as his running mate , claiming that the eloquent illinois politician would be bad for israel .
the long-time hillary advocate was not the only pro-mccain protestor on hand .
a group of egyptian coptic christians had gathered to protest the persecution of arab christians throughout the muslim world , singling out egypt in particular .
a group of ardent pro-life , anti-gay marriage advocates had assembled near the gates of the xcel center to demonstrate as well .
those interviewed were unanimous in their support of mccain , primarily for his selection of alaska governor sarah palin .
at all entrances to the convention centre were supporters of former presidential candidate and republican texas congressman ron paul .
as it is too late for the favourite of those opposed to the " new world order " and for a near total " hands-off " approach by the federal government , i asked why they were still quite literally carrying the flag .
the paulistas justified their activities by claiming that their support for paul represent their support for the issues he champions and though there is a strong libertarian streak in paul 's message , almost all of them said they would support constitutional party candidate chuck baldwin and not bob barr , the candidate of the libertarian party .
there was another protestor carrying a 9/11 conspiracy banner who claimed that the truth of the terrorist attack had not been totally exposed , alleging that the us government masterminded the attack .
after asking if he had received any harassment from the government for so publicly and vociferously promulgating his belief in a grandiose government conspiracy , he admitted he had not received any trouble .
max deveson : taking on the media 1730 local time -lrb- 2230 gmt -rrb- if you were watching the convention last night , you might have been fooled into thinking that the republicans are running against a new party called " the media " , rather than their traditional foes , the democrats .
rudy giuliani informed delegates that " the citizens of the united states get to decide our next president - not the media " .
later on , sarah palin said " if you 're not a member in good standing of the washington elite , then some in the media consider a candidate unqualified " .
and she had a " newsflash " for " all those reporters and commentators " , namely : " i 'm not going to washington to seek their good opinion - i 'm going to washington to serve the people of this country . "
as cnn political correspondent candy crowley told me last night , this tactic has a long pedigree .
the question is - will it work ?
will journalists be cowed by the accusations of bias and , literally , give the republicans and sarah palin a good press ?
if the rave reviews her speech received are anything to go by , then yes .
but there is plenty of grumbling within the press corps about the republicans ' attempts to close down journalistic inquiries about mrs palin , as this article from joe klein demonstrates .
many news organisations are sending reporters up to alaska to nose into her background .

though there is no shortage of media on the floor of the convention hall and it 's likely that every credentialed delegate has been interviewed at least twice by journalists foreign and domestic , the networks seem almost to have contempt for the national conventions .

now it 's the court jesters of sit-com and sports that are king , with news shows an annoying distraction to networks that are now subsidiaries of light bulb manufacturers , elevator constructors and theme-park operators .
conventions are quadrennial ratings losers for the networks , whose piece of the television pie has been decreased by the expansion of designer cable channels and satellite television .
networks that once carried gavel-to-gavel coverage of both parties ' conventions now allot it one prime-time hour per night ... and grudgingly at that .
they complain that the conventions lack spontaneity and are nothing more than well-choreographed political rallies and infomercials .

day three : wednesday 3 september day two : tuesday 2 september day one : monday 1 september mike bayham : big mac brings it home 4 september : 2340 local time -lrb- 0440 gmt -rrb- so it was n't the stuff that made people weep , inspire epiphanies or intense feeling of euphoria leading to a change of underpants .
but mccain 's acceptance speech adequately did the job .
in his deferential way , mccain paid his respects to barack obama 's historic presidential run while also pointing out the differences between himself and his democratic opponent in policy and preparation for what is the world 's most important job .
here were the talking points : obama will raise your taxes , mccain will cut them .
obama will socialise health care ; mccain will seek a solution to protects quality while increasing access .
obama will grow the federal government ; mccain will cut it , vowing to take on democrats , special interests and his own party .
obama refuses to find a practical solution for bringing down the cost of energy in the short term ; mccain supports more drilling and the construction of new nuclear power plants .
obama is not prepared to effectively deal with hostile countries and his soft touch with their leaders will compromise american interests ; mccain will stand tough while doing everything possible to avoid war , something he said his experience in vietnam taught him to hate .
and he could n't help working in a bit of his trademark salty wit , taking a jab at the messianic aura that has propelled the obama campaign throughout the primaries and motivated 200,000 germans to ecstatically chant his name in front of berlin 's victory column .
the crowd received mccain 's message well , solidifying the republican base that had only grudgingly accepted his candidacy and charged them up for what will be a hard fought campaign against a candidate with a tremendous financial advantage -lrb- obama , unlike mccain , is refusing matching funds thus allowing him to spend in the general election without federal limits -rrb- .
mccain 's speech helped bring the party together , something obama is still struggling to accomplish with more than a few hillary voters still spurning the democratic nominee 's overtures .
the next great milestone in the campaign will be the first presidential debate later in september .
it is something mccain looks forward to and he proposed holding more than the traditional three , something obama , who is great at talking to friendly audiences but somewhat of a deer in headlights when fending against the on-site slings of opponents .
that time will be filled with generous salvos of paid campaign advertising as the democrats claw and fight to regain the advantage after a week dominated by hurricane gustav and the gop convention .
often on the campaign trail , mccain ticked off a list of failed arizona presidential candidates -lrb- barry goldwater , mo udall , bruce babbitt -rrb- and joked that arizona was the one state in the union where parents did n't tell their children they could grow up to be president .
with the polls starting to reflect the convention bounce the gop has been hoping for and counting on this entire year , mccain might have helped his cause of ending the 48th state 's losing streak in presidential elections .
max deveson : smitten delegates 4 september : 2300 local time -lrb- 0400 gmt -rrb- dodging balloons , as the epic sound of journey 's " do n't stop believin " ' echoes through a rapidly-emptying arena , i chat to the delegates .
" john was good , but sarah was better , " says greg smith of west virginia .
" sarah 's my number one , " says ladonna from georgia , clad entirely in denim with sparkly-rimmed glasses .
" i 'm gonna take a leave of absence from work and follow her on the campaign trail . "
jenniffer -lrb- no , that 's not a typo -rrb- and jessalyn from california rated john mccain 's speech just as highly as his running-mate 's , saying that the arizona senator " did n't have as much to prove as sarah palin .
he was quietly confident , while she was just confident . "
so - plenty of loyalty to their party 's nominee on display , but the delegates all seem genuinely smitten by sarah palin .
as the music stops , and all that remains is the sound of balloons bursting and cheerful chatter , i ca n't help thinking that this convention will be remembered not for john mccain 's acceptance speech but for the debut of a woman who - barring some massive scandal - will be on the national stage for many years to come .
mike bayham : convention street theatre 1900 local time -lrb- 0000 gmt -rrb- not all of the political action takes place within the very secure confines of the convention centre .
there are late-night parties , cocktail soirees and , of course , protests that at times take on the appearance of full-scale riots .
there have been reports that protestors have stepped up their haranguing of delegates beyond taunts , chants and shouts , in which some have been sprayed with bleach and one was injured when a brick was thrown at the vehicle she was riding in .
prior to going to the final night of the convention , i decided to sample some of the characters hanging around on the other side of the double-metal mesh barrier separating the delegates from the rabble-rousers .
one of the first groups i encountered was code pink , one of the most vocal and controversial groups against the war in iraq that is n't any happier with barack obama than they are with john mccain .
a dozen or so women gathered outside of the msnbc set-up , the base camp for the protesters , singing songs against the war and its advocates .
not all of the protests had as many people .
just down the block there was perhaps the loneliest protestor , an individual whom i had met in new hampshire back in 2004 .
he was advocating a draft of hillary clinton for the democratic nomination for president .
bob , a native of florida , said he is now supporting mccain and would have even done so had obama picked the new york senator as his running mate , claiming that the eloquent illinois politician would be bad for israel .
the long-time hillary advocate was not the only pro-mccain protestor on hand .
a group of egyptian coptic christians had gathered to protest the persecution of arab christians throughout the muslim world , singling out egypt in particular .
a group of ardent pro-life , anti-gay marriage advocates had assembled near the gates of the xcel center to demonstrate as well .
those interviewed were unanimous in their support of mccain , primarily for his selection of alaska governor sarah palin .
at all entrances to the convention centre were supporters of former presidential candidate and republican texas congressman ron paul .
as it is too late for the favourite of those opposed to the " new world order " and for a near total " hands-off " approach by the federal government , i asked why they were still quite literally carrying the flag .
the paulistas justified their activities by claiming that their support for paul represent their support for the issues he champions and though there is a strong libertarian streak in paul 's message , almost all of them said they would support constitutional party candidate chuck baldwin and not bob barr , the candidate of the libertarian party .
there was another protestor carrying a 9/11 conspiracy banner who claimed that the truth of the terrorist attack had not been totally exposed , alleging that the us government masterminded the attack .
after asking if he had received any harassment from the government for so publicly and vociferously promulgating his belief in a grandiose government conspiracy , he admitted he had not received any trouble .
max deveson : taking on the media 1730 local time -lrb- 2230 gmt -rrb- if you were watching the convention last night , you might have been fooled into thinking that the republicans are running against a new party called " the media " , rather than their traditional foes , the democrats .
rudy giuliani informed delegates that " the citizens of the united states get to decide our next president - not the media " .
later on , sarah palin said " if you 're not a member in good standing of the washington elite , then some in the media consider a candidate unqualified " .
and she had a " newsflash " for " all those reporters and commentators " , namely : " i 'm not going to washington to seek their good opinion - i 'm going to washington to serve the people of this country . "
as cnn political correspondent candy crowley told me last night , this tactic has a long pedigree .
the question is - will it work ?
will journalists be cowed by the accusations of bias and , literally , give the republicans and sarah palin a good press ?
if the rave reviews her speech received are anything to go by , then yes .
but there is plenty of grumbling within the press corps about the republicans ' attempts to close down journalistic inquiries about mrs palin , as this article from joe klein demonstrates .
many news organisations are sending reporters up to alaska to nose into her background .
and if and when mrs palin agrees to sit down to a one-on-one interview , she is likely to be asked some tough questions .
she will be asked why she now claims to have been an opponent of the famous " bridge to nowhere " when her previous support for it is a matter of public record .
and she will no doubt be pressed on her involvement in the firing of alaska 's public safety commissioner , a man who had refused to sack her sister 's ex-husband when requested to do so by mrs palin 's staff .
attacking the media might be a win-win political gambit for the republicans .
if it improves their coverage , great ; if the negative attention continues , then the attacks can simply be portrayed as more evidence of media bias .
but if the media are goaded into digging up information about sarah palin that damages her reputation irreparably , then the tactic will have backfired .
mike bayham : ready for some ...
football ? 1300 local time -lrb- 1800 gmt -rrb- tonight the stadium will be packed with tens of thousands of screaming and energized partisans .
prior to the big event , there will be tribute videos and performances by major music acts .
millions tune in at home .
too bad for the just officially nominated republican presidential candidate , the aforementioned is a reference to kick-off of nfl football in east rutherford , new jersey , as the defending super bowl champions the new york giants take on their hated rivals , the washington redskins .
why would the national football league and nbc take on the speech of john mccain 's life and an important contribution in the national discourse about what will be one of the most historic elections in american politics ?
money .
though there is no shortage of media on the floor of the convention hall and it 's likely that every credentialed delegate has been interviewed at least twice by journalists foreign and domestic , the networks seem almost to have contempt for the national conventions .
there used to be a time in america where news programmes were the anchors of networks .
now it 's the court jesters of sit-com and sports that are king , with news shows an annoying distraction to networks that are now subsidiaries of light bulb manufacturers , elevator constructors and theme-park operators .
conventions are quadrennial ratings losers for the networks , whose piece of the television pie has been decreased by the expansion of designer cable channels and satellite television .
networks that once carried gavel-to-gavel coverage of both parties ' conventions now allot it one prime-time hour per night ... and grudgingly at that .
they complain that the conventions lack spontaneity and are nothing more than well-choreographed political rallies and infomercials .
perhaps .
but they also provide the public extensive arguments and reasons why they should support their candidate and not the opposition .
with full convention coverage exiled to the cable domain of c-span , foxnews , cnn and msnbc , there 's now an indirect cover charge to watch the conventions .
oh , i guess one could watch public broadcasting , assuming the signal is strong enough .
barack obama set an audience record last thursday when he accepted his acceptance speech .
with nbc providing circuses in lieu of politics tonight , mr mccain will have pulled off his latest upset if he can squeak out a viewership upset against the giants ' star quarterback eli manning .

many news organisations are sending reporters up to alaska to nose into her background .

she will be asked why she now claims to have been an opponent of the famous " bridge to nowhere " when her previous support for it is a matter of public record .
and she will no doubt be pressed on her involvement in the firing of alaska 's public safety commissioner , a man who had refused to sack her sister 's ex-husband when requested to do so by mrs palin 's staff .
attacking the media might be a win-win political gambit for the republicans .
if it improves their coverage , great ; if the negative attention continues , then the attacks can simply be portrayed as more evidence of media bias .

day three : wednesday 3 september day two : tuesday 2 september day one : monday 1 september mike bayham : big mac brings it home 4 september : 2340 local time -lrb- 0440 gmt -rrb- so it was n't the stuff that made people weep , inspire epiphanies or intense feeling of euphoria leading to a change of underpants .
but mccain 's acceptance speech adequately did the job .
in his deferential way , mccain paid his respects to barack obama 's historic presidential run while also pointing out the differences between himself and his democratic opponent in policy and preparation for what is the world 's most important job .
here were the talking points : obama will raise your taxes , mccain will cut them .
obama will socialise health care ; mccain will seek a solution to protects quality while increasing access .
obama will grow the federal government ; mccain will cut it , vowing to take on democrats , special interests and his own party .
obama refuses to find a practical solution for bringing down the cost of energy in the short term ; mccain supports more drilling and the construction of new nuclear power plants .
obama is not prepared to effectively deal with hostile countries and his soft touch with their leaders will compromise american interests ; mccain will stand tough while doing everything possible to avoid war , something he said his experience in vietnam taught him to hate .
and he could n't help working in a bit of his trademark salty wit , taking a jab at the messianic aura that has propelled the obama campaign throughout the primaries and motivated 200,000 germans to ecstatically chant his name in front of berlin 's victory column .
the crowd received mccain 's message well , solidifying the republican base that had only grudgingly accepted his candidacy and charged them up for what will be a hard fought campaign against a candidate with a tremendous financial advantage -lrb- obama , unlike mccain , is refusing matching funds thus allowing him to spend in the general election without federal limits -rrb- .
mccain 's speech helped bring the party together , something obama is still struggling to accomplish with more than a few hillary voters still spurning the democratic nominee 's overtures .
the next great milestone in the campaign will be the first presidential debate later in september .
it is something mccain looks forward to and he proposed holding more than the traditional three , something obama , who is great at talking to friendly audiences but somewhat of a deer in headlights when fending against the on-site slings of opponents .
that time will be filled with generous salvos of paid campaign advertising as the democrats claw and fight to regain the advantage after a week dominated by hurricane gustav and the gop convention .
often on the campaign trail , mccain ticked off a list of failed arizona presidential candidates -lrb- barry goldwater , mo udall , bruce babbitt -rrb- and joked that arizona was the one state in the union where parents did n't tell their children they could grow up to be president .
with the polls starting to reflect the convention bounce the gop has been hoping for and counting on this entire year , mccain might have helped his cause of ending the 48th state 's losing streak in presidential elections .
max deveson : smitten delegates 4 september : 2300 local time -lrb- 0400 gmt -rrb- dodging balloons , as the epic sound of journey 's " do n't stop believin " ' echoes through a rapidly-emptying arena , i chat to the delegates .
" john was good , but sarah was better , " says greg smith of west virginia .
" sarah 's my number one , " says ladonna from georgia , clad entirely in denim with sparkly-rimmed glasses .
" i 'm gonna take a leave of absence from work and follow her on the campaign trail . "
jenniffer -lrb- no , that 's not a typo -rrb- and jessalyn from california rated john mccain 's speech just as highly as his running-mate 's , saying that the arizona senator " did n't have as much to prove as sarah palin .
he was quietly confident , while she was just confident . "
so - plenty of loyalty to their party 's nominee on display , but the delegates all seem genuinely smitten by sarah palin .
as the music stops , and all that remains is the sound of balloons bursting and cheerful chatter , i ca n't help thinking that this convention will be remembered not for john mccain 's acceptance speech but for the debut of a woman who - barring some massive scandal - will be on the national stage for many years to come .
mike bayham : convention street theatre 1900 local time -lrb- 0000 gmt -rrb- not all of the political action takes place within the very secure confines of the convention centre .
there are late-night parties , cocktail soirees and , of course , protests that at times take on the appearance of full-scale riots .
there have been reports that protestors have stepped up their haranguing of delegates beyond taunts , chants and shouts , in which some have been sprayed with bleach and one was injured when a brick was thrown at the vehicle she was riding in .
prior to going to the final night of the convention , i decided to sample some of the characters hanging around on the other side of the double-metal mesh barrier separating the delegates from the rabble-rousers .
one of the first groups i encountered was code pink , one of the most vocal and controversial groups against the war in iraq that is n't any happier with barack obama than they are with john mccain .
a dozen or so women gathered outside of the msnbc set-up , the base camp for the protesters , singing songs against the war and its advocates .
not all of the protests had as many people .
just down the block there was perhaps the loneliest protestor , an individual whom i had met in new hampshire back in 2004 .
he was advocating a draft of hillary clinton for the democratic nomination for president .
bob , a native of florida , said he is now supporting mccain and would have even done so had obama picked the new york senator as his running mate , claiming that the eloquent illinois politician would be bad for israel .
the long-time hillary advocate was not the only pro-mccain protestor on hand .
a group of egyptian coptic christians had gathered to protest the persecution of arab christians throughout the muslim world , singling out egypt in particular .
a group of ardent pro-life , anti-gay marriage advocates had assembled near the gates of the xcel center to demonstrate as well .
those interviewed were unanimous in their support of mccain , primarily for his selection of alaska governor sarah palin .
at all entrances to the convention centre were supporters of former presidential candidate and republican texas congressman ron paul .
as it is too late for the favourite of those opposed to the " new world order " and for a near total " hands-off " approach by the federal government , i asked why they were still quite literally carrying the flag .
the paulistas justified their activities by claiming that their support for paul represent their support for the issues he champions and though there is a strong libertarian streak in paul 's message , almost all of them said they would support constitutional party candidate chuck baldwin and not bob barr , the candidate of the libertarian party .
there was another protestor carrying a 9/11 conspiracy banner who claimed that the truth of the terrorist attack had not been totally exposed , alleging that the us government masterminded the attack .
after asking if he had received any harassment from the government for so publicly and vociferously promulgating his belief in a grandiose government conspiracy , he admitted he had not received any trouble .
max deveson : taking on the media 1730 local time -lrb- 2230 gmt -rrb- if you were watching the convention last night , you might have been fooled into thinking that the republicans are running against a new party called " the media " , rather than their traditional foes , the democrats .
rudy giuliani informed delegates that " the citizens of the united states get to decide our next president - not the media " .
later on , sarah palin said " if you 're not a member in good standing of the washington elite , then some in the media consider a candidate unqualified " .
and she had a " newsflash " for " all those reporters and commentators " , namely : " i 'm not going to washington to seek their good opinion - i 'm going to washington to serve the people of this country . "
as cnn political correspondent candy crowley told me last night , this tactic has a long pedigree .
the question is - will it work ?
will journalists be cowed by the accusations of bias and , literally , give the republicans and sarah palin a good press ?
if the rave reviews her speech received are anything to go by , then yes .
but there is plenty of grumbling within the press corps about the republicans ' attempts to close down journalistic inquiries about mrs palin , as this article from joe klein demonstrates .
many news organisations are sending reporters up to alaska to nose into her background .
and if and when mrs palin agrees to sit down to a one-on-one interview , she is likely to be asked some tough questions .
she will be asked why she now claims to have been an opponent of the famous " bridge to nowhere " when her previous support for it is a matter of public record .
and she will no doubt be pressed on her involvement in the firing of alaska 's public safety commissioner , a man who had refused to sack her sister 's ex-husband when requested to do so by mrs palin 's staff .
attacking the media might be a win-win political gambit for the republicans .
if it improves their coverage , great ; if the negative attention continues , then the attacks can simply be portrayed as more evidence of media bias .
but if the media are goaded into digging up information about sarah palin that damages her reputation irreparably , then the tactic will have backfired .

there used to be a time in america where news programmes were the anchors of networks .
now it 's the court jesters of sit-com and sports that are king , with news shows an annoying distraction to networks that are now subsidiaries of light bulb manufacturers , elevator constructors and theme-park operators .
conventions are quadrennial ratings losers for the networks , whose piece of the television pie has been decreased by the expansion of designer cable channels and satellite television .
networks that once carried gavel-to-gavel coverage of both parties ' conventions now allot it one prime-time hour per night ... and grudgingly at that .
they complain that the conventions lack spontaneity and are nothing more than well-choreographed political rallies and infomercials .
perhaps .

the paulistas justified their activities by claiming that their support for paul represent their support for the issues he champions and though there is a strong libertarian streak in paul 's message , almost all of them said they would support constitutional party candidate chuck baldwin and not bob barr , the candidate of the libertarian party .
there was another protestor carrying a 9/11 conspiracy banner who claimed that the truth of the terrorist attack had not been totally exposed , alleging that the us government masterminded the attack .
after asking if he had received any harassment from the government for so publicly and vociferously promulgating his belief in a grandiose government conspiracy , he admitted he had not received any trouble .
max deveson : taking on the media 1730 local time -lrb- 2230 gmt -rrb- if you were watching the convention last night , you might have been fooled into thinking that the republicans are running against a new party called " the media " , rather than their traditional foes , the democrats .
rudy giuliani informed delegates that " the citizens of the united states get to decide our next president - not the media " .
later on , sarah palin said " if you 're not a member in good standing of the washington elite , then some in the media consider a candidate unqualified " .
and she had a " newsflash " for " all those reporters and commentators " , namely : " i 'm not going to washington to seek their good opinion - i 'm going to washington to serve the people of this country . "
as cnn political correspondent candy crowley told me last night , this tactic has a long pedigree .
the question is - will it work ?
will journalists be cowed by the accusations of bias and , literally , give the republicans and sarah palin a good press ?
if the rave reviews her speech received are anything to go by , then yes .
but there is plenty of grumbling within the press corps about the republicans ' attempts to close down journalistic inquiries about mrs palin , as this article from joe klein demonstrates .
many news organisations are sending reporters up to alaska to nose into her background .
and if and when mrs palin agrees to sit down to a one-on-one interview , she is likely to be asked some tough questions .
she will be asked why she now claims to have been an opponent of the famous " bridge to nowhere " when her previous support for it is a matter of public record .
and she will no doubt be pressed on her involvement in the firing of alaska 's public safety commissioner , a man who had refused to sack her sister 's ex-husband when requested to do so by mrs palin 's staff .
attacking the media might be a win-win political gambit for the republicans .
if it improves their coverage , great ; if the negative attention continues , then the attacks can simply be portrayed as more evidence of media bias .
but if the media are goaded into digging up information about sarah palin that damages her reputation irreparably , then the tactic will have backfired .

day three : wednesday 3 september day two : tuesday 2 september day one : monday 1 september mike bayham : big mac brings it home 4 september : 2340 local time -lrb- 0440 gmt -rrb- so it was n't the stuff that made people weep , inspire epiphanies or intense feeling of euphoria leading to a change of underpants .
but mccain 's acceptance speech adequately did the job .
in his deferential way , mccain paid his respects to barack obama 's historic presidential run while also pointing out the differences between himself and his democratic opponent in policy and preparation for what is the world 's most important job .
here were the talking points : obama will raise your taxes , mccain will cut them .
obama will socialise health care ; mccain will seek a solution to protects quality while increasing access .
obama will grow the federal government ; mccain will cut it , vowing to take on democrats , special interests and his own party .
obama refuses to find a practical solution for bringing down the cost of energy in the short term ; mccain supports more drilling and the construction of new nuclear power plants .
obama is not prepared to effectively deal with hostile countries and his soft touch with their leaders will compromise american interests ; mccain will stand tough while doing everything possible to avoid war , something he said his experience in vietnam taught him to hate .
and he could n't help working in a bit of his trademark salty wit , taking a jab at the messianic aura that has propelled the obama campaign throughout the primaries and motivated 200,000 germans to ecstatically chant his name in front of berlin 's victory column .
the crowd received mccain 's message well , solidifying the republican base that had only grudgingly accepted his candidacy and charged them up for what will be a hard fought campaign against a candidate with a tremendous financial advantage -lrb- obama , unlike mccain , is refusing matching funds thus allowing him to spend in the general election without federal limits -rrb- .
mccain 's speech helped bring the party together , something obama is still struggling to accomplish with more than a few hillary voters still spurning the democratic nominee 's overtures .
the next great milestone in the campaign will be the first presidential debate later in september .
it is something mccain looks forward to and he proposed holding more than the traditional three , something obama , who is great at talking to friendly audiences but somewhat of a deer in headlights when fending against the on-site slings of opponents .
that time will be filled with generous salvos of paid campaign advertising as the democrats claw and fight to regain the advantage after a week dominated by hurricane gustav and the gop convention .
often on the campaign trail , mccain ticked off a list of failed arizona presidential candidates -lrb- barry goldwater , mo udall , bruce babbitt -rrb- and joked that arizona was the one state in the union where parents did n't tell their children they could grow up to be president .
with the polls starting to reflect the convention bounce the gop has been hoping for and counting on this entire year , mccain might have helped his cause of ending the 48th state 's losing streak in presidential elections .
max deveson : smitten delegates 4 september : 2300 local time -lrb- 0400 gmt -rrb- dodging balloons , as the epic sound of journey 's " do n't stop believin " ' echoes through a rapidly-emptying arena , i chat to the delegates .
" john was good , but sarah was better , " says greg smith of west virginia .
" sarah 's my number one , " says ladonna from georgia , clad entirely in denim with sparkly-rimmed glasses .
" i 'm gonna take a leave of absence from work and follow her on the campaign trail . "
jenniffer -lrb- no , that 's not a typo -rrb- and jessalyn from california rated john mccain 's speech just as highly as his running-mate 's , saying that the arizona senator " did n't have as much to prove as sarah palin .
he was quietly confident , while she was just confident . "
so - plenty of loyalty to their party 's nominee on display , but the delegates all seem genuinely smitten by sarah palin .
as the music stops , and all that remains is the sound of balloons bursting and cheerful chatter , i ca n't help thinking that this convention will be remembered not for john mccain 's acceptance speech but for the debut of a woman who - barring some massive scandal - will be on the national stage for many years to come .
mike bayham : convention street theatre 1900 local time -lrb- 0000 gmt -rrb- not all of the political action takes place within the very secure confines of the convention centre .
there are late-night parties , cocktail soirees and , of course , protests that at times take on the appearance of full-scale riots .
there have been reports that protestors have stepped up their haranguing of delegates beyond taunts , chants and shouts , in which some have been sprayed with bleach and one was injured when a brick was thrown at the vehicle she was riding in .
prior to going to the final night of the convention , i decided to sample some of the characters hanging around on the other side of the double-metal mesh barrier separating the delegates from the rabble-rousers .
one of the first groups i encountered was code pink , one of the most vocal and controversial groups against the war in iraq that is n't any happier with barack obama than they are with john mccain .
a dozen or so women gathered outside of the msnbc set-up , the base camp for the protesters , singing songs against the war and its advocates .
not all of the protests had as many people .
just down the block there was perhaps the loneliest protestor , an individual whom i had met in new hampshire back in 2004 .
he was advocating a draft of hillary clinton for the democratic nomination for president .
bob , a native of florida , said he is now supporting mccain and would have even done so had obama picked the new york senator as his running mate , claiming that the eloquent illinois politician would be bad for israel .
the long-time hillary advocate was not the only pro-mccain protestor on hand .
a group of egyptian coptic christians had gathered to protest the persecution of arab christians throughout the muslim world , singling out egypt in particular .
a group of ardent pro-life , anti-gay marriage advocates had assembled near the gates of the xcel center to demonstrate as well .
those interviewed were unanimous in their support of mccain , primarily for his selection of alaska governor sarah palin .
at all entrances to the convention centre were supporters of former presidential candidate and republican texas congressman ron paul .
as it is too late for the favourite of those opposed to the " new world order " and for a near total " hands-off " approach by the federal government , i asked why they were still quite literally carrying the flag .
the paulistas justified their activities by claiming that their support for paul represent their support for the issues he champions and though there is a strong libertarian streak in paul 's message , almost all of them said they would support constitutional party candidate chuck baldwin and not bob barr , the candidate of the libertarian party .
there was another protestor carrying a 9/11 conspiracy banner who claimed that the truth of the terrorist attack had not been totally exposed , alleging that the us government masterminded the attack .
after asking if he had received any harassment from the government for so publicly and vociferously promulgating his belief in a grandiose government conspiracy , he admitted he had not received any trouble .
max deveson : taking on the media 1730 local time -lrb- 2230 gmt -rrb- if you were watching the convention last night , you might have been fooled into thinking that the republicans are running against a new party called " the media " , rather than their traditional foes , the democrats .

and she had a " newsflash " for " all those reporters and commentators " , namely : " i 'm not going to washington to seek their good opinion - i 'm going to washington to serve the people of this country . "
as cnn political correspondent candy crowley told me last night , this tactic has a long pedigree .
the question is - will it work ?
will journalists be cowed by the accusations of bias and , literally , give the republicans and sarah palin a good press ?
if the rave reviews her speech received are anything to go by , then yes .
but there is plenty of grumbling within the press corps about the republicans ' attempts to close down journalistic inquiries about mrs palin , as this article from joe klein demonstrates .

if it improves their coverage , great ; if the negative attention continues , then the attacks can simply be portrayed as more evidence of media bias .

advertisement haiti flooded after hanna haiti faces a " catastrophe " after being hit by a series of storms in recent weeks , president rene preval has said .
three storms in less than 21 days have killed more than 200 people , haitian officials say .
a un official says 600,000 people may need help because of flooding caused by tropical storm hanna , which has caused the deaths of 136 people .
mr preval warned that hanna could prove even more deadly than hurricane jeanne , which killed more than 3,000 in 2004 .
hanna swirled over haiti for four days , dumping massive amounts of rain , blowing down fruit trees and swamping tin-roofed houses .
massive need the port city of gonaives bore the brunt of the storm , with thousands of people seeking shelter on rooftops and balconies .
a team from the american red cross flew over gonaives enlarge image " there is no food , no water , no clothes , " arnaud dumas , a pastor at a gonaives church , told the associated press .
" i want to know what i 'm supposed to do .
we have n't found anything to eat in two , three days .
nothing at all . "
the un co-ordinator for humanitarian aid in haiti , joel boutroue told the bbc : " we 're already facing a lot of difficulty trying to respond .
" in gonaives alone we have some 70,000 people in shelters , and around 250,000 around gonaives city need our assistance and that of the government , and throughout the country i would say around up to 600,000 people might require our assistance . "
an ap reporter in the city said safe drinking water was in very short supply , and fetid carcasses of drowned farm animals were strewn in soupy floodwaters .
help was arriving in the area , with un troops picking people from rooftops and spain announcing that a planeload of aid was being flown in from panama .
but floodwaters were frustrating efforts to distribute food , the un said .
the british red cross announced it was launching an appeal , saying the needs of haiti were " massive " .
red cross workers were also helping residents of the turks and caicos islands , north of haiti , rebuild after hanna ripped through there on monday .
" our volunteers have been supporting the shelters here with food and shelter management , transporting people to hospital , and handing out tarpaulins to help keep roofs on , " said the organisation 's clive evans , on the islands .
" there are abandoned cars everywhere , overturned boats , uprooted trees , downed power lines and flooded roads . "
us prepares for storm earlier , mr preval said he would hold emergency talks with donor countries to appeal for aid .
gonaives was battered with winds of 100km / h -lrb- 65mph -rrb- , leaving people on rooftops screaming for help as floods reached depths of 2m -lrb- 6.5ft -rrb- .
in pictures : haiti floods eyewitness : haiti 's ordeals warming boosts strongest storms at 0300 gmt on friday , hanna was about 250km -lrb- 155 miles -rrb- east of the florida coastline and moving north-west , the us national hurricane center -lrb- nhc -rrb- said .
there are fears it could become a hurricane by the time it hits land along the us coast on saturday , but the storm 's uncertain path means officials are holding off ordering an evacuation .
however , a hurricane watch is in place in north and south carolina .
some residents of those states have already moved boats and booked inland hotel rooms .
separately , storm ike has strengthened rapidly into an extremely powerful category four hurricane in the open atlantic , the nhc says .
however , it says it is too early to determine if ike poses any threat to land .

advertisement haiti flooded after hanna haiti faces a " catastrophe " after being hit by a series of storms in recent weeks , president rene preval has said .
three storms in less than 21 days have killed more than 200 people , haitian officials say .
a un official says 600,000 people may need help because of flooding caused by tropical storm hanna , which has caused the deaths of 136 people .
mr preval warned that hanna could prove even more deadly than hurricane jeanne , which killed more than 3,000 in 2004 .
hanna swirled over haiti for four days , dumping massive amounts of rain , blowing down fruit trees and swamping tin-roofed houses .
massive need the port city of gonaives bore the brunt of the storm , with thousands of people seeking shelter on rooftops and balconies .
a team from the american red cross flew over gonaives enlarge image " there is no food , no water , no clothes , " arnaud dumas , a pastor at a gonaives church , told the associated press .
" i want to know what i 'm supposed to do .
we have n't found anything to eat in two , three days .
nothing at all . "
the un co-ordinator for humanitarian aid in haiti , joel boutroue told the bbc : " we 're already facing a lot of difficulty trying to respond .
" in gonaives alone we have some 70,000 people in shelters , and around 250,000 around gonaives city need our assistance and that of the government , and throughout the country i would say around up to 600,000 people might require our assistance . "
an ap reporter in the city said safe drinking water was in very short supply , and fetid carcasses of drowned farm animals were strewn in soupy floodwaters .
help was arriving in the area , with un troops picking people from rooftops and spain announcing that a planeload of aid was being flown in from panama .
but floodwaters were frustrating efforts to distribute food , the un said .
the british red cross announced it was launching an appeal , saying the needs of haiti were " massive " .
red cross workers were also helping residents of the turks and caicos islands , north of haiti , rebuild after hanna ripped through there on monday .
" our volunteers have been supporting the shelters here with food and shelter management , transporting people to hospital , and handing out tarpaulins to help keep roofs on , " said the organisation 's clive evans , on the islands .
" there are abandoned cars everywhere , overturned boats , uprooted trees , downed power lines and flooded roads . "
us prepares for storm earlier , mr preval said he would hold emergency talks with donor countries to appeal for aid .
gonaives was battered with winds of 100km / h -lrb- 65mph -rrb- , leaving people on rooftops screaming for help as floods reached depths of 2m -lrb- 6.5ft -rrb- .
in pictures : haiti floods eyewitness : haiti 's ordeals warming boosts strongest storms at 0300 gmt on friday , hanna was about 250km -lrb- 155 miles -rrb- east of the florida coastline and moving north-west , the us national hurricane center -lrb- nhc -rrb- said .
there are fears it could become a hurricane by the time it hits land along the us coast on saturday , but the storm 's uncertain path means officials are holding off ordering an evacuation .
however , a hurricane watch is in place in north and south carolina .
some residents of those states have already moved boats and booked inland hotel rooms .
separately , storm ike has strengthened rapidly into an extremely powerful category four hurricane in the open atlantic , the nhc says .
however , it says it is too early to determine if ike poses any threat to land .

his speech - in which he pledges to bring change to washington and tells how his experience as a vietnam prisoner of war inspired his love of country - brings to an end the republican national convention in st paul .
his wife cindy , senator lindsey graham and governor tim pawlenty all praise his courage , integrity and character .
key quotes " let me offer an advance warning to the old , big spending , do nothing , me first , country second crowd : change is coming . "
john mccain , giving his acceptance speech for the republican party 's white house candidacy john mccain 's loyalties have always been to his country and to our men and women in uniform .
not a political party senator lindsey graham day at a glance : 3 september day at a glance : 2 september day at a glance : 1 september " john has picked a reform-minded , hockey-momming , basketball shooting , moose hunting , salmon-fishing , pistol-packing , mother-of-five for vice president . "
cindy mccain , praising her husband 's choice of running mate " calling for more troops to be sent to iraq was one of the most unpopular things john mccain could have done .
some said it was political suicide .
but you know what ?
it was the right thing to do . "
senator lindsey graham praises mr mccain for his stance on the iraq war " tonight , john mccain said that his party was elected to change washington , but that they let washington change them . he 's right . he admonished the ' old , do-nothing crowd ' in washington , but ignored the fact that he 's been part of that crowd for 26 years , opposing solutions on health care , energy and education . "
bill burton , obama campaign spokesman , responds to mr mccain 's speech " the notion that any questions about her work in alaska is somehow not relevant to her potentially being vice president of the united states does n't make too much sense to me ...
i assume that she wants to be treated the same way that guys want to be treated , which means that their records are under scrutiny .
i 've been through this for 19 months , she 's been through it , what , four days so far . "

the first , hurricane gustav , delayed the start of proceedings , but did not cause the chaos that many had feared .
the second storm was over senator john mccain 's choice of running mate , alaska governor sarah palin .
the impact of this would be much harder to predict .
the questions started last friday , but only reached a crescendo this week .
who was mrs palin ?
how and why was she chosen ?
what qualified her to be his running mate and where exactly was wasilla , alaska ?
the smiling family - trig , track , bristol , piper and willow - turned out to be not quite so perfect .
' scented blood ' mrs palin 's 17-year-old unmarried daughter bristol was pregnant .
had the mccain campaign done its homework , or was this a rather desperate shot in the dark ?
the media found out sarah palin 's teenage daughter was pregnant some in the media pack scented blood .
the hunt was on when mrs palin appeared to go to ground for the first few days of the convention .
it all seemed to be heading for disaster .
yet mrs palin turned out to be the darling of the convention .
maybe in part because of the media 's attacks .
but mostly because of that speech that fired up the party faithful .
she used her humble origins , humour and a stiletto heel to turn the attack on the media and the democrats .
' sudden stardom ' rarely has such a political unknown shot to such sudden stardom - 37 million americans watched her speech .
just a few million fewer than had watched barack obama in denver .
the reality is that there are still questions about mrs palin .
sarah palin became an instant star at the convention and there will be greater tests ahead .
but she has re-energised the republican base and rallied support around mr mccain .
it is worth remembering that many conservatives still had strong reservations about the vietnam veteran before mrs palin was chosen .
st paul , minnesota , may have been their road to damascus .
but john mccain still had plenty to prove .
' no mcsame ' first he needed to distance himself from an unpopular president bush and to blunt the democratic party attacks that a mccain administration would be more of the mcsame .
the fact that mr bush did not appear in person at the convention probably helped .
as did the focus on mrs palin .
mr mccain 's biggest theme was regaining the american people 's trust mr mccain also had to reach out beyond the republican base .
the attacks on his rival , delivered by his surrogates , were effective .
but there had been precious little detail in terms of policy .
how would a mccain administration differ from eight years of bush ?
in the end mr mccain 's speech ticked most of the boxes , without setting the world alight .
he has never been the most inspirational of speakers - and it was always going to be hard to compete with the oratory of barack obama .
but he filled in some of the details on economic policy .
his biggest theme : to regain the trust of the american people .
in truth the speech did not contain any real surprises .
but then mr mccain - the self-proclaimed maverick - had already done that in the selection of his running mate .
a move that has already shaken up this race .

the first , hurricane gustav , delayed the start of proceedings , but did not cause the chaos that many had feared .
the second storm was over senator john mccain 's choice of running mate , alaska governor sarah palin .
the impact of this would be much harder to predict .
the questions started last friday , but only reached a crescendo this week .
who was mrs palin ?
how and why was she chosen ?
what qualified her to be his running mate and where exactly was wasilla , alaska ?
the smiling family - trig , track , bristol , piper and willow - turned out to be not quite so perfect .
' scented blood ' mrs palin 's 17-year-old unmarried daughter bristol was pregnant .
had the mccain campaign done its homework , or was this a rather desperate shot in the dark ?
the media found out sarah palin 's teenage daughter was pregnant some in the media pack scented blood .
the hunt was on when mrs palin appeared to go to ground for the first few days of the convention .
it all seemed to be heading for disaster .
yet mrs palin turned out to be the darling of the convention .
maybe in part because of the media 's attacks .
but mostly because of that speech that fired up the party faithful .
she used her humble origins , humour and a stiletto heel to turn the attack on the media and the democrats .
' sudden stardom ' rarely has such a political unknown shot to such sudden stardom - 37 million americans watched her speech .
just a few million fewer than had watched barack obama in denver .
the reality is that there are still questions about mrs palin .
sarah palin became an instant star at the convention and there will be greater tests ahead .
but she has re-energised the republican base and rallied support around mr mccain .
it is worth remembering that many conservatives still had strong reservations about the vietnam veteran before mrs palin was chosen .
st paul , minnesota , may have been their road to damascus .
but john mccain still had plenty to prove .
' no mcsame ' first he needed to distance himself from an unpopular president bush and to blunt the democratic party attacks that a mccain administration would be more of the mcsame .
the fact that mr bush did not appear in person at the convention probably helped .
as did the focus on mrs palin .
mr mccain 's biggest theme was regaining the american people 's trust mr mccain also had to reach out beyond the republican base .
the attacks on his rival , delivered by his surrogates , were effective .
but there had been precious little detail in terms of policy .
how would a mccain administration differ from eight years of bush ?
in the end mr mccain 's speech ticked most of the boxes , without setting the world alight .
he has never been the most inspirational of speakers - and it was always going to be hard to compete with the oratory of barack obama .
but he filled in some of the details on economic policy .
his biggest theme : to regain the trust of the american people .
in truth the speech did not contain any real surprises .
but then mr mccain - the self-proclaimed maverick - had already done that in the selection of his running mate .
a move that has already shaken up this race .

the first , hurricane gustav , delayed the start of proceedings , but did not cause the chaos that many had feared .
the second storm was over senator john mccain 's choice of running mate , alaska governor sarah palin .
the impact of this would be much harder to predict .
the questions started last friday , but only reached a crescendo this week .
who was mrs palin ?
how and why was she chosen ?
what qualified her to be his running mate and where exactly was wasilla , alaska ?
the smiling family - trig , track , bristol , piper and willow - turned out to be not quite so perfect .
' scented blood ' mrs palin 's 17-year-old unmarried daughter bristol was pregnant .
had the mccain campaign done its homework , or was this a rather desperate shot in the dark ?
some in the media pack scented blood .
the hunt was on when mrs palin appeared to go to ground for the first few days of the convention .
it all seemed to be heading for disaster .
yet mrs palin turned out to be the darling of the convention .
maybe in part because of the media 's attacks .
but mostly because of that speech that fired up the party faithful .
she used her humble origins , humour and a stiletto heel to turn the attack on the media and the democrats .
' sudden stardom ' rarely has such a political unknown shot to such sudden stardom - 37 million americans watched her speech .
just a few million fewer than had watched barack obama in denver .
the reality is that there are still questions about mrs palin .
and there will be greater tests ahead .
but she has re-energised the republican base and rallied support around mr mccain .
it is worth remembering that many conservatives still had strong reservations about the vietnam veteran before mrs palin was chosen .
st paul , minnesota , may have been their road to damascus .
but john mccain still had plenty to prove .
' no mcsame ' first he needed to distance himself from an unpopular president bush and to blunt the democratic party attacks that a mccain administration would be more of the mcsame .
the fact that mr bush did not appear in person at the convention probably helped .
as did the focus on mrs palin .
mr mccain also had to reach out beyond the republican base .
the attacks on his rival , delivered by his surrogates , were effective .
but there had been precious little detail in terms of policy .
how would a mccain administration differ from eight years of bush ?
in the end mr mccain 's speech ticked most of the boxes , without setting the world alight .
he has never been the most inspirational of speakers - and it was always going to be hard to compete with the oratory of barack obama .
but he filled in some of the details on economic policy .
his biggest theme : to regain the trust of the american people .
in truth the speech did not contain any real surprises .
but then mr mccain - the self-proclaimed maverick - had already done that in the selection of his running mate .
a move that has already shaken up this race .

rhondda cynon taf and merthyr tydfil councils say the planned facility would " greatly reduce " the amount of waste that is dumped at landfill sites .
they say the project could be part of the bryn pica landfill and recycling centre near aberdare .
a shortlist of companies selected to bid for the scheme is due to be announced shortly .
earlier this week it was announced that all 22 councils in wales had met targets on the amount of biodegradable waste they can send to landfill sites .
but councils were warned that targets would be getting tougher and they would need to " step up " action .
failure to meet targets result in financial penalties .
the tomorrow 's valley / cwm yfory joint project between merthyr and rct councils would allow both authorities to recycle more food waste and materials left over after recycling .
if sent to landfill sites , this waste can form hazardous landfill gas and leachate , the liquid created by rain water mixing with waste .
more than half of councils have already started or aim to begin offering food waste recycling in the next year .
merthyr and rct are among those that have already started to introduce food waste collections .
aled roberts , welsh local government association spokesperson and chair of waste awareness wales , welcomed the proposal .
" for too long wales has relied on landfill and there is recognition that to deal with our waste in the most sustainable and environmentally-friendly way , investment is needed in a range of facilities , " he said .
the welsh assembly government has already urged councils to introduce more food recycling and offered a package of grants .

it is happening at the boomerang project in stobswell where teenagers are shaking off traditional stereotypes to help elderly people in their area .
the group already takes pensioners to christmas pantomimes , but now with almost £ 90,000 of lottery money they are going to develop a befriending service .
project manager neil ellis explained : " it 's where local folk look after local folk - bring back the community spirit there used to be years ago when neighbours looked out for one another .
" they 'll befriend the elderly and disabled within the area , just do basic things for them .
" also , when folk come out of hospital they 'll get bread and milk for them coming home .
" it 's bringing the generations back together again so that they find out more about each other 's lives . "
lisa ballie , 15 , is one of the young volunteers .
she said : " when we went to perth last year we took them to the shops and then the pantomime .
peter keith believes young and old are learning from each other " i know a lot of people think that young people are just idiots , but with this group it shows that we 're not . "
hayley glen , 16 , added : " a lot of old people feel scared of young people walking along the streets but if we 're taking them out and stuff they 'll get used to us .
" i 'd encourage them -lsb- other teenagers -rsb- to do it because we have a good laugh and it stops you from being out on the streets . "
and 80-year-old peter keith is certain that both age groups are benefitting .
he said : " in the past years its been sort of ' man mind thyself ' - everybody 's been concerned about looking after their own interests .
" it 's not like when i was younger - the people looked after one another .
poverty was rife but whatever the people had they shared with one another .
" so , it 's great to see the youth going in and talking with the elderly , helping them and running errands for them .
" they 're getting as much from the elderly as they 're giving to the elderly , because the elderly pass on what they 've learned in their life .

its leader , the flamboyant muammar gaddafi , once described by late us president ronald reagan as the mad dog of the middle east , will shake hands with condoleezza rice on friday in tripoli .
for washington , it is an incredible turnaround in once the longest hostile relationship with a country , apart from cuba and north korea .
" it 's a historic stop .
this is the first time since 1953 that a us secretary of state has visited libya , " said state department spokesman sean mccormack when he announced the visit .
" in that period of time , we 've had a man land on the moon , had the internet , the berlin wall fall , and we 've had 10 us presidents . "
it is the final step in what has been a long process , which started between 2001 and 2003 , when mr gaddafi made the first u-turn .
he renounced terrorism , accepted libya 's responsibility for the pan am airline bombing over lockerbie in 1988 which killed 270 people , and - crucially - gave up his weapons of mass destruction -lrb- wmds -rrb- .
most of the relatives see no remorse in the libyan leader 's moves , just tactics , but they felt that compensation was a necessary part of libya 's rehabilitation gaddafi : ' mad dog ' no more in 2006 , the us removed libya from its list of state sponsors of terrorism .
some say mr gaddafi feared libya might face the wrath of the us in the wake of the attacks of 11 september 2001 , or perhaps he saw an opportunity .
" i think people in libya saw that the way they were pursuing their national interest was not going to work for them .
it was costing them a very high price for their country , " david welch , assistant secretary of state for near eastern affairs , told the bbc in an interview .
" when they decided they did n't want to have wmds anymore , president bush and prime minister blair acknowledged it in a very public fashion . "
compensation tactics but even with tripoli 's change in behaviour and the lifting of us and un sanctions on the country , a main sticking point remained - compensation for the families of victims of attacks linked to libya .
tripoli paid most of the money for the lockerbie victims -lrb- $ 10m per family -rrb- but held out on the last instalment of $ 2m - in part because it was frustrated it was not getting more economic and political benefits out of washington .

interview with saif al-islam , in which he called the families of the disaster greedy finally , this month , a groundbreaking deal was negotiated by mr welch to set up an international compensation fund and to restore sovereign immunity for libya , ending all pending lawsuits against tripoli in us courts .
the fund will be set up in libya to compensate all american and libyan claimants - this would include relatives of the victims of the us bombing of tripoli and benghazi in 1986 , which came in retaliation for a previous attack in berlin against us citizens .
this is what paved the way for condoleezza rice 's visit , something mr gaddafi has wanted to see happen for some time .
calculation relatives of the victims say they are disappointed that ms rice 's trip was announced before libya had deposited the money into the fund .
in a recent interview with the bbc , the libyan leader 's son , saif al-islam described the families as greedy and seemed to indicate the decision to pay compensation had been a clear and perhaps cold calculation .
" everything was clear in the un security council resolution .
libya should do certain steps in order to get rid of the sanctions .
that 's why we abide by the rules of the game , " said the younger gaddafi .
" the americans and the british said you have to satisfy the families and we will lift the sanctions . "
most of the relatives see no remorse in the libyan leader 's moves , just tactics , but they felt that compensation was a necessary part of libya 's rehabilitation .
" it requires a particular person in each of those countries to make the decision that they want to settle , " said glen johnson , chairman of victims of pan am flight 103 and the father of 21-year-old beth-ann who died on the flight .
" libya i think surprised a lot of people by agreeing to do this and i think anytime you can do that a lot of lives can be saved . "
iran question attorney james kreindler , who represented 120 of the lockerbie families and is also representing families suing iran and sudan for other attacks , believes there are lessons to be learned from the 20 year-long lawsuit .
what we achieved with libya is a road map james kreindler attorney " one of the lessons is that taking a responsible position in resolving legitimate international lawsuits can be an important step in normalising relations between countries that had not enjoyed normal relations , " he said .
" what we achieved with libya is a road map .
everyone wants to see a safer world where countries are not sponsoring terrorism and this could be a piece of that puzzle . "
having neutralised one past bitter enemy , can the us now replicate what it sees as a diplomatic success with other countries , like iran ?
" in tehran they should be sitting in their offices and conducting an assessment of whether their policies are paying off or not , " said mr welch adding that libya , its economy and oil producers would benefit greatly from the full resumption of us-libyan ties , while iran 's economy was " woefully mismanaged " .
" the iranian national leadership has chosen to take a path that will cost the country more each day .
we hope they wake up . "
but mr welch and foreign policy experts are aware that iran is very different from libya .
" libya was relatively easy because the issues were relatively neat and did n't resonate in the same way in the united states .
iran is not in that category , " said jon alterman , middle east director of the center for strategic and international studies -lrb- csis -rrb- .
although it was still actively pursuing wmds up until the moment it changed tack , libya had for a while already stopped supporting militant groups , making it easier for the us to deal with one issue at a time .
" if you look at iran , it 's actively involved in terrorism , it 's undermining any sort of arab-israeli peace deal , it 's helping kill american soldiers in iraq and is actively pursuing a nuclear weapon .
" which one of these issues are you willing to ignore while dealing with one of the other issues , one by one ? "
tricky relationships today libya feels that it has made the right choice .
" we were very wise , now we are a safe country … we are trading now with our ex-enemies , we just have friends , no enemies anymore , no embargo , no sanctions , no threat , " said saif al islam .
but tripoli may be disappointed in its long term relationship with washington .
" libya is still not a strategic consideration for the united states , although reversing its hostile relationship with the united states was the most strategic decision taken by libya , " said mr alterman .
muammar gaddafi , ever the shrewd politician , may already have picked up on that when he said this week that his country did not want to be friends with the us , it just wanted to be left alone .
the iranians may be watching to see how this relationship develops and assess what they could get out of washington if they ever decide to go down the same route .
although , with a much more strategic role in the region , tehran will be driving a tougher bargain and a much longer , more complex process , whenever it really kicks off .
